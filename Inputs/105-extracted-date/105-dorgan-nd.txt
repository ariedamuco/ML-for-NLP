Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the language to which my colleague refers is only included in the statement of managers and does not have a binding effect on HCFA. As a matter of law, nothing in the bill or the report language would prohibit HCFA from moving forward with the final rule.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The statement of managers does not mandate, as a matter of law, any further studies by HCFA on this issue. Nor would HCFA be impeded from moving forward with issuing a final rule regarding the physician supervision issue. In fact, the language clearly states it is not intended to discourage or delay HCFA from moving forward. 
I know this issue is particularly important to some of us because nurse anesthetists are the sole anesthesia providers in 70% of rural hospitals. Finalizing this proposed rule is critical to rural America.

Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Subcommittee Chairman for his commitment to this provision in the bill. The Commerce Secretary has agreed that closing the Williston weather station would amount to a degradation of weather service. It is critical, therefore, that Congress send a strong signal that the station at Williston be kept fully operational.

Mr. DORGAN. Is it correct to say that the fact that specific funds are being provided to the National Weather Service to maintain operations at the offices which were identified in the 1995 Secretary's report signals that the Congress expects these offices to continue and that the NWS ought not to be taking any actions that would suggest that these offices will be closed?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the 105th Congress is limping to a close, and I listened to my colleague from Idaho who, incidentally, I think is a good legislator and does good work in this Chamber. He is someone with whom I am pleased to work on a wide range of issues, including agricultural issues. 
But I must say that I have a different view of the 105th Congress. Abraham Lincoln once said, `Die when I may. Let it be said by those who know me best that I always picked a thistle and planted a flower where I thought a flower would grow.' 
Let me talk for a minute about thistles and flowers. There is apparently a 4,000 page bill lying in state--Lord knows in what room; I guess it's over here in 224. I heard the previous speaker from Minnesota say it was 40 pounds. I expect that is a guess because he probably didn't weigh it. I guess that the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Minnesota, and most other Senators here have not read it. It is a process that results in a lot of concern here in the Congress. There are 4,000 pages on display. 
The whole country is moving toward miniaturization and we are going in exactly the opposite direction. On the final day of the legislative session, we are going to have a 4,000-page bill--a third of the Federal budget--presented in the Senate, and we are told to vote up or down on this. `We assume you have read it, even though we know you just got back into town.' 
Let me talk about a thistle for just a minute. In this piece of legislation is a provision called section 1005 of the Revenues and Medicare part of the Omnibus Bill, which contains the so-called Subpart F Active Financing Provisions. Now, there might be a couple of Americans who are intimately familiar with Subpart F of the Tax Code and its Active Financing Provisions--but not many. These provisions were added at a time when I spent a lot of time on this floor trying to get some money for the construction of Indian schools, for the Ojibwa School that is falling apart. Kids are walking between trailers in the winter with howling winds blowing and are going back and forth to trailers. These are conditions that every study says are unsafe, but you can't get money to improve these conditions; there's not enough money. Or the Cannonball School, where a little girl named Rosie said to me, `Mr. Senator, will you buy us a new school?' There are 150 kids there, and there's only one water fountain and two bathrooms. One of the rooms those kids study music in stinks of sewer gas once or twice a week and they have to vacate the room. Half of the school has been condemned. But there's no money for that little girl and her classmates. We just can't afford it. 
But let me tell you what we could afford. Stuck somewhere in the 4,000 pages, deep in the bowels of that carcass, are lucrative Subpart F Active Financing Provisions. This means $495 million of revenue loss to our Government, and an enormous tax windfall to a select group of large multinational financial service businesses. It says to them, in effect, that we provide an incentive in our Tax Code for them to take their businesses--and the jobs they provide--overseas. This bill not only extends this misguided incentive for one additional year at a cost of $260 million; it also makes matters worse by expanding it by another $235 million, despite strong opposition from the Treasury Department. It is now a $495 million gift to say to the financial services industry of this country: Move overseas, hire foreign workers, take your business and jobs elsewhere and we will give you a large tax cut for doing it. What a terrible thing to do, at a time when we don't have money to do the important things here. We are told, gee, there is plenty of money for somebody to slip somewhere in the middle of those 4,000 pages for a special little deal for some very big taxpayers who want to do business elsewhere and get paid for it. Bob Wills of the Texas Playboys talked about this in the 1930s: `The little bee sucks the blossom and the big bee gets the honey; the little guy picks the cotton and the big guy gets the money.' 
Why is it that every time you turn around here and reach into 4,000 pages, you find something like this? This is just one example. You talk about absurdity at a time when we're told that our priorities aren't affordable. You can't invest in the Cannonball or Ojibwa School; there's not enough money. But there is plenty of money for the big shots. 
Let me talk for just a minute about how we got to this point. The Senator from Idaho talked about it at some length. While I disagree with some of his conclusions, I think most people would view this process--coming to the end stage of this Congress with 4,000 pages to be voted on in one vote, with a third of the Federal budget appropriated in one large piece of legislation--as a terrible legislative practice. Does anybody think that makes sense? Instead of passing the bills as they should be passed by Congress, where they can be debated and amended, you put them all in a big package at the end so that you just have one vote. It is just a lot more convenient. That way you don't have to amend and debate all these things. 
Does anybody think that is a good idea? I don't. I think it is a terrible idea. How did this start? On April 15, the law requires that Congress pass a budget. That is what the law requires. It says Congress must pass a budget. This Congress said, no, we have decided not to pass a budget. We have a bunch of folks that are feuding, so we will decide not to pass a budget at all. Then they decided that because we can't agree on a budget, we just won't pass all of our appropriations bills. So they stagger to the end of the 105th Congress, having no budget, few completed appropriations bills, and they create this 4,000-page mountain. Then you have a bunch of folks who say: If there is going to be a pile here, let me stick something in the pile. So the pile grows. 
And here we are. I don't happen to think that this is just one party's fault. I agree with the Senator from Idaho on that point, although I reject his implication that somehow the Democratic Members were hindering the business of the Senate and therefore, cloture motions had to be filed. That is not true at all. 
In fact, I can tell you example after example after example when a bill is brought to the floor, and before there is any debate--and certainly before there are any amendments--cloture motions are filed at the desk to say, `No, we haven't had any amendments yet, but we want to foreclose amendments; we want to shut off debate.' 
What kind of practice is that? That doesn't make any sense. That is impeding work of the Senate. That is saying we want to have a legislative body in which there is supposed to be debate, and we want to cut off debate. We don't want debate. We don't want you to offer your amendments. We think our legislation is so good that no one can improve it, and, by the way, you have no right to offer amendments. That is what these cloture motions are about. 
With respect to the question of where we are and the balanced budget that was mentioned by one of the previous speakers, there is no question that both parties contributed to a better fiscal policy. But it started in 1993 with a piece of legislation proposed by this President that was unpopular. I voted for it. The easiest thing would have been to vote no. It passed by one vote here in the Senate and one vote in the House and became law. It began the long trail towards stable fiscal policy and getting rid of the Federal budget deficit. 
When we cast that vote, the expectation that year was a $290 billion Federal budget deficit; completely out of balance. We were told by some on the other side of the aisle, if you do this, you are going to wreck this country's economy; if you do this, you are going to throw this country into a recession; if you do this, you will kill jobs. You will throw this country into a depression, we were told. Well, we did it, because the American people understood the fiscal policy we were on. They understood that the road we were traveling was destructive to this country's interest. They wanted us to make the tough choices. And we did. 
Guess what? We have wrestled that budget deficit to the ground. We now have a budget that is very close to being in balance. We now have an economy that is growing. Inflation is almost gone. Home ownership is the highest in 30 years. Unemployment is down, down--way down. Things are better in this country. 
Starting in 1993, when the American people saw that Congress was willing to make tough choices, we did it alone. There was not one vote from the other side of the aisle. But I will say this: The Republican Party has helped after that 1993 vote. They also provided some assistance with a fiscal policy that is better for this country, and we ought to have more of that. We ought to have more bipartisanship and more cooperation to do the right things for this country's future. 
The difference is, it seems to me, that a product of debate ought not be about aggregate fiscal policy, but rather about priorities. What represents the priorities for our country's future? What should we do that is important? 
Again, I think where I would disagree with some previous speakers is that doing nothing ought not be a badge of honor when the agenda of this country cries out to do something to address critical needs. We should have done something on managed care reform. We should have said to HMOs in this country, you must tell patients all of their medical options for treatment--not just the cheapest. You must do that. You must provide reimbursement for emergency care when someone shows up at an emergency room. 
I told the story--there are stories that go on forever--of a woman who broke her neck, comes to an emergency room unconscious, and is told later, `We will not reimburse you for the emergency room stay because you didn't have prior approval.' 
Those are the kinds of things that have been going on in managed care in the name of saving money, but actually degrade and diminish health care standards. This Congress certainly should have addressed this issue. Doing nothing is not a badge of honor on this issue of managed care reform. 
Certainly, it is not a badge of honor that we weren't able to pass FAA reform. We should have done that. That piece of legislation included an amendment of mine that would have substantially changed the way the major airlines have to connect with regional jet carriers. And we would have more regional jet carriers in this country, more competition and lower prices for airfares had we passed that piece of legislation. I regret that it was not done. 
Let me also mention the issue of family farmers and the farm crisis in our part of the country. I know there is a difference of philosophy about this. But there ought not be. 
If this country wants family farmers in its future, it ought to decide that when prices collapse it is going to have to help build a bridge across those price valleys, because, if not, the family farmers won't get across the valley. They will just wash out and be gone. And we will have corporate farmers farming America from the west coast to the east coast, and we will still have crops growing. There will just be no people living out on the land. And this country will have lost something important. 
We did something at the end of this session. We reached some bipartisan agreement on an emergency package. But it wasn't enough. It was nearly $2 billion short of what the President requested, nearly $3 billion short of what the commissioners of agriculture and the Farm Belt said was necessary to address this farm crisis. We will be right back in this set of circumstances in January, February and March as farmers begin to consider spring planting. 
With respect to the agriculture package, we did get nearly $1 3/4 billion more because we fought and because we did accept the admonition of some to take what they are willing to give you and quit. There was $100 million more for the family farmers of my State. Is that important? Yes. Some will survive. Some who would not have survived without it will survive to be able to continue farming in the future. 
I have mentioned a couple of times the letter from a young boy named Wyatt in North Dakota, a sophomore in high school, the son of a family farmer who wrote to me, and said, `Mr. Senator, my dad can feed 180 people, and he can't feed his family.' This young boy wanted to know what kind of a system allows that to happen. This country needs to do better by family farmers. 
I was impressed that we could work together on a bipartisan basis toward the end of this session. I hope we can do the same at the start of the next session to address many of these issues. 
Let me complete my comments. 
There are so many issues in this omnibus appropriations bill. One of them is an issue that I have worked on with the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and Senator Byrd, that will create a trade deficit review commission. The reason I mention this is because today the new trade deficit numbers were released for this month. It shows a $2 billion increase, the largest trade deficit in the history of this country, the largest trade deficit in the history of human kind. We have wrestled the fiscal policy budget deficit to the ground, and our trade deficit is swelling and growing, and we need to do something about it. This omnibus package will include a requirement that a trade deficit review commission be established, and that recommendations will be made to Congress on how to deal with those issues. I hope the Congress will be able to take some steps early in the next session of Congress to respond to that issue. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I hope we will never again be confronted with this circumstance at the end of a Congress. I understand that at the end of Congress there is wrap-up. Sometimes a bill or two doesn't get passed. Sometimes you wrap one or two bills into a package. But this is not a good way to legislate. 
It is, in my judgment, subverting the legislative process--the regular order of bringing bills to the floor so we have open debate and amendments, when at the end all of these things are put into one large package, and we are told to just read it, think about it, and then vote on it. 
I don't think that is the best that this Congress can offer the American people. I hope this will be the last chapter of this kind of congressional action, or lack of it. 
Mr. President, finally, the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee is on the floor. I thank him for his work. 
I have not been complimentary of the process, but I know Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd and their staffs, and many others, have spent an enormous amount of time trying to put this package together simply because the Congress did not get its work done during the year. I compliment them for their work to try to do that. I know, especially from a staff standpoint, what kind of effort and time was required to get this to this point. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help bring much-needed regional jet service to underserved communities. This legislation is designed to help restore air service to underserved communities and to stimulate airline competition by offering an investment tax credit to new entrant carriers to provide regional jet service to underserved markets. My bill also significantly reduces the current airline ticket tax on passengers flying in and out of rural America. Together, these tax incentives will encourage new entrants to enter thinner rural markets. 
This legislation has two objectives: (A) incentivize the purchase and deployment of regional jets for under-served markets; and (B) stimulate competition in rural areas by providing financial incentives for new entrants to serve underserved markets with regional jets. Using tax credits is a fair and effective means to accomplish these goals. 
Most small communities have not benefitted from airline deregulation. In fact, airline deregulation has been a steady decline for much of rural America. Since 1978, when the Congress deregulated the airline industry, more than 30 small communities have had jet service replaced with turbo prop service; out of the 320 small communities served by a major airline in 1978 declined from 213 to 33 by 1995; and the number of small communities receiving service to only one major hub airport nearly doubled, increasing from 79 in 1978 to 174 in 1995. 
Countless studies from the General Accounting Office and the U.S. Department of Transportation have documented that as the airline industry grows more and more concentrated under deregulation, small rural communities are being left behind with less service and higher fares. Several GAO studies have pointed to the correlation between industry concentration and higher air fares and that small rural communities are being hit especially hard as a result of the chilling of competition in the industry. In 1990, the GAO identified several market barriers thwarting the emergence of competition. In 1996, the GAO found that not only do the same problems continue to exist, but have gotten worse. 
In the present deregulated environment, small rural communities see very little to give them hope that air service will improve. The advent of regional jets holds some promise, but most RJs are presently being purchased by the major carriers who are using them to serve high density markets. Thus, if air service to rural America is going to be revitalized, we must find a way to incentivize the deployment of regional jets in underserved markets. 
Last August, Northwest Airlines had a pilot strike and therefore a shutdown of their airline service. That might not have meant much to some. In some airports, Northwest was one of a number of carriers that was serving certain airports and serving passengers. But in North Dakota, the State which I represent, Northwest Airlines was the only airline providing jet service to my State. That is a very different picture than the last time we had an airline strike, which was over 25 years ago. 
Nearly a quarter of a century ago when Northwest had another strike and a shutdown prior to deregulation of the airlines, we had five different airline companies flying jets into the State of North Dakota. At roughly the same time, we had folks in Congress saying: `What we really need to do is foster competition. We need to deregulate the airline industry.' Thus, Congress deregulated the airline industry about 20 years ago. I wasn't here at the time, but the results for North Dakota was that we went from five jet carriers to one and we pay some of the highest fares of anywhere in the country. 
All those folks who swallowed the goal to deregulation in order to stimulate competition are now choking on the word `competition.' Today, stimulating competition is likened to re-regulation. What a twist. But, the fact is that competition is more the exception than the rule. 
If you live in Chicago and you are flying to New York or Los Angeles, God bless you, because you are going to have a lot of carriers to choose from and you are going to find very inexpensive ticket prices. You have a choice of carriers and ticket prices that are very attractive to you. You live in a city with millions and millions of people and you want to fly to another city with millions and millions of people. This is not an awfully bad deal for you; more choices and low fares. But if you get beyond those cities and ask how has this airline deregulation affected other Americans, what you will find is less selection, fewer choices, and higher prices. 
North Dakota is just one example, and the recent shutdown of our state's only jet carrier highlighted the problem. When the strike was called and the airline shut down, just like that, an entire State lost all of its jet service. 
A complete shutdown of all jet service chokes the economy very quickly. People can't move in and out. Now, I happen to think Northwest is a good carrier. I believe the same about all the major carriers. Most of them are well-run, good companies. 
What I do not admire is what they have done by retreating into regional monopolies--dominating the access points of our Nation's air transportation system. The major carriers have retreated into fortress hubs where one airline controls 60 or 70 or 80 percent of all the traffic at a major hub airport. With that level of market dominance, does anyone believe that another carrier is going to be able to come in and take them on? Competition is not flourishing. It's dying. This is not a free market--new entrants cannot access these dominated hubs and the result is that we now have regional monopolies without any regulation. 
What sense does that make, to have monopolies without regulation? The minute I say `regulation,' we have people here having apoplectic seizures on the floor of the Senate. Oh, Lord, we cannot talk about `regulation!' I am not standing here today talking about regulation and I am not suggesting to re-regulate the airlines. All I want to do is see if we can provide some sort of industrial-strength vitamin B-12 shot right in the rump of those airlines to see if we cannot get them competing again. How do we do that? We do it by creating the conditions that require competition. This legislation is one attempt to do just that. 
In order to encourage new startup regional jet service, I am proposing a 10 percent investment tax credit for regional jet purchases. That is, those startup companies that want to begin regional jet service to fly these new regional jets between certain cities and hubs that are not now served with regional jet service, we would say to them that we will help with a 10 percent investment tax credit on the purchase or lease of those regional jets. We will help because we want to provide incentives for the establishment of regional jet service once again in our country. 
Under this legislation, qualifying carriers would be eligible for an investment tax credit--up to ten percent of the purchase or lease price--of regional jet aircraft that are used primarily to serve under-served markets. To receive the investment tax credit, an air carrier must have less than $10 billion annual revenue passenger miles and the aircraft for which the tax credit applies must be used primarily (over 50% of its flight segments) to serve underserved markets for 5 years. An under-served market is defined as a community served by an airport with fewer than 60,000 annual emplanements. 
The investment tax credit would be offset by closing a corporate tax loophole regarding the deductible liquidating distributions or regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. The remaining revenue available from the offset would be used to reduce the airline ticket tax for the domestic segment serving a rural airport. 
Under current law, an 8 percent ad velorem tax is imposed on all domestic flights, plus a $2 flight segment tax. Beginning in fiscal year 1999, the ad velorem tax is reduced to 7.5 percent and the flight segment tax is increased to $2.25. In subsequent years, the ad velorem tax remains at 7.5 percent while the flight segment tax increases $0.25 per year through 2003 at which point is capped at $3.00 per flight segment. Current law provides that the flight segment tax is not imposed on domestic flights to and from rural airports, which are defined as an airport with fewer than 100,000 passenger departures and is not located within 75 miles of another airport (that has fewer than 100,000 passenger departures) or is receiving EAS subsidies. Under this legislation, the 7.5 percent ad velorem tax on domestic flights to rural airports would be reduced in proportion to the amount remaining from the revenue offset after the regional jet aircraft investment tax credit has been provided. 
It is targeted, it makes good sense, and it will stimulate investment in an activity that this country that very much needs more competition. The so-called free market is clogged--a kind of an airline cholesterol here that clogs up the arteries, and they say, `This is the way we work, these are our hubs, these are out spokes, and you cannot mess with them.' 
My legislation simply says we would like to assist areas that no longer have jet service but could support it. We would like to encourage companies that decide they want to come in and serve there to be able to purchase the regional jets and be able to initiate that kind of service. 
My legislation has a second provision which reduces the airline ticket tax for certain qualified flights in rural America. This proposal also has a revenue offset so it would not be a net loser for the Federal budget. 
We are not in a situation in rural areas of this country where we can just sit back and say what is going to happen to us is going to happen to us and there is nothing we can do about it. There are some, I suppose, who sit around and wring their hands and gnash their teeth and fret and sweat and say, `I really cannot alter things very much, this is the way it is.' 
The way it is not satisfactory to the people of my State. It is not satisfactory to have only one jet carrier serving our entire State. Our State's transportation services and airline service, especially jet airline service, is an essential transportation service. It ought not be held hostage by labor problems or other problems of one jet carrier. We must have competition. If all of those in this Chamber who mean what they say when they talk about competition will weigh in here and say, `Let's stand for competition, let's stand for the free market, let's try to help new starts, let's breed opportunities for broader based economic ownership and more competition in the airline industry,' then I think we will have done something important and useful and good for States like mine and for many other rural States in this country.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator from Texas. He is always interesting in his presentations. During my presentation, I will take issue with a number of the comments he has made. 
At the start, I want to indicate it is not, in my judgment, the case that this issue of education has just recently been raised in recent days. The last few days, certainly, have included a lot of references to education by the President and by others, but going back to January and February of this year, the President and Members of Congress on this side of the aisle were pushing very hard for education changes that we think would strengthen the school systems and strengthen opportunity for education for all children in this country. 
I want to speak more generally, first, and then I will address a couple of those issues. I am enormously disappointed that we come to the middle of October in this session of Congress, the 105th Congress, and find that at the end of this long, arduous Congress, we have half a dozen, maybe a dozen people somewhere in a room--Lord only knows where the room is--negotiating a third to half of the Federal budget in appropriations bills that the Congress didn't get completed. 
First of all, in this year, the Congress passed no budget. It is the first time, as I understand it, since 1974--no budget. The requirement is that the Congress shall pass a budget by April 15. This Congress didn't pass a budget. This Congress, by its inaction, said, no, we don't think there ought to be a budget. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, because the Congress didn't even bother to pass a budget, it didn't pass a good number of its appropriations bills. So we came to the end of the fiscal year, months after when the appropriations bills should have been completed, many months after the budget should have been passed, and the Congress had to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government operating. Then we have this closed-door bunch of folks in a room making deals on how to resolve these final issues. 
During this Congress, at a time when no budget was enacted and a good many appropriations bills were not completed, the Congress said no to campaign finance reform, not once, not twice, a good number of times. No, we don't want to do campaign finance reform. They said, no, we don't want to do HMO or a Patients' Bill of Rights reforming the managed care system and providing certain rights to patients in this country. They said no to tobacco reform, don't want to do that; no to the education proposals offered in the President's budget calling for reduction in class size. 
Incidentally, I take issue with the charts used moments ago, and I guess most parents who have kids in school will take issue with that chart, suggesting somehow that classroom sizes are decreasing rather than increasing. I think most parents understand that is not the case in their schools. It is not unusual for kids to be going to school with 22, 24, 28, 30 children in their class. The question is, Does that make a difference? Does it make a difference for a teacher when there are 15 in the class versus 30 in the class? Does it make a difference in terms of the personal attention a teacher can devote to children with 30 kids in a class versus 15 to 18? The answer is, of course. 
This Congress, in passing no budget and missing most of its appropriations bill, said no to campaign finance reform, no to tobacco, no to Patients' Bill of Rights, no to the education proposal offered by the President on school construction and reduction in class size. 
In the old western movies you will recall the folks that rode themselves into a box canyon, took their hat off and scratched their heads wondering why they were being attacked on all sides. Because they road into a boxed canyon is why they are under attack. That is exactly what happened in this Congress. 
Is it surprising that a Congress that doesn't pass a budget and doesn't finish its appropriations bills finds itself today, on Monday, October 12, in a situation where we are scrambling, trying to figure out who is doing what with whom, to determine what kind of spending we have in dozens and dozens and dozens of areas? Does it surprise anybody we have this kind of a mess at the end of this session? I don't think so. 
The previous speaker just spoke of a robbery. He used the term `robbery' to describe the amount of money that some are proposing to be offered to deal with certain education issues. I personally think it is a significant and exciting and 
wonderful investment in the young children of our country to invest in education. That is not a robbery. That is a remarkably effective investment for this country. 
Investment in health care is not a robbery. That is a remarkable investment for the people of this country. 
How about for family farmers? Part of this debate is what we do for family farmers in the middle of a farm crisis. No one should think that would be a robbery, to take some funds during the middle of a farm crisis and say to family farmers when prices collapse and you are down and out, we want to give you a helping hand to help you up and help get you through this tough time. That is the issue here. The issue is what are our priorities? 
Let me give an example of a robbery. Yes, there are robberies taking place. I understand there is a tax extender bill that some in Congress are trying to slip in, another $500 million little tax incentive for some of the biggest economic interests to move their jobs overseas, make it a little sweeter deal. We have a perverse incentive in our Tax Code to say if you want to move American jobs overseas, we will pay you for it, we will give you a tax break. Just take those good old American jobs, shut your plants, move them overseas, and we will give you a tax break. Talk about perversity. We have people working to try to juice that up, increase the tax break. That is a robbery. It robs America of jobs it needs, it robs us of the revenue we ought to have to invest in kids and invest in health care. 
The point is, priorities. What are our priorities? What do we think is important? At the start of this century, if you lived in America you were expected to live an average of 48 years of age. Almost 100 years have elapsed and now if you live in this country you are expected, perhaps, to live to be 78. Forty-eight to 78--30 years added to the lifespan of the average American. Is that success? Yes, I think so. You could solve all the Social Security problems and all the Medicare problems, all the financing of those issues could be solved if you simply take the life expectancy back to the 1940s or the 1920s or the 1900s. However, for a range of reasons, life expectancy has increased dramatically in our country in one century. 
We have invested an enormous amount in health care research, National Institutes of Health. I am one, and some of my colleagues have joined me, who wants to increase the investment in health research. We know 50 years ago if someone had a bad heart, bad knee, bad hip or cataracts, they wouldn't be able to see, they wouldn't be able to walk, and they would probably die after a heart attack. Now they have knee surgery, get a new hip, get their heart muscle and arteries unplugged, have cataract surgery, and they come to a meeting in that small town and feel like a million dollars. All of that is possible because of research, an expenditure in health care in this country. It is remarkable. It has been remarkably effective. The same is true with education. 
My colleague from Illinois is going to follow me on the floor. He will remember--and I have told my colleagues this on previous occasions--he will remember Claude Pepper, who served with us in the U.S. House. The first time I went to Claude Pepper's office, I saw two pictures behind his chair. One was Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight; it was autographed to Claude Pepper. Orville autographed the picture before he died. And then a photograph of Neil Armstrong standing on the moon, and that photograph was autographed to Congressman Pepper. 
I thought, what is the interval between leaving the ground to fly, and flying to the moon? What is that interval? It is the most remarkable investment in human potential and in education compared to anywhere else on Earth. All of the kids that went to our school, that became the best scientists, the best engineers, the best at whatever they could be the best at, and we discovered we could develop the technology, through research, to learn how to fly, learn how to fly all the way to the moon. And standing on everyone's shoulders with accomplishment after accomplishment, we have now understood that virtually anything is possible. That comes from massive investment in education. That is what the interval in the two pictures told me--that investing in America's children in education has paid dividends far beyond our wildest imagination. 
That is why I come here today. 
Let me make one additional point with respect to family farmers. I have talked about investment in health care and education. Investment in America's family farmers is also one of the best investments our country has ever made. We have the best food in the world for the lowest percent of disposable income anywhere on the Earth. Who produces that food? A lot of families living out there in the country, by themselves, taking risks that almost no one else takes--the risk that they might lose everything they have, this spring, this summer, this fall if a seed doesn't grow, or if a seed grows and is destroyed by nature, or if it grows and is not destroyed and they harvest it and take it to the elevator and it is worth nothing. These family farmers just inherit, by the nature of what they do, the most significant risk you can imagine. 
That is why this country, for 60 or 70 years, has said we want to try to help farmers when we have these price depressions, we want to build a bridge to help them over the price valleys. That is what this fight has been about in recent days here in Congress. That is what the President's veto is about--about trying to get this country to say, during a time of severe crisis in family farming, during a time of abject price collapse, where the price of wheat has gone down 60 percent in 2 years--our farmers in North Dakota have lost 98 percent of their income in 1 year alone. Ask yourself, in any city, on any block, any occupation, what would happen to you if you lost 98 percent of your income? Would you be in a severe crisis? Despite that, what do we do about that? Can we extend a helping hand? Can we say, during these tough times, that we want to help you over this valley because we want you in our future? 
Family farmers matter to this country. If we lose family farmers, we will have lost something about ourselves that is very important--broad-based economic ownership, with families living on the land and producing America's foodstuffs. That is what the fight is about. I am not saying one side is all right and the other side is all wrong. But I am saying to those who say that farmers aren't worth it at this point, just let them float in some mythical free market, that we just don't have the money, or those who perhaps would say if you use the money to save family farmers, it is `robbery'--I don't understand that. 
This, after all, is about priorities. What are our priorities? What is important to us? A hundred years from now, everybody in this room will likely be dead. The only way anybody might determine about our value system as a people is to look at how we chose to spend our resources. What did we think was important? Education? Family farmers? Did we think it was important to deal with health care? What were our priorities? 
President Clinton, at the start of this year, asked for the education priorities dealing with school construction and class size. He asked, at the start of this year, to deal with health care issues--Medicare, managed care, and the Patients' Bill of Rights. He asked, at the start of this year, for a tobacco reform bill. He asked, at the start of this year, for campaign finance reform. 
Sadly, we now come to the 12th hour and we have a bunch of folks sitting in a room somewhere trying to negotiate probably a third of the Federal budget, or a third of the Federal spending, by themselves. I just think that is a terrible way for Congress to conduct its affairs. My hope is that when all of these fights are done and the dust has settled, we will have achieved a result that says the priorities for us at this point are to try to save family farmers during a time of crisis, the priorities for us are to invest in our kids and our schools, and the priorities for us are to decide that, in the future, we ought to do our work in Congress the way the law describes. Let's pass a budget, pass some bills, do the regular order, and not end up another session the way this session appears to be ending. 
Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Illinois is waiting to speak. Let me also say, as I conclude, that the Senator from Illinois has been very active on the issue of tobacco legislation, as well as education issues. I think he has been a remarkably effective addition to the U.S. Senate. It has been my pleasure to serve with him in the 105th Congress. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I did want to say, having listened to the Senator from Kentucky, my expectation is that virtually every Member of this Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, shares my feelings about the Senator from Kentucky. 
He is tough, he is honest, he gets things done in the Senate, and we are going to miss him a great deal. 
I know the Senator from Montana feels that way, as does the Senator from Texas. Some of our other colleagues are not here. But one of the privileges of serving in this body is serving with some of the best men and women I have ever had the opportunity to work with in my life, and I count among that group the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford. 
I would like to say, as he leaves the Senate, I thank him for his public service to our country. He, because he served in this body, has contributed to the well-being of America. We are going to miss him a great deal. I expect he will not be going far. I know he is going fishing, and I know he is going to be involved in public service in his own way, dealing with educating young people about civic responsibilities and about government. I just want to say he has contributed a substantial amount of service to his country and we are deeply indebted to him for it.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the comments made by the majority leader earlier this morning on the subject of education. 
I have great respect for our Senate majority leader. He and I agree on some things and disagree on others, but I always have great respect for his opinion. But on the issue of schools and what kind of, if any, involvement the Federal Government shall have on this issue, I think we have a very substantial disagreement. 
State and local governments, especially local school boards, will always run our school system, and that is how it should be. I don't suggest, and would never suggest, that we change that. 
However, there are some things that we can and should aspire to as a nation in dealing with education. One is to improve and invest in the infrastructure of our schools. I have spoken on the floor a good number of times about the condition of some of the schools in this country. I won't go into that at great length, but let me just describe a couple of them. 
At the Cannon Ball Elementary School in Cannon Ball, ND, most of the children going to that school are Indian children. There are about 150 students who must share only two bathrooms and one water fountain. Part of the school has been condemned. Some of those students spend time in a room down in the older part of the school that can only be used during certain days of the week because the stench of leaking sewer gas frequently fills that room with noxious fumes that requires it to be evacuated. 
They can't connect that school to the Internet because the wiring in that 90-year-old facility will not support technology. The young children who go through those schoolroom doors are not getting the best of what this country has to offer. And that school district simply does not have the funds on its own to repair that school or build a new one. 
I challenge anyone in this Congress to go into that school building and say no to young Rosie in third grade who asked me, `Mr. Senator, can you buy us a new school?' I would challenge anyone to go into that school, and decide whether that is the kind of school you want your children to go to. Can you say that your children are entering a classroom that you are proud of? I don't think so. 
That school district doesn't have the capacity to repair that school on its own. It has a very small tax base that will not support a bonding initiative for building a new school. There are schools like that--the Cannon Ball Elementary School, or the Ojibwa Indian School on the Turtle Mountain Reservation--all over this country, and we ought to do something about it. We can do something about it we enacted a number of proposals on school construction. That ought to be a priority for this Senate. So, too, ought this Senate have as its priority trying to help State and local governments and school districts reduce class size. It makes a difference. 
I have two children in public schools, in grade school. One goes to school in a trailer, a portable classroom. The other is in a class with 28 or 29 students. And it has almost always been that way. Would it be better if they were in schools with class sizes of 15, 16 or 18 students? Of course, it would. Does a teacher have more time to devote to each student with smaller classrooms? Of course. Of course. Can we do something about that? Only if this U.S. Senate determines that education is a priority. Only if we decide to do something about it. I am not suggesting that we decide that we ought to run the local school systems; that is not the case at all. But we should decide that we as a nation have the capability and the will to modernize and help construct the kind of schools that all of us would be proud to send our children to.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we reach the conclusion of this 105th Congress, I note that there are a good many issues yet to be discussed and resolved. I wanted to come to the floor to talk about one issue that is very important, the issue of home health care. It is vitally important that Congress take action on this issue before adjourning. 
I am very familiar with home health care. This is not theory to me. It is not an issue that I just read about and only understand from books and manuals and rules and regulations. 
One snowing Wednesday evening in January a number of years ago, my mother was killed in a tragic manslaughter incident in North Dakota. She had gone to the hospital to visit a friend and on her drive home, four blocks from home, a drunk driver going 80 to 100 miles an hour and being chased by the police hit her and killed her instantly. 
During this same period, my father was having significant health problems, and as so often is the case, my mother was providing the bulk of his care at home in Bismarck, ND. I will perhaps never forget the moment of having to wake my father up and tell him that my mother had lost her life. 
In addition to the shock of losing our mother, my family understood that we were also going to have to struggle to make sure my father got the care he needed. In the days ahead, we began talking about what we could do to help my father in his fragile state of health. One of the things we discovered was that there is in this country a system of home health care. Through this system, skilled health care providers will come into the home on a routine basis to help to meet the health care needs of those who desperately need it. 
My family used the home health care system and the services of wonderful nurses and others who worked in home health to care for my father. It allowed us to keep my father out of a nursing home and in the home that he had lived in for so many years with my mother. 
Was that important? Yes. It was very important and made life much, much better for him. And it occurred because we have a home health care system that could provide the routine health care needed to allow my father to continue to live at home. My father is gone now, but I still remember how important that home health care was and still is to millions of families all across this country. 
Home health care is a wonderful Medicare benefit because it allows older Americans to remain at home and to be independent where they are most comfortable, rather than having to go into more costly hospitals or nursing homes. 
But at this time, we have in our country a very serious financing problem with home health care that is jeopardizing this Medicare benefit. Before we end this session of the Congress, we need to do something to address it. I would like to describe just for a moment what that problem is. 
Congress, last year, passed the Balanced Budget Act, something I supported. This legislation made a lot of changes to Medicare and to the home health care program. Some of those changes were warranted because the home health care program had mushroomed, and we had to constrain the rate of growth of home health care spending, which had more than tripled in the early 1990s. 
But Congress went too far and, in my judgment, made a mistake in the way it implemented what is called the interim payment system, which is now having a devastating impact on home health care agencies and Medicare beneficiaries. The current interim payment system penalizes the very home health care agencies that have operated most efficiently in the past, and it locks in the payment inequities that currently exist. The result is that 1,100 home health agencies nationwide have closed their doors. 
Unfortunately, the very Medicare beneficiaries who are being harmed the most by this interim payment system that is so unfair are those Americans who need home health care the most. That is because, under this interim payment system, more than 80 percent of home health agencies will be paid a capped amount called the `per-beneficiary limit.' 
In my home State, the average per-beneficiary limit is $2,247, not nearly enough to cover the cost of care needed by the sickest and the most frail of Medicare beneficiaries. 
The home health care folks have a Hobson's choice. They can close their doors, or they can start a kind of cherry-picking with respect to those who need home health care service. In other words, they can choose to serve only the less ill or less sick Medicare beneficiaries whom they know will not exceed the per-beneficiary cap. 
I am told cherry-picking is not yet occurring in my home State. But I am afraid it is only a matter of time before home health agencies have no choice and begin to do that. 
I don't believe it was Congress' intention to cause efficient home health agencies to close or to stop caring for sicker patients, and I think it is imperative that this Congress solve this problem. 
In the negotiations on the budget, I hope very much that will happen. If we wait until next year, it is going to be too late. Hundreds of agencies will probably not be there and a good many of the sickest and the most frail health care beneficiaries who need home health care will not get it. 
I have cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Collins and others, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act, that would make the home health payment system more fair to the historically efficient providers, and reduce the incentive for dropping sick patients. 
Let me emphasize again that the purpose is to make the home health care system more fair to the historically efficient home health care providers. 
There have been dozens of bills introduced to solve the problem, and to date more than two-thirds of the Senate from both political parties have cosponsored one or more of these bills, or have gone on record in support of efforts to address the problem. 
With nearly 70 Senators cosponsoring or supporting legislation of this type, I think we ought to, before Monday evening or whenever we adjourn, fix this home health care payment system. 
I know my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee have been working to develop legislation that will at least deal with the most pressing problems in this interim payment system and to tide the home health agencies over until permanent changes can be implemented. 
One of the challenges they face is to do this in a fiscally responsible way that will not harm other areas of Medicare. 
It is also important, I think, not to be asking older Americans, especially those who have reached the age of declining income, to shoulder the cost for this change through a new copayment on home health services. 
I know that the Congress can meet this challenge if it decides this is a priority between now and perhaps Monday evening. Congress must, in my judgment, begin to select the right priorities. 
We seem to be at loggerheads here in negotiations between the House and the Senate, the Congress and the President, Democrats and Republicans. Between now and when we complete the final omnibus spending bill, we must make choices about what our priorities are, what is more important, and what is less important. 
I ask that we decide that dealing with the home health care payment system is more important. That it be one of the priorities. 
This is something we can do. It is not something that is terribly difficult. It is simply a choice that we will make--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, all of us deciding together how we spend limited resources on nearly unlimited wants in this country. 
Mr. President, I know others wish to speak, and I would say to the majority leader that this will be an interesting couple of days. He, I am sure, will have a significant challenge working with all of us to try to figure out what the priorities will be in the closing hours of this session. It is my fervent hope that one of those priorities will be to address the interim payment system in home health care. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, S. 391, the Mississippi Sioux Judgment Fund Distribution Act is a bill intended to resolve a longstanding problem with respect to a judgment fund distribution to Sisseton and Wahpeton tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. The bill would distribute an additional 7.1 percent of the funds, plus accrued interest, awarded by the Indian Claims Commission in 1967 to the Sisseton and Wahpeton Mississippi Sioux Tribes. This legislation is cosponsored by Senators Baucus, Burns, Conrad, Daschle, and Johnson. 
In 1972, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Secretary of the Interior to distribute 75 percent of the $5.9 million judgment award to the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota (now known as the Spirit Lake Tribe), the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota, and the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Council of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. The remaining 25 percent was to be distributed to individuals who could trace their lineal ancestry to a member of the aboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton Mississippi Sioux, the predecessor to the three modern-day tribal entities. The judgment was compensation for the 27 million acres of land taken from this aboriginal tribe in the 19th century. 
Congress made the decision to allocate 25 percent of the original judgment to the lineal descendants at the urging of the Department of the Interior. The Department, in 1972, felt that historical events warranted a departure from precedent which was to make awards to tribes and not to individuals. In fact, the 1967 Indian Claims Commission judgment awarded compensation only to the successor tribes to the aboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton Mississippi Sioux tribe, not to individual lineal descendants. 
The three Sisseton and Wahpeton tribes received their respective shares of the judgment award by the mid-1970's. To date, though, the funds allocated for the lineal descendants have not been distributed. This has resulted in a situation where the accrued interest on the original principle of approximately $1.5 million has now grown to more than $15 million. 
If the 1,988 lineal descendants identified to date by the Department of the Interior receive the $15 million in per capita payments, they would receive more than 18 times what the 11,829 enrolled members received in the 1970's. Moreover, since these identified lineal descendants comprise only 14 percent of the total number of tribal and non-tribal member descendants, the 25 percent allocated for lineal descendants in the 1972 act would permit each lineal descendant to receive almost twice as much as did the enrolled tribal members who were compensated in the 1970's, not counting interest. 
In 1987, the three Sisseton and Wahpeton tribes filed suit in federal court to challenge the constitutionality of the lineal descendancy provisions of the 1972 Act. When this legislation failed, in 1997 the tribes filed a new suit in federal court challenging these provision on constitutional grounds. This second suit is currently on appeal. In 1992, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Attorney-General to settle these cases on any terms agreed to by the parties involved. However, the Department of Justice has refused to proceed with any settlement negotiations and has taken the position that the 1992 law did not authorize the Department to settle these cases on any terms other than those laid out in the original 1972 act. While I believe that this interpretation flies in the face of congressional intent, the Department has been unwilling to pursue the issue.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the areas that have been most recently discussed with respect to this legislation are arcane, complicated areas dealing with nexus, jurisdiction of tax and so on. There are not a lot of people who understand the nuances of all of those words and all of the provisions. That is why it was hard to sift through all of this and reach an agreement. But an agreement has been reached that I think is a good agreement, one that accomplishes the purpose of this legislation in a manner that is not injurious to any other interests. 
I thank the Senator from Arizona--I would say for his patience, but he is a Senator who is impatient to get things done on the Senate floor. I understand that and accept that, as do others. That is the reason he brings a lot of legislation to the floor and is successful with it. 
I thank the Senator from Oregon who has been at this task for a long, long time and has been very determined to help get this legislation through the Senate. 
Let me say to the Senator from Florida, one of the admirable qualities of that Senator, among many, is his stubborn determination to make certain that when things are done here, they are done the right way and that he understands it and that the interests affected are protected in a manner that is consistent with what he views as a matter of principle. I know that is frustrating for some, but the Senator from Florida certainly has that right. He contributes to this process by being determined to make certain we understand the consequences of all of this. 
I thank him for working with us now in these final moments to reach an agreement that I think is the right agreement. We will pass this legislation, and I think we have accomplished something significant. 
Mr. President, let me also indicate that my staff member, Greg Rohde, who has been working on these issues for many, many years with me, has done an outstanding job, as well as have other staff who have helped work through this process. I thank him for his work. I yield the floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I introduce the first in what will be a number of bills addressing the inequalities in the availability and pricing of agricultural chemicals between the United States and Canada. This bill focuses on the differences in prices between identical or nearly identical chemicals. The need for this bill is created by chemical companies who use our chemical labeling laws to protect their pricing and marketing system. By labeling similar products only for use in different states or countries or only for use on certain plants, chemical companies are able to extract unreasonable profits from farmers who desperately need their products. 
A second part of my effort to correct differences between agricultural chemicals used in Canada and the United States is a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO). I am now finalizing discussions with GAO as to the specific areas to be studied and the scope of the study. It is my expectation that I will introduce legislation in the next session of Congress to correct the remaining deficiencies. 
Of particular concern lately has been the significant difference in farm chemical prices between Canada and the United States. Because our farmers are engaged in a difficult trade battle with Canada, differences in agricultural chemical prices between Canada and the United States place our farmers at a disadvantage with their Canadian competition. This bill is drafted to correct 
As introduced today, the bill sets up a procedure by which states may apply for, and receive, an Environmental Protection Agency label for agricultural chemicals sold in Canada which are identical or substantially similar to agricultural chemicals used in the United States. Initially, this bill will allow the cross border movement of similar chemicals. Eventually, it is my expectation that this bill, along with the GAO study, will lead to an equalization of farm chemical availability and prices across the border. 
I request my colleagues' support in this effort to bring fairness to cross-border chemical pricing.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the second-degree amendment for all of the reasons previously stated by the Senator from Wyoming, the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Florida. I have, beginning with the origin of this bill in the Senate Commerce Committee, been very concerned about exactly what the language in this legislation will mean to this country, to our Main Streets, to our States and local governments. 
The issue here is a relatively simple one, and I don't need to restate all of the reasons that were offered by the Senator from Wyoming for being concerned about it. But the genesis of this bill was to be concerned about State and local governments applying `punitive' tax programs against Internet commerce. They were worried that this growth of the Internet and the expansion of commerce on the Internet would be retarded by local governments or State governments, seeing that as a big, juicy target, and apply some kind of new discriminatory or punitive tax regime upon it. Therefore, they said, let us at least have a time-out until we understand how to impose some sort of tax system that is fair to the Internet sellers and that does not discriminate against the Internet sellers. 
Well, the question here, then, is, if in this legislation where you have a time-out, or a moratorium, and you create a commission during that moratorium to investigate or evaluate all of these issues, why then would you say to that commission that you can take a look at all of this, you can take a look at what this means with respect to Internet commerce, but you cannot look at the other issues; you cannot look at how it relates, Internet commerce versus mail-order firms; you cannot look at how it relates to Internet commerce versus Main Street sellers? What kind of logic is that? If you are going to have a commission to try to figure out how this piece fits in the puzzle, then make sure all the pieces are there. That is all this second degree says--make sure all the pieces are there. 
The people who are here saying we don't want to solve this puzzle are people who have a vested interest. They are here, frankly, because of mail-order firms and the Internet. They are saying we don't want anybody to look at all of this. We want a moratorium for the Internet over here, and over here we don't want anybody discussing mail-order issues. 
The Senator from Wyoming said he and his wife had a shoestore. I didn't know that. I have never been to their shoestore. I have never shopped in Gillette, WY, and I probably never will shop there. But the issue he raises is essential to this point. When he and his wife opened the door in the morning and displayed shoes for sale in that store, they knew a couple of things: They rented the building, they hired the employees, and they bought an inventory. They opened their door and said: We are in business on Main Street in Gillette, WY. They knew that when somebody came through the door and took their shoes off and got fitted up and bought a brand new shiny pair of shoes, when they paid for it, they had to apply the local sales tax. That is what you have to do on Main Street. You are a tax collector for the local consumption tax in the State of Wyoming. I didn't hear him complain about that. That is what they do on Main Streets all across this country. I believe 45 States have a sales tax. 
Another thing he and his wife knew, I am sure, and he is not here to answer the question, but I am sure they knew that if someone three blocks away decided they were not going to go to Main Street to buy shoes today, they were going to buy them through a mail-order catalog, in most cases they will buy those through the catalog without paying a local sales tax or a State sales tax, which means that his local business ended up being undersold by someone, perhaps by 4 percent, maybe 6, or maybe even 7 or 8 percent, because the catalog seller, in most cases, didn't charge the State sales tax. 
Is that discriminatory vis-a-vis the Main Street businessperson? I think it is. Of course, it is. Does it mean there is not a tax on the transaction? No, there is a tax. When they mail that pair of shoes from the mail-order catalog house to the person in Gillette, WY, or Fargo, or Bismarck, ND, the person who receives that pair of shoes has a responsibility in most every State to pay a use tax. Of course, they don't know that and they won't ever pay that, but that is the responsibility. 
The net result of all of this is that the Main Street folks 
will end up always being at a disadvantage with respect to taxation versus those who are doing business elsewhere, those who have constructed a catalog and haven't hired the employees, haven't rented a place to do business, and they haven't hired local folks; they have just operated through a catalog. 
I happen to think catalog sellers are very important to this country. Frankly, they are wonderful marketers. I think it is wonderful for a lot of people in this country to be able to shop that way. There is no question about that. I think when you look at the tax issue here--whether it is buying it through a catalog or going through a computer and getting on the Internet and buying it through a seller on the Internet or buying it on Main Street--there ought to be some symmetry here in the tax treatment to make sure the tax treatment is not going to retard the growth of the business on Main Street, it is not going to retard the business growth of people who have catalogs and the business opportunities of the people on the Internet. 
But what is being said in the underlying amendment is, let's take a look at this only with respect to how it relates to the Internet, and you must ignore everything else. My friend, the Senator from Oregon, says, well, we want to explore everything. But, of course, this says you cannot, you must not; in fact, we are going to fight to the end here to see that you are unable to explore everything. That doesn't make any sense to me. That is what the second-degree amendment is about. 
The Senate Finance Committee got this right. It passed a bill, came to the floor, created a commission and said, take a look at all of this. We will have a commission that evaluates and studies all of this with respect to the tax neutrality, with respect to the opportunities in growth, and the impact of these taxes on a wide range of commerce--not just Internet commerce, but a wide range of commerce. 
The Senate Finance Committee got it right. The underlying amendment now offered by a couple of good legislators, I think for understandable reasons, would say that the Finance Committee is wrong; this commission must not, cannot, and will not be able to study the whole range of circumstances. The second degree says, no, we don't accept that; we want to insert language that is effectively the language coming out of the Senate Finance Committee. 
I say again, as I did yesterday when the Senator from Florida was on the floor, and I say it now to the Senator from Arkansas, who along with the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Wyoming were primary sponsors of the second degree, in my judgment, they are dead right. They are absolutely right on target. I hope that the Senate, notwithstanding whatever curves and straightaways we find with this legislation--I assume this legislation will be worked out in the coming hours and days and, perhaps, be passed tomorrow, and I hope it will be passed in a satisfactory form. 
But one of the ways that this legislation will be made a better piece of legislation is to pass this second-degree amendment and restore it to the condition it was in when it came out of the Senate Finance Committee. These folks spent a lot of time on tax issues in the Finance Committee. I used to be on the House Ways and Means Committee in the other body for 10 years, and I spent a lot of time on tax issues. I think the Senate Finance Committee got it right. They said, study these issues, evaluate them all, understand the consequences of them all, and then, with that knowledge, let's make some judgments. That is the purpose of the time-out; that is the purpose of the moratorium. 
I have, as the Senator from Oregon stated, spent a fair amount of time with him, and I think we have made a lot of progress on these issues. 
My expectation is we will pass a piece of legislation that is an acceptable piece of legislation that has a timeout moratorium. But it must, in my judgment, include this in order to really give us the assurance that that moratorium is used effectively by a commission that has divisions to look at all of these issues. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is also my hope that in a relatively short period of time we will be able to resolve the remaining issues. We have made a lot of progress on the bill. I will say again that the Senator from Arizona has done an excellent job, and the Senator from Oregon and others have pushed very hard to get us to this point. There are other significant issues, but I expect to get them resolved in relatively short order. I hope we will make the final progress necessary on this piece of legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the second-degree amendment to the first-degree amendment that was offered by the Senator from Arizona is an amendment that has been worked out over a period of several days dealing with the grandfather clause. It is something that I think represents a workable solution which improves the legislation. It would be my hope that the Senate would approve it. 
I do want to point out that the amendment that was referred to by Senator McCain would be an amendment dealing with the length of the moratorium. My understanding is that the passage of the first-degree and second-degree amendments would leave in place a 3-year moratorium with respect to this legislation. The Senator from Arizona would then offer an amendment, and I believe there would be a recorded vote after some debate on that amendment, that would propose that the 3-year moratorium be extended to 4 years, and the Senate then would make a judgment on that question. 
I offer that by way of explanation of what is happening here. I hope the Senate will approve by voice vote the first- and second-degree amendments.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from Arkansas, and I am reminded again why we are going to miss him when he is gone. He fights hard for the things he feels strongly about, and this has been one of them for many years. 
This vote coming up, probably in 20 minutes, is a very simple vote. This issue started with the notion that people said, gee, we must do something here to provide a shield so that nobody would impose punitive taxes on the Internet and retard the growth of the Internet. Lord, have you ever seen anything grow like the Internet and Internet commerce? That is mushrooming so fast you can't get your arms around it. And they are saying we have to be sure that we protect them. 
Well, in the matter of protecting them, they have created a moratorium on the ability of State and local governments to impose taxes. The vote that we are going to have in a moment is regarding how long that moratorium is going to last. The committee on which I serve reported a bill out that said let's have a moratorium for 6 years. I didn't vote for that. The House of Representatives said let's have a moratorium for 3 years. The Senate Finance Committee said let's have a moratorium for 2 years. 
The underlying bill will now say 3 years. The amendment we are going to vote on says no, that is not enough; we need a 4-year moratorium. The Senator from Arkansas will be fishing in Arkansas, and at the end of 4 years we will have folks--I guarantee it--who will stand here on the floor of the Senate, and they will say, `We have got to have an extender. We have to extend this moratorium.' How long? Another 4 years. How about permanently? Make it a permanent extender. That is exactly what is going to happen. 
We ought to decide as a Senate 3 years--no more. And at the end of 3 years we are done. If we can't figure it out by the end of 3 years, there is something wrong with us. 
I ask the Senator from Arkansas. Does he agree that this ought not be a circumstance where we create a tax system that says, `Oh, by the way. We will favor folks doing this over a computer,' which means we will penalize the folks that hire the folks on Main Street who rent the building, put the inventory in, open their door early in the morning, and hold themselves open for business. And we say to them that we will penalize them because the other folks don't have to comply with the tax laws when they come in and compete with them. 
That is what this fight is about. The amendment here is going to be 4 years or 3 years. There will be a lot of folks who come to the well of the Senate and say, `What is the issue?' The issue is that for every, I assume, 4 years, or for every 3 years. But what does good sense tell us ought to be the case here? Three years maximum, and then no more. Then let's have a tax system that is fair to everybody regardless of how they are selling--off the Internet, catalogs, or Main Street. Let's be fair with respect to this tax system of ours. 
Let me conclude by saying I worked on this issue when I was in the House of Representatives on the Ways and Means Committee for 10 years. I know what the problem is. You start talking about this issue, and the first thing you know you have a million friends--not friends. You get a million postcards, because everybody who buys from a catalog seller is told to send a postcard to this person, or that person, and they are told that person is trying to increase your tax. Of course, that is not true. Nobody is talking about any additional taxes. There is no increase in tax. This is a different issue--the moratorium. So you get a million cards out there, or 10 million cards that affects all of the interests that are voting. 
Mr. President, again, let me say to the Senator from Arkansas that his dedication to this issue is important, and he will leave a long and lasting impact on the Senate. I think the most immediate impact and the most immediate presentation now is a good vote so we can at least turn back the 10 years. I think that would be a good public service.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the efforts by the Senator from Alaska. My understanding is that he is seeking to table the underlying first-degree amendment, the McCain amendment. The McCain amendment includes the grandfather provision which preserves the existing Internet access taxes. In my judgment, this makes the moratorium a forward-looking moratorium, and will not preempt existing taxes. 
It also deals with State and local taxing authorities by including a State and local tax savings provision, which makes it clear that no other State or local tax will be affected. In other words, it protects against the unintended consequences that may well occur unless we have that savings clause. 
I really think that it is important that we not support the motion offered by the Senator from Alaska. 
The third provision I want to mention in the first-degree amendment that he is attempting to table is a provision ensuring that this moratorium will not affect any pending or existing liabilities. Currently there are companies that may have failed to pay some taxes that would have a current liability under current valid existing laws, and we would not want this moratorium to have the unintended consequence of interrupting those liabilities either. 
As I understand it, we have a first-degree amendment, and now a motion to table that. I hope that the motion to table will not prevail. I will vote against it. I will be, by that vote, supporting the underlying first-degree McCain amendment. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute. I want to use this unique opportunity to add my comments about the Senator from Indiana. I have told people that I am enormously proud to serve in this body. One of the major reasons for that is the men and women with whom I serve, both Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, I think are the best men and women I have been associated with in my entire life. 
One of those is the Senator from Indiana. We became acquainted in 1981 when we both were elected to the House of Representatives in the same election, and although we perhaps have agreed and disagreed many times on many issues throughout the years, I have deep admiration for Senator Coats and his family. 
When he leaves the Senate, as is the case with so many of our colleagues, the Senate will have lost a very important contributor on a good many issues, this one most notable. He has been persistent on this issue and, as the Senator from Arizona just described, we have had hearings in the Commerce Committee about this issue. It desperately needs attention, desperately needs a solution, and the Senator from Indiana has been a significant contributor in that effort. I did not want to let this moment pass without sharing my respect for Senator Coats. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a few questions of my friend from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, regarding the water quality component of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES) Special Grants Program. In particular, I note that although the Senate agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 included $436,000 for water quality grant in North Dakota, the conference report now before us has moved those funds into a separate water quality item. Could the Senator explain the reason for this action?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I may not need the entire 2 minutes, but I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida. 
This issue is relatively simple. The whole purpose of a moratorium is to take kind of a time-out and establish a commission and review a series of these issues. But all of us here know how difficult it is going to be when this moratorium, whatever it is, is to expire. We will have people coming here saying this needs to be a perpetual thing; we will continue the moratorium year after year after year. I want this piece of legislation with its moratorium to represent that time-out; to give this country time to make the right decisions. But at that point I want the decisions to be made, and I want the moratorium to be gone. That is what the Senator from Florida is saying. It is a very important amendment. 
I hope my colleagues will support this amendment so that we will comply with what I think the true spirit of this legislation really is--a time-out for thoughtful decisions to be made and then business as usual. We don't want permanent preemption of the State's tax base. That is what will happen if we don't decide now that this moratorium will be--whatever it is. I hope it is 3 years.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the items up for consideration as we finish this 105th Congress is H.R. 10, the so-called financial modernization bill. In fact, we have gone through a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to that bill. H.R. 10 is a piece of legislation that apparently has fairly wide support, I am told, in this Congress. I do not happen to support it, but I assume we will go through a period this week of debating and voting on a series of procedural motions dealing with H.R. 10. 
It is a 600-page bill, and it will make the most sweeping changes to the financial sector and particularly the banking and other financial industries since the 1930s. This piece of legislation repeals the Glass-Steagall Act, which restricts the ability of banks and security underwriters to affiliate with one another. 
The bill creates a new category of financial holding companies. The structure will allow for a broader range of financial services now to be done in one affiliated area--commercial banking, insurance underwriting, merchant banking. 
I do not know whether most people have forgotten the lessons of the 1930s, but in the 1930s it was thought that perhaps we ought not to merge or marry in any way inherently speculative activities with banking because banking requires the perception--even just the perception--of safety and soundness to survive and do well. Safety and soundness is critical. 
When you bring into the realm of banking activity that is inherently speculative, such as underwriting securities, insurance underwriting, merchant banking, and a whole range of other activities, it seems to me we have just forgotten the lessons of the 1930s. And we are told that we must do this is the name of financial modernization. In order to be `modern,' we must decide to step forward and change the structure of these financial institutions. 
This country learned tough lessons the very hard way decades ago about marrying banking activities with other activities that are inherently speculative. I know they say, gee, we have created these affiliates with firewalls, all that sort of thing. I have heard that all before. I heard that with the Saving and Loans. The taxpayer got stuck for $500 billion bailing out the S&L mess. 
I think this bill represents a huge step backwards for this country. For that reason, I do not support the legislation. I will speak more about it at some point later. 
But the thing I find interesting is this rush to complete H.R. 10 right now. The big shots want financial modernization and the halls are filled with people who are working to get H.R. 10 done because the big economic interests in this country want financial modernization. 
But what about school modernization? I have been on the floor of this Senate talking about school construction, I guess maybe 10 times in this Congress. I have told about a young second grader at the Cannon Ball elementary school. Let me just talk about this issue again, because school modernization does not seem to be a priority. Apparently, second graders are not big shots. They do not have the same clout with this Congress. 
The school in Cannon Ball, just on the periphery of an Indian reservation, is a public school. It is open today. Those little kids, mostly Native Americans, are in their crowded classrooms. There are 160 students and staff in that school with only one water fountain and two bathrooms. Part of the school that is now being used had previously been condemned. It is an old, old, old building in desperate disrepair. 
One of the rooms they use for music is in the downstairs area. They more than occasionally cannot use it because the stench of sewer gas comes up and fills that area, and they have to evacuate that area. And a little second grader came up to me when I toured that school, and asked, `Mr. Senator, will you build us a new school?' Well, the answer is, modernization of a school building does not apparently have the same priority to this Congress as modernization of our financial system. 
Instead of financial modernization, how about modernization of the Cannon Ball school so that little girl, Rosie, age 7, can walk into a second grade classroom that we can be proud of, where you can hook a computer to the Internet, a classroom that is not going to have to be evacuated because of seeping sewer gas, a classroom that has a bathroom outside or a water fountain close by. What about her needs? What about the needs of all those kids? 
Or maybe we can talk about the Ojibwa school. The kids there go to school in trailers that are overcrowded and unsafe and classrooms that have been condemned--and this Congress knows it. There is going to be a desperate accident there some day. There is going to be a fire spread across those trailers with their wooden fire escapes. My deep concern that somebody is going to die unless somebody takes action first. 
Study after study after study shows that school to be unsafe, but there is no money to modernize that school. Those little children on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation go to the Ojibwa school in conditions that, in my judgment, should not give any of us pride that we send our children through its doorway. 
We can do something about it. We can modernize those schools. We have had proposals on the floor of the Senate for school construction, but guess what? The funds to modernize those schools is not nearly as important as modernizing our financial system because H.R. 10, the financial modernization bill, has all kinds of folks in dark suits standing out here lobbying for it. 
They have a lot of clout, a lot of resources. When they say, `Jump,' we have people saying, `How high?' But what about the second graders? What about the Cannon Ball school? What about the Ojibwa school? I could go on talking about the school construction needs in our country and in my State, and especially on Indian reservations, about which we ought to do something. 
I know the Senator from Massachusetts wanted to make this point with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Talk about modernization, what about modernization with respect to the delivery of health care? Is it modern to have a health care system in which people do not get the medical care they need? 
The Senator from Massachusetts has been talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights. We cannot even get a vote on it. It is very simple. It says that, when you are sick, you ought to be able to have a doctor or a health care plan that tells you all of your treatment options, not just the cheapest. And yet today all across this country people find HMOs saying, `We will only tell you what the cheapest option is, not all of your options, as a patient.'

It is apparently not a priority. In fact, not only is this apparently not a priority but they have also deliberately attempted to prevent us from having the opportunity to enact HMO reform, the Patients' Bill of Rights, school modernization, and so on, because it is not something they want to do.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Idaho. 
Let me make one final point, and if the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to make a final point in the form of a question, I will yield. 
The point is that health care decisions ought to be made in a doctor's office or in a hospital room, not by some insurance company accountant 500 or 1,000 miles away. That is the point the Senator from Massachusetts is making. That is the point that is made in the underlying legislation dealing with a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a critically important point. 
We ought to have been able to debate fully under regular order the piece of legislation called the Patients' Bill of Rights. I regret we have not been able to debate that. 
I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is a custom in the Senate to speak well of someone you are about to oppose. So let me speak well of the Senator from Mississippi. We have worked together on a wide range of issues. He is a very effective Senator and somebody I enjoy working with a great deal. He has a very effective staff and we work on a lot of issues together. But I come to the floor today opposing the conference report and to do so as aggressively as I possibly can. I want to explain to him and other Members why I feel so strongly about this. 
First of all, it is not the case that all that was offered in July was the $500 million indemnity program that was introduced as an amendment by Senator Conrad and myself. It is the case that we also proposed, and had a vote on an amendment to increase the price supports by lifting the caps on the loan rate. We did it then; and we did it a second time. We lost twice in those efforts. We proposed a series of steps, one of which was lifting the loan rate, and another of which dealt with disaster issues. 
I want to describe why I feel so strongly about this. I received a letter from the head of the Farm Service Agency in our State. I asked him, `If things don't change, what should we expect in the next few months in North Dakota with respect to family farms?' He points out that North Dakota in the judgment of the Farm Service Agency, will lose over 3,500 farms by this spring without some significant assistance. That is probably some 14,000 people. I assume there is an average of three or four persons on each of those family farmers, including a spouse and a couple of children. So at least 3,500 family farms will not get credit and will not be able to continue farming this coming year. That means 12,000 to 14,000 North Dakota farm people will be told that their dream is over. They tried, but they failed. 
Let me describe the reasons they are not making it. There are two main reasons. One, is the disaster. We had the 500-year flood of the Red River, and people know about that. They remember the flood at Grand Forks. For a number of years we have been in a wet weather cycle in eastern North Dakota. We have had massive quantities of standing water that have inundated acres and acres of farmland in North Dakota. This wet cycle has caused and exacerbated a crop disease known as fusarium head blight, or scab. This combination has devastated the quality of farm life in North Dakota. 
I have a chart here. If you are a North Dakota farmer and you are in these red counties on this chart in the eastern part of the State, you have had 5 straight years of disaster declaration. The red counties are not 1, 2, or 3, but every year for 5 straight years that these counties have been declared a disaster. Why? Because of weather-related events, and other events, their production has been devastated. So that is the disaster portion of this problem. You can see that with the orange counties and yellow counties, that these counties have had disasters 3 out of 5 years. In fact two thirds of the counties in my State have been declared a disaster area 3, 4 or 5 years out of 5 years. 
Now, in addition to the disaster, what also has happened to these farmers is that Congress passed a new farm bill. The Senator from Nebraska might be right that this might have nothing at all to do with price. The new farm bill might not be related to the collapse in price. 
But it might be; I don't know. I am not asserting that today, I am just saying that we passed a new farm bill. This chart shows what has happened to the price of wheat since Congress passed the farm bill. It is down by almost 60 percent. There has been a 60-percent drop in the price of wheat since Congress passed the new farm bill. The price of wheat has fallen from $5.75 a bushel to $2.36. 
Add together the significant disasters year after year and the collapse of prices and here is what you have. In my State, in North Dakota, which is the hardest hit, in 1 year there was a 98-percent drop in net farm income. These are U.S. Government figures. We had a 98-percent drop in net farm income. With respect to this group of North Dakotans, their income has virtually been wiped away. 
Is it any wonder they are in deep trouble? We are not a State of big corporate agrifactories. We are a State largely composed of family farms. When they suffer a loss of virtually all of their income, many of them just do not make it. 
The current farm bill doesn't provide a bridge across price valleys. The philosophy of the current farm bill is that you ought to operate in the free market. If there is a price valley, the farmer is told, `Tough luck; try and find your way across the valley.' 
So because we don't have that pricing bridge under this economic philosophy, family farmers certainly don't get to the other side. The head of our Farm Service Agency says 3,500 farms will not be in the field next spring in North Dakota. 
I am betting that if any other Member of this body had the same set of statistics in front of them concerning what is happening to their family farmers would also be here. They would be here with as much energy and as much passion as I have to see if we can't change this result and to do whatever we need to do to change it. 
The underlying bill has disaster assistance. I am very appreciative of that. We might argue about who provides more. But overall, frankly, I think the underlying bill, and the administration, and virtually everyone who is party to this has offered a fairly decent package with respect to disaster assistance. 
The Senator from Mississippi correctly pointed out that he and Senator Lott accepted the $500 million indemnity program amendment that we put into in the bill in the Senate in the first instance to deal with the initial estimate of damages from the disaster in the Northern Plains. That amendment was done prior to the almost complete collapse of the cotton crop in Texas and the devastation in Louisiana, Oklahoma and other States. At that time we all understood that the disaster indemnity program was going to have to be increased at some point along the way. The disaster package in this appropriations bill started with the acceptance by the Senator from Mississippi to put in the $500 million indemnity for the Northern Plains. I appreciate that. 
I am not here to argue about which disaster proposal for this bill is better than the other. Both the President and the conference report addressed this disaster issue in a very significant way. But, I am here to say that is not enough. 
On top of the disaster provision, as the Senator from Mississippi indicated, the majority party added a 18-cents-a-bushel payment for wheat. This additional AMTA payment really only means that farmers will get 13 cents a bushel for wheat when it is all figured out. That is because AMTA payments are made on only 85 percent of contract acreage on the frozen historic yields. So the real assistance to deal with price collapse in this bill amounts to 13 cents a bushel for wheat. And it is not enough. 
It won't allow farmers enough cashflow. It won't allow their bankers to decide that they will get another loan to go to the fields next spring to plant crops. They simply won't be able to do it. That is the dilemma. This is not enough. And there isn't any way to argue to say that it is enough, or that it will solve this problem. 
If numbers are to be believed with respect to the estimates in North Dakota, at least 3,500 farm families are going to be washed away. These farm families are not going to be able to farm next spring. I am not willing to accept that result. It is not a fair result. Family farmers are not getting their share of this country's national income. They should be expected to get a decent share of that. 
Let me show you what family farms face. They are told that they should just go ahead and operate in the free market and whatever happens, happens. What is that free market about? Everywhere they look, they confront near monopolies, or at least enormous concentrations of economic power. The top four firms in this country control 62 percent of flour milling. The top four firms in dry corn milling control 57 percent. In wet corn milling, the top four control 76 percent. In soybean crushing, the top four have 76 percent. 
If a farmer happens to produce livestock and he markets that cow, he finds that 87 percent of the beef slaughter is controlled by the top four firms. The top four control 73 percent of sheep slaughter. It is 60 percent for pork. Or, if farmers want to haul their grain to market on a railroad--and most of them have to--they stick it on a rail car somewhere in my State, and they get double charged at least because there is no competition. 
I have mentioned this before and I will say it again. If you put a carload of wheat on the rail track in Bismarck and haul it to Minneapolis, they charge you $2,300. If you put it on a car in Minneapolis, and haul it to Chicago, which is about the same distance, it costs you $1,000. Why do we get double charged? Because there is no rail competition in North Dakota, while there are multiple lines between Minneapolis and Chicago. 
So it is not just concentration among processors. It is also the transportation components of the grain trade that are highly concentrated. This isn't a circumstance where there is a free market. Yet farmers are told to operate in the free market. If prices collapse, they are told tough luck, and we will give you 13 cents. If they can't make it with that, tougher luck. 
Those want to pass this bill also contemplate tax cuts that they say will help farmers. Tax cuts don't help people without income. The problem in farm country is lack of income. The first thing we should do is to restore income. 
I happen to support most of those tax proposals that I have heard about. In fact, some that the Senator from Mississippi described today have great merit. I support fully deductible health insurance for sole proprietorships and income averaging. I can go down a whole list of proposals that I support. My point is that first we need to restore income to these family farmers. They need to get a fair share of this Nation's income. 
The fact is that everybody who touches products produced by these farmers is virtually making record profits. The railroads? You bet your life they are doing fine. They haul the farmers' products. How about the slaughterhouses? Are they doing fine? You bet they have solid profits. They are the ones who slaughter the livestock that is sent to market by those farmers. 
How about the cereal manufacturers who put the snap, crackle and pop into a cereal. They take a kernel of wheat, put it in a plant some place, put it in a bright-colored box, ship it to a grocery store, and sell it at $4 a box. The company that puts the puff in puffed wheat makes far more than the person who gassed the tractor, planted the seed, and harvested that wheat. In fact, the person that harvested the wheat that they planted is going broke. And the people who are puffing it, crackling it, and snapping it are having record profits. 
I don't understand the notion that somehow, if we just do nothing, things will work out. When we look at all of the evidence here, we are going to lose tens and tens of thousands of family farmers across this country unless this Congress does what it needs to do now. We need to provide some decent price supports to get farmers across this price valley. 
I am not standing here asking that we tip the current farm program upside down. I didn't vote for the current farm program. I am not going to stand here and provide a litany of why I think it is not a good program. I am not suggesting we tip it upside down. I am simply saying what this farm program did in the big print it took away in the small print. This farm program, passed by this Congress, said we would provide farmers 85 percent of the five-year Olympic average price as a price support in the form of a loan rate. That is what it said in the big print. In the small print it said that the 85 percent of the five-year Olympic average price would be capped. The small print says we will put an artificial cap on it to bring the loan rates way down. 
All we are saying is that we should take the artificial cap off. Do what the big print said the farm bill will do. Get rid of the small print that took away that help to the family farmers. 
In North Dakota it means a $156 million difference just on the price support mechanism. The difference for the farmers in my State alone is $156 million. That could well mean the difference between making it and not making it. It can mean the difference between succeeding and failing. 
A young fellow wrote to me recently. I have referred to his letter previously in the last couple of days. His name is Wyatt. He is a sophomore in high school at Stanley, ND. He wrote this plaintive cry for help on behalf of his family farm. He is a young boy who loves to farm. He knows his dad and mom do as well. He wrote me a letter that says, `My dad can feed 180 people. And he can't feed his family.' He was describing a circumstance where his family's income has been washed out. Their family farm may not be able to make it and he wonders whether that is fair, and whether that is good economic policy for this country. The answer clearly is no, that is not fair. And clearly it is not good economic policy for our country. 
Both the independent community bankers in my State and the North Dakota Bankers Association tell me that if we don't pass some meaningful assistance this year these farmers won't be in the field next spring. 
That is from the lenders. 
This weekend, I was reading some of President Truman's speeches in 1948. I want to read a couple of pieces from President Truman in 1948. Old Harry was doing a whistle stop tour on a train back then. I like Harry Truman. Harry spoke plainly and never minced any words. I thought maybe we would celebrate just a bit of what Harry Truman said about family farmers and what this debate is about today. 
Harry Truman said at the National Plowing Match in Dexter, IA, September 18, 1948:  
[I] believe that farmers are entitled to share equally with others in our national income. [I] believe a prosperous and productive agriculture is essential to [this country's] national welfare. 
He said: 
Those who are wilfully trying to discredit the price support program for farmers don't want the farmers to be prosperous. They believe in low prices for farmers, cheap wages for labor, and high profits for big corporations. 
And then he said: 
The big money [interests look] on agriculture and labor as merely an expense item in a business venture. [They try] to push their share of the national income down as low as possible and increase [their] own profits. And [they] look upon the Government as a tool to accomplish this purpose. 
That was 1948, 50 years ago. Isn't it interesting that as we stand here debating agriculture, in North Dakota there are probably 12,000 to 14,000 citizens who will not get into the fields next spring unless this Congress does the right thing. At least 3,500 farms will go belly up. That is 12,000 to 14,000 people, who will lose their livelihood unless we do the right thing. Yet, surrounding those farmers are the bigger economic interests that are all making money. There are the railroads, slaughterhouses, grain trader, cereal manufacturers, grocery manufacturers, and you can name all the others that are all making record profits. 
Does that say something about whether the system is fair? And you might say, well, what business is it of ours? The business for this country is that if we do not act, we will not have people living in the country. We will not have people living out on the land. We won't have yard lights illuminating those family farms. We won't have the Jeffersonian notion of broad-based economic democracy in America if we don't start caring a bit about whether we have family farmers in our future. 
Instead, we will end up having big agribusiness in control in rural America from California to Maine. When they do that, the price of food will go way up, and then they will have cornered everything. I guess they can haul it, process it, slaughter it, and make money off of that and then finally they can grow it because they got rid of mom and pop on the family farm. You ask them, would that be good for the country? I don't think so. 
So this issue is very simple. Is what the conference committee brought to the Senate floor enough? The answer is clearly no. It is not nearly good enough. Do we have the resources in this country to do better and do what we should? The answer is yes, clearly yes. For those who believe in this as a priority, there are clearly enough resources to make the difference. I hope that if the Congress falls short, the President will veto the legislation as he indicated earlier. He should send it back and say let us do better. We can do better and work together. 
We must understand that there are two components, one of which is a disaster component. For that portion I commend the Senator from Mississippi and the entire conference. But the second portion is the price support component. These two components added together must be enough to give farmers some hope and some opportunity. This bill falls far short of that. 
As I mentioned in my opening statement, it is not the case that somehow the proposal to increase the price supports that are available to family farmers has just emerged from some mysterious corner of policy making. That is not the case at all. We have already had two votes in the Senate on this issue of raising price supports. We have lost by a handful of votes both times, and we may lose again. But, I will be here through the last breath of legislative effort to see that this Congress is persuaded to do the right thing for these family farmers. 
These 3,500 farm families deserve a chance. They didn't cause the Asian financial crisis. They didn't cause the crisis in Asia which means that this country can export fewer agricultural goods to Asia. Family farmers didn't cause crop disease. Family farmers didn't cause the collapse of grain prices. Family farmers didn't cause the incessant wet cycle in our part of the country that has helped exacerbate crop disease. Family farmers didn't cause these problems. And this Congress should not say to family farmers, `Well, you deal with it. And if you can't, you don't matter.' 
This Congress ought to extend a helping hand to say to family farmers, `We want to help you over this trouble spot. We want to help you survive because you are important to this country.' 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my intention--I did not provide an opening statement as we brought the bill to the floor. Senator McCain, who is managing the legislation, and I and Senator Wyden and Senator Bumpers and others talked about the schedule. I wanted the vote to be able to occur in a way that would allow Members to cast their vote and catch their airplanes, so I deferred on an opening statement. It is my intention to provide an opening statement to discuss the framework of, I think, some of the amendments that we will be debating as we continue this legislation this afternoon and also perhaps next week. 
Let me, if I can, describe the circumstances that brought this legislation to the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, along with Senator McCain, when we brought the legislation to the floor today, I was interested in trying to accommodate the schedules that Members had. And the second vote this morning was able to be held at a time that would allow some Members the opportunity to catch airplanes back to their home States. But I did want to discuss the circumstances that allowed us to get this legislation to the floor. And I would like to review with the Senator from Oregon some of the provisions of the bill that are yet to be completed. 
First, with respect to this general subject of the Internet, my orientation of this issue is that, like most Americans, I view the Internet as something new and exciting and wonderful in a lot of ways and troublesome in other ways. The technology without question is remarkable and wonderful. 
Obviously, there are some things on the Internet these days that are troublesome and that is why we struggle with this question of the Decency Act that we wrote in the Commerce Committee and was struck down by the Supreme Court. I think the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, is going to offer an amendment similar to something we have discussed previously with respect to the Internet and decency. 
But leaving that aside, the Internet itself and the telecommunications revolution that exists in this country, and the information superhighway that comes from that revolution, is really quite remarkable. 
I come from a town of 300 people. I have a very different background than the Senator from Wyoming or the Senator from Arizona for that matter. I come from a town of 300 people. I went to a very small school. Obviously, a school in a town of 300 people is not going to be big under any circumstance. But my high school graduating class was nine students. And we had a library in my high school that was a very small coat closet, and that contained all of our books. And that was it. That is the way life was in my school. Would I trade it for another experience? No. I thought it was a wonderful school, a wonderful hometown, and a wonderful education. 
But now when I go back to my hometown it is slightly smaller than it was when I left. Some of those rural communities are shrinking. I go back to that wonderful community and go to the school. The library is not much larger than it was then except--that school is now connected to the information superhighway. Computers in those small schools can now access the information superhighway. 
And what does that mean? It means in my hometown of Regent, ND, there is a student today who is able to use a computer and access the Library of Congress. Now, the Library of Congress has the largest repository of human knowledge that exists anywhere on Earth. Of all of the accumulated knowledge in human history--the largest body of that knowledge exists in the Library of Congress. 
In Regent, ND, that small library is now augmented by the largest library on Earth as a result of the information superhighway and the new revolution in telecommunications. 
Is that wonderful? It is more than wonderful. It changes our ability to educate. It changes our ability to do a whole series of things. In fact, as an aside, I read a while ago that the CEO of IBM Corporation gave a speech to shareholders. He said they are on the cusp of discovery in researching storage density sufficient so that he expects we will soon be able to put all of that information from the Library of Congress--14 to 16 million volumes of work, the largest repository of human knowledge on Earth--on a wafer the size of a penny. Think of that, a computer storage wafer the size of a penny encompassing all of the works of the Library of Congress. 
What does that mean? It is a wonderful opportunity in our future to use the Internet and to use telecommunications to enhance education and a whole range of things. 
I wanted to provide that framework simply to say, especially coming from a very small community in North Dakota, we understand the wonders and the technological marvels that exist in what we are talking about here and how it changes things. 
My hometown, 120 miles southwest of Bismarck, ND, 50 miles from Dickinson, and, for those who want to pinpoint it more precisely, 14 miles west of Mott, ND--my hometown is as close to the Hudson River as downtown Manhattan with telecommunications. Just like that, you can transmit data off the Internet. We have erased geography as a disadvantage. 
Now, in addition to the advantages of education that I have described with respect to the Internet and the information superhighway, there is another entire area of commerce that also provides significant advantages to people in my hometown and people in every hometown in our country. 
When I was a young boy, from my hometown we had to drive nearly 60 miles to go to a hospital. We had to drive 60 miles to a sporting goods store. When I was a young boy, that is what I wanted to do when my parents took me to the big town, Dickinson, ND, 10,000 people. I wanted to go to a sporting goods store. It was a small store with baseball mitts and merchandise. In my hometown, we had none. So I would go there and get lost in the sporting goods store, picking up the new baseball gloves, feeling and nurturing them, and wondering, what if I owned one of them? That was a big deal to me. 
It was true with respect to a Dairy Queen--50, 60 miles to a Dairy Queen; 60 miles to a clothing store. That is the way it was. 
Now, however, in my hometown you can't order a Dairy Queen over the Internet, but that sporting goods store is brought to my hometown by the Internet. The Internet changes commerce. Now someone in my hometown can dial up on the Internet a sporting goods store, a clothing store. Want to buy some new athletic shoes? That is available. How about a book? Amazon.com--we all know the success story of that company. 
My point is, we are seeing dramatic new areas of commerce available to people around the country, and around the world for that matter, which will improve their lives. I agree with that. 
We had a disagreement, the Senator from Oregon and I, about the piece of legislation in the Commerce Committee. I felt very strongly that what was proposed was dead wrong and he felt strongly it was right on target. We didn't disagree because we differed about the policy of what the Internet could mean to our country and to our people. I fully understand the full flow of benefits that will come from this. I understand and recognize that. Members know my interest is not in any way, ever, to impede the growth of the Internet or the growth of opportunity that people want to take advantage of on the Internet to market their goods, to build their business, and to do those kinds of things. 
At the same time, however, I recognize that while the Internet might bring a sporting goods store to my hometown, it will also bring some merchandise to my hometown that those few merchants in my hometown sell and must now collect a sales tax on when they sell it. I want to make sure, relative to the previous amendment and also some other amendments we will discuss, that what we do with respect to this form of new commerce has some relationship to fairness, fairness tied to selling on Main Street, sales from mail-order catalogs, selling on the Internet. I want to make sure what we are doing here is fair to all areas of commerce. 
That is why when Senator Wyden--who has been a leader on this, no question about that; he was the author in the Senate Commerce Committee of the underlying legislation--brought this legislation to the committee, I felt very strongly that the way it was constructed was going to cause a lot of problems. I opposed it vigorously, as he well knows. 
Since that time when it was passed out of the Commerce Committee, it has changed substantially. We now, I think, agree on one central principle, and that principle embodied in the underlying legislation is that we ought to have a moratorium of sorts so that we don't have State or local governments creating regimes of taxation here that could be punitive or could retard opportunities on the Internet in a punitive or discriminatory way. We agree with that and we have constructed legislation which I think will accomplish that and doesn't disadvantage any State or any local government. If there is a State or local government that has plans today to say let me be punitive in the way I apply a tax or construct a tax dealing with the Internet, I say I am not in your corner. I am not on your side on that. You are wrong; you ought not do that. 
I didn't want to snare in the net the kinds of State and local taxes that are applied to virtually all other kinds of commerce and do it in a way that would say to those who are at home on Main Street that you will be at a disadvantage because we have created a special safe harbor or special tax haven for certain kinds of electronic commerce. That has always been my concern. 
As long as the Senator from Oregon is here, I will engage him in this conversation. I think we are coming to the same point, Senator McCain, Senator Wyden, myself, and others, with respect to what we want to accomplish with this legislation. It is a system which, as we see the Internet begin to grow in its infancy--and it still is in its infancy--is nondiscriminating with respect to how taxes are imposed among different forms of commerce. 
I yield for a comment from the Senator from Oregon about whether he sees us coming to that same point and whether he shares that goal.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the issues that we have not completely resolved is extending the moratorium. We have a moratorium in this legislation that says to the States that if you have not yet adopted or enforced an Internet tax, there is a moratorium; you will not be able to do that during this time out. During that period, a commission will meet and evaluate all of these issues. The Senate finance bill reported out a 2-year moratorium on bit taxes, discriminatory taxes, and on Internet taxes. The House-passed version of this legislation has a 3-year moratorium. My understanding is that there will be an amendment calling for a 5-year moratorium on the bill that is coming to the floor. The version passed out by the Senate Commerce Committee had a 6-year moratorium. 
Keynes used to say, `In the long run, we are all dead.' I don't know what the long run is, but when you talk about moratoriums here, 6 years is a large expanse of time. It seems to me that it is wholly inappropriate. I would more favor the Senate finance bill, which is a 2-year time out, or moratorium. We will likely have to agree to something more than that, but 5 or 6 years, in my judgment, is not reasonable. I think there is another amendment that was noticed, or at least will be offered, with a 3-year moratorium, which seems to me to be a more reasonable compromise. I ask the Senator from Oregon about that.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not made an opening statement on this piece of legislation. I will do that at some future point. I want to allow the Senator from Arkansas to proceed with his amendment. I will, at some more convenient time, make an opening statement. 
I have some very strong thoughts about a whole range of issues, including the issue that is going to be raised by the Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, in just the 10 minutes that I am allotted, make a comment about the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers and also to comment about the underlying bill. 
Senator Bumpers offers an amendment that I think is very important and one that I intend to vote for and feel is a good amendment. The bill brought to the floor of the Senate, in its original form when it was passed out of the Commerce Committee, was totally unacceptable to me. I voted against it, worked against it, and felt its provisions were counterproductive. But since that time, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, Senator McCain, I, and others, have worked together; and the bill that will now be presented--I believe changed also by the managers' amendment--is a piece of legislation that has merit. But I think the legislation will be improved by the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas as well. 
This legislation is called the Internet Tax Freedom Act. And all of us understand that the information superhighway and new technology mean that commerce in this country is changing. Nowadays, if you want to buy a book, you can walk down to a bookstore someplace and buy a book. You might be able to look in a mail-order catalog and buy a book, or you might be able to go to your computer and buy a book. In either of those cases, you are a consumer purchasing a book. 
You can do the same with a saddle, if you happen to ride horses. You can do the same with a car. For that matter, you can do the same with virtually all merchandise these days. And the Internet, used for commerce purposes, is exploding all around us. 
The question is: When people are accessing the Internet or, for that matter, a mail-order catalog, or going downtown to make the purchase at a local business, what are the tax consequences? What kind of taxes do they pay? To whom do they pay those taxes? These are important issues. 
I am not someone who believes we ought to impede the use of the Internet in any way with punitive taxes. I believe that if there are punitive or discriminatory taxes that would impede the ability of the Internet to serve this country's commerce interests, then let's stop that, let's prevent the States from doing that. I have always said to the Senator from Oregon, who has been a leader on this issue, you and I do not disagree on that score. If there are taxes imposed that are punitive, then I say, stop it. But the other question that is raised by the Senator from Arkansas is a very important question. 
Someone decides to start a store on the main street of Fargo, ND, or Little Rock, AR, and they decide to open for business. They rent a place, buy a sign and put it out front. They hire some people to work in the place, get some inventory in, and then they open the door. And they are proud; they have some flowers around for their grand opening. There they are; they are in business. Then someone walks down the street, sees their picture window, goes on in, and buys a product. 
When that person buys that product, in Little Rock or in Fargo, ND, that person is going to pay the local retail taxes that are imposed by that State. That is the way it works. That is the way it always works. 
Then we see an increase in mail-order sales. What happens with mail-order sales is that someone sends a catalog into the home. The person sitting in a home orders the same products, does not go down to a store to order but just orders it through the mail, and gets those products sold without a sales tax attached. If that State has a 6-percent sales tax, it means that catalog seller has about a 6-percent advantage over the person who has hired the employees, rented the building, and holds himself open for business on Main Street. 
The Senator from Arkansas is correct--and I think not many people know this--when the person orders from the mail-order catalog and gets the merchandise, that individual has a responsibility--in almost all the States--to pay a use tax. Most people will never do that because they do not know that requirement exists, don't have the forms to comply in any event, and would not want to fill out a set of forms for 86 cents or $1.86. So the fact is, it does not happen. 
Now, add to mail-order catalog sales the question of Internet sales. And what are the tax consequences there? What will be the impact on the Main Street businessperson who is competing with that Internet seller, competing with the mail-order seller? What will be the impact on that Main Street merchant? 
That is the question that is raised by the Senator from Arkansas. It is a very legitimate question. 
I come from the Jeffersonian wing of my political party. The Jeffersonian wing believes, as Thomas Jefferson did, that this country is made strong by broad-based economic ownership. A lot of men and women across this country are in the market system, opening up for business, with a network of small businesses doing business all across America. We ought to be mindful of how those folks on Main Street that are risking all their savings to open their businesses are treated with the tax system. If you are a real person that has a business on Main Street you are treated one way for tax purposes, but if you have a catalog firm or Internet selling operation you are treated a different way. 
The Internet Tax Freedom Act, at its roots now, as it has been changed, is an attempt to say we don't want anybody to see this Internet system as some huge peach out there that they can take a big bite out of for tax purposes in a way that is punitive and impedes or retards the growth of Internet. I agree with that. 
But the Senator from Arkansas raises another question: Do we want the Internet and/or mail-order sellers to have an advantage over the folks who open their businesses on Main Street with respect to the imposition of State and local taxes? The answer to that ought to be no. This ought to be tax neutral. The whole system ought to be tax neutral. No matter how you are selling your product, you ought not be in a circumstance where you are selling it at an advantage over the person that hired the people, found the location and is open for business on Main Street. That is the point the Senator from Arkansas is making. 
This is not a new issue, incidentally, for mail-order catalogs, but it certainly is a new issue with respect to the Internet. 
I guess it was probably 7 years ago when I was in the other body serving on the Ways and Means Committee, probably 8 years ago, and got a bill through the subcommittee on the Ways and Means Committee to do just exactly what the Senator from Arkansas is proposing. It was very controversial. It never got beyond the subcommittee. I got the subcommittee to vote it out. But then our committee got millions of post cards from across the mail-order spectrum saying that the attempt here was to increase taxes. That is not true at all. The Senator from Arkansas doesn't propose, and I would never propose, we increase taxes on transactions. That is not the case. There is no proposal here that would increase anybody's tax. 
The question here is: How do you treat different kinds of commerce in a way that is fair with respect to the imposition of State and local taxes? Some say let's treat it in this way: Have the Federal Government set itself up as the referee and create moratoriums and prohibitions and all kinds of mandates with respect to the State and local governments. I don't happen to favor that. I don't think that is the right approach. 
Others say let us find a way to be helpful to the State and local governments to do what is necessary to even this out so we don't have discriminatory taxes imposed on one kind of seller versus another kind of seller. That is what I think is addressed by the Senator from Arkansas. 
I do want to mention with respect to the larger bill that is before the Senate, this is very important. If this is done in a way that is inappropriate, in a way that we really don't understand, in a way that changes words sufficient so that we have a blizzard of litigation in all the State courts all across the country or in a way that creates safe harbors for certain kinds of people doing certain kinds of business or punitive tax treatment because competitors are not faced with the same consequences, then we will have done a disservice. 
The moratorium that is described in the legislation is a moratorium that I think is appropriate. It says let's take a time out for a few years. We will take a time out and we will evaluate where we are. We will grandfather the States that have certain kinds of taxes, but we won't impose different taxes until we understand what we are doing here. I agree with that. 
The New York Times in their editorial this morning says the Senate, which debates this bill today, should resist extending the moratorium to 5 years. I agree with that, as well. We will have Members come to the floor and say, `Gee, the moratorium is a great idea. Let's slap a moratorium on the States.' 
I support a thoughtful, sensible moratorium to give time regarding what is happening here, but a 5-year moratorium is far too long. Those who propose that with an amendment--I am sure they will; I am told they will--I hope we can defeat a 5-year moratorium. That is wholly inappropriate. 
Those are the comments I want to make in support of the effort made by the Senator from Arkansas. He does the Senate, in my judgment, a real service. As he leaves the Senate, I will miss him walking up and down the aisle telling us about his home State, but I will miss him most importantly for the causes he fights for and the aggressive, energetic manner that he fights for these important things. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses, but the prospect of winning and losing doesn't affect the kind of things he knows in his heart are right. He is as aggressive as anybody in this Senate in fighting for the things he finds important. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me just add to the comments of the Senator from Arkansas. This is a toothless argument that doesn't even wear well with age--that this is a new tax. I have heard that for 8 years. There is simply no demonstration of truth to that argument. It is demonstrably untrue. This is not a new tax. The tax already exists on that form of commerce. It is not now being paid. The Senator from Arkansas does not propose to change the fundamental question of whether that transaction is taxed or not taxed. 
So when I hear comments from friends of mine saying that this is a new tax, I say they are wrong, dead wrong and the facts demonstrate that. So I hope Senators will support the Senator from Arkansas. I think he has offered a good amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we talk about the farm crisis and whether Congress will address a farm crisis that is urgent. I just want to make this point. I watched this week, as did all Americans, this hurricane that came roaring out of the Caribbean and threatened a fair part of the southern part of this country. My heart goes out to those people, worrying about their State, their lives, their property, and everything that they have saved and built. Then a wind comes along at 100, 125, and 150 miles an hour, and wipes it away. 
There is an emergency declaration, as we always do. Whether it is floods, fires, or earthquakes, or hurricanes, Congress responds with an emergency declaration. We say: You are a victim and the rest of the country wants to help. 
A week ago, the President sent down an emergency request to this Congress dealing with the farm crisis. It wasn't a wind, it wasn't a fire, it wasn't a flood, it wasn't a hurricane or an earthquake. Family farmers in this country have been literally devastated by the abject collapse of farm prices. Grain prices have just collapsed. In my State, in 1 year net farm income collapsed 98 percent. 
Ask yourself: Could anybody on your home street or block or in your county or your city survive if their net income dropped 98 percent? The remaining income is 2 percent. These are people who milk the cows, plow and put seed into the ground, and harvest in the fall. These are people in this country who raise America's food. They take enormous risks. They turn their yard light on and with their family have hopes and dreams to make a living. 
There has been a 98 percent collapse of the net farm income in North Dakota for family farmers. Prices have collapsed. We have the worst crop disease in this century. This President is right when he says we have an urgent farm crisis and he sends down an emergency proposal to deal with this. 
Two nights ago, I drove home after a conference committee on the Appropriations Committee. In that conference meeting, on a party-line vote, the President was told: We don't care about your emergency request. We don't think it is quite that important. We are going to offer up a 4-foot rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of water, and we will suggest somehow that we have helped. 
I was sorely disappointed. More than that I was angry when I drove home that night. We meed to understand that these folks who farm America's land out there, the family farmers, don't ask for very much. All they ask is for an opportunity to make a living. When farm prices collapse and when they are hit with crop disease, it is as much a crisis for them as wind, flood, fire, or tornado. This Congress has a responsibility to help. 
There is a week and a half left in this Congress. If this Congress doesn't help, thousands and thousands and thousands of farmers and their families living on the land will lose their livelihood. 
I know the Senator from Nebraska has some information about exactly what the President has proposed and what the stakes are here, State by State, and what we are trying to do. I yield for a moment to the Senator from Nebraska for a question and some comments.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska asks an important question. I want to emphasize again that the President has sent down an emergency request. He sent down an emergency request and said what is needed in order to address the farm crisis is $7.9 billion. Now, I will say to my friend, as I indicated when I started this, when the emergency request comes--and it will--to deal with this hurricane that just hit, I am going to vote for it. Perhaps other hurricanes will hit during this season. I have voted for aid for earthquakes, floods, fires, and hurricanes; and I always will because this country has a responsibility to do that. I won't think twice about it. We don't have hurricanes in North Dakota, but when a hurricane hits in this country, count me as someone voting for the emergency request. 
FEMA and others will evaluate what is necessary, and the President will send us a supplemental emergency request. I have always voted for them and I will again. It wasn't, as I said, a fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, or hurricane that caused the crisis that required the President to send up this emergency request. It was the collapsed prices and crop disease. It was the worst crop disease of a century combined with a total collapse of prices. 
Now, why do we have some people who ought to be voting in support of this emergency request reluctant to do so? As the Senator said, it is ideology. This Congress, a couple years ago, passed something called the Freedom to Farm bill. I didn't vote for it. I didn't think it was appropriate. I don't think you will have family farmers in this country when prices drop off the cliff and you don't have an adequate safety net for them. If you don't have a price support for them to get across the price valley, farmers can't make it. The big corporate farms will get across the valley because they have the financial strength to do it. 
Some may decide that they don't care about family farmers or whether they exist. They may worship at the altar of a `free market' that doesn't exist in agriculture. They decided that we were going to cut farmers loose. Even if prices collapse after we pass this Freedom to Farm bill, they are going to refuse to budge because they have so much pride in the work they did a couple years ago that they don't want to admit it was wrong. I am not asking anybody to admit that. 
I am just saying that farm prices have collapsed. Wheat prices have dropped 57 percent since passage of the farm law. North Dakota farmers lost 98 percent of their net income in one year. The same is true through much of the Midwest in the farm belt. At this point, shouldn't Congress stop, look, and listen and say this is a crisis? Does this country want family farmers with yard lights that light up the hopes and dreams on the family farm out there in the country? Do they want family farmers in the future? They should for a lot of social and economic reasons. Then Congress has to come forward now and address this issue that the President has recommended with an emergency request. 
The Senator from Nebraska has gone through and talked about what it means to these States. I want to describe it in slightly different terms. There is not a Republican or a Democratic way to go broke. Family farmers don't care about party labels, tickets, or politics. They care about whether they are going to be able to make it through the winter? 
I talked about a young man named Wyatt the other day. He is a sophomore in school right now in Stanley, ND. He wrote a letter to me that brought tears to my eyes. He said, `My dad is a family farmer.' After he described what the family was going through, he said, `My dad can feed 180 people and he can't feed his own family.' That describes better than almost any description we can offer how productive our family farmers are. Yet, they are being wrung dry by prices that have collapsed, and they are told that even though they are all-star producers, somehow they don't matter. 
It seems to me that we must, as a Congress, address this issue, and the point is this: There are those who say let's address this issue by doing what is called increasing the AMTA payment by some 19 cents a bushel for a bushel of wheat. That is like walking up to somebody bleeding to death and holding out a Band-Aid and saying, `Aren't I wonderful? Here is a Band-Aid.' 
The people proposing it know better. They have told me in private that it will not address this problem. It won't get those farm families into the field next spring. Tens of thousands of them will be broke and forced out of business before they can get into the field next spring because this is a half-baked solution. It is, as I said, like offering a 4-foot rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of water. Let's not have half-baked solutions. Let's not pole-vault to get over the election. 
Let's pass the emergency request of the President to solve this problem. We need to help these farmers have the hope that they can get in the field next year, plant a crop, harvest it in the fall, and have some hope that perhaps prices will rebound and they will be able to continue farming in this country in the future. Either we are going to decide to solve this problem or we are not. That is what this is about. 
First of all, I respect the fact that I come from a political party that lost. I understand that. I understand winning and losing. I belong to a political party that doesn't control this Chamber. I understand that. I am perfectly willing to lose from time to time. We do. In fact, it is getting habit-forming. But I am not willing to lose quietly on this issue. 
Up until the last 2 minutes of this legislative session, I intend to be on the floor demanding that this country respond to the urgency of this matter, just as we would if it were a natural disaster. I will be demanding that we respond to the hopes and dreams of family farmers that are going to lose their family farms if we don't act. They will lose it in the next week, the next month, or the next 4 months, and they will lose it as sure as I stand here, if we come up with half-baked solutions. 
I know the Senator from Nebraska wants to add to that. Let me just say again, it is the old silk-purse-out-of-a-sow's-ear thing. We have people here resistant to doing what they know in their heart is the right thing to do because they are worried because it would look like a 180-degree turn on Freedom to Farm. Don't worry about that. Let's figure out what we can do together, all of us together. Let us do what we know in our hearts will help the farmers get into the fields next spring and have some hope that maybe they can make a decent living. If we do that, we will have done something to strengthen this country and invest in this country's future. 
Then we can then go home with pride and say to those that Thomas Jefferson described as the `best Americans,' those producing our foodstuffs on the family farms, that we have done something to assure their future and give them an opportunity. 
Our economy is doing better. Inflation is down, unemployment is down, and the deficit is almost gone. All of those numbers are good and the country feels better about the economy. We should be able to say to family farmers that we will not, in these good times, turn a blind eye to their economic plight. They matter to this country. 
I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Nebraska once again.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner. Let me just continue for 1 additional minute, and then turn the floor over to the Senator. 
I don't like having to come here and ratchet away on this issue day after day. I know some get tired of that, but this literally is about whether people will survive out on the family farm. I have used some letters to try to describe their plight. I used a letter the other day of a woman who described the two jobs she has, the two jobs her husband has, in addition to raising kids and running the farm, and all the part-time jobs her kids have. She wrote how they are just flat broke, out of money and with no capability of making it. The price of hogs is down. The price of cattle is down. The price of grain has collapsed. She said to her daughter, `Let us try to buy you one pair of new jeans for school.' And her daughter said, `No. Mom, I understand we can't afford that.' They are just out of money and about to give up hope. 
This Congress needs to intervene to do something. We need to say to our farmers, `You matter to this country.' I am not saying we should prop up some artificial economy for farms. I am saying that these farmers face monopolies in every direction they turn. They face monopolies with the grain trade. They face monopolies with the way they do business with the railroad. They face them with the cattle slaughter. They face them with the hog and sheep slaughter, and they face them with the flour millers. 
I had charts. I will not put them up again. In every area, the top three or four companies control 60, 70, and in some cases 80 percent of all of the activity. And these farmers are told, `You compete in the free market.' Then they have to compete with other countries that deeply subsidize their products. It is not a free market. It has never been free. We are the only ones who will come up with these goofy stories and tell the farmers to go to the grain markets which are stacked against them. Then when prices collapse, we tell our farmers we are not going to be there to help. This is the only country that does that. 
This country ought to decide now that it made a mistake putting the future of family farmers on a free market that doesn't exist, and we ought to correct it. This President says that we have an emergency need, and he asked for a supplemental appropriations to meet that emergency need totaling about $8 billion. 
I drove home the other night after the conference committee between the House and the Senate. That conference, on a party-line vote, said no; we are not willing to do that. I hope we are going to change that result in the next week and a half, Mr. President.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely correct. The farm bill that Congress passed said we would provide a support price equal to 85 percent of the five-year Olympic average of the average price of this grain. Then they put an artificial budget restraint on it even though they promised that formula. Once again, the big print giveth and the little print taketh away. Despite the promise, they put an artificial cap on it. That means our support prices don't work. The promise doesn't offer real help and it doesn't offer protection. 
What we have proposed--and the President and others have proposed--is to get rid of the artificial cap and to give them what the big print said they would give them and stop this taking away with the little print. That is all this proposal is about.

Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The Senator from South Dakota is, of course, correct. Emergency needs have always been anticipated and expected in the budget process. When emergency needs are requested, I am someone who will always vote to fund those emergency needs. It is not outside of the scope of what we decided to do when we decided to try to get this country's fiscal house in order. The Senator is correct about that. 
I don't understand why some continue to insist that the funding doesn't exist for this emergency need. Of course, it does. Of course, it is a need. 
Let me say to the Senator from Virginia, when I said he is here for serious business, that the implication was not that this isn't. This is the most serious business for me in this Congress. I know the Senator from Virginia is involved in defense and a range of other issues that are also very serious for this country. I very much appreciate his service and the service of the Senator from Arizona. 
The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, of course, is from a farm State, just like mine, that is suffering the same kinds of problems. It is devastating. This crisis is really devastating to not just the economy of the State but to the families who tonight will go to bed not knowing whether they are going to be able to hang on to their family farm. That is the dilemma here, and it is something we have to face.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am joined on the floor today by the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. I cannot help but mention the presentation just made by Senator Kennedy. I fully support and agree with his presentation. He talks about the agenda. What is the agenda here in the Senate? What do the leaders of this Congress feel is important for this country? 
I gave a presentation on the Senate floor one day about a young boy named Ethan, who was born with severe difficulties from cerebral palsy, for which he required intense physical therapy. And the HMO said, `No, we're going to cut off that therapy because he will not make significant progress.' Now what they defined as `insignificant progress' was the ability to walk by age 5. It was not doctors who were making that decision. It was accountants in an HMO who were saying, `Being able to walk by age 5 is insignificant.' 
So there was a matter of dollars and cents versus a young boy's health. 
That is the point the Senator from Massachusetts makes about the urgency of having an agenda on the floor of the Senate that deals with real issues that affect real people. We have a `legislative landfill' here. You know landfills. Almost all landfills are out of sight, over the hill, down the valley. You go through a big gate and don't even see it. You drive your merchandise down there that you want to dispose of, then you dump it and they cover it up. 
We have a legislative landfill here in the 105th Congress. There was tobacco legislation. It was sent out to the landfill, and covered up. Campaign finance reform also went into the legislative landfill, and was covered up. Add the Patients' Bill of Rights as another bill sent into the legislative landfill they have created, and covered it up.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me say that piece of legislation and a lot of other legislation that has been considered by the Congress, by this 105th Congress, in my judgement pales in importance to the responsibility we have to deal with the current farm crisis that exists in this country. 
Last evening, I drove home from the Capitol, and I thought about the day. When I left, I left the conference committee between the House and the Senate on agriculture appropriations. It was a conference committee in a small room. There were a lot of people. It was cramped and hot. The result of that conference committee was a party-line vote to reject a proposal by President Clinton to provide nearly $8 billion of emergency aid to deal with the farm crisis. 
Instead, the conference committee accepted the majority party's proposal of roughly $3.9 billion which almost everyone understands comes far short of what is necessary. I also thought about the news yesterday that was described in a story in the Washington Post this morning. I was thinking about it on the way home because I was thinking about the juxtaposition. It was a story about a hedge fund. This particular hedge fund apparently had liabilities upwards of $100 billion and ran into serious problems. And then the rescuers were brought together under the Federal Reserve Board's so-called official sponsorship. 
The banks were brought together, and they put together a rescue package for this group that is involved in hedging. By the way, the Fed spokesman said they are helping sponsor this rescue package not with Federal funds but from all of the lenders. The Fed felt it had to get these lenders together for a rescue package because it had a `concern about the good working of the marketplace and the large risk exposure and potential for a disruption of payments.' 
One wonders about such an organization that is involved in hedging. By definition this is a rather speculative occupation. In fact, one of the principals had been one of the top officials at the Federal Reserve Board. He went over to this hedging operation. It grows and expands, and then has liabilities up to $100 billion. I have no idea what the assets were. Then it gets in trouble. But then instead of having the marketplace assess its future, the Federal Reserve Board apparently brings together the lenders and says, `Well, gosh, you're too big to fail.' 
If you apparently work in these environs, have these contacts, and are involved in this kind of risk, you are too big to fail. But what if you are one of those family farms out there that has seen what has happened to their wheat price. The price of wheat has been going down, down, down, down. These family farmers are told, `You're too small to matter.' What is the difference between those who are too big to fail and those who are too small to matter? 
I guess it is economic clout in the form of sheer raw economic power. 
I would hope that we would have the opportunity to decide in this Congress that family farmers ought not be failing in this country either. The fact is this country will lose something very important to its future if we decide that family farmers do not matter. Right now they are suffering through a crisis that is very significant and one that we must address. 
The question is whether we will address it in a kind of a puny, cheap way that does not solve it? Will Congress do just enough to pull us through the election for a month or two? Or is Congress going to address it and say, `Farmers, we're on your side. You matter to this country. We're going to do something significant to help you get in the field next spring, help you harvest next fall, and give you some hope that maybe you can make a decent living"? 
Mr. President, I notice that a couple of my colleagues perhaps want to propound a unanimous consent request. And I will be happy to yield the floor briefly provided that I retain my right to the floor and provided it is not going to take 15 or 20 minutes. 
If they intend to propound a unanimous consent request that is very brief, I am happy to interrupt my presentation and allow them to do that so they don't have to wait.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Iowa wishes to join in this discussion, and I am happy to have his input. 
I was driving home last evening after the Agriculture appropriations conference committee, and I was once again struck by how some in politics here just sort of shrug off some things that are so important. I am referring especially to the future of family farming. It is true that almost every day you see something around here in which someone treats the important things too lightly and then someone treats the light things in a far too serious way. It is hard to see that things are treated appropriately. 
There is no more urgent need in this country, in my judgment, than to address the farm crisis at this time. If we do not act on a timely basis, we will not have family farmers left in the Farm Belt given their current circumstances. 
Again, this chart shows the price of wheat. This is the income our farmers receive for their production. In 1 year in North Dakota, our farmers lost 98 percent of all their net income. It was just washed away. Their net income was virtually all gone. It was a 98 percent drop in their paycheck. Think of it this way: What if this were your salary or your wage? Look at what has happened, month after month after month after month. This is the gross returns that our farmers receive. The price of wheat in our part of the country is down, down, down, way down. In fact, the price of wheat has fallen 57 percent since the Freedom to Farm law was passed. 
These families are out there living on the land, turning the yard light on, illuminating the dreams and hopes of a family that is trying to make a go of it. They are discovering they are going broke in record numbers and nobody seems to care much because we have people that chant on street corners in Washington, DC, `the marketplace, the marketplace, the free market.' 
There is no free market. What a bunch of unmitigated baloney. This is no free market. There has never been a free market in agriculture, and there will not be one. 
This is picture of a farmer that is being sold out. This is an auction sale. All his equipment is being sold. These farmers go broke and they have an auction sale. They are told, gee, you didn't make it in the free market. 
Let's examine this free market. This farmer plants some wheat in the spring and harvests it in the fall, if the farmer has some good luck. If it doesn't rain too much, and if it rains enough; if the insects don't come and if the crop disease doesn't come; if it doesn't hail; if all those things don't occur or do occur, this farmer may or may not get a crop. And then this farmer puts that crop, after a hard day's harvest, into a truck and puts it on a county road and goes to market. He pulls up to an elevator and the elevator manager says, `You can dump that grain in my country elevator.' Guess what it costs a farmer to produce that crop? It costs five dollars a bushel to produce that bushel of wheat, and the elevator man says he is prepared to give the farmer $2.50. In other words, he is prepared to give only half of what it costs the farmer to raise it. 
The elevator man says, `What I want to do is to put that grain on the railroad car and the railroad company will charge you twice what it is worth to haul it, and they will haul to the miller who will make a record profit grinding it, and they will send it perhaps to a grocery manufacturer and they will puff it and pop it and crisp it and flake it and they will put it in a bright colored box.' 
Then they are going to ship it to the grocery store shelf and somebody out there is going to come and buy it in Pittsburgh, or Fargo, or Los Angeles. These consumers are going to pay $4 a box for a bright-colored box of wheat that is puffed up and called puffed wheat now. The person who put the puff in it is making record profits, the person who hauled it on the railroad car is making record profits, and the miller is making record profits. Everybody is making record profits, except the farmers who got their hands dirty, gassed up the tractor, plowed the ground, seeded and fertilized the ground, harvested the crop, and hauled it to market. They are going broke in record numbers. Yet, nobody seems to care a bit. 
Last night, in that conference committee, they were stone deaf to a proposal by this President who said we need $8 billion in emergency aid, and we need it now if we are going to solve this farm crisis. They rejected that on a straight party-line vote. It is not that there is not enough money. They think they have enough to give an $80 billion tax cut. The sky is the limit there. But how about another $4 billion for family farmers? That is what we were talking about last night. We were asking just another $4 billion more to save family farmers. They have $80 billion for a tax cut, but they don't have another $4 billion to invest in the lives of these people, who I think are the salt of the Earth. Family farmers are the ultimate risk-takers. 
Let me mention one more point about this free market. I talked about the monopoly railroads that haul the grain and the monopoly grain trade firms. Wherever you look, in every direction our farmers face a monopoly. It doesn't matter which way they turn. Let's say we have a cow out here. They are raising wheat, corn, soybeans, and they are raising some cows. They are going to send the cow to market. But are they going to make money off that cow? I don't think so, because that cow is going to be sold into a monopoly. Four firms control over 80 percent of all the slaughter of beef cattle in this country. That farmer markets up to a monopoly. That farmer moves the grain to a monopoly railroad and markets into a monopoly grain trade. 
Then we have these half-baked economists who talk about the free market. Harry Truman used to say, `Give me a one-armed economist. I'm sick and tired hearing `on this hand' and `on the other hand.' I am not sure how many economists we have around here talking about the free market. Maybe we ought to put a robot out on the street corner and let him chant, `There is no free market here.' 
In every direction, the farmer is getting fleeced. This Congress, for a change, needs to say we are going to be on the side of the ultimate producers in this country, who are the economic all-stars in this country. If we don't, we won't have any family farmers left. 
I had a young boy named Wyatt write to me. He is a sophomore at a school in Stanley, ND. The other day in a letter to me, he said, `I am a 15-year-old farm boy. My dad can feed 180 people, but he can't feed his own family.' That says something about family farming. It says how productive they are, how important they are, how incredible they are as producers, and what they have to face in a market controlled by economic giants that pillage and prey on these family farmers every day and in every way. And, they do it in such a way that family farmers can't make a living. 
This Government and this Congress, has to decide whether we are going to stand up for these people or not. We are going to force another vote on the floor of the Senate. We have had two votes to get a decent support price, and we lost by a handful each time. But for those who don't want to vote on this, I say: Brace yourself, because you are going to have to vote again. We are not going to quit. Family farmers would not expect us to quit. They don't quit and we are not going to quit them. We are going to vote on this again until we get a result that says this Congress stands with family farmers and that this Congress cares about the future of farm families. 
I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa, if he has a question.

Mr. DORGAN. No, no. This is about corporate profits, not about advantages to consumers at the disadvantage of farmers. What is taken out of the hide of family farmers in collapsed prices doesn't go into the pockets of consumers through cheaper bread prices. Take a look at the price of a loaf of bread when the price of wheat peaked about 2 1/2 years ago. Then go to your grocery store and look at the price of a loaf of bread today. Ask yourself, gee, if farmers suffered a nearly 60-percent drop in the price for wheat, what happened to the price of a loaf of bread? The answer is that somebody in between is taking more profit. But the consumer hasn't gotten the benefit. This country always had a cheap food policy. Will it have a policy that protects the basic income requirements of family farmers?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. He and I and others from the farm belt feel very strongly about this issue because it is not just some cerebral discussion about economic theory. It is about thousands and thousands of people who have had dreams and hopes of continuing to operate their family farm and raising their family out in the country and tilling the soil and producing food. It is about whether they are going to be able to continue to do that. This isn't a bluff nor is this crying wolf. 
What has happened in my State is the complete collapse of grain prices coupled with the worst crop disease in a century. It has just put thousands of family farmers in a position where they are not going to be able to continue to farm. 
I would like to read just a couple of letters. This one is from a young man named Eric. He graduated from high school 10 years ago. He is a farmer. His family and his wife's family were farmers. Eric wrote to me and he said, `When I started out, I knew it wasn't going to be easy. The only support either family, mine or my wife's, was able to afford was advice and hard work.' They could not afford more support than that. 
He goes on to say, `In our area we have been hit with heavy rains the past 5 years which has greatly reduced the yield of our crops, and caused crop disease. One of those years we had to burn the crop off of the fields so it would be able to dry enough to farm the following year.' That, he said, was like `burning dreams.' 
He is raising cattle, crops, hogs. He writes, `As of this fall we decided that we would have to reduce the number of acres we farm. I am watching my hopes and dreams fade away as I reduce these acres. Yet, I work 16 plus hours a day to try to keep the farm going again for another year.' 
He adds, `My wife works about 55 hours a week just to try to pay household bills. She works off the farm and then comes home and does the farm work as well. At one time I had hopes of being able to pass this farm down to the next generation. Now the only hope I have is that we can just continue.' 
This is a letter I received the other day from Barbara. Barbara says, `I have been married for 19 years. I have two sons. It was our dream, my dream and my husband's that one day this farm of ours would belong to our boys.' 
Then she describes the way they have tried to make ends meet and can't. `My husband not only farms, he works out in the winter and finds as many part-time jobs in the summer as he can to help supplement our income. We raise hogs to help supplement the farming also. I work in the county school system during the school year. I am a cook in the elementary school. I also drive a bus some evenings after working in the cafeteria. I also work as part-time help in our local hospital and dental office. I'm an emergency medical technician and, my husband is a firefighter with the local fire district.' 
She writes, `Our oldest son is 17 and works part-time during the school year and this past summer went on part of a run with a custom harvesting crew to make some money. Our youngest son has a job mowing cemeteries for our local church and helps on the farm. He is 15.' 
`As you can see we have full schedules which don't allow us much in the form of extra cash or time for vacation or leisure. The part I can't understand,' Barbara writes, `is why after working 17 or 18 hours a day we can't make enough to live on. My husband went to the elevator yesterday to haul in some wheat to pay our expenses for the coming month. He was told he would get $1.82 a bushel for the wheat.' 
By the way, she doesn't write this, but USDA says it costs them at least $4.75 a bushel to raise that. Her husband goes to the elevator and is told that he will be paid $1.82 a bushel. `You tell me,' she writes, `how we are supposed to pay our bills with these prices? 
She said, `A couple of weeks ago, our youngest son came to me and he asked if he could talk to me. I said yes. And he asked if we would be mad at him if he chose not to farm after he finished school. He didn't want his dad or grandfather to be upset with him. He has seen how much work it is and how little the family is getting out of it, but still feels the love of the land and pride in continuing another generation of farmers.' 
This young boy asks if they would be angry if he doesn't try it. She says, `I have come to fear that my generation is the last, if we survive. It's hard to tell your children that you really wish they would not come back to farming because there's no future there for them.' 
Mr. President, these are two letters from Eric and Barbara, a farmer and farm wife, both struggling out there, trying to make a living with collapsed prices and crop disease and a farm crisis that gives these folks depression-era prices for their crops. 
What makes me so angry about all this is in thinking about it in driving home last night after the conference committee. What makes me so angry is there is this kind of blithe attitude about it here. It is an attitude that dismisses this crisis and says: Well, this is just another day; this is just another problem; this is just another group of Americans who want something. 
These people don't want anything special. But they don't want to be turned loose in a circumstance where they are told you compete in a free market and the market isn't free. Everything that they do in this economic system means that someone is preying upon them, and that someone is taking money out of their pockets unfairly. Then the Congress somehow says we don't have the time to help; we don't have the resources to help; you are too small to matter; all we care about are those who are too big to fail. 
And as I said when I started, I drove home last night thinking about the story I read about a $100 billion liability outfit that gets in trouble and the Federal Reserve Board apparently convenes a meeting of bankers. They get a bunch of aspirin together and fluff up the pillows and say, `Gee, can't we make you comfortable. We sure wouldn't want you to fail. You are too big to fail.' They got 20-some banks in that circumstance. I guess we got other hedge funds out there and a whole series of speculators as well. 
But what about these folks? What about the folks who Congress says are too small to matter. These are the folks who day after day are holding auction sales, standing around watching their farm implements and watching their personal possessions being auctioned off because they can't make a living. It is not because they are not good at what they do. They are the best in the world. There is nobody in the world who measures up. Nobody. Not even close. Yet this economic system is stacked against them, stacked against them in a way that is almost criminal. 
You know what we ought to do? 
These folks face a railroad that hauls their grain and charges them double the price they ought to be charged, and they market that grain up through a grain trade in which there are just a few companies. That is not free enterprise. And then they send their cattle up where you have four companies controlling over 80 percent of the slaughter. 
You know what we ought to do? We ought to put an independent counsel on all those issues. How about an independent counsel investigating the marketing of cattle, and looking into the four companies that control the slaughter of over 80 percent of the cattle in this country. 
How about an independent counsel tracking down railroad prices on behalf of family farmers to see if they are fair? How about an independent counsel looking at the grain trade to see whether this is truly a fair market? 
I could go on at great length about that. What about an investigation on behalf of these folks that says to them we are intending that you have a fair deal, and that you have a fair opportunity to make a living. And, if you don't, we are going to help. That is part of what yesterday was about. It is part of what last night's conference committee was about when, unfortunately, on a party-line vote the folks in that committee said, no, we can't afford it; we don't have any money. 
The President says, I need $8 billion in emergency aid to deal with the farm crisis. The same people who said we have $80 billion to provide a new tax cut said we don't have $8 billion above the current budget level to meet the President's request to deal with the farm crisis. 
I am telling you, that is a misplaced sense of priorities. We have had two votes in the Senate on this issue of providing a decent support price. When I say `decent,' this is very modest. It is much more modest than I think is necessary. But even at that, we lost each of those votes by a handful. 
I say to those who were in the conference committee last night, who voted against standing up for family farmers, you are going to vote again. One way or the other, you are going to vote again in the U.S. Senate, and the vote is going to be on this question: Are you willing to stand up and support family farming in times of crisis? When prices collapse and you have this price valley, and those family farms simply fall through the cracks, are you willing to stand and say, `Let us build a bridge across that valley,' or do you say that family farmers don't matter? 
Are you willing to say that it doesn't matter that corporate agrifactories will farm America from California to Maine? Will big corporate agrifactories get up in the morning, put on their Big Ben coveralls and milk 3,500 cows at one lick, because that is corporate agrifactories? Or will they plow their tractors as far as they can go on a tank of gas and then turn around and plow back? Do you think it will benefit this country to turn out all the farm yard lights in the country and say to these families, `You don't matter; we will replace you with a big agrifactory'? This country will have lost something very important and it will have done so because this Congress said that they don't matter. If they do that, this Congress will have to answer to a lot of the American people about their sense of priorities. 
This has become a legislative landfill in recent months. I can go down on two hands the list of important things we should have done that have been taken out in the country and covered over with dirt, because we have too many people in here saying, `No, you can't do the important issues; we have to track around chasing the tail of unimportant issues.' 
This is one issue that a number of us from farm country are not going to let be sent out to some legislative landfill and be covered up. One way or another, we are going to push and fight and scrap on behalf of those families who still have their hopes and dreams to make a living as family farmers. We are going to push and fight to the end to get a decent, kinder program out of this country that will say to family farmers in this country, `You matter; you matter to this country and its future.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. We have been talking about financial modernization. It seems to me the farm crisis is more important than that. That is ahead of us. The Internet tax freedom bill, it seems to me the farm crisis is more important than that. We apparently are going to take that up. 
I mentioned when I began this discussion the juxtaposition of a hedge fund nearly going broke on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Board getting so concerned that they convened the bankers and said, `Gee, can't we help those people; prop up their pillow, help them get back to bed, give them a nap and get them some strength again?' 
And it is interesting to me that, in fact, the Fed even signaled when that was going on, they were going to reduce interest rates. So today, lo and behold, they lowered interest rates. It is the `too big to fail' thing. 
It reminded me of what Will Rogers once said. He said, `You know, if one day all the lawyers on Wall Street failed to show up for work, wouldn't anybody miss lunch. But if all the cows in America failed to show up to the barn to get milked, then we would have a problem.' What Will Rogers was trying to say in a humorous way is `What really matters in this country is what we produce.' And there is no more all-star producer in America than the family farmer. 
Yet this country has an economic system that says to them, `There's no connection between effort and reward. You make the effort. You go broke.' And that is what is wrong with this system. This farm bill of ours does not work. Everybody ought to now be willing to confess that and decide that this farm bill does not work and we want to save family farmers. Let us join together in a bipartisan way to make something happen that really will work to save family farmers.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the subject about which my colleague from Texas just spoke and the subject addressed by a couple of my colleagues earlier today, the question of a proposed tax cut, is one that I think will engender a great deal of debate in the coming weeks, not with respect to the question of whether the American people could use a tax cut or deserve a tax cut, not about whose money it is. The issue, instead, is going to be, that there is an election 5 weeks from tomorrow. 
On Saturday of this past weekend, the House of Representatives passed an $80 billion tax cut. And the discussion by many, including those on the other side of the aisle, and by those on the other side of the Capitol, is about what to do with the so-called `surplus.' 
I want to make the point again, as I have made before, that there is not at this point a budget surplus, evidenced by the fact that even though there are those who say there is a budget surplus, the Federal debt will increase this year to next year, and next year to the year after. 
Now, why would the Federal debt be increasing if there is a surplus? The answer is, the Federal debt is increasing because there is not a surplus. What is called a surplus, in fact, is the Social Security dedicated funds that are to go into a `trust' fund to be used on behalf of future generations. 
This chart shows that what is called a surplus can only be called a surplus if you take these Social Security funds and put them over here. Take the Social Security moneys away, and you don't have a surplus in the 5-year budget window. Instead, you are short $130 billion. The point is that, without using the Social Security revenues in the trust fund, there is no surplus. 
Now, there have been two arguments made in the last days about this subject. One is we are not using Social Security trust funds; the second is that we are only using 10 percent of the surplus. Those arguments don't mean very much to me. These numbers do not lie. 
The Federal debt will increase. To those who argue for this tax cut by saying that there is a surplus, I would simply point to the following fact: the Federal debt will continue to increase because there is no surplus. 
We have made enormous progress in tackling this Federal budget deficit. Most people would not have predicted we would have been this successful. And we have very nearly balanced the Federal budget, but not quite. We will have truly and honestly balanced the Federal budget when you can call it `in balance' without using the Social Security trust funds, and that is not now the case. 
If we here in the Senate debate using Social Security trust funds for this tax cut, we should be honest and call it theft. It will be a theft; yes, theft. It will be a theft to use the trust funds to give a tax cut. If that debate exists, I will offer an amendment to take the word `trust' out of the trust fund. Why call it a trust fund if people reach in and grab the money and use it for something else? 
I happen to believe that most of the recommendations on tax changes are recommendations that I support: Eliminating or substantially reducing the marriage tax penalty makes good sense; full deductibility for health insurance for sole proprietorship, and I've supported that for years. I can go down the list. All of them, or almost all of them, make good sense. 
But none of them make good sense if they are paid for with Social Security trust funds, the funds that were taken from American workers' paychecks and pledged to go into a trust fund to be used for only one dedicated purpose. 
What the supporters of this tax cut are saying is, let us use those funds now, 5 weeks from election day, so we can tell the American people we gave them an $80 billion tax cut in the coming 5 years. I believe that those who support it should have to say, we took $80 billion out of the Social Security trust funds. We took that money despite the fact we told you we were going to save it for your future. We took it and we used it for something else. 
That is not honest budgeting. Try to do that in a business, try to claim in a business that you have now reached a break-even stage, or you are even seeing profits in your business because you have been able to take your employees' retirement funds and show them as part of your business profit, you would get sent off to 5 years of hard tennis at some minimum security prison someplace. That is against the law. You can't do that. That is stealing from the funds. You can't do that. And you ought not be able to do it in Congress. 
One thing the American people ought to be able to rely on is that when taxpayers put money into trust funds that comes straight from their paychecks, and which we promise is going to stay in this trust fund to be used for their future, we ought not allow this money to be used, 5 weeks from an election day, so that the majority party can brag to the American people that they handed out a tax cut. 
If they do that, and if they brag about it, I want them to brag with full disclosure. Let's see if they will brag about taking money out of the Social Security trust funds. That would be theft in any other avenue of public or private life, and it ought to be theft here as we describe it. 
This will consume a fair amount of debate in the coming couple weeks of the closing days of this Congress. I would like to see a tax cut. I support most of the provisions of the tax cut that was debated this weekend, but I will not ever support a proposition that says take the trust funds from the Social Security accounts and use those to give a tax cut 5 weeks before the election. 
That is not good government, not good politics, not good for this country's future. I hope in the next 10 or so days of legislative activity those of us who feel that way will band together and say to this majority that appears determined to want to do this that we will not let them. When this country has truly balanced its budget, when we have finished the job--and we have come a long way and made a great deal of progress on fiscal policy--then, and only then, is it time to talk about the kind of tax cuts that are being discussed. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make some comments on three items that are left on the Senate's agenda that I am very concerned about. The Senate is going to continue, for apparently 2 additional weeks, and try to adjourn for the year and finish the 105th Congress on October 9th or October 10th. In the 2 short weeks that remain, I am told that we will consider H.R. 10, the financial modernization bill, fast-track trade authority for new trade treaties, and a substantial tax cut. 
I want to describe how easy it is, with a small amount of time left, to make big mistakes. I am mindful there will be much disagreement about these three items. And I am also mindful back in my hometown one of the older fellas who was the wise sage said, `It's hard to tell the difference between the open minded and the empty headed. They dress alike.' 
Let me describe these three issues and tell you what I think is empty headed about the attempt to try to pass these three pieces of legislation in the final 2 weeks of a legislative session.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me add my words of admiration for the work done by Senator Ford. He has been an important part of the Senate for many years and has done some very important things for his country and the Senate will miss very much the service that he has offered. He is in the leadership, has been for many years on the Democratic side of the aisle. But he is fiercely independent. He is smart. He is tough, and he has all the qualities that you look for in a good legislator. He will, in my judgment, for many, many years be remembered as one of the really outstanding legislators in this body, and I feel very fortunate to have been able to serve with him. I just wanted to add those words to the words offered by the Senator from Arizona.

Mr. DORGAN. I have indicated that I will offer two amendments to this piece of legislation. This would be the first. I intend, however, not to seek a vote on this amendment. I intend to ask unanimous consent that it be withdrawn. I am offering it for this reason. This legislation provides tax credits under certain circumstances. I recognize that it would cause a blue slip on this bill because this tax legislation must originate in the House of Representatives. I do not intend or want to cause that kind of problem for this bill, but I believe very strongly that this amendment is part of the solution to a very large problem we have, and I introduce it today for the purpose of describing to my colleagues an approach that I would intend to offer to some future tax legislation that will be considered by the Senate and the House. 
Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee--excuse me, chairman of the full committee--I have demoted him--the chairman of the full committee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Ford, have brought a bill to the floor of the Senate that is very important.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I was saying, the amendment that I have offered to the FAA bill is an amendment that is very important to the country and especially to my region of the country. Just before I yielded the floor, I was talking about the leadership of Senator McCain and Senator Ford. I think they have both done a wonderful job with this piece of legislation. It is an important piece of legislation for the country's sake, and it now appears that we will get this through the Senate and probably be completed with the legislation today, and that will be in no small measure due to their tenacity and their skill at crafting and moving this piece of legislation. 
Let me describe what I intend to do with this amendment, and I will not talk about the second amendment which I intend to offer later today and hope that that will be approved by the Senate. 
In late August, Northwest Airlines had a pilot strike and therefore a shutdown of their airline service. That might not have meant much to some. In some airports, I assume Northwest was one of a number of carriers that was serving certain airports and serving passengers. But in North Dakota, the State which I represent, Northwest Airlines was the only airline providing jet service to my State. That is a very different picture than the last time we had an airline strike, which was over 25 years ago. 
Nearly a quarter of a century ago when Northwest had another strike and a shutdown prior to deregulation of the airlines, we had five different airline companies flying jets into the State of North Dakota--five different jet carriers in North Dakota. And then we had folks in Congress saying, you know what we really need to do to foster competition? We need to deregulate the airline industry. And so we deregulated the airline industry. I wasn't here at the time. But we deregulated them and we went from five jet carriers in North Dakota to one. 
So I am thinking to myself, all those folks who are choking on the word `competition,' we need to deregulate so we stimulate more competition, where are they now so they can really choke on the word `competition'? We have much less competition in airlines today, much less competition with a couple of exceptions. 
If you live in Chicago and you are flying to New York or Los Angeles, God bless you, because you are going to have a lot of carriers to choose from and you are going to find very inexpensive ticket prices, and you can make a choice of carriers and ticket prices that are very attractive to you. You live in a city with millions and millions of people and you want to fly to another city with millions and millions of people. Guess what. This is not an awfully big deal for you; more choices and low fares. But you get beyond those cities and ask how has this 
airline deregulation affected other Americans, and what you will find is less selection, fewer choices, and higher prices. 
North Dakota is just one example, but the most striking example--one airline with jet service. And on that night at midnight, when the strike was called and the airline shut down, just like that, an entire State lost all of its jet service. 
What does that mean to a State? It begins to choke the economy very quickly. People can't move in and out. North Dakota is a sparsely populated State, 640,000 people. Up in the northern tier, we are 10 times the size of Massachusetts in land mass--big State, 640,000 people, and one airline serving with jets. 
Now, I happen to think Northwest is a good carrier. I believe the same about all the major carriers. Most of them are well-run, good companies; they went through tough times, now are doing better, and I admire them. 
What I do not admire is what they have done--retreating into regional monopolies in this country, retreating into hub and spoke so that they control the hub. 
You go to any big area in this country and take a look at what they do. 
The major carriers have retreated so that they now, one company, will control 60 or 70 or 80 percent of all the gates at that airport. They control that hub. Do you think anybody is going to come in and take them on, anybody is going to come in and compete aggressively and say, `Boy, this is a free market; we are going to go into your hub and we are going to compete against you?' This is not happening. They cut the pie, created the slices, retreated into their little slices, and there is no competition. We now have regional monopolies without any regulation. 
What sense does that make, to have monopolies without regulation? The minute I say `regulation,' we have people here having apoplectic seizures on the floor of the Senate. Oh, Lord, we should talk about regulation? I am not standing here today talking about regulation because I want to reregulate the airlines. All I want to do is see if we can provide some sort of industrial-strength vitamin B-12 shot right in the rump of those airlines to see if we cannot get them competing again. How do we do that? We do it by creating the conditions that require competition. This amendment is one. 
Let us assume there is somebody out there who says, `You know what I would like to do, I would like to run an airline. I have the money, I have the energy, I have the time, I have the skill. I want to create a regional airline, and I want to fly in an area where nobody else is flying a jet, and I want to haul people to a major hub.' 
They create their airline and fly to a major hub and they drop somebody off. And guess what. That somebody in most cases is going beyond that hub. 
Let me give an example, of Bismarck going to Denver, which is a major hub. For 35 years, we had jet service with Frontier Airlines and then Continental, from Bismarck, ND, to Denver, a major hub. Now we do not. So a new company comes in and says, `I will connect Bismarck to Denver, a major hub.' But about 70 percent of the people leaving Bismarck are not going to just Denver, they are going beyond, to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix--you name it. 
So this airline carrier starts up and hauls the Bismarck passengers to Denver and opens the door of the airplane, and they disembark on a sunny Denver day and discover they cannot go anywhere else, because if they walk over to United or another carrier, they don't have the opportunity to get a joint fare ticket. They charge them an arm and a leg. In fact, they even have trouble getting their baggage moved from one airline to another, because the big airlines do not want competition. They have their hub, they don't want anybody messing with it, and they certainly do not want these upstart regional airlines springing up, hauling people into their hub. 
So what you have is a circumstance where there is deregulation of the airlines, and the major carriers have merged. There has been all this romance going on; they decided they like each other a lot. Pretty soon they are going to get married. They merge up, two airlines become one, and now we have five or six large airlines in this country because they like each other so much, and they have retreated into these regional monopolies because they don't want to compete with each other. They create their own hub and they create their own spokes and they say to those who want to start up, `We are sorry but we are not interested.' 
Having said all that, and that is a mouthful, and having said I admire the majors--most of them are good carriers and they have good management and they do what they do in their interest--there is their interest and then there is a parallel and sometimes not parallel public interest. In some cases it is not a parallel public interest, as the case where we have areas that used to be served and are now not served but could be served by a new carrier if only the majors would cooperate with those new carriers. 
In order to encourage new startup regional jet service, I am proposing a 10 percent investment tax credit for regional jet purchases. That is, those startup companies that want to begin regional jet service to fly these new regional jets between certain cities and hubs that are not now served with regional jet service, we would say to them that we will help with a 10 percent investment tax credit on the purchase or lease of those regional jets. We will help because we want to provide incentives for the establishment of regional jet service once again in our country. 
My legislation would require that they serve those markets for a minimum of 5 years. We have defined exactly what those underserved markets are. It is targeted, it makes good sense, and will stimulate investment in an activity that this country very much needs and an activity that the so-called free market now does not accommodate, because the free market is clogged. There is kind of an airline cholesterol here that clogs up the arteries, and they say, `This is the way we work, these are our hubs, these are our spokes, and you cannot mess with them.' 
My legislation simply says we would like to encourage areas that no longer have jet service but could support it. We would like to encourage companies that decide they want to come in and 
serve there to be able to purchase the regional jets and be able to initiate that kind of service. 
My legislation has a second provision which reduces the airline ticket tax for certain qualified flights in rural America. This proposal also has a revenue offset so it would not be a net loser for the Federal budget. 
Having described all that, the second amendment I am going to offer also addresses this in a different way. My hope is we could work to get that accepted. We have been working hard with a number of Members of the Senate to see if we cannot get that accepted. 
I just want to make two more points. 
We are not in a situation in rural areas of this country where we can just sit back and say what is going to happen to us is going to happen to us and there is nothing we can do about it. There are some, I suppose, who sit around and wring their hands and gnash their teeth and fret and sweat and say, `I really cannot alter things very much, this is the way it is.' 
The way it is is not satisfactory to the people of my State. It is not satisfactory to have only one jet carrier serving our entire State. Our State's transportation services and airline service, especially jet airline service, is an essential transportation service. It ought not be held hostage by labor problems or other problems of one jet carrier. We must have competition. If all of those in this Chamber who mean what they say when they talk about competition will weigh in here and say, `Let's stand for competition, let's stand for the free market, let's try to help new starts, let's breed opportunities for broader based economic ownership and more competition in the airline industry,' then I think we will have done something important and useful and good for States like mine and for many other rural States in this country. 
Mr. President, as I indicated when I started, I will offer my second amendment later this afternoon, which I hope will be accepted, because the amendment I have just described and offered has a blue slip attached to it in the sense it would be objected to, because a revenue measure must begin in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives--and I used to serve in the House and used to serve on the Ways and Means Committee, and we were fierce in our determination to make certain that committee always had original jurisdiction on those issues. I am willing to say I understand that. But I wanted my colleagues to be able to review this amendment in the Record, because if and when there is a piece of legislation dealing with tax issues later this year, it is my intention to see that this becomes part of that discussion. 
With that, I ask unanimous consent my amendment be withdrawn.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to conference, I think, this afternoon or tomorrow on the agriculture appropriations bill. I want to make some comments so that those in this Chamber who believe what some are proposing to go to conference with is adequate will understand it is not adequate at all. 
We have a farm crisis in our country that is as significant a crisis as we have had since perhaps the 1930s. As you know, farm prices have collapsed. The price of wheat has dropped nearly 60 percent. We have farmers facing a serious, serious problem, many of whom will not be able to continue farming next year. 
That means that yard light someplace out in the country is going out, that family farm is losing their money, their farm, their hope, their dreams. This Congress has the capability to do something about it or it has the capability to ignore it. 
We have had two votes here in the Senate to increase price supports to give family farmers some hope. Twice we have been turned back. We are going to have a third vote. I am not sure when that is going to happen. As soon as we have the opportunity to offer the emergency plan sent down by the President on Monday of this week, we are going to have another vote. We have only lost by a handful of votes. 
The future of a lot of farm families will depend on that next vote. Some have offered an alternative plan in recent days. I am told they intend to put that in the agriculture appropriations conference in the next day or so. I would say to them, it is not going to work. It is not enough. It is offering a 4-foot rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of water. `Well, thanks for the rope, but it doesn't help.' 
This Congress has to decide that it is going to help family farmers when prices collapse. If it does not build a bridge over price valleys, we will not have family farmers left. 
I have a letter from a young boy named Wyatt that I mentioned the other day on the floor of the Senate. Wyatt is 15-years old, a sophomore at Stanley High School in Stanley, ND. He comes from a family farm. Wyatt said, after a long description of the problems his family is having, `My dad is a family farmer. And my dad can feed 180 people, but he can't feed his family.' It just breaks your heart to get letters like Wyatt's, and so many others, who write to us talking about what happens to them when prices collapse. 
Our farmers in North Dakota lost 98 percent of their net farm income in 1 year. Washed away was 98 percent of their income--gone. Just have any neighborhood, any block, any community, any group of people think to themselves, `Where would I be if I lost 98 percent of my income?' I know where I would be. I bet I know where you would be. That is what farmers are facing right now in my State and all up and down the farm belt. 
People seem to think, `You know, things will be just fine. Food comes from the store. Butter comes from a carton. Milk comes from a bottle.' Things will not be just fine if this country loses its family farms and America's farmers to big agrifactories from California to Maine. I will tell you what will happen to food costs. 
The way you get good, wholesome, safe food--the best in the world, at the best possible price--is to have a network of family farmers farming this country and putting food on our tables, at a price that gives them a decent opportunity to earn a living. 
We have had this kind of economic circumstance in our country recently where I guess the farm belt is viewed as one giant economic cow. Nobody is willing to feed it, but everybody wants to milk it from every single direction. Well, the cow is about out of milk. The question for this Congress is: Are you going to step up, when you pass a farm bill that says, `Let's have farmers operate in the free market,' but then in every direction the farmer turns, there is no free market? 
Want to market some cows? Guess what? Eighty-five percent of the cattle slaughtered in this country is done by four firms--four. They will tell a family farmer what they are going to pay them. If they do not like it, tough luck. 
Want to ship your wheat on a train? Well, there is one train that comes through our State to haul that wheat. They will tell the farmer what they are going to charge them. If the farmer does not like it, tough luck. 
Let me give you a little example about what farmers face on transportation. Ship a carload of wheat from Bismarck, ND, to Minneapolis; the railroad says that is $2,300--that is what it is going to cost you to ship that wheat to Minneapolis. Ship the same wheat from Minneapolis to Chicago--about the same distance--the railroad says that is $1,000. So you ask the railroad, `Why do you double-charge North Dakota farmers?' The answer is because there is competition between Minneapolis and Chicago and there is none in North Dakota. So the railroad says, `We're able to double-charge farmers in North Dakota.' 
So send a cow to market; you face a monopoly. Take your grain to the railroad; you face a monopoly and get double-charged. Send a hog to market; the same thing. Send your grain to a flour mill; the same thing. And 50, 60, 70 percent of the milling, the slaughter, the transportation--all controlled by a couple big corporations that then tell family farmers, `Yeah, you worked hard, you plowed this soil in the spring, you planted the seed, you nurtured it, you put some chemicals on it to keep the bugs away and the weeds out, put some nitrogen in to make it grow, and then you harvested it--and, by the way, when you are done, we're going to pay you half of what it's worth and half of what it cost you to produce. And if you don't like it, tough luck.' Well, that does not work for this country. That is not the way this country's economy should be allowed to work. It is not a free market. 
So let's assume a farmer would be able to find a benevolent railroad--that is, of course, an oxymoron. Let's assume the farmer was able to market up through a cattle market that was not controlled by monopolies. Let's assume all of that worked--it does not--but let's assume it all did. The only thing left that farmer would face is a series of other countries, like Europe. The farmer then finds half of his grain, or her grain, goes overseas to a foreign market where they compete with other governments that subsidize the sale of their grain into northern African markets and other places to the tune of 10 times the United States. 
People here say to farmers, `Well, go compete in the free market.' Yes, the farmer should compete against the big grain companies, against the big chemical companies, against the big railroads, against the big packing plants, and against European countries, and against the Canadians. And if all of that were settled--if all of that were settled--those farmers would still be told, `Just compete in the free market. And here's one more piece of the free market. We've signed you up for some competition with a trade agreement that we've negotiated with Canada.' And my colleagues have heard me speak about this many times. That trade agreement says to the Canadians, `You just flood us with your grain and your cattle and your hogs. You just run them over, just bring them right on down. And we can't get our grain up, but you just keep bringing your grain down here, undercut our price.' That is the kind of trade agreement we negotiated. We send incompetent negotiators to negotiate bad agreements, and then we do not even enforce them. 
We had farmers gather at the Canadian border the other day. The Canadians are good neighbors of ours, have been for a long while, but the trade agreement with Canada is unfair and taking money right out of the pockets of our farmers. And we have trade officials who do not seem to want to do much about it. 
So every direction you turn, we have these problems that press in on our family farmers. We face the prospect of up to 20 percent of our family farmers in North Dakota not being able to plant in the next spring or the spring thereafter. You fly over my State and look out at night from a small plane, look out that window and look at those yard lights that shine down on a family trying to make a living out on the land; and then see them turn off, one by one, because public policy says to them, `You don't matter anymore. This country doesn't need you anymore.' Ask yourself whether this country is going to be a better or a weaker country when family farmers are gone. 
They are talking about bringing the endangered species bill to the floor of the Senate soon. 
I am thinking of enlisting family farmers. I know it will list birds and butterflies, frogs, and flowers. I am the first one to say I like birds, I like butterflies, and sign me up for frogs and flowers, as well. I think they are good for our environment and good to have around. 
However, another endangered species in this country is Wyatt. He is a young boy that comes from a family that will lose their farm, and there won't be another family like Wyatt's out there. There is only one family like Wyatt's. Does it matter if Wyatt and his folks and tens of thousands of others are told, `You are too small an operator, you don't matter.' 
I think this country will make a huge mistake. The reason I wanted to speak for a moment now is we are fixing--I think tomorrow--to take a pathetic little plan that has been offered that will maybe pole-vault some farmers between now and December, just over the next election, but won't do nearly enough to get those family farmers into the field next spring and give them some hope that they can get a harvest next fall. It is a pathetic little plan. It will be offered, perhaps, in the agriculture appropriations conference tomorrow, and then people will wash their hands and say, `We sure took care of that.' 
No, they won't have taken care of anything. All they will have done is nudged enough resources out of the scarce pot of money to get them from here to December, to be able to say to farmers here is a little, but it is not enough. We understand you won't make it. 
There are some of us in this Chamber who are not willing to stand for that and are not willing to let that be the last word on the fight for the family farmers' future in the 105th Congress. I don't mean to sound challenging--yes, I do, now that I think about it. Of course I do. It is unforgivable in my judgment when we have people coming to the floor of the Senate and the House and there are hundreds of millions of dollars here and billions of dollars there and they have appetites for everything and everything is important, for us to go home and decide it is not important to save family farmers. I do want to challenge that. 
In my judgment, that is a goofy set of priorities for this country. Thomas Jefferson said 200 years ago that those who live on that land and produce that food are the best Americans, the first Americans. He wasn't necessarily saying that nobody else is any good, I am sure. Thomas Jefferson believed in everyone's worth and he believed in broad-based economic ownership. Part of what makes this country so strong is the opportunities for people around the country to engage in broad-based ownership of America's economy and resources. No one represents that more than families living on the farm trying to make a decent living. 
I hope in the next 2 weeks we will have the opportunity to convince the leadership of this Congress that family farmers matter and the submission on Monday by President Clinton of an emergency plan to respond to this farm crisis is the right step for this Congress to take. If Congress does not stand for family farmers, if it fails to take the step the President has requested, if it decides that this doesn't matter somehow, then we will have made a very fatal error. 
The Senator from Kentucky stood on this floor month after month this year in very tough circumstances when we were debating the tobacco bill. He said he understood the public policy issues of tobacco, but he said I want the Congress to understand the public policy issues of family farmers out there raising tobacco, as well. Their interests need to be heard. I know he did that and I watched the passion with which he did that. He feels very strongly about the interests of those family farmers. I feel as strongly about his farmers as I do about mine and all of the farmers up and down that farm belt. 
I just want to say to those who think they will shortcut this issue and they will ram some pathetic plan home tomorrow, take a deep breath, because you are in for a heck of a fight in the coming weeks if you think that is how you will solve the problem. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will shortly offer an amendment to the FAA bill on the floor. But I could not help but listen to my colleague from Texas. I should not frame it that way, I `could not help but listen to him.' I was here and listened to him, and I couldn't help but have a desire, an urgency to respond to some of it. I shall not do that now, but reserve the time later. 
I notice he talked about the Kennedy plan. He is probably talking about the plan that is embraced by hundreds of organizations in this country, by the President, by the American Medical Association, and others who believe that health care ought to be practiced in a doctor's office or in a hospital room, not by some insurance accountant 500 miles away, and who understand the stories we have told on the floor of the Senate about a little boy had cerebral palsy whose HMO says this boy only has a 50 percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, and that is insignificant, and therefore we will not give this young boy the kind of therapy he needs. That decision was not made by a doctor. The doctor of that boy recommended therapy. That decision was made by an accountant, and had everything to do with an HMO's bottom line, not health care. That is the issue. 
The issue is, do patients have a set of rights here? Do patients, when sick, and who present themselves to a doctor and hospital, have a right to know all of their medical options? 
Or do they have a right to know only the cheapest medical option? 
Does a patient have a right to be taken to an emergency room when they have just broken their neck? I will give you an example of somebody who broke their neck, went to the emergency room, unconscious, and the HMO said, `We can't pay for that because you didn't get prior clearance.' That is health care? That is a decision a doctor would make? I do not think so. 
That is why doctors across this country, health care professionals across this country, and increasing numbers of people who have been herded into these shoots called `managed care,' 160 million of them are now saying, there needs to be some changes here. 
Health care ought to be practiced in the doctor's office, in a hospital room. I understand there is great passion about this issue. I hope this Congress will address this issue. The Senator from Texas proposes a way to address it. `We have a bill; they have a bill. We have a vote; they have a vote.' 
What about regular order? Why does the Senator from Texas propose that we not have regular order? Bring your bill to the floor--we have amendments, they have amendments--vote on the amendments one by one. How do you propose to deal with emergency care? What about the choice of specialists when you need it? What about the ability to know all of your medical options? What about the issue of bringing managed care to the floor of the Senate, a Patients' Bill of Rights--any version--and then having votes, amendment after amendment after amendment?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated when I spoke previously on this bill, I think Senator McCain and Senator Ford have done a remarkably good job on this piece of legislation, and I appreciate their work so much. And I think many involved in airline issues in this country, such as safety and so many other related issues, feel the same way. This is an important piece of legislation, and we very much appreciate their good work. I think both of them will be on the floor shortly, but I did want to offer the amendment and begin a discussion of it. 
Let me first describe why I felt a requirement to offer an amendment of this type. I offered an amendment similar to this in the Commerce Committee and lost by a vote of 11-9. It is interesting to me. I always remember the exact vote when I lose--11-9--and somehow that sticks with me, because I understand why I lost: there are people who view these issues differently. 
My concern here is about competition in the airline industry. I know about competition. I come from a town of 300 people. I grew up in that town. I was in a high school class of nine. We had one blacksmith. We had one doctor. We had one barber. We had one of almost everything. Actually, we had a couple of bars. I guess that is probably typical of a lot of small towns. But we had one of most things. I understand that. 
The fact is, most of the people who had their exclusive services that they offered in my hometown always priced their service in a very reasonable way. Go to the barber and the haircut was just very little cost. Same was true with the blacksmith. But then, as I left my small hometown in southwestern North Dakota and started studying economics and lived in some big cities and went off to graduate school and so on, I began to understand that is not always true in our economy. When you have one entity providing a service or a commodity, it is not always true that they will always price that service in the public interest. Sometimes they will price it in their interest. 
I began to understand what monopolies were. I studied economics. Actually, I taught economics for a couple years in college. And I have told people I was able to overcome that experience, nonetheless. But I understood about economic concentration, market dominance. 
Then I watched what has happened in the airline industry in the last 20 to 30 years. I understood some of the things that I had studied and learned and understood something in the field of economics relates to what we are experiencing in this country in the airline industry. 
In 1938, when the Federal Government began to regulate air transportation, there were 16 carriers--16 carriers--who accounted for virtually all of the air traffic in our country. It was a pretty primitive system back then. If you looked at those airplanes now down at the Smithsonian Institution you would say, `Gee, I'm not sure I would want to ride very far in those airplanes,' but people did. Sixteen air carriers accounted for the total traffic in our U.S. domestic market. 
By 1978, 40 years later, the year that Congress passed something called deregulation of the airlines, those same 16 carriers had reduced to 11. They were merged. A couple went out of business. So you had 11 carriers. Those 11 carriers accounted for 94 percent of all the airline business in the country. 
Today, those 11 carriers have been reduced to seven airline carriers because of mergers, a couple bankruptcies--a lot of mergers. Those seven now account for over 80 percent of all the total traffic. American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta, Northwest, United and USAir--they account for 95 percent of the total air traffic in the domestic U.S., with their cochair partners. 
Since deregulation, 1978, it was estimated that we have had about 120 new airlines appear. And then about 200 different airlines have disappeared, appeared, disappeared, merged, been purchased. But we do not have more competition after deregulation; we actually have less competition. 
Between 1979 and 1988, there were 51 airline mergers and acquisitions. Twenty of those were approved by the Department of Transportation after 1985 when it assumed all the jurisdiction over mergers and acquisition requests. In fact, the Department of Transportation approved every airline merger that was sent to it. You do not need a human being to do that. You do not need somebody that breathes and lives and eats breakfast; all you need is a big rubber stamp. If we are going to have a Department of Transportation that will say, `Gee, no merger is too big. No merger's consequence is too significant for market dominance. We'll just stamp `approve' with a big, big ink pad and a big stamp,' we don't need to pay anybody any significant amount to do that kind of Government work. Every airline merger submitted to it was approved. 
The 15 independent airlines operating at the beginning of 1986 had been merged into six megacarriers by the end of 1987. 
The father of deregulation, Alfred Kahn, testified recently at one of our hearings. He said that he had great disappointment in the industry concentration because he said it perverted the purpose of deregulation. And he pinned most of the blame on mergers and the Department of Transportation's approval of all of these mergers. 
What has happened is that these megacarriers--I will probably describe in a moment `megacarriers'--have created competition-free zones in effect, securing dominant market shares at regional hubs. 
Let me describe a couple of these. 
Atlanta: Atlanta is a big, old city. If you go down to Atlanta, Atlanta is bustling. It has an economy that is vibrant, a huge city, big airport, a lot of folks coming and going, a lot of traffic. One airline has 82 percent of all traffic in and out of the airport in Atlanta. 
Why would that be the case? A city that big, that vibrant, an economy that strong, one airline virtually dominates the hub? Why? Because that is the way the airline companies have sliced up the pie. 
Charlotte: One airline, 92 percent in and out of Charlotte. 
Cincinnati: One airline, 94 percent. 
Dallas-Fort Worth, a big city: One airline, 72 percent. 
Denver: One airline, 74 percent, 
Detroit: One airline, 82 percent. 
Well, I do not need to go through all of them, but you get the picture. This is not exactly the picture of a robust American economy in which there thrives aggressive, interesting competition, one company competing with another for the consumers' business, deciding `I'll offer a better product. I'll offer a lower price.' That is what competition is about. 
Most businesses understand competition. The airlines have constructed a series of regional hubs which have dominance for major carriers, and then they retreat from the kind of competition you would have expected. 
That is my way of describing my criticism of where we find ourselves. I would like to infuse some competition here. 
I would like to see if we can find ways to say to the major carriers, `We need more competition.' The consumer deserves more competition, the consumer deserves more choices, and the consumer deserves lower prices with respect to airlines. 
We have had plenty of studies about this issue. I come from a sparsely populated State, and deregulation has affected us in a much more detrimental way than in other parts of the country. Here are some studies--just a few--that describe deregulation and its impact on small States and rural economies: Airline Competition, Industry Operating and Marketing Practices Limit Market Entry; Trends and Air Fares at Airports in Small- and Medium-sized Communities; Fares and Competition at Small City Airports; Effects of Air Competition and Barriers to Entry. The list goes on and on, study after study. 
We don't need to study this. We know what is happening. We know what has happened. Most of us know what should happen. We should do something to help provide competition, certainly in areas that are underserved. For areas that used to have service but don't now have jet service, we ought to find some way to allow that service to exist. I have produced a piece of legislation that I think will do that. 
I mentioned that we had an airline shutdown as a result of a labor strike recently. That shutdown was very inconvenient to a lot of people, but it was much more inconvenient to my State. Just prior to deregulation, we had five airline companies flying jets in and out of my State. Now we have one. That one happened to shut down as a result of a labor strike. At 12:01 a.m. on August 30, there were no more jet flights in and out of our State. It was devastating to North Dakota, to the passengers, and to the economy. 
That kind of dominance by a carrier I admire. I think the carrier that serves our State is a wonderful carrier. It has some labor problems and other issues, but the fact is, they fly good planes and they have been serving North Dakota for many, many decades. I hope they will continue to serve many decades. I have told their president that one day there will be another carrier and some competition. Although I hope to get them some competition, I want them to stay there because they are a good airline carrier. 
But I also want to plug some holes in service that does not now exist, that should exist, and used to exist. For example, a State like North Dakota, for 35 years, had jet service connecting North Dakota to a hub in Denver, CO. After 35 years, that jet service was gone. We no longer have jet service to Denver, CO. The only way a jet service can exist between North Dakota and Denver, CO, is if you have a regional jet service that starts up and can cooperate with and have interline and other agreements with the major carrier that dominates in Denver. We had a company that started and tried to do that, but, of course, the major carrier in Denver said, `We want nothing to do with you; we don't want to do interline agreements with you.' 
So the only passengers they could haul were the passengers going from North Dakota to Denver. In fact, 70 percent of our people were going beyond Denver. They were flying North Dakota to Denver to Phoenix, to Tulsa, to Tucson, to Los Angeles, to San Francisco. That airline pulled out because they couldn't make it. The large carriers will coshare with each other, they will do all kinds of interline agreements with each other, but they don't want regional jet service to start up and flourish in these regions. 
I don't understand that. It seems to me it would benefit them to have regional jet service startups. 
However, I proposed something I hope will address this issue in the Commerce Committee that lost 11-9, as I mentioned before. I have modified that substantially now. But even with those modifications, it embodies the principles I am trying to establish: the opportunity for new regional jet service carriers to compete in a regional market by encouraging agreements between new regional jet carriers and large airlines with respect to a number of items--gates, baggage, and other issues. 
I will not read the amendment, but let me say that the current Presiding Officer, the Senator from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton, is someone who has spent a great deal of time on airline issues. I will be careful not to mischaracterize any of his views. I hope it is accurate to say that he has been someone who has felt very strongly that he does not want to move in the direction of reregulating air service. While we might disagree on some issues, I very much respect his views, and he has been very strong in asserting his views on a range of these issues. 
I have worked with Senator Gorton and others in the last few days to see if we could find agreement on a set of principles in this amendment that will accomplish the purposes and the goals that I want for my region of the country and other regions without abridging the principles that he has with respect to the consistency, deregulation, and other areas. I think we have done that. 
The amendment I have sent to the desk, I believe, is an amendment that is approved by Senator Gorton, who is the chairman of the subcommittee on the Commerce Committee that deals with these issues. I want to say to the Senator I very much appreciate his willingness to work with me to address this issue. It is more urgent than it has been in the past, because everyone understands the dilemma that we faced with this shutdown. It could happen again. We have other circumstances out there that could very well result in it happening again. I just want the Congress to send a signal that we are going to provide some workable solutions to allow regional carriers to serve areas not now served, in a way that can give them a viable opportunity to make it. That is the purpose of this amendment. 
I think I have described the amendment without spending time on a great deal of detail about the amendment itself. I have worked with Senator McCain, his staff, and Senator Ford. I recognize that doing anything in this area causes some heartburn for some people. There are some who are still not pleased because they would prefer the existing order--leave things as they are. Honestly, we can't leave things as they are. We must make some thoughtful changes here. That is what I propose to do with my amendment. 
Since the chairman of the subcommittee and Senator Ford were not here, let me again say I thank them very much for their cooperation. I am pleased we were able to work out this amendment. I hope very much they will be able to help me prevail in conference with the House on this very important amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was thinking as the Senator from Arizona talked about fares, the ultimate objective of more competition is more kinds of service and lower fares. I pointed out on the Commerce Committee--and I thought maybe I should for my colleagues on the floor--the disparity in fares. I pointed out in the Commerce Committee that we may fly from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles to go to Disneyland and see Mickey Mouse, which is all the way across the country. Or, instead, we could choose to fly to Bismarck, ND, which is half the trip, and see the world's largest cow sitting on a hill outside New Salem. If you wanted to see Salem Sue, the largest cow in the world, you would pay twice as much to go half as far than if you were to go see Mickey Mouse.

Mr. DORGAN. No; the cow is dead. Because you might be interested in going there, I will tell you that it is a big metal cow that sits on a hill. 
My point is that we have a fare structure that says you can go twice as far and pay half as much. Or, if you choose, if you want to go half as far, you get to pay twice as much. People talk about bureaucrats, and the discussion here a while ago was about bureaucrats and the HMO issue. I can't think of many Americans who could sit down and develop a rate structure that says, `You know, we are going to tell people that if they will just go farther, we will cut their ticket in half, but if they don't go as far, we will double their price,' and think that marketing strategy has any relevance at all. That has everything to do with competition. Where there isn't competition, they will price at whatever they want to price. Where there is competition, of course, prices must come down because that is the regulator in the competitive system.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, going back to the previous discussion on the Internet tax issue that the Senator from Arizona raised, I want to make a comment about both the objection raised by the minority leader, Senator Daschle, as well as the bill itself. 
The bill started out being a very controversial piece of legislation. There was great disagreement on exactly whether and how to proceed on this issue. But I must say, the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from Arizona, and others have worked with a number of us who have had reservations and concerns about the bill. I think we have made a substantial amount of progress. I expect at some point it will get to the floor of the Senate here, and I will hope to be helpful on a compromise that I think does the right thing. 
I always said if the proposition is, let us not apply punitive taxes to the Internet, I am for that. I am for a prohibition against punitive taxes on the Internet. But the way it was described initially, I have a lot of concerns about that. There have been a lot of changes made on this bill and I think the changes made a lot of progress. I compliment the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Oregon as we continue to discuss this. But I did want to mention one additional point. 
The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, was constrained to object. I know the Senator from Arizona understands well the concerns. It is not just about the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. We must also find a way to address this agricultural crisis in a satisfactory manner. If we do not, about 20 percent of the family farmers in North Dakota will not be in the field next spring. It is a devastating circumstance in the farm belt. 
So the Senator from South Dakota was saying we need somehow to protect our rights to address these key issues. I know the Senator from Arizona acknowledged that he understood that. I just wanted to point out, again, it is not anybody's intention to provide roadblocks. What we want to try to do is see if we can find avenues to address significant and real issues. 
Yes, the Internet bill will get here and I think get done at some point. But we need to protect the rights, as legislation brought is to the floor, to deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights and to deal with the agricultural crisis which is potentially so devastating to the farm belt in this country. 
I wanted to make that point clear to reinforce the comments made by Senator Daschle earlier. 
I yield the floor. I know the Senator from Oregon wishes to be recognized. 
Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Harkin is on his way. He spoke briefly on this amendment yesterday afternoon, and I would like to make a couple comments on it. This amendment is very simple. It is an amendment that expresses the sense of Congress that the Federal Reserve Board, through the Federal Open Market Committee, should reduce its Federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve Board will meet soon and consider once again what it wishes to do with monetary policy, and especially with short-term interest rates. 
I would like to show a couple of charts just to describe where we are at this point with the American economy. 
`Consumer Price Index.' As we know, the Federal Reserve Board has been chasing inflation now for, oh, 4 years or so. Every quarter they have another discussion and wring their hands and gnash their teeth and fret and worry and sweat about what is happening to inflation and when the next wave of inflation is going to hit. Of course, inflation has gone down, down, way down. 
The Federal Reserve Board told us, by the way, at the start of this, that the inflation rate would jump up almost certainly if the unemployment rate went below 6 percent. Of course, the unemployment rate has been below 6 percent for over 4 years and the inflation rate keeps coming down. The Federal Reserve Board was dead wrong on that issue. 
But the Federal Reserve Board sits in that house of theirs on a hill impenetrable by the American public, closes its doors, makes its decisions in secret about interest rates. Only, and then tells us after the decisions are made what the interest rates in this country will be. 
The Federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is much higher than it ought to be. Prior to Mr. Greenspan becoming Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, from 1950 to 1987, the average real Federal funds rate was 1.8 percent; for 37 years on average. The real Federal funds rate, the economic rent for money, adjusted for inflation, that was set by the Federal Reserve Board, was 1.8 percent. Today that short-term interest rate, after inflation, is 3.9 percent--the highest level since just before the last recession in 1990. 
One must ask the question, Why, why are the American people in effect being taxed with higher interest rates? Why is the Federal Reserve Board punishing the American people with interest rates that are higher than they should be? The answer: Because they have served their constituent interests, which are the large money center banks; they want the higher interest rates. But that moves against the interests of the American people, of the people who produce and work and borrow. 
I have brought to the floor from time to time pictures of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the presidents of the regional Fed banks, and the reason I have done that is because they control monetary policy and nobody knows who they are. So I thought we should probably have pictures of all of them, when they were appointed, where they were educated, what their background is, and how much money they make. And so here, once again, is a picture of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the regional Fed bank presidents. On a rotating basis, these regional Fed bank presidents join the board of governors, they go into a room, shut the door, and in secret determine what our interest rates are going to be in this country. 
Here is who they are. You could put them all in a barrel, shake it up, roll it downhill, and you would always have somebody with a gray suit on top. They are economists. They all come from the same background. They all pretty much look the same, and they all pretty much think the same. There is not a person among them who represents somebody who manufactures something or fixes something or sells something, but that is the way the Fed is. 
When I was a kid in a town of 300 people in southwestern North Dakota, we had a circus come to town. That circus--it was a very small circus because you do not get a big top in a town of 300 people--but that circus had an elephant. It was the first elephant I had ever seen, and the first elephant, I think, that had ever come to my hometown. The thing that interested me as a little boy is that that big old elephant would stand out there by the tent and he had a steel cuff around his foot and a chain of about 6 or 8 feet attached to a stake that was pounded into the ground. I thought to myself, how on Earth can that little stake hold that big elephant? How can that work? 
Then I was told later, when I grew up, about that elephant and that chain and that stake. They say that when they capture wild elephants in Thailand, they get a wild elephant and they put a big metal cuff around the elephant's leg, put a chain on that cuff, and then they tie the other end of that chain to a big banyan tree. And for 6 days, 10 days, 12 days, maybe 2 weeks that elephant will pull and struggle and grunt and groan and try to pull that chain away from that big banyan tree. Of course the banyan tree doesn't budge an inch. After a certain period of time, the elephant understands that the elephant cannot move. Then they take the chain off the banyan tree and just put a stake in the ground and the elephant stands there with a cuff around his leg and a chain and a small stake. The elephant is chained to his habit. His habit is he knows he cannot move. 
I was thinking about that the other day and I was thinking about the Federal Reserve Board. What a wonderful analogy, chained to his habit. You talk about a board chained to their habits, the Federal Reserve Board has been, for 4 or 5 years--despite all the evidence to the contrary in this country that the global economy is putting downward pressure on wages, that there are no new fires of inflation out there in the country, that the inflation rate is coming down even as the unemployment rate has come down. These gray-suited folks, chained to their old habits, have continued to insist, no, they must keep interest rates higher than they ought to be because they are worried about some future specter of inflation despite the fact that inflation is running in the opposite direction. 
What does that mean? What does it mean when these folks lock their doors and in secret say, `We are going to keep interest rates higher than what it ought to be'? What it means is everybody who owns a house, everybody who is paying off a credit card, anybody who has any debt at all of any type is paying higher interest rates than they ought to pay. In a number of cases it means some homeowners might be paying $100 or $200 a month more in interest than they ought to pay. Somebody is just taking it out of their pocket. In effect, they have taxed them--to the detriment of the individual, to the reward of the lender. That is why I asked the question earlier: Whose interest does this Fed serve? 
Some say its constituent's interest is that of the big money center banks. It looks that way. How else would they justify interest rates that are more than 2 full percentage points above the real rate of inflation, when in fact for nearly 40 years prior to Mr. Greenspan joining the Federal Reserve Board the real interest rates above inflation set by the Board were 1.8 percent? How else would you justify that kind of massive overcharge of the American people through higher interest rates? 
The Federal funds rate is not charged to everybody. It happens to set the fee, set the charge. The prime rate comes off the Federal funds rate. Other rates come off the prime rate. The fact is, when the Federal Reserve Board decides in secret to set 
interest rates that are higher than they ought to be, then everybody else ends up paying more than they should pay. And who benefits? The big money center banks. 
It is interesting, these folks who will be in that room making the decision when the door is closed--the last dinosaur in America that makes decisions in secret, the last dinosaur that exists in our Government--when they go into a room and close that door and make decisions in secret, they will be representing--who? Who hired them? Their boards of directors. Who hires the regional Fed bank president? The regional board of directors. And who is that? The regional bankers. Whose interests are they going to look after in that room when the door is locked? They are not accountable. Their names did not come here for the Senate to say, yes, we would like to sanction you to go into a room and make decisions about monetary policy. They are not accountable to anybody. They were not confirmed by anybody. They are not accountable. Yet they go into a room with a locked door and make a secret decision with others and tell the American people what they are going to pay in interest rates. 
We have people come here and talk about taxes forever--that is a tax. A higher interest rate than ought to be paid is a tax; it is a big tax on almost all working families in this country. So who are these people going to represent? Are they going to be sent to the Open Market Committee to make decisions that contradict the interests of their boards of directors? I don't think so. Would it be logical to assume that they would come to this decisionmaking point representing the interests of those who gave them their jobs? I think so. 
The amendment to be offered by Senator Harkin and myself and a couple of others is an amendment that asks the Congress to express itself to the Federal Reserve Board. I know we have people who say, `Oh Lord, the last thing Congress ought to be involved in is monetary policy.' Why should we not be involved in making our views known to the Federal Reserve Board? Anybody who comes out here opposing this, I would like to ask them this: If for 40 years the real economic rent for money set by the Fed through Federal funds rate is 1.8 percent, if that is the rate for 40 years, how do you justify having a rate that is nearly 2 points higher, on average during the Greenspan years? How do you justify it? Do you think it is fine? If so, how do you justify taxing your constituents with the higher interest rate because the Fed decides it is going to represent their interests, not ours? 
I am not here arguing for easy money, easy credit. I am here arguing for fairness. I am here asking the Federal Reserve Board to represent the entire public interest here, not just their interest. 
Our economy, from most recent evidence, looks to be slowing down some. Our economy faces a number of international threats. We have an Asian economy that is in shreds--Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia. The difficulty in the Asian economy, a very significant difficulty, is beginning to be felt in this economy. It seems to me, when we have a Federal Reserve Board that imposes higher interest rates than are justified, much higher interest rates than we have historically had with respect to real economic rent for money, it seems to me when they do that at a time when we begin to face what appears to be some significant difficulty from external economic forces, the Fed ought to take a look at doing what it should have done long ago, and that is reduce real short-term interest rates to where they ought to be. 
I know this discussion causes a lot of people just to fog out and glaze over and go to sleep because, frankly, it is in the interests of those who make monetary policy to keep the monetary policy questions outside of the purview of public discussion. A century ago you could go to a barber shop or a bar in this country and get into an aggressive, interesting, lively discussion about interest rates. All over the country they talked about interest rates. Mr. President, 35 years ago there was going to be a one-quarter percent increase in the Federal funds rate. And the fellow who was heading the Federal Reserve Board was thinking about the one-quarter of 1 percent increase. There were front page headlines all across the country. Lyndon Johnson invited this fellow, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, McChesney Martin, invited him down to the ranch at Perdinales, in Texas, and they say almost squeezed the barbecue sauce out of that guy, he was so upset the Federal Reserve was going to increase interest rates by one-quarter of 1 percent. 
Interest rates used to be part of substantial discussion and lively interest in this country, but we now have a Federal Reserve Board, as I said, that is the last dinosaur. It wants to keep monetary policy outside the purview of normal public debate. It wants to do what it wants to do in a locked room behind a closed door, and decide to keep interest rates about 2 full percentage points above where they ought to be given the real rate of inflation in this country today. 
The Senator from Iowa will offer an amendment. The sense of the Congress at the end is very simple. It is one short sentence:  
It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal Open Market Committee should promptly reduce the Federal funds rate. 
It is very simple. That is preceded by a series of pieces of information that make the case. 
Let me finish, Mr. President. I know Senator Harkin is on his way. I know Senator Domenici is also scheduled to speak. We have a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board. There is one seat vacant. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has seven people, all appointed by the President, confirmed by the Congress. The confirmation process requires there be accountability, so that is what we have, a Presidential appointment with confirmation. 
That is not the case with regional Federal bank presidents. They serve on the Open Market Committee and make decisions, but they are not confirmed by anybody. 
We have one vacancy. I have come to the floor to say I would like my Uncle Joe to be considered. My Uncle Joe is retired. My Uncle Joe used to fix generators and alternators in his shop behind his house. He is pretty good with his hands. He knows how to fix things. My theory is, there is nobody on the Fed who has ever fixed anything or ever manufactured anything or ever been in a part of the business where one is actually involved in a consumptive use of credit to make a business work. 
For a couple of centuries, we had tensions in this country between those who produced and those who financed production, and in some decades those who produced have had an upper hand, and in some decades those who financed production have had an upper hand. With the help of the Federal Reserve Board, in most recent years those who finance production have had the upper hand. That ought not be the case. 
There is a clear and compelling case, made by Senator Harkin yesterday, and I hope by myself, that the current Federal funds rate established by the Federal Reserve Board responds to a threat that does not exist and, as a result, keeps interest rates substantially higher than they should be on a real basis. As a result of that, the Federal Reserve overtaxes every American family that pays a higher cost for credit than can now be justified. 
The Congress has every right to send a message to the Federal Reserve Board that: `When next you meet and close that door and begin deciding in secret the fate of this country's monetary policy and interest rates, we encourage you, given all the evidence, to decide to reduce interest rates.' 
Mr. President, I notice Senator Harkin has not yet arrived on the floor. Let me go down the findings briefly while we are awaiting Senator Harkin to come to the floor. 
While interest rates, we hear on the news, continue to decline, long-term mortgage rates, and so on, the inflation rate, of course, is way, way, way down. The question is the real interest rates, the economic rent for money. And also the question is, What is happening to our economy? Is it slowing down? And if so, would paying higher interest rates, as imposed by the Federal funds rate, be beneficial to this economy? 
Real interest rates are at historically high levels, the highest in 9 years--real interest rates. The Federal funds rate is 5.5 percent. It has been there since March of 1997, despite an inflation rate of 1.7 percent. Between 1992 and 1994, the Federal funds rate averaged 3.6 percent, while inflation was at 2.8 percent. 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Greenspan, said during his testimony before the House Banking and Financial Services Committee on February 24 of this year: 
Statistically, it is a fact that real interest rates are higher now than they have been on the average of post-World War II periods. 
Actually, real interest rates are higher now than they have been prior to Mr. Greenspan becoming Chairman of the Fed. Inflation over the last 2 years, preceding the date of enactment of this act, was at its lowest level since the 1960s. Corporate earnings are down 1.3 percent from a year earlier, and, as I mentioned, farm debt is at its highest level since 1985. Broad commodity price indexes are extremely low. There are signs of global depression or at least severe recession and the potential of depression in parts of the economies of Asia, and there are signs that that will negatively impact this country through fewer purchases of U.S. exports and through a greater influx of cheap imports to the United States. 
We, as a result of this resolution, want to put the Senate on record as saying to the Federal Reserve Board: `You ought to do what the evidence requires you to do; you ought to do what the American people know you should do; you ought to do what most good economists would advise you do now, even though you have not done it for sometime now; you ought to reduce the Federal funds rate to a level that is fair and fairly reflects the economic rent for money relative to the real rate of inflation.' 
The Federal Reserve Board has kept the Federal funds rate artificially high because it has worried about inflation. As I indicated in the chart, the rate of inflation has come down, down, way down, even as unemployment has come down. The Federal Reserve Board, predicting new waves of inflation at every step along the way, has been consistently wrong about this. Some say the Federal Reserve Board should be given credit for the fact it is down. The Federal Reserve Board did nothing but predict this was going to be different. It requires no credit to be wrong. 
So I ask, and I think Senator Harkin would ask, the Federal Reserve Board to do the right thing when it meets in the Federal Open Market Committee, and make the reduction in interest rates that is justifiable and is important to this country. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. By 5 minutes. That would be 11:50 a.m. I am waiting for Senator Harkin to arrive on the floor. He is the principal sponsor, along with myself, on the legislation. He wants to speak on it. I just finished speaking. I am waiting for Senator Harkin. I suspect he will want to provide some remarks, after which the Senator from New Mexico can proceed.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada talked about this audit that was done of the Fed by the GAO. What the audit showed was a $3.7 billion fund accumulated at the Federal Reserve Board--$3.7 billion. And they pointed out that the Fed has not had a loss for nearly 80 years--will never have a loss. You can't lose money when you create money. So there was no reason to have a rainy day fund or some sort of provisional fund of $3.7 billion. And the GAO recommended that it be returned to the Treasury. It belongs to the American people. 
Not only has it not been returned, the $3.7 billion has now been increased to $5.2 billion. So you have to say to somebody, if you think there is reason to get some of these resources to do something with it--pay down the Federal debt or to do some of the other issues--there is $5.2 billion down at the Fed that they have for a rainy day fund, and they never have rain down there. They create money. They make their own money. And they have never had an annual loss, and will never have a loss; and yet they have squirreled away $5.2 billion of resources. And we have raised this issue. 
The GAO--not us--the GAO says that ought to be returned. But it will not be, I assume because this Senate--Congress says, `Gee, we don't want to touch that house on the Hill that's got those big gates around it, the big fence. And it's an American dinosaur. We can't crawl in there and see what's going on.' But the GAO did a 2-year study. I would commend my colleagues to take a look at what they found in that study. 
There is plenty wrong down there. There is not good accounting. There is not good contracting. There is a rainy day fund of billions of dollars. So there is plenty of work to do with the Fed. 
I ask the Senator from Iowa, isn't it the case that all we were doing today was to say, `Gee, we think it's time for you to reduce interest rates the next time you meet, given all the evidence that exists'?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly my thoughts about the automated teller machine (ATM) fee ban amendment offered today by Senator D'Amato to the bankruptcy reform bill. 
I share the concerns that Senator D'Amato and others have about the rapid, and seemingly unchecked, increases in ATM fees across this country over the past few years. There is compelling evidence that some banks are charging exorbitant ATM charges that impose an unnecessary and unfair financial burden on bank customers. For many consumers, this happens every time they use an ATM that's not owned by their bank. And there appears to be no end in sight to this explosion in ATM fees. I do applaud the work of Senator D'Amato and others for bringing attention to this growing problem. 
But regrettably, I was forced to vote against Senator D'Amato's amendment, as drafted, because it failed to recognize that many of our rural communities have significantly higher costs for providing many kinds of services. I'm afraid that adopting Senator D'Amato's approach may actually be harmful for people living in these higher-cost areas. In my judgment, this amendment might have forced some of our banks to shut down existing ATMs in more sparsely populated areas in our state or made it too costly for them to install new ones in places where they are needed. 
Let me be clear on this point. I would have liked to support a proposal to stop those ATM owners who are charging excessive and, in some cases, outrageous fees. And I'm willing to consider other approaches to help put the brakes on ATM price gouging. Unfortunately, the amendment that Senator D'Amato offered today is one that I could not support because it may inadvertently hurt rural America. 
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I have listened to the debate; it is an interesting debate, but I think all of us know what is happening in this country with respect to credit cards. 
I noticed an article this morning in the Washington Post on the front page: 
Banks Risk New Wave of Bad Debt: Report Cites Easing of Credit Standards. 
They are talking about commercial loans in response to competition; even though the risks will rise, they are easing standards, lowering lending standards. 
What are the standards of lending for credit cards? Go to a college campus and look in the mailboxes and see the solicitations for these kids that have no jobs, no income, no independent means of paying. They get solicitations from companies halfway around the country. 
The solicitation says we have something to offer you. You don't have money? We have money. We will give you a piece of plastic, and you get a preapproved range of credit. Sign this, send it in, and it is all yours. 
It is Byzantine to me to see what is happening with the `blizzarding' of these credit cards all around the country, even to people without money. 
Yesterday in our mail, my son got a solicitation from the Diners Club. My son, Brendon, is a great young guy. In fact, do you know what Brendon told me he wanted to do when he gets big? Brendon told me he wants to be like his grandpa. 
Now, I know that doesn t sound surprising. But do you know why? It s because he wants to be retired, just like his grandpa. 
You see, Brendon went to Arizona to see his grandpa, and Brendon watched his granddaddy and thought, that's what I want to do--sleep late, get up and golf a little bit, come home, have some lunch, take a nap, then watch television. 
Brendon says, `I like what grandpa has. I want to be retired.' Brendon is only 11. 
The Diners Club wrote to Brendon. Doreen Edelman, Senior vice president at Diners Club, wrote: 
Dear Brendon, Whether you travel for business or pleasure, wouldn't you like a Card that rewards your spending with something you could really use--frequent flyer miles on the major airline of your choice? 
It says get our Diners card. You can go to lounges, you can go to fancy restaurants, you can rent cars, you can pay for your airline ticket. 
I didn't show Brendon this last night because the fact that Brendon would like to be retired might persuade him that he would like a Diners Club card, too, but he is only 11. He doesn't have a job. He doesn't have any money. He isn't going to have a Diners Club card. 
I don't know whether Doreen Edelman, senior vice president of the Diners Club, listens to this debate. In fact, it looks like she is from Sioux Falls, SD. Holy cow, I didn't think anybody from either of the Dakotas would think this way--that an 11-year-old boy ought to get a Diners Club card. 
I know why he got this. They don't know him from a head of lettuce. They don't know Brendon Patrick Dorgan. They gathered the name someplace and sent him a little letter that says they would like him to get a Diners Club card. 
It would serve them right to have all these 11-year-olds send this in, get the Diners Club card and go spend some money. 
I come from a town of 300 people. If someone in business on the main street of my hometown said, Do you know what I want to do? I want to send some 11-year-old an invitation to have credit with us. That person would have to be drunk or just dumb. What are they thinking? That is what is happening. 
I know this debate is a little more serious than that. It is about the explosion of credit cards to college kids and so on. I understand that. But this is a wonderful example of how ridiculous it has become, isn't it? It is just indiscriminate. Are you alive? Do you breathe? Do you have a name? Are you on a list? Congratulations, we would like to offer you some preapproved credit. 
What kind of standard is that? What kind of business behavior is that? 
I happen to support the underlying bill. I believe the pendulum has swung too far on bankruptcy. I think it ought to swing back some. I am prepared to support the underlying bill. I also believe those in this country who run these businesses and send solicitations to 11-year-old boys and solicit every college student in the country with credit cards with preapproved limits, I think they have some responsibility, as well. That is what the Senator from Connecticut is saying today with his amendment. They have some responsibility, too. 
I am pleased, on behalf of Brendon, to support the amendment by the Senator from Connecticut. Perhaps we will make some progress in saying to those who extend credit in this country, yes, we believe bankruptcy laws ought to be adjusted some; you are right about that. We also believe you have some responsibility, which you have been ignoring with the solicitations you are making indiscriminately around this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an interesting debate that likely will get very little attention, given the proclivity of the press to cover other things going on in our country these days. 
I rise today to support the amendment offered by Senator Boxer. There is a charming quote from Abraham Lincoln that came during his debates with Douglas. At one point, very exasperated because he simply could not get Douglas to understand a point he was making, Lincoln turned to Douglas and said, `Tell me, how many legs does a cow have?' Douglas said, `Four, of course.' Lincoln said, `Now, assume that the tail were a leg; how many legs would the cow have?' Douglas said, `Five.' Lincoln said, `You see, that's where you are wrong. Just calling it a leg doesn't make it a leg at all.' 
As I heard members discuss this amendment on the floor of the Senate, saying this amendment affects independent oil companies, I thought it was easy to say, but it was totally removed from the facts. This bill has no impact on independent oil companies. It does not have an impact on independent oil companies. It has nothing to do with the fact that commodity prices are collapsing which is true on the farm and true for energy companies. It has nothing to do with that either. In fact, the lower the price for oil, the less royalty fee would be required to be paid by the oil industry. So that is not what this issue is about. 
A lot of folks want to confuse the issue. It is not about that. It is not about independent oil companies who are not affected, and not about the price of oil. When the price of oil goes down, royalty fees go down. 
Let me describe what it is about. It is very simple. The companies who drill for oil on Federal lands pay a 12-percent royalty to the American people for the privilege of doing that on the oil that they bring up out of those lands and sell. They are required, because they are drilling on lands that are owned by the American people, to pay a royalty fee. That is fair. I suppose some think they ought to drill and keep all the money. But it is fair. 
Over many years, we have decided that if they are going to get something the public has, they will pay a fee. That is the 12-percent royalty fee. A fair portion of that fee that goes to the States is used for education. That is an important part of the revenue base of our States. A large part, no, but an important part. How much do we get from these royalties? When someone wants to produce oil on public lands, how much do we get from the royalties of 12 percent? Well, it is 12 percent of the price of the oil. What is the price of the oil with respect to the independent oil companies that produce it and sell it? That sale price is the price of the oil. They are then required to pay a royalty fee on the price of the oil. So an arm's length transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller establishes the market price for oil. That is not a problem. That is not a matter of contention. 
But what about a company that is a large integrated company that produces oil and then, as a producer, sells it to itself as a wholesaler or a retailer and it produces the oil and prices it and sells it to itself? What about that company? What then is the price of the oil, and how much in royalty payments do the American people get from that transaction? The answer is, the price of that oil in a large integrated oil company is whatever the company says the price of the oil is. 
What if they say, gee, well, the price of our oil is $4 a barrel, and you get 12 percent of that? Are we being cheated if, in fact, oil is selling for $12 a barrel and they say, `Ours is only worth $4 because we are selling it to ourselves, and we have artificially priced it because we want to avoid paying your fees, avoid paying our fair share to the American people?' 
Are we being cheated? Of course we are being cheated. The question is, Who cares about that in here? Does anybody care? Does anybody care if the American people get taken to the cleaners by somebody that wants to underprice something they sell to themselves and, as a result, pay the American people something less than they were supposed to pay? Does anybody care about that? A few of us do. We will have a vote on it to see who cares. 
So what is the royalty fee we get? It is 12 percent times the value of the oil. Who establishes the value of the oil? In most cases--95 percent of the cases, with all of the independents and some others--it is the fair market value, a willing buyer and a willing seller in an open market transaction, which establishes a price upon which a 12-percent royalty payment is made. 
This amendment isn't even a close call, by any standard. I want to use this example to talk about two other things that relate exactly to this, which give me as much concern as this does. In fact, this is not a very large issue. It is an issue of $66 million a year; $66 million is a lot of money, but in the construct of a trillion dollars, or a trillion and a half--the $1.6 trillion budget that we have, and the $135 billion of revenue here and there--I mean, it is not that big an issue. Yet, they are waging a fight; the major integrated oil companies are waging a fight, and you would think you were taking away their last oil truck. 
Let me tell you about an exact replica of this debate. We lost it on the floor of the Senate. We have the exact same issue on taxation--corporations, especially foreign corporations, but domestic as well, that sell to themselves and then tell us at what price they sell the product to themselves, a wholly owned subsidiary, and therefore how much profit they made and how much income tax they will pay to the Federal Government. And 65 percent of the foreign corporations doing business in this country, most of whose names you will recognize, do tens of billions of dollars of business in America and pay zero in income tax--not a penny. Zero. How do they do that? Let me give you one example. A company sells a piano to its affiliated subsidiary and prices it at $50. Would you like to buy a piano for $50? It is exactly the same thing we are talking about with pricing oil you sell yourself--undervalue it and pay a tax, or in this case, a royalty, based on evaluation that is artificially low so you can avoid paying the royalty, or as in the case I described, avoid paying the income tax. 
How about a tractor tire? I don't know if anybody in here buys and sells tractor tires. Probably not, but $7.60 is the price of a tractor tire in a transaction between a corporation--a foreign corporation--and its wholly owned subsidiary in the U.S. Why $7.60? The company artificially prices it low so that it doesn't pay income taxes in the U.S. We voted on that. We voted on something that corrects that problem. We have people in this Chamber, sufficient numbers, who have said, `We don't want to correct that. We don't even want to debate whether it is cheating. We don't want to deal with it because big business doesn't want that to be changed.' 
We don't intend to change it. It is the same principle here. Big, integrated oil companies sell to themselves, underprice what they are selling to themselves, and, therefore, cheat the American people out of royalty payments that they ought to be making. Then members come to the floor of the Senate and say to us, `Gee, you are being unfair.' We are not being unfair. We are required to stand up for the interests of the American people. They own that land. They own that land on which drilling takes place. They are owed the 12-percent royalty based on a fair computation of the price of that oil. 
I will tell you one more story. I served in State office before I came here. In our State, we assess a tax on railroads. It is exactly the same principle we are talking about here today. We assess a tax on railroads. When I assumed office as Tax Commissioner, which was an elective office, and assumed responsibility for that tax, I asked one of the folks who were responsible for that tax--which is an ad valorem property tax on the railroad system--`How do you do that?' He said, `Sit down and I will show you.' He said, `Because the railroads aren't bought and sold, you look at all of the stocks and all of the debt. Assuming you bought all of their stock and debt, that is the value of the railroad.' I said, `Tell me a little more about that.' He said, `Here is the stock. I sell you this railroad. Here is the stock.' I said, `Gee, what price are you using, par value?' `Par value,' he said. 
Remember, we have been doing that for 25 years. The railroads indicated to us that that is the value. Using the par value, of course, is absolutely ridiculous. Par value has nothing to do with the value of the railroad stock. But the industry had convinced the people in our State who value railroads to use an artificially low, absurd value for the railroad stock. They were fat and happy for dozens of years underpaying their taxes. They loved it. The minute I decided to change it, they said `Holy cow. What are you doing to us? Why on Earth are you being unfair to us?' I said, `I am not being unfair. I am asking you to do what every other American does--pay your fair share of the taxes.' 
That is the principle and the issue on which we will be voting. The principle and the issue here is not about ma and pa. It is not about independents and not whether you support the oil industry. I do. I have cast a lot of votes on behalf of the independents, and support the majors as well, because I think they play an important contributing role for this country in providing energy for our future. But in cases like this where you have integrated companies who are undervaluing their oil so they can underpay the royalty fee they owe to the people of the United States, I say let's correct it. 
Some of my colleagues say that underpayment is not happening. 
Let's take a look at the rates. Alaska settled with the oil companies for over $2.5 billion. Is that because somebody was making arithmetic errors? I don't think so. California, $350 million; Texas, $17.1 million. 
My point is that the States have been plodding their way through this issue with respect to royalties owed to the States. Can we not have the strength to stand up here and say to the integrated oil companies, `You have a responsibility to be fair to the people of the United States? We are not asking for more than you owe. Your oil prices have declined. Therefore, you should pay the new price.' We understand that. `We are not asking for more than you owe; not a penny more. We are asking you on behalf of the people of this country to pay your fair share.' 
What is happening today--and in this bill that came to the floor of the Senate--is an attempt to intercept a rule that will require these folks to pay their fair share of royalties. And a bunch of folks here in the Senate stand up and say, `No, no, no. We want to protect the old order.' The old order is to let people sell oil to themselves, to underprice it, undervalue it, and avoid paying the American people what they owe them in royalty fees. That is what is wrong. 
If we turned out the lights and voted on this, people in this Chamber would express that view. I hope when we have a vote on this we will all decide that there is a right and wrong answer. The right answer is to just ask the integrated majors who sell oil to themselves to price it fairly and abide by the new MMS rules. They have been studied and worked on and they are fair. Do this the right way. 
The Senator from California is not on the floor trying to attack an industry. The Senator from California is not offering an amendment that in any way affects the independent oil producers. Ninety-five percent of the oil producers in this country will be unaffected by this amendment, 95 percent of them. In fact, some of those who have been unaffected have been convinced to send us letters saying that they are going to be affected by it. I assume they have been convinced by their bigger cousins, or bigger uncles. But the fact is, it is wrong. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg at all, as Lincoln said. Saying this affects independents doesn't make it affect independents. It does not. It is a very simple, direct approach to say to the integrated oil companies who sell oil to themselves that they have a responsibility to price oil fairly so that the American people get what they deserve. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is going to offer an amendment on our behalf and on behalf of the Senate minority leader. My expectation is Senator Gorton would like to provide an opportunity for the minority leader to speak before the vote. I don't know if he made a unanimous consent request. I hope, in any event, if there is a discussion of time with respect to the tabling of this amendment, that there is an understanding the minority leader will be given time to speak prior to the tabling motion.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments by Senator Harkin from Iowa. I have spoken over the weekend, again, with Senator Daschle, on whose behalf we offer this amendment. A group of us have joined together, believing it is urgent that we respond to the farm crisis and that we do so quickly. 
I want to go through a couple of charts, just briefly, that describe what this crisis is about. The first chart goes back to April 1996 and shows what has happened to farm prices. Wheat prices have fallen from $5.75 per bushel down to $2.46. The price of wheat, in this case, dropped 57 percent in this nearly 2-year period, since the farm bill. 
Now, I ask people to think of their own situation. If their income dropped 57 percent, what shape would they find themselves? That is what has happened with family farmers. At the same time the price of their inputs have grown, and increased dramatically. The price of their grain has collapsed. In my State of North Dakota, in 1 year, net farm income for family farmers dropped 98 percent. Anyone in this country, any neighborhood, any community, any business, would be in desperate trouble if they lost 98 percent of their income, and yet that is what has happened to our family farmers. 
When historians look back at this period, they will say that this is one of the most significant farm crises that we have faced since the Great Depression. We, in fact, have Depression-era prices for grain in rural America right now. We won't have many family farmers left if this Congress doesn't extend a hand to help out when family farmers are in trouble. 
Each month has brought more and more bad news for family farmers. Wheat prices have fallen an average of a 11-cent-a-month drop during this entire year. That amounts to an almost $40 million income loss each month to North Dakota farmers. 
I want to read a letter from a 15-year-old high school boy who comes from a family farm. He wrote me a letter that I received in recent days. 
My name is Wyatt Goettle. 
Incidentally, he told us we should go ahead and use his name. Wyatt says: 
I live on a farm by Donnybrook [in North Dakota], and we raise sheep, cattle, and grow crops. I'm 15 years old and I'm a sophomore at Stanley High School. 
This year we rented out most of our cropland. The prices of crops this year and in past years is ridiculous. What would happen if all the farmers just quit because they couldn't even feed their families? I don't know what is going on, but somebody somewhere is making money and it isn't the farmers that put all the work into it. 
Then he says this:  
You know, my dad can feed 180 people, but he can't feed his own family because of the prices. 
. . . Our farm is a small family farm and it's hard to keep going . . . It's hard getting back from school and working until 10:30 or 11:00 at night. Then having to get up at 6:15 the next morning just to find out that you can't put gas in the car to go to school because you can't afford it. It all goes back to the beef and grain prices. 
This from a 15-year-old boy, a sophomore attending school in Stanley, ND. 
Let me read an additional letter from Brian and Johnet Christianson, who wrote to me recently from Glenburn, ND. She said: 
Our loan officer has told us this will be our last year of farming if we can't make our scheduled payments. We want to farm. I have a good job, and my husband has taken on a full-time job and a part-time job [off the farm] to make ends meet. That is to cover living expenses. 
. . . The public keeps hearing about the family farmer, but what about the farmer's family? The wife tries to be a decision-maker with her husband to pay a bill or get disconnected; or put food on the table. The wife is there to give a smile and a hug when he comes in from the field. As a new school year is getting underway, it is the farmers' children who continue to suffer the misfortunes of the farm life. Don't get me wrong. We have chosen this life for our family, and we will fight to keep it going. 
She said: 
When mom offers to buy one pair of new school jeans, it is the daughter who says, `No, mommy, I don't need them because we [can't afford it], right, mommy?' As I fill out reduced or free school lunch applications, the farm has brought us $72 a month this past year. Yet people think we are rich farmers who can handle a bad year. 
. . . Brian and I have a very strong marriage and we will get through this year with hope for a better tomorrow. Our children will, too. We will make it--the optimism of the farmer. 
Please continue to fight for equity in grain prices for the farmer and his family. 
Now, these two letters--one from a husband and wife and one from a 15-year-old boy--describe this crisis better than I can describe it. The young 15-year-old boy, a sophomore in high school, says: 
My dad can feed 180 people, but can't feed his own family because of farm prices. 
There is something wrong with that. One fellow sent me something that I ask unanimous consent to be able to show on the floor of the Senate. It is a handful of grain.

Mr. DORGAN. If I might, I will show my colleagues that this is the barley he sent to my office a couple of days ago. Then he sent a similar bag of kitty litter. This kitty litter is worth 20 cents a pound, and the barley is worth 2 cents a pound. This farmer said, `Is there something wrong here? Kitty litter is 20 cents a pound and barley 2 cents a pound. Am I missing something?' 
No, he is not missing something. There is something fundamentally wrong with grain prices. There is something wrong when we say to the world and to family farmers that what they produce has no value. What they produce has no worth? 
I have said this before on the floor of the Senate and we have heard it in testimony of people. Halfway around the world, old women are climbing trees in Sudan to scour for leaves to eat because they are facing starvation. A million and a half people in Sudan are starving halfway around the world. At the same moment that an old woman is climbing trees to get leaves to eat, a family farmer loads up his truck to drive to the elevator with a load of hard red spring wheat. When he gets to the elevator, he is told, `This wheat doesn't have much value; it is not worth much.' 
Is there a disconnection here? I think so. We produce an abundant quantity of food that the world needs, but somehow we cannot get to halfway around the world where they need it. Those who need it can't get it and those who produce it are told it has no value. If you want to talk about a disconnection of things that are really important on this Earth, that is it. 
Now, we passed a new farm bill a couple years ago. I didn't vote for it. I didn't believe the farm bill was the right approach. I still don't. Like so many political promises, that farm bill had big print and it had little print. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the big print giveth and the little print taketh away. 
Now, the big print promised that price supports would be set based on marketplace prices. Loan rates would therefore be 85 percent of the Olympic 5-year average of prices on the market. This promised a price cushion for family farmers. If market prices fell, there would be a cushion set at 85 percent of the Olympic 5-year average price. That was the big print. 
Now here comes the little print. The little print then said that what the big print said was wrong. The little print said that while loan rates were supposed to be based on market prices, the little print put a cap on it. That is an innocuous little word, that three-letter word--`cap.' 
So the big print says you get 85 percent of the Olympic market average, and we are going to give you that as an opportunity to provide some kind of price support so that if the market collapses, you have something to support you. But then the little print comes back and says, `Oh, by the way, we are not going to give you what you were promised; we are going to put a cap on it; and therefore your support prices are pathetic.' They never use the word `pathetic'; they put the cap on it that made it pathetic. Now we find ourselves under circumstances where we must come to the floor and say let's take the cap off the loan rate and give farmers what they were promised in the farm bill. 
All we want to do is delete just a part of the little print. Our amendment would just delete a part of that little print in the farm bill. Why, you would think we were burning 85 barns down with all the commotion about this. We come and say, `Let's delete the little print that took away from farmers what the big print promised,' and you would think we were burning barns down. 
Holy cow, people are jumping up and down and screaming that we are going to unwind, unravel, and tear apart the farm bill. No; we are just going to make the farm bill honest. We are trying to make it do for farmers what the farm bill promised it was going to do for farmers. If making that bill honest is the wrong direction, then I guess I have lost part of the compass by which to measure these issues. 
Well, let me show the second chart. It describes part of the problem that cries out for attention. The red and orange areas are counties in our State. This is the State of North Dakota, which is 10 times the size of the State of Massachusetts, just for some land mass comparisons. This whole area of the State has been declared as an agricultural disaster. One third of our counties have been declared a disaster every year for the last 5 years. That's right; every single year. Two thirds of our counties have been declared disaster areas in 3 of the last 5 years. Why? It is because of a wet cycle that came and stayed, and provided the conditions for the worst crop disease in a century. And, now we have collapsed grain prices on top of it. 
Now, farmers can't make it when, year after year after year, they have recurring natural disasters. That is exactly what has happened. It is precisely why, if we are going to save the family farmers, we must take action now to deal with this issue. 
One of the problems that came from these wet cycles and all of the other natural disasters is a crop disease called fusarium head blight, which is a fancy way of saying scab. Farmers know what scab means. It means money is sucked right out of their pockets by decreased grain quality and quantity. Brian Steffenson, a cereal scientist from North Dakota State University, said: 
Make no mistake about it. This is the worst plant disease epidemic that the U.S. has faced with any major crop during this century. 
Our family farmers face collapsed prices, the worst crop disease of the century, disaster declarations year after year in most of the State. Yet, North Dakota, which is a rural State, is an important part of the bread basket in this country. 
Let me add one additional chart which shows another part of the problem. As if this situation is not bad enough with bad prices, poor crops and crop disease there is another economic dilemma facing our farmers. When the farmer does produce a product, the farmer faces basic monopoly pricing or monopoly influences up the marketing stream. 
Want to sell some beef? Well, then, show up at the packing plant and you will find that 87 percent of the beef packing is controlled by four firms. Eighty-seven percent of the cattle slaughtered in this country is controlled by four firms. How about pork? Sixty percent of pork slaughter is controlled by four firms. Fifty-five percent of broiler chicken processing is controlled by four firms. Do you have sheep to send to the market? Well, 73 percent of sheep slaughter is controlled by four companies. 
Everywhere a farmer turns, as he sells his commodities up the marketing stream, he finds that it is controlled by monopolistic kinds of enterprises. 
How about transportation? Take it to the railroad, and what do you find there? Competition? No. You find one railroad that says, `We will haul your wheat, and here is what we charge you. If you don't like it, tough luck. 
Try walking down the highway carrying your wheat to market in gunnysacks.' 
In North Dakota, when you want to ship your wheat from Bismark to Minneapolis, MN, the railroad charges a farmer $2,300 to ship that carload of wheat. But, if you put that carload wheat on in Minneapolis and ship it to Chicago, which is about the same distance, they don't charge $2,300. They charge $1,000. Why do we get charged more than double? Because there is only one railroad. And they say, `Here is your price. If you don't like it, tough luck.' So we pay too much money for transportation. 
My point is that in every direction the family farmer is confronted not by a free market but by a controlled market--controlled in someone else's interest. That is the dilemma we face. 
At some point in agriculture, we reach a point of no return. The question for this Congress is whether we care enough about the future of family farmers in America to take effective action. Do we want to save family farmers? We can decide not to do that. 
The best way to decide not to do much about family farming is to essentially say the farm bill passed by Congress was just fine. We can say it is all right that the big print giveth and the little print taketh away. Well, I don't think that is just fine. I think it is critically important to save family farmers. 
If this country believes that food is expensive these days, they ought to try buying food once corporate agrifactories farm America from California to Maine. Then they will find out what the price of food really is. It won't be cheap food. It will be expensive food for the American consumer. 
This last chart shows a cartoon from one of our newspapers. There is nothing very funny what we have been discussing. This cartoon tells the story of agriculture in our region. It shows `Family Farmers: The Point of No Returns.' It describes the roadbed our farmers are traveling. That roadbed is made up of low yields, low market price, low cattle prices, high production costs, crop disease, bad weather. Our farmers have no returns on their production and now are on the point of no return. 
When I talked about transportation costs earlier, I should have also mentioned that there are many other business stories of what family farmers are facing. 
My colleague from Minnesota is ready to speak. He comes from the east of North Dakota, Minneapolis, MN. Did you know that if a North Dakota farmer is going to ship his or her grain on a rail bed, put it in a car and ship it on the railroad, that the same railroad that will ship a carload of wheat from Iowa all the way up through North Dakota and then to the West Coast for less? That's right shipping from Iowa up through Minneapolis, through North Dakota to the West Coast will be cheaper to than to load the grain on in North Dakota and ship it from North Dakota to the West Coast? Why? Because shipping from Iowa is a circumstance where you are shipping where there is competition at the point from which you start to ship it. The railroad will charge more money for fewer miles to North Dakota farmers to ship that same load of grain. 
My point is, it doesn't matter where you intersect this farm problem. In every single instance you will find out that there are no free markets; not in transportation, chemical prices, slaughterhouses, grain markets, you name it. 
I haven't yet even mentioned the unfair trade that comes from Canada and elsewhere that undercuts our farmers' markets and further collapse farm prices. This is in addition to all of the other things I have mentioned. Right now, as I speak, somewhere up in a border port between Canada and the United States there is an 18-wheel truck driving up. And the driver is leaning out with his left elbow telling some Customs' inspector, `Yes. I have Canadian durum on the back of this truck. I have got a load of Canadian durum.' He is going to drive that Canadian durum into the United States, undercutting our market, and thus taking the money right out of the pockets of American producers. 
How is he going to do it? Because the grain on his truck was sent by the Canadian Wheat Board, which is a monopoly. It is a state-sponsored monopoly that would be illegal in the United States of America. The durum wheat that he is hauling is sold through the Wheat Board at secret prices, which is not something that can happen in this country, either. So we have a state monopoly from Canada selling at secret prices in this country to undercut our farmers' price. It is fundamentally unfair. 
While that truck comes across today, we have trade officials who just sit on their hands. They see nothing, they do nothing and they say nothing. In fact, they ought not be there when the paychecks come out. We ought to save the money. Why have a trade office that doesn't have the energy to get up in the morning and suit up, with the notion that, `I am going to do something good'? I will have more to say about that this week. 
Right now my sense is we have trade people who have an unwillingness to take action. I say get rid of them. Get rid of all of them, and do it now. I am at my wit's end with our trade officials, because they know in their hearts that all they have is this mantra of free trade. They ought to really have some cymbals on the street corner someplace and just chant all day. That is all they do is chant. They certainly don't do any effective work with this country. If they did, they would be at the borders deciding that when people come into this country unfairly to try to undercut our markets and dump in this country at secret prices that there ought to be sanctions for that. As I said, I will have more to say about our trade officials later this week. 
But I am here today for a very specific reason. Between now and several weeks from now when this Congress adjourns, there isn't a more important agenda item for us to complete than to deal with the farm problem. I hope we can do it together. I hope that Republicans and Democrats coming from farm country are able to stand together and say, `We want to do something to help family farmers get over this price depression.' 
When prices drop and you have a price valley, we need to build a bridge across that valley. That is what this farm program this Congress passed was supposed to do. But, as I said, the promise was in the big print and the small print took that away. Shame on the small print. What we propose to do is dump the small print today and give family farmers the kind of support that is necessary to get across these price valleys. 
Let me finish as I started by telling you about Brian and Johnet Christianson. This is just one farm family--one couple living on a farm--that is representative of thousands and thousands of farmers across the region. They say, `This will be the last year for us, our loan officer tells us, if we can't make scheduled payments.' They ask a question. When their prices drop 57 percent and they are getting more than $2 a bushel less for their grain than it cost them to produce, how can they possibly be expected to meet their payments? 
There are no better people in this country than our farm families. I am not judging who is best. But, certainly there is nobody better folks in this country than those people who went out and homesteaded the land, built themselves a house, raised a family, and operated a family farm. There are no bigger risk takers in America than those who plant the seed in the spring, and borrow some money to do it. They put everything they have, their sweat, their blood, their tears, everything they have into it. They risk everything they have every year. Then they hope that the insects don't come, it doesn't rain too much, that it rains enough, it doesn't hail, hoping their crop grows. And, when it grows, they hope that if they can harvest it and get it to the elevator, they hope among hope there is some kind of price that will give them the opportunity to make a living. 
All of us know in our hearts that those folks are out there crying tears tonight because they are losing their hope and they are losing their dream of wanting to continue a family farm for themselves and their children. 
We know what is happening to these people in those farm houses that Brian and Johnet talk about it. This mother says she is only able to buy her young daughter one pair of new jeans for the school year, and her daughter says, `No, no, that is all right; I know we can't afford that.' We know that in those houses they hope tonight that this Congress will do the right thing. 
Congress extends itself to say to everyone around the world whenever there is trouble, `We are off rushing to help.' What about now, here at home on the family farm, where there is trouble? Shouldn't we begin to rush to help with some real assistance that gives these farm families the hope of surviving for another day, another year, and an opportunity to say, `I am a family farmer, I am making a decent living on the family farm, and I am proud of it.' If at the end of the day, together we do what we can and should do to make things right for America's family farmers, we will give these people on our family farms the opportunity to be able to say that with dignity and pride. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Minnesota will yield further just for a question before he begins his address. I understand that this coming Saturday in Worthington, MN, there is to be a farm rally, which I assume the Senator will be speaking about. The rally is in his home State, but it is a rally designed to encourage farmers from a four-State area to come together to talk about and demonstrate the urgent need to stress this farm crisis. I intend to be in Worthington, MN, this Saturday with Senator Wellstone and others. I think it is a 9:30 a.m. farm rally. But I would expect a good many farm families will come from our four-State region to talk about their hopes and dreams and talk about especially what they hope this Congress will do to address this deep and abiding farm crisis.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader will entertain an inquiry. 
At the conclusion of Senator Byrd's presentation, it is my intention to speak for a few moments on the agriculture crisis, and I would just like to inquire of the majority leader, who I know was supportive in July as we moved a $500 million indemnity piece out of the Senate dealing with the farm crisis, I would like to ask the majority leader if he has some interest and some intention of allowing us to work on a farm crisis package during the month of September. 
The reason I ask the question, I know that the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, is trying to fit a lot of things into a very short window here, but I think he knows that Members on this side and the other side coming from farm country are having to deal with an enormously difficult farm crisis. We hope very much that that will become part of the agenda in the month of September. I would just inquire of the Senator as to his intentions.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk briefly about a couple of issues that are of critical importance to the country, and especially to that part of America that I come from--North Dakota, the farm belt. It is an important part of our country. Our country is made up of many parts--of cities, of country, of family farms, of main streets, and small businesses. But we are going through a very, very tough time in rural America. 
I asked the majority leader some moments ago on the floor of the Senate about the ability to deal with this farm crisis through some action by this Congress before we adjourn. I was impressed that he indicated that it is his intention for us to take up legislation to address this farm crisis once again as we did in the month of July. It is an urgent situation. 
The future of many family farms and the future of many families living out in rural America depends on this Congress stepping up and making the kind of decisions that will give them the opportunity to make a decent living on the family farm. 
When I talk about my part of the country, or our part of the country, I am reminded of something that Daniel Webster said. He was one of the giants of this institution. In fact, his portrait is on the wall out here in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. He is recognized as a giant in the history of this body. When Thomas Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase, which was fairly controversial at the time, let me read to you what Daniel Webster said. Remember; this a part of the country that I come from. About that Louisiana Purchase, Daniel Webster said: 
What do we want with this vast, worthless area, this region of savages and wild beasts, of desert and shifting sands and whirlwinds, of dust, cactus, and prairie dogs? What can we ever hope to do with this western coast, a coast of 3,000 miles, rockbound, cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it? What use do we have for this country? 
Daniel Webster is not considered thoughtless because he made this statement. But it is quite clear, I suppose, to all of us now that he missed the mark some. 
`What do we want with this vast, worthless area?' 
Gosh. What a remarkable part of our country that Louisiana Purchase became. 
Then a couple of years after Daniel Webster asked this question about that part of America, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to explore that area, and it was one of the great expeditions in the annals of American history. 
Lewis and Clark, on May 14th, 1804, left St. Louis, MO, with 44 men and 120 gallons of whiskey, by the way, purchased with government vouchers. The President said, `Buy whatever you need.' I have made jokes about the need to purchase 120 gallons of whiskey to get them through certain States. But I will not repeat those jokes here. I do that only because I think it is interesting to study the history of that Lewis and Clark Expedition. It was a remarkable expedition. 
In April of 1805--April 7, to be exact--after Lewis and Clark had gone from St. Louis up to what is now near Washburn, ND, and spent the entire winter with the Mandan Indians, before they began the next portion of their journey to the West Coast, April 7, 1805, Captain Lewis wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson. That letter--a six-page letter--was put on a keelboat with some soldiers and sent down the Missouri back to St. Louis, then down to New Orleans by boat, then to Washington, DC, to Thomas Jefferson. And then we never heard another word from Lewis and Clark for 17 months. Then we discovered on the conclusion of that remarkable expedition that they had been to the West Coast and back. And they told us what they found in this remarkable country of ours. 
That letter, by the way, just for interest sake, was never viewed by the public until a couple of months ago. That letter, in a special effort by the Library of Congress, is now being viewed publicly at an Interpretation Center of Lewis and Clark near Washburn, ND, with all proper security, about a mile from where Captain Lewis wrote the letter in the year 1805 on April 7. He sent it by keelboat down the Missouri, all the way around to President Jefferson, and, of course, it came back in by jet airplane nearly 200 years later. 
I tell you that just to say that this is a wonderful, remarkable country, and in our part of the country, which is called the farm belt, a rural area of the country, we are having an enormous amount of difficulty, one that requires this Congress' attention. 
There are two things that are of great concern to us. 
The collapse of grain prices means that we see the threatened loss of thousands and thousands and thousands of families who now live out on the family farm. Grain prices have flat out collapsed. Crop disease has come and visited our State --the worst crop disease of the century at the same time that grain prices have collapsed. And, on top of that, these farmers also fail because of unfair trade, unfair trade which helps cause the grain price collapse; an enormous amount of unfair trade, unfair trade that no one seems to be interested in doing anything about. 
That brings me to the point I want to make today dealing with our trade problems, especially with our neighbors to the north--the Canadians--but these trade problems relate to Mexico, to France, to China, and to other countries as well. 
Let me describe the problems just briefly, as I have before, and then tell you why I am especially interested today. 
Trade agreements: There are those talking about this mantra of free trade saying let's do more free trade agreements, and the more we trade, the better off we are, and the better it is for our country. Trade statistics show that as we negotiate these agreements, agreement after agreement, whoever is negotiating these agreements must not be keeping their eye on the ball, because agreement after agreement we see deeper and deeper trade deficits for this country. 
I ask those who negotiate our agreements: Is there any chance you might negotiate a trade agreement that is in our country's best interest just once; something that benefits our country instead of deepens our trade deficits? The economic all-stars in trade have become America's family farmers. We have an abiding and abundant trade surplus in agricultural commodities and products. But that is shrinking, as you can see. That is shrinking because the trade agreements that have been developed over the years with other countries--the Canadian agreement, Mexican, and others--have not been in the interest of our farmers. They have created a bifurcation of trade strategy so that we become a sponge for virtually anything anyone wants to send into our country, even if it is sent here unfairly. And we increasingly cannot get our products into other countries' markets. The result is that the agricultural trade surplus, which once was healthy and which once reflected the one bright spot on our trade picture, is now itself diminishing. 
Our foreign debt grows to finance this trade deficit. You know what red means, and I have shown many of these charts before that show that the trade debt is increasing and increasing dramatically. 
Now, we have a U.S. trade ambassador's office that negotiates trade treaties. I voted against, I guess, the last three or four of the treaties they have negotiated. They went and negotiated one with Canada and, fundamentally, in my judgment, sold out the interests of American farmers. I think I can demonstrate it; I think I have. Then they negotiated NAFTA with Canada and Mexico. Same thing--a wholesale exodus of American jobs. They negotiated GATT--fundamentally unsound in the way it was negotiated to protect our producers' economic interests. I am not talking about being protectionist now. I am talking about standing up for the economic interests of our producers to say, if you must compete--and that is a worthy objective--then we will make sure the competition is fair. 
Has that happened in all of these recent trade agreements? Not at all. Because these folks are interested in negotiating agreements, some kind of trade agreements that comport with some notion of free trade they have, a notion that is foreign to the folks where I grew up. 
Is it free trade to say to an American producer, you go ahead and produce a product, then ship it to a marketplace and try to sell it? And by the way, you are going to compete with a manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka or Indonesia or Bangladesh, and they are going to hire 14-year-old kids and pay them 14 cents an hour; they are going to work them 14 hours a day, and they are going to make that product dirt cheap so they can increase their corporate profits; they are going to ship that product to Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, or Fargo, and you, Mr. and Mrs. Producer, compete with them, go ahead, compete with them. Is that fair trade? Absolutely not. 
Or how about saying to a mom and pop operation in this country that is producing a product, you produce a product, but we need to make sure you are not polluting our air, not polluting our water, not hiring kids, and you don't have unsafe plants? 
So we have restrictions on air pollution, restrictions on air and water pollution, we have child labor laws, and we have worker safety provisions. And then we say, you produce that product under those conditions--and I support all of those conditions, by the way--and then go compete, and when you compete, you compete against a plant in some country tens of thousands of miles away that doesn't have any restriction on dumping chemicals into the air, chemicals into the water, hiring kids or having unsafe factories. And so they increase corporate profits, make cheaper products and ship them here and compete unfairly. 
I ask our trade ambassadors to defend that; defend that. And if you can't, then don't go negotiate another treaty for this country unless you can demonstrate to the American people you are willing for a change, for once, to stand up for this country's economic interests. 
Now, there will be some people in this town who will listen to this, and they say, well, this guy is some xenophobic isolationist, and that is what all this language is about. I am not that: we need to find a foreign home for much of what we produce in farming today. 
I want expanded trade, I want expanded trade opportunities around the world, but I am flat out sick and tired of our farmers and our business men and women being consigned to trade internationally in a circumstance where our trade negotiators have negotiated trade agreements that, A, are incompetently negotiated so they put us at a disadvantage and, B, totally nonenforced, unenforced. They won't lift a finger to enforce a trade agreement that I can see. 
This morning I read in the paper that our steel industry is going to file an action alleging that there is dumping going on in this country. I don't even know much about it, but I say to the steel industry, sign me up as a supporter. It is about time people start standing up for their interests and demanding that trade competition be fair competition. 
The first 25 years after the Second World War, trade policy could be foreign policy and we could tie one hand behind our back and beat anyone, anytime, anywhere. That was fine. War-torn Europe was trying to restore itself, and we were dealing with weak competitors. That is not true anymore. Now we have shrewd, tough international competitors, and the fact is our trade policy is still half foreign policy and our negotiators and our trade agencies don't seem to give a whit about either negotiating good agreements or enforcing the agreements we have. 
That brings me to the issue of Canada especially. While our farmers face collapsed prices and are having auction sales the Trade Representative does nothing. You can go to those auction sales and see the tears those farmers cry because they have lost more than a farm and a home; they have lost their hopes, their dreams and everything they wanted to do in life. And one of the reasons that that is happening and that prices are collapsing is this grain from Canada, durum, wheat, barley, is flooding through our back door because of a trade agreement that was, again, incompetently negotiated. 
It is unfair trade, in my judgment. That is quite clear. It is sent here by a State trading agency in Canada which would be illegal in this country. A State trading monopoly in Canada would be illegal here. It sends that grain with secret pricing. By the way, we don't have secret prices here. Their prices are secret, and yet our trade agency refuses to lift a finger, doesn't lift a finger. And they boast about all the work they are doing. 
Senator Byrd once talked about Aesop's fly. It probably fits here. Aesop's fly, sitting on the axle of a chariot observing, `My, what dust I do raise.' Yes, my, what dust this USTR does raise. It is not even relevant to what is going on. The fact is, there are levers, there are opportunities, for our agencies to use, including the USTR, to stand up and fight for fair trade for our producers, our farmers, and our manufacturers, and they consistently refuse to do it. 
I will have more to say about this specifically next week and specifically about USTR and specifically about the trade agreement with Canada. I will have more to say about it next week. But this country and this Congress should not allow this to continue where our producers are confronted with unfair trade circumstances. We either ought to expect an agency to stand up and fight trade fairness or get rid of the agency; just get rid of it. Stop pretending. 
Mr. President, I mentioned Canada. I could talk about beer, Mexican beer coming north and American beer not going south. That is liquid barley, I guess. You know that is where beer comes from. I could talk about looking at trade through the eye of a potato, whole potatoes south, french fries north with the Mexican agreement. Or maybe we could do it with something everybody understands--Beanie Babies. You go stand at the border and see a convoy of trucks coming south with millions of bushels of Canadian grain, coming into a country that already has too much grain, and the result is prices are collapsed. And at the same time those convoys of trucks and railroad cars with millions of bushels of Canadian grain are coming into our country, trading unfairly, incidentally, at the same time that happens, try to bring a Beanie Baby in, and they stop you at the border and say, oh, no, you can only bring one--one. You only get one Beanie Baby to come across the border. 
So we are willing to stand up for cloth dolls filled with beans but not for family farmers whose lives, whose economic lives are threatened, who are going out of business in record numbers, going out of business so fast that they have had to call auctioneers in my State out of retirement to handle the auction sales. 
Am I upset about this? Yes. I am upset because I am a part of a system here that anticipates that those in the system will do what they are supposed to do, and I am especially upset with the U.S. trade ambassador's office. It is not new. I have been upset with them for years. But there is a new energy at this point because they are sitting on their hands doing essentially nothing while our farmers are going out of business. And there is a real and abiding problem that all of us understand that they refuse to take action to deal with it. 
I will revisit this subject next week, early next week on the floor of the Senate and have more to say about the USTR with some specifics, and also about Canada. 
But I wanted to make the point today, once again, that as part of the response to the farm crisis that I asked Senator Lott about today, we must deal with strengthening prices. We must deal with an indemnity program that Senator Conrad and I got passed. 
But we must also deal with the trade component, because we can't continue to try to find a way to deal with strengthening prices and finding new markets overseas for our grain products and then have a flood or an avalanche of grain coming through our back door, unfairly traded into our country. 
That is not fair to farmers. They ought to expect more. I certainly expect more. And the President ought to expect more from the U.S. Trade Ambassador's office, and as I said, I will have more to say about that early next week.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let briefly turn to one additional subject. That is the question of interest rates and the Federal Reserve Board. I want to talk about this because it also affects farmers--not just farmers, but all producers and all Americans. There is a lot of discussion these days about what is happening to the economy in our country. We have plenty of challenges. But it is also hard to miss some good news. The unemployment rate has gone way down. And the Federal Reserve Board, as most of us will recall, said: Now be careful, because if the unemployment rate ever falls below 6 percent there is a natural rate here below which we will get new waves of inflation; go below 6 percent, the Fed said, and we are going to have inflation problems. 
Of course, the Fed was dead wrong. We have had unemployment below 6 percent for 4 years now. Inflation has not gone up, it has gone down. But this is good news for the economy. The unemployment rate continues to be down. The Consumer Price Index has gone way down too. The core rate with respect to the CPI is 2.2 for the last 12 months ending in July. 
Finally, the real Federal Funds Rate, that is the short-term interest rate, adjusted for inflation, that the Federal Reserve Board sets, is 3.9 percent, the highest it's been in nine years. When inflation is way down here and the Federal Funds Rate, the real interest rate, is up here, you ask the question: Why? Let me see if I can answer that question and give just a bit of advice to the Federal Reserve Board. 
The Federal Reserve Board is doing its best imitation of petrified wood. It is not a tough imitation for them. All you have to do is look at the Federal Reserve Board and it resembles the Petrified Forest. In fact, what I would like to do is, just for those who might be watching or those who might be interested, I would like to show them the Federal Reserve Board's Governors and regional bank presidents, because they don't get enough attention. 
Here is who they are, here is where they are educated, largely their experience, and this is how much money they make. This is who sets interest rate policy in this country; interest rate policy which now has short-term rates too high and therefore the prime rate and other interest rates is too high. 
Jerry Jasinowski, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, says: 
Interest rates are a dangerous drag on the economy in view of the fact that 1/3 of the world is in a recession. 
He calls on the Fed to cut interest rates. 
Dr. Sung Won Sohn, Norwest Corporation: 
If the Fed were to cut interest rates today, it would help ease the farm crisis, which has become critical because of low commodity prices, bad weather, crop disease, and so on. 
James Glassman--I don't quote him very often, but James Glassman says: 
[Interest] rates are not really as low as they seem. After adjusting for inflation, long-term rates are high, and short-term rates are even higher. . . . The longer the Fed waits (to cut rates), the closer a serious slowdown, or recession, becomes. 
Mr. President, the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee will meet on September 29. Two of these folks still probably think that interest rates ought to be increased, despite the fact that our economy is slowing down and the real interest rates are far too high now. It might serve the money centers' bankers' interests. It certainly does not serve the interests of the producers in this country. And there has been, for 200 years in this country, a tension between those who produce and those who finance production. At this point, with this crowd, it tilts in favor of those who believe it might be in the interests of the Fed to serve their constituency, the money center banks. But there is no reason, given the economic circumstances in our country today, for them not to put interest rates where they belong, given the current rate of inflation, and that would augur not for an interest rate increase on September 29, but a cut. 
Here are the folks. Here are their names. You could put them in a barrel and shake them all up and you would still have a gray suit, somebody with an economics background, no one from my part of the country, and no one who has ever fixed anything or built anything. 
In fact, we have a vacancy now, and I said I would like my Uncle Joe to be considered for that. My Uncle Joe doesn't have any particular skills that would suggest him for the job, but he used to fix generators and alternators, so he has run a business and worked with his hands. He fixes things. Nobody here represents producers. Nobody on the Federal Reserve Board has an understanding, in my judgment, about the productive side of our economy. 
My Uncle Joe is not going be seriously considered, I suppose. But what we will probably find is this administration, like all others, will find somebody who looks just like this, same color suit, Ph.D. in economics. Certainly nobody from the Upper Midwest where they have been farming or their folks have run a small business or anything like that. 
I guess the point I wanted to make today is, as we head towards September 29, all of the evidence suggests that we ought to be seeing a cut in interest rates. I should confess that I actually used to teach economics a bit in college. I have been able to overcome that and lead a reasonably productive life. All I ask from the Federal Reserve Board is to look at this from the standpoint of this country's long-term economic health and the economic facts that are now self-evident. 
There is nothing that could persuade a couple of these people, as I understand they still believe that we ought to have higher interest rates except that they must represent some narrow self-interest for the money center banks. Certainly most of them ought to be able to look at the facts and understand we need--and this country deserves and our economy requires--a lowering of Federal Funds rate and therefore a lowering of the prime and other interest rates that represents where we ought to be, given the historical interest rates and declining inflation. 
Mr. President, I understand that when you come down and are even obliquely critical of the Federal Reserve Board, it is like taking on the last American dinosaur. I regret that I do that. But it is the last part, the last institution that remains impervious to the broader public interest. Some think that the Fed is a hero for whatever has happened in our economy. I don't happen to view it that way. I think they view themselves as a set of human brake pads, and they keep their foot on the brake--and good for them. Except that what we have now is a need to put interest rates back where they ought to be for producers and farmers and others, given the fact that overall inflation is down at 1.7 percent over the last twelve months and only 1.5 percent since the beginning of this year. 
Today's announcement was that the Producer Price Index for finished good in August fell 0.4 percent. This means that producer prices have fallen 1.6 percent over the past twenty months. All these numbers augur very hard for the Federal Reserve Board to do something that some suggest they are not prepared to do. I ask Fed Chairman Greenspan and others to see if they can't do what some people now don't expect them to do, but do the right thing: On September 29, we reduce those interest rates. 
Several of us in Congress are considering offering at least a sense-of-the-Congress resolution to send a message to the Fed. Who knows whether it will get through the door there, but at least send a message to say here is what we think. Interest rates have a significant impact on virtually every family in America, on every producer, business and farmer in this country. And my hope is that at the end of this month, given the uncertainty we face in the world, given the numbers from the last quarter here in this country showing a slowing of our economy, and given the historical low rate of inflation and the fact that we are now overpaying because of the Federal Funds Rate, the Federal Reserve Board will finally do the right thing. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this debate and this vote are not about whether we support research on a missile defense system. I am on the Appropriations Committee. I am on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. The Defense appropriations bill has over $3 billion for research and development of theater and national missile defense programs. I expect all Members of the Senate support that. I do. 
But this bill presents us with a different question. This bill would put the Senate on record saying there must be a deployment of a national missile defense system--there must be a deployment as soon as `technologically feasible.' And we must then deploy. 
Well, 25 years ago, we had an antiballistic missile system in North Dakota. I guess that particular system was technologically feasible then. Of course, that system would have used nuclear bombs to intercept and destroy incoming missiles. But it was built, at the cost of over $20 billion in today's terms. Thirty days after it was declared operational, it was mothballed. That system was too expensive and too controversial. 
Let's keep that cautionary tale in mind as we consider this bill. 
If this bill were to pass, the question is, What is technologically feasible? What kind of technology? At what cost? Does cost have any relevance at all? How will the bill affect arms control? Will this bill crowd out spending on other ways of dealing with terrorism? What other defense programs that respond to terrorist threats or rogue nations will then lack funding because we forced deployment of a system when someone said we now have the technology, and we forced deployment notwithstanding costs? 
Frankly, a rogue nation or a terrorist state is much more likely to pose a threat to us with a suitcase nuclear bomb planted in the trunk of a rusty Yugo car at a dock in New York City. The threat is much more likely to be a nuclear weapon put on top of a cruise missile--not an ICBM, but a cruise missile. There is far greater proliferation of cruise missiles and greater access to them. Will this defend against cruise missiles? No. Will it do anything about the suitcase bomb? No. What about a fertilizer bomb in a truck parked in front of a building? No. What about a vial of the most deadly biological agents? Again, no. 
There are a lot of terrorist and rogue nation threats that we ought to be concerned about, and we ought to worry about developing missile defense--and we are. But rushing to say we must deploy now, as soon as it is technologically feasible, notwithstanding any other consideration, makes no sense. 
The Senator from Michigan was asking what this bill would do to arms control. I want to hold up a chart of unclassified pictures to try and show what arms control means. This is a photo from March 26, 1997. It shows the launching of an SSN-20 missile from a Russian submarine in the Barents Sea. The submarine launched a missile, and within minutes the missile was destroyed. And the last picture here shows the missile's pieces falling into the sea. 
Why was that missile destroyed? Because of arms control agreements that we have reached with Russia. There was a whole series of these `launch-to-destruction' launches, because they were an inexpensive way for Russia to destroy its submarine-launched missiles and for us to verify their destruction. That is the way to deal with these threats--a reduction of nuclear weapons, reduction of delivery vehicles. This is the kind of thing, with Nunn-Lugar and other efforts, especially arms control agreements, that results in a real reduction of threat. 
The question is, What will the vote today do to arms control? Will it mean more delivery systems, more nuclear weapons? A greater arms race? I don't think anybody in this Chamber has that answer. My colleague, Senator Conrad, put it well. To those who support--and I think almost all of us do--theater missile 
defenses and the research on national missile defense, it doesn't make any sense to say that notwithstanding any other consideration we must deploy as soon as technologically feasible. That is not, in my judgment, the right thing or the thoughtful thing to do in order to defend this country. 
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have a number of things to complete and to discuss and debate in the coming 5 or 6 weeks before this Congress finishes its work. Many of them are very important. The work of the Appropriations Committee in getting the appropriations bills done on a timely basis is critically important. 
All of us understand that. I am here today to talk about one specific issue that must be addressed. It is an issue that must be addressed on an urgent basis by this Congress before it completes its work in the 105th Congress. The issue is the farm crisis that exists in rural America. 
I come from a rural State, the State of North Dakota, which is the size of 10 Massachusetts in landmass. It has 640,000 residents, and 40 to 50 percent of our State's economy comes from agriculture, and our system of family farming. I have spoken on the floor at some length about the problems and challenges we face these days. 
In the last year, family farmers in our State suffered a 98-percent drop in net farm income. Yes, I said a 98-percent loss of their net income. Now, these are families who have elected, for a variety of reasons, to populate rural America. They own a farm. They raise livestock. They till the soil and produce grain. They produce America's foodstuffs. They take enormous risks, often with very few rewards. They live out in the country and they turn that yard light on at night, and that illuminates a family out there somewhere living on the land trying to make a living. 
What is happening these days in the Farm Belt is that grain prices have collapsed, and livestock prices are way down. These family farmers who have risked everything they have and invested it in their hopes and dreams in making this family farm work, are now all too often standing with tears in their eyes as their farm is being sold at an auction sale. 
This country will lose something important if it loses its family farmers. I suppose we could farm America from California to Maine with giant agrifactories. We could have big corporate farms and a farming system where nobody lives on the land and there are no yard lights because nobody is there at night. Do we want corporate agrifactories farming America? This country will have lost something very important in its culture and in its economy if we lose our family farmers. And, we will lose them if we don't decide as a Congress to take action soon. 
Congress needs to tell farmers that this nation wants to help them through these troubled time. We need to build a bridge across these price valleys, when grain prices, cattle prices and hog prices collapse. We want to help. But, if we don't do that soon, we won't have many farmers left. 
This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, or conservatives and liberals; it is about values and whether we in this Congress believe that family farming contributes to this country. I consider myself a Jeffersonian kind of Democrat. A Jeffersonian Democrat is somebody who really believes in broad-based economic ownership in this country, and who believes that the political freedoms we enjoy in this country could not exist without economic freedom. Such freedom comes only with broad-based economic ownership. It does not come with concentration, nor with big corporations, but with broad-based ownership in which the men and women of America are out there investing in farms and small businesses. Nowhere is that broad-based economic ownership more important and more apparent to the economic health of this country than on America's farms and ranches. 
I was in a Quonset building a couple of days ago in North Dakota. It was in the evening and there was a picnic out on the farmstead. Farmers from all around the county came. About 100 folks gathered there. This young fellow who owned this farm hadn't finished taking off his grain. He had been trying hard, but he hadn't gotten it all off the field yet. As we were in this Quonset hut at this picnic, the clouds began to form out in the west. First they were blue and then almost black. Those clouds came in as part of a vicious, vicious storm. It came with a vengeance with wind, hail, rain. Inside that Quonset, it sounded almost like war as the huge hailstones were hitting that steel roof, making a loud, echoing sound together with the pelting rain. 
I watched those farmers in that Quonset building look at those clouds. I started to understand what that storm meant when tears welled up in their eyes and they were shaking their heads. Some of these farmers knew that storm was probably wiping them out, destroying their crop, and probably destroying their hope to get something off of those fields and get it to the market and pay some bills. 
Those are the risks our farmers face. Two years ago, the Congress passed the farm bill. I didn't vote for it. I didn't think it was a good farm bill. In the last 2 years, wheat prices have dropped 57 percent, right off the table. This is critical to us because wheat is the largest cash crop in North Dakota that the family farmers raise. In addition to wheat prices collapsing on us, we have also had the worst crop disease in the century. The most damaging is known as fusarium head blight or scab. So we have had crop diseases, together with the wet cycle that has fostered these diseases, a collapse in prices, and we have had auction sales all across the State. Family farmers are wondering whether they can continue. Their lenders are saying, `I don't think you can continue because the farm bill Congress passed has decreasing support prices in the out years, and it doesn't look good. Maybe you ought to get out now and save whatever little equity you can.' That is the position farmers now find themselves in too often in rural America. 
So the question for us is what should we do about it? In July this Senate passed a bill that included $500 million in what is called an indemnification program. Senator Conrad and I authored that, along with Senator Craig and others. That bill is now going into conference committee with the House. We need to get that bill through to try to get some short-term help to family farmers. The indemnification program will have to be increased because of other disaster situations. The Texas cotton crop was devastated. Louisiana, Oklahoma, and other States now face an increasing crisis in family farming and in agriculture. 
In addition to that bill, it seems to me the Congress has a responsibility now to reach out to family farmers and say: `We made a mistake a couple years ago. We need to build back some sort of price support program for you. We don't want to tell you when to plant, or how to plant, or what to plant. We don't want to do that. But we want to say that you matter and we care about family farmers, and we want to provide some basic kind of price bridge to get you over these price valleys.' 
We only have a couple of weeks to do that. I find it disturbing that in our economic system that almost everyone who touches something that a farmer grows or produces is making money with it. Farmers buy the seed and they buy the equipment to plant the seed. They put the fertilizer in the ground. They hope it doesn't hail, and that the insects don't come. They hope it doesn't rain too much. And, they hope it rains enough. Then maybe they get a crop. When they harvest the crop, they hope when they put it in the truck and drive it to the elevator, they will get a decent price for it. Any problem along the way may mean they are gone, broke, and out of business. 
Let's assume that farmer gets through the year and harvests the grain and gets a dismal price for it. That is what is happening right now. What happens to this harvest? Somebody puts it on a train and they put it on those tracks and down the tracks it goes. And guess what? The railroads are making money. Do you think they aren't making money off that wheat? The farmer who planted and harvested it didn't, but the railroads are making money, I suspect record profits. Then it goes to a miller. The millers are doing fine. They are making money. Then it goes to some plant someplace where they are going to make breakfast food out of it. They take that kernel of wheat and put it into a plant and they puff it up. They make puffed wheat. They put it in a box and send it to a store and somebody buys the puffed wheat. They are making money off it. The people who move it, the people who puff it and crisp it, and the people who sell it in a store make money. Everyone makes money except the people who produced it. The family farmers don't make money from their harvests. They are going broke. What kind of a system is that? 
Speaking of disconnections in the system, let's look further at our food system. We have a system that doesn't make sense. As farmers go broke we have circumstances where halfway around the world today, we hear that old women are climbing trees in Sudan trying to find leaves to eat because they are on the abyss of starvation. Millions are starving. 
At the very same time an old woman is climbing a tree to get leaves to eat in Sudan, a farmer is loading a 2-ton truck to take to the country elevator, and when they get there, the elevator operator says, `We're sorry, this wheat isn't worth anything; the market has collapsed. This wheat doesn't have value.' What kind of a disconnection is that? In the same world, halfway around the globe, people are starving and those who produce the best foodstuffs in the world are told it doesn't have value. There is something wrong with that picture as well. 
My hope is that in the coming 4 or 5 weeks, Republicans and Democrats will understand that it is our responsibility as a country to say to that this most important sector, the agriculture sector, matters. We need to especially tell our family farmers that they matter and that we are going to make a difference by passing a price support mechanism of some type that gives them a chance to survive. 
Let me add one final piece to this. 
In addition to saying that price supports will be available when prices collapse and we want family farmers to survive, this Congress also ought to do something to help family farmers survive by saying we will correct the problems in the trade agreements that we have negotiated over recent years that have been to the detriment of family farmers. 
Almost no one wants to hear my recitation of the trade problems because they have heard it so often. 
We send negotiators to go to negotiate with Canada, and we have an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. They finish the negotiations, bring the treaty back to Congress, Congress passes the treaty, and the trade deficit doubles. They send negotiators to go negotiate with Mexico. That is done. They send it to Congress, and Congress approves it--not with my vote--and a surplus turns into a big deficit. They send negotiators to go out and negotiate a GATT agreement. The same thing: Record trade deficits. 
Mr. President, there is something wrong. 
Mr. President, there is something dreadfully wrong when our family farmers and other producers in this country--but especially family farmers--are told: `You compete in the open market. It is a global economy. You go compete.' And our negotiators somehow fail to suit up. I don't think it should be necessary for our negotiators to wear a jersey reminding them for whom they are negotiating. But, somehow they should be reminded. Maybe we ought to have our negotiators wear a jersey like they wear in the Olympics that says `USA' just so they understand whom they represent. Maybe the next time they bring a trade treaty back to the U.S. Senate they can bring one back that serves our economic interest. We need trade agreements that are not driven by foreign policy, but instead are guided by hard-nosed economic policy that represents our economic interests. 
Now we are told that in the next week or so we are going to have fast-track trade authority brought to the floor of the Senate. Good luck. This fast track is going to do more of the same trade stuff that got us into this trouble. Not with my vote. I intend to stand here and object to every single thing that is asked and every single thing that is requested to get fast track to the floor of the Senate. I am only one person. I probably can't stop it. But I can sure slow it down some. I fully intend to do that. 
I have something to say to those folks who are so all-fired anxious to bring fast-track trade authority back to the floor of the Senate based on the package already reported out of the Senate Finance Committee. If you are so anxious to talk about trade, why don't you figure out how to deal with the problems created in our previous trade agreements. Before you start trying to figure out how you send people over to do new trade treaties with other countries, fix a few of the problems. Fix the problems with Canada. Tell our farmers why a flood of Canadian grain can come across in this direction, and a pickup truck with a few kernels gets stopped at the Canadian border, and they have to sweep the few kernels off because you can't take a few kernels of wheat into Canada. Tell our farmers how that is free trade. It is not. Fix those trade agreements before you come to us talking about more fast-track trade agreements. 
I just want to say this to the majority leader and others. If you think this place is going to move quickly, trying to bring fast track to the floor of the Senate is a sure fire way of slowing down the proceedings of the Senate. I guarantee it. Fast track will not solve the farm crisis. It is the farm crisis that has to be our priority in the remaining few weeks of this session. 
I hope very much that we can agree on a bipartisan basis on the need and the urgency to address the farm crisis. I hope that we can do that on a bipartisan basis. Farmers don't get up in the morning or go to bed at night as Republicans or Democrats. They don't care with respect to their long-term economic survival whether it is a Republican or a Democratic plan. They care about whether it is a plan that works. They need a plan that says to them that we care about them and their future. 
I hope that all of us who come from farm country and who represent rural America can join together and decide to do something meaningful, something real, and something that really does help family farmers before we adjourn this 105th Congress. 
I wanted to make those comments because in the next week or so I expect there will be amendments offered once again on the floor of the Senate dealing with farm price supports that need to be passed. I will also be involved in the Appropriations Committee in conference with the House to move forward with the $500 million indemnification program which Senator Conrad and I and others authored and that we have already passed through the Senate. And we may be working on other issues as well, including the trade issue that I just described. 
Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Washington for allowing me to make some interim comments. I noticed I wasn't interrupted. I guess that means no one showed up to offer an amendment on his Interior bill. 
Let me also say that I am a member of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the subcommittee. I very much respect his leadership. I think he does an excellent job with this piece of legislation. I say that because tomorrow I intend to offer an amendment that I hope he will perhaps accept. But I thank him again for allowing me the time to interrupt the legislation on the floor. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last Saturday morning at 12:01 a.m., labor negotiations between Northwest Airlines and its pilots broke down. There was a labor strike and, therefore, a shutdown of Northwest operations. The result of that shutdown of operations means that all jet airplane service to North Dakota is gone. The shutdown has a substantial impact on our entire region of the country, but on our State it has a profound impact because all jet service is now gone. There is not one jet flying in or out of North Dakota. 
I have talked to President Clinton. I have talked to Secretary of Transportation Slater. I have talked to Northwest Airlines and I have talked to the pilots. 
It is clear to me that this labor dispute is not going to be settled in the coming hours. We have waited now for several days following the shutdown, during which the Transportation Secretary called the parties together. But even from that, there is not a negotiation ongoing. None is scheduled tomorrow, and none is scheduled the next day, as I understand it. It is now clear to me this will not be settled quickly unless the President invokes his emergency powers. 
This dispute is about corporate profits and pilots' paychecks, and they have every right to have a dispute about that. But no one has a right to visit on our State the burden and the devastating consequences that occur when an essential part of our transportation system is withdrawn, when all jet service is withdrawn, and that is what has happened in North Dakota. 
Today, my colleagues, Senator Conrad and Congressman Pomeroy, and I have asked President Clinton to appoint a Presidential emergency board, and to call the parties back to work to restore service to our State. During the 60-day period, we want the President to help resolve a settlement in this dispute and to end this shutdown. We don't do this lightly. We understand that this is an important step. 
I don't know who is at fault, but I know who is hurt. In a State like ours, where all jet airplane service is gone, there are devastating consequences. Because the airline industry has now retreated into regional monopolies, a shutdown of service or a labor strike causes devastation to certain regions of the country. This can no longer be business as usual. We must ask this President to invoke his emergency powers and get airline service restored to our region of the country. 
Mr. President, one final point. We also ask that the regional carrier in North Dakota that has also discontinued service, Mesaba Airlines, of which Northwest is a minority shareholder, restore its service to our State as well. We are preparing a request to the president of Mesaba and to Northwest to do that. 
This is a very difficult step for me and my colleagues to take, but we have no choice. We cannot allow day after day after day to go by with our State suffering the impact and the burden of a dispute that has resulted in the discontinuation of all jet service in North Dakota. It is unfair to the citizens of North Dakota and our region, and I want the President to put a stop to it and restore air service in our region immediately. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask the Senator to yield for a question. This is a critically important issue that affects tens and tens of millions of Americans. It deals with the question of whether, when they show up and are ill and need health care treatment, they are going to be told by their attending physician who is working for a managed care organization all of their options for medical treatment or just the cheapest. We have talked day after day in this Chamber about how these issues deal with the life and death of patients. 
We had one story here about a managed care organization that evaluated a young boy and determined that because he had only a 50 percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, it was determined insignificant and he shall not therefore be eligible for the therapy--a 50 percent chance of walking by age 5 is insignificant so don't help him. These are important issues. 
Now, the question I ask the Senator from South Dakota, we have put together legislation, we have developed legislation that I think is very important and we have been working very hard to try to get it to the floor of the Senate. We spent days debating the renaming of an airport, but apparently we don't have time to deal with the issue of managed care reform and a Patients' Bill of Rights. How many months have we been trying to get a time to get this issue to the floor of the Senate so that we can debate it and deal with this issue? I ask the minority leader, how many months have we worked to try to get this issue to the floor of the Senate for debate?

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, just another point. I regret that there is opposition to the request. It seems to me the request is appropriate. Do the appropriations bills, do the conference reports, but make time at least to do this issue. We have talked about in this Chamber the stories of someone whose neck was broken, taken to an emergency room, and told you can't get this covered because you didn't have prior approval, brought to the emergency room with a broken neck, unconscious. So I mean these issues go on and on and on, the stories go on forever, and the question is, Is the Congress going to address it? Is Congress going to deal with it? Does the Congress think it is an important issue? If it thinks it is an important issue, then we ought to be debating it on the floor of the Senate; we ought to make time and allow for discussion. That is what the Senate is about. I hope, I say to the Senator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, I hope very much that we continue to push and continue to press, and we will not take no for an answer. We want this piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate for full and open debate so we can resolve this issue on behalf of all Americans. 
I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to join this tribute to Kent Hall, following on the remarks offered by Senator Harkin from Iowa and my colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota. 
I knew Kent Hall, who was Senator Conrad's chief of staff, for 12 years in the time that he had served North Dakota and served with Senator Conrad. I was shocked to learn Saturday morning that Kent had died Friday evening in his sleep. 
I know how difficult it is for his family right now. I know how difficult it is for Senator Conrad and his staff, the extended family that worked with Kent Hall and served with him in the Senate. 
We lead busy, fast-paced and challenging lives here. Kent Hall was a part of that. We, from time to time, I suppose, forget to tell people what an integral role people like Kent Hall play to make this system of ours work. Kent Hall was smart, was tough, and yet had a great sense of humor. He was a quick study. He worked very hard. He always had a twinkle in his eye. He was quite an extraordinary man. 
He always, to me, had a certain dignity about him as well. When Kent was around in a meeting or with a group of people, he was always the one who had that certain sense of dignity. Yes, he had the sense of humor, but he had a sense of dignity that was unusual as well. 
The last time I talked to Kent, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago before the August recess, and what we talked about then was what he talked about a lot--it was his children. We talked about our children. He leaves behind two young children. And we talked about them. 
I know how difficult this must be now for his widow and his children. Kent Hall was a young man with a young family. He had an enormous commitment to that family. He also had a commitment to our State and to our country. That commitment was a commitment that was manifested every day in every way in his public service to all of us. 
So today I express my sorrow and my sympathy for the passing of Kent Hall. 
Emily Dickinson wrote a poem called `Because I could not stop for Death.' I want to read two verses of it. 
Because I could not stop for Death, 
He kindly stopped for me; 
The carriage held but just ourselves 
And Immortality. 
We slowly drove, he knew no haste, 
And I had put away 
My labor, and my leisure too, 
For his civility. 
It is very, very hard, for those of us who have seen too many at too young an age leave us, to understand any civility in a death like the death of Kent Hall. But I hope that his contributions, as a family man and as a public servant, will be known to his family and his children by these remarks and by other words that will be spoken in the coming days. 
His children, I believe, are age 4 and 2. And I hope they will someday understand that their daddy was a very special man. Their father contributed to their family and their country in a very important way. And those of us who were privileged to call him a friend will miss him dearly. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to make some remarks on the subject of the farm crisis that exists in North Dakota and other parts of the country. North Dakota is faced with a combination of collapsed grain prices and crop disease. This has produced a farm crisis that is very, very serious and to which this Congress must respond. 
In my home State of North Dakota, net farm income has dropped 98 percent in 1 year. That's right; a 98-percent drop in net farm income in 1 year. Ask yourself what would be the result for you, your neighbor, or your community, if you experienced a 98-percent drop in net income? 
Many third and fourth generation farmers have been unable to get an operating loan this season due to low grain prices. They have had so many auction sales on North Dakota farms that they have had to call retired auctioneers back from retirement to handle the auction sales. Every one of these auction sales represents a family farmer who has worked hard, and invested everything they have, to run a family farm. And then they discover they can't make it. 
I'd like to share it with you a poem written by Luella F. Hermanson of Hampden, North Dakota. She describes what the farm crisis has done to her community and what it will do to ours unless we take decisive action. 
When the Farmers All Shut Down  
They're selling out my neighbor 
It's his auction sale today 
Life's hard out in the country 
We can't farm the good old way 
Remember neighbor helping neighbor 
It's not like that anymore 
We're hanging on by just our boot straps 
Wondering what we have in store 
What will our city cousins do 
When the farm boys move to town 
Will there be jobs for all of them 
When our farms are all shut down 
Who'll buy that big machinery 
Standing idle on the lots 
And the gas and parts and fuel oil 
They might have to close their shops 
Who'll buy the fertilizer 
and the spray to kill the weeds 
They'll probably close the diner 
There'll be no one left to feed 
There'll be no grain to borrow on 
So the bank will close its door 
The insurance boys will duck and run 
When we can't pay them anymore 
Who'll buy the tractors, plows and trucks 
Or plant the barley, beans and wheat 
Who'll pick the rocks and mow the roads 
And smile in dark defeat 
Who'll spend forty bucks an hour 
To fix a combine in the fall 
And his last red cent to save his land 
When his back's against the wall 
Yes they're selling out my neighbor 
Heard he's moving into town 
What will happen to this land we love 
When farmers all shut down.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the Managers of this bill, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, for the fine job they have done on this important legislation. It has been my great pleasure to work with the Managers as a member of the Defense Subcommittee, and they do a masterful job of balancing many competing needs and interests in this bill. 
Mr. President, I would like to call the Chairman's attention to one key provision in the committee report. In the Defense-Wide Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation section, the committee has included report language regarding the importance of anti-corrosion technologies to the Department of Defense. As the report says `New anti-corrosion technologies are needed to prevent corrosion, reduce corrosion-related costs, and extend the life of aircraft in a manner compatible with environmental concerns.' 
North Dakota State University has a long history of excellence and nationally-recognized expertise in polymers and coatings, and has received significant competitively-awarded funding to investigate new methods of fighting corrosion. Last year DoD awarded a $2 million competitive grant to NDSU for this purpose. Mr. President, given NDSU's expertise in this area and DoD's experience working with NDSU, does the Chairman believe NDSU would be well-qualified to compete for this work?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express my concern about the lack of funding within the Senate's Department of Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 for schools that have been heavily impacted by their proximity to military installations. 
Fortunately, the House bill does include $35 million for this purpose, and I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will be working through my position on the House-Senate conference committee to see that this funding is preserved. 
This extra assistance is needed by schools on or near our military bases because their tax base is eroded by the large amount of federal land taken off the tax rolls. In addition, military personnel often are not required to pay local taxes, which support the schools, even if they have children enrolled in those schools. The DOD funding would be aimed at those schools most in need of the extra aid--school districts whose student population is made up of at least 20 percent military children. 
This funding is sufficiently important to the quality of life of military personnel and their families that both the House and Senate fiscal year 1999 Defense Authorization bills authorize $35 million for this purpose. It is my strong hope that the Congress will see fit to include this funding in the final version of the Defense Appropriations bill.

Mr. DORGAN. You did call within the last hour or so. I indicated to you there was no problem with this provision, and I do not object to this provision. 
But I do want to make the point that the Senate has debated and passed an emergency provision calling for $500 million of indemnity payments. That is the only new money available. It is the only new money around in the appropriations process. If it is completed by October 1, then perhaps we may get money into the pockets of some farmers. We have seen prices collapse even further in recent weeks. It may get money into the hands of some farmers, perhaps in October--unlikely--perhaps November, maybe December. 
My proposition is that to the extent that we have already debated this subject, the Senate, by 99 to nothing, has said we have an emergency in farm country. They have already passed a $500 million indemnity payment program. It makes eminent good sense to me that we would be able to pass that indemnity program this evening and move it to the House. Does the House want to deal with it? I don't know. But they won't have an opportunity to deal with it in any timely way if we don't proceed. 
I have no objection at all to what the Senator is requesting. I simply ask that he consider, and we consider, taking the $500 million we have already decided upon and see if we can't move that to the hands of family farmers, many of whom are desperately strapped for cash. 
As soon as the Senator has completed getting his unanimous consent and as soon as I am able to get the floor, I intend to ask unanimous consent the Senate will proceed to the bill providing the $500 million of agriculture indemnity payments, which was agreed to as an amendment to the agricultural appropriations bill, and the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. 
If someone objects to that, fine. But I hope they would not object to it. We will not object to this. I think this may help. I hope you will not object to that, because I know it will help. It would help in a more timely way than will be the case if we wait until after recess, and farmers have to wait until November or December. Perhaps we can help farmers to get some help from that provision earlier.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a new and disastrous farm crisis is roaring through the Upper Midwest. Family farmers are under severe assault and many of them are simply not making it. It's not their fault. It's just that the combination of bad weather, crop disease, low yield, low prices and bad federal farm policy is too much to handle. Under the current federal farm law there is no price safety net. Farmers are--as they were in the 1930's --at the mercy of forces much bigger than they are. 
The exodus occurring from family farms in the Upper Midwest is heart-breaking and demands the immediate attention of this Congress. We need to address this problem both within the farm program and in other policy areas as well. 
For example, Mr. President, there's a fundamental flaw in the tax code that we need to fix. It adds insult to injury for many of these farmers. You see, too often, these family farmers are not able to take full advantage of the $500,000 capital gains tax break that city folks get when they sell their homes. Once family farmers have been beaten down and forced to sell the farm they've farmed for generations, they get a rude awakening. Many of them discover, as they leave the farm, that Uncle Sam is waiting for them at the end of the lane with a big tax bill. 
One of the most popular provisions included in last year's major tax bill permits families to exclude from federal income tax up to $500,000 of gain from the sale of their principal residences. That's a good deal, especially for most urban and suburban dwellers who have spent many years paying for their houses, and who regard their houses as both a home and a retirement account. For many middle income families, their home is their major financial asset, an asset the family can draw on in retirement. House prices in major growth markets such as Washington, D.C., New York, or California may start at hundreds of thousands of dollars. As a result, the urban dwellers who have owned their homes through many years of appreciation can often benefit from a large portion of this new $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion. Unfortunately this provision, as currently applied, is virtually useless to family farmers. 
For farm families, their farm is their major financial asset. Unfortunately, family farmers under current law receive little or no benefit from the new $500,000 exclusion because the IRS separates the value of their homes from the value of the farmland the homes sit on. As people from my state of North Dakota know, houses out on the farmsteads of rural America are more commonly sold for $5,000 to $40,000. Most farmers plow any profits they make into the whole farm rather than into a house that will hold little or no value when the farm is sold. It's not surprising that the IRS often judges that homes far out in the country have very little value and thus farmers receive much less benefit from this $500,000 exclusion than do their urban and suburban counterparts. As a result, the capital gain exclusion is little or no help to farmers who are being forced out of business. They may immediately face a hefty capital gains tax bill from the IRS. 
This is simply wrong, Mr. President. It is unfair. Federal farm policy helped create the hole that many of these farmers find themselves in. Federal tax policy shouldn't dig the hole deeper as they attempt to shovel their way out. 
The legislation that I'm introducing today recognizes the unique character and role of our family farmers and their important contributions to our economy. It expands the $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for sales of principal residences to cover family farmers who sell their farmhouses or surrounding farmland, so long as they are actively engaged in farming prior to the sales. In this way, farmers may get some benefit from a tax break that would otherwise be unavailable to them. 
I fully understand that this legislation is not a cure-all for financial hardships that are ailing our farm communities. This legislation is just one of a number of policy initiatives we can use to ease the pain for family farmers as we pursue other initiatives to help turn around the crippled farm economy. 
Again, my legislation would expand the $500,000 tax exclusion for principle residences to cover the entire farm. Specifically, the provision will allow a family or individual who has actively engaged in farming prior to the farm sale to exclude the gain from the sale up to the $500,000 maximum. 
What does this relief mean to the thousands of farmers who are being forced to sell off the farm due to current economic conditions? 
Take, for example, a farmer who is forced to leave today because of crop disease and slumping grain prices and sells his farmstead that his family has operated for decades. If he must report a gain of $10,000 on the sale of farm house, that is all he can exclude under current law. But if, for example, he sold 1000 acres surrounding the farm house for $400,000, and the capital gain was $200,000, he would be subject to $40,000 tax on that gain. Again, my provision excludes from tax the gain on the farmhouse and land up to the $500,000 maximum that is otherwise available to a family on the sale of its residence. 
We must wage, on every federal and state policy front, the battle to stem the loss of family farmers. Tax provisions have grown increasingly important as our farm families deal with drought, floods, diseases and price swings. 
I believe that Congress should move quickly to pass this legislation and other meaningful measures to help get working capital into the hands of our family farmers in the Great Plains. Let's stop penalizing farmers who are forced out of agriculture. Let's allow farmers to benefit from the same kind of tax exclusion that most homeowners already receive. This is the right thing to do. And it's the fair thing to do.

Mr. DORGAN. I simply wanted to make the point that the reason I asked the unanimous consent request really has nothing to do with the request by others to advance the Agriculture Marketing Assistance Act, or AMTA payments as they are called, under the Freedom to Farm bill. I didn't object to that. If that will help a producer here and there, that is good. Anything that helps gets assistance into the pockets of family farmers, I am for that. So I didn't object to that. I told folks this evening I wouldn't object to that. 
But, this is not new money at all. This is just a payment that they are supposed to get later on. Now, they might get this payment earlier or at least they will have the option to get it earlier. 
I was thinking about the farmer who testified yesterday at our farm policy hearing. This was young fellow from South Dakota who testified. When he talked about putting the crop in this spring, he could barely continue. His chin was quivering, and he had tears in his eyes. He talked about having to find something on his farm to sell in order to get the money together to put in his crop. Then things went bad for him and he was out of money again. He had to sell some of the feed for his cattle that he put aside for this winter. 
He didn't have any money. He talks about the need to feed his kids, the need to provide for his family. He could barely continue because he was talking about something that is much more than a business. It is a way of life. This was life, and his dream. I had a call from a guy in Sarles, ND. You could hear the pain in his voice. Everything that he has, everything that he owns, everything that he aspires to, everything that he has fought and worked for in his family is on the line. He said, `You know, I'm going to harvest my barley and I'm going to have to take it right to the elevator. Prices have crashed, I am not going to get anything for it. I don't have a choice. I have to pay back my lender, and feed my family.' The pain was so evident in his voice. He was asking, `What can I do? Is there help someplace?' 
The point of both of these producers is that they didn't cause these conditions. They didn't cause the Asian financial crisis that has caused our exports to start to slow down and prices collapse. They didn't cause the crop diseases that have devastated these crops. They didn't cause the price collapse of wheat and barley. It is not their fault. The question for this country is whether we are going to have any family farmers left. And, does anybody care about that? 
This Senate did something that I thought was the right thing to do. We passed an indemnity program of $500 million. Frankly, that is going to have to increase substantially. Since that time, in the last several weeks, we have learned that the Texas cotton crop is gone, with over $2 billion in damage. In Louisiana and Oklahoma, the agricultural economies are devastated. So the $500 million is going to have to be increased. The point is, while I think advancing the Freedom to Farm payments is fine, I think we can do more by deciding to take the $500 million we have already agreed upon and advance that and move that out. 
The earliest farmers are going to get these indemnity payments would be perhaps November or December. Tonight, we could have taken that $500 million and made it available. We could have sent it to the House, and let them pass it. Next week, or the week after, the Department of Agriculture could have begun to try to deal with this deepening farm crisis. This isn't an ordinary crisis. I have mentioned before that we have so many auction sales of family farms in North Dakota that they were calling auctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales. You can go to those sales and see these little tykes wearing their britches and cowboy hats with hair in their eyes, wondering why mom and dad have to sell the farm, and why their life is going to change. You can see the husband and wife with tears in their eyes, watching people bid on their machinery. Most of the equipment is old because they can't afford the new machinery. You can see the pain being suffered out in the great plains. 
I am disappointed tonight. I wish we could have done what we have already decided to do. We should make $500 million available now. We should do it sooner rather than later. We will come back in September and have another significant debate. Advancing the Freedom to Farm payment is fine. It may help some producers. If it does, I am for that. But we must do more. This Congress must decide that family farmers matter. This isn't just about dollars and cents, or about economic theory. With all that is going on in agriculture, including unfair trade, unfair competition, a choked market, monopolies up and down and sideways, and everywhere, we are losing something very important. We are losing family farmers. Then all the yard lights will be turned off on these farms. You will fly from California to Maine and you won't see family farms because agri-factories don't have yard lights. They plow as far as you can plow for 10 hours, and they plow back. There will be nobody living out in the country. That seed bed of family values that existed and that nurtures us from small towns to America's cities, and which has always refreshed this country will be gone. Then somebody will scratch their head and say: What happened to our country? What will have happened is that this Congress didn't understand, as some other countries do, that family farmers make a difference in our national life. It is not just dollars and cents. It is a lot more than some economic calculation made by those who give us a bunch of constipated theories about agriculture. This is everyday living by farm families that just ask for an even chance to make a decent living. Yet they are confronted in every direction by monopolies, price collapse, disease, and then by a Government that says they want to pull the rug out from under them on price supports. 
What if the Government tried to do that on the minimum wage? They would say, `Let's reduce the minimum wage to $1 an hour and call it freedom to work.' It's the same thing. The fact is, we must come back here in September and have a real debate about real policies that will give family farmers in this country a real opportunity to make a decent living. They are the economic all stars in this country. Make no mistake about it. This country will make a serious mistake if it turns its back to the economic opportunity that ought to be offered to the family farmers in this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I am trying to understand the difference. We voted on a tabling motion. We went actually to a recorded vote on a tabling motion on this amendment. Then, immediately after the tabling motion failed, the author of the amendment said he was going to withdraw it because apparently it would be blue-slipped and, therefore, inappropriate, and, second, violates the Budget Act. 
What is the difference between voting to table and then being the author and deciding it violates the Budget Act and it is also a blue-slip problem, and therefore I am going to withdraw it? Is there any distinction between a vote to table and a decision by the author to withdraw, in the Senator's opinion?

Mr. DORGAN. I inquire of the Senator from South Dakota, the representation was made by the author of the amendment, after the vote, `We now have some expression of who in the Senate wants to abolish the marriage tax penalty.' We have had other votes on that constructed in different ways, constructed in ways that don't use the Social Security trust funds in order to provide this kind of tax relief. But, could one also not make the point that those who voted against tabling were casting a vote to violate the Budget Act? If, in fact, the amendment as offered violated the Budget Act, could one not construe a vote in opposition to tabling to say, by those who cast that vote, we would like to violate the Budget Act here? I mean, there are all kinds of motives, I suppose. I don't want to ascribe motives to anyone. But it seems to me, to have a tabling vote here on the floor of the Senate and then decide by that tabling vote who cares or does not care about the marriage tax penalty, and then withdraw the amendment and then stand up and say, `Now we know who cares and doesn't care,' it seems to me you could also put different interpretations on that same vote. Perhaps the people who decided they didn't care whether it violated the Budget Act cast a vote to say we didn't care about the Budget Act. Would that be a fair construction?

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Kansas makes a fair point. I think he makes his point with some credibility on the issue of the marriage tax penalty. I understand that. I think most people find most Members of the Senate agree with him. When, in the Tax Code, you have a penalty with respect to the income tax for certain married couples, we ought to do something to address that. I just observed, however, that the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Missouri offered an amendment that addresses it and then withdrew the amendment because it apparently violates the Budget Act and would be blue-slipped in any event because a revenue measure of this type must be advanced first in the House of Representatives by the Ways and Means Committee. 
The reason I stood, following the vote on tabling this amendment, was I did not want this to be interpreted as the Senator from Kansas was interpreting it, that this tabling motion was a description of who in the Senate cares about the marriage tax penalty. I think there are many Members of the Senate who agree with the Senator that the marriage tax penalty ought to be eliminated. It ought to be eliminated. We ought to find a way to do that. We ought to find the right way to do that. 
The question is, When you eliminate the marriage tax penalty, as the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee indicated, where do you make up the revenue? Exactly how do you construct something that makes up the revenue you lose when you eliminate the marriage tax penalty? I think it is a worthy effort for this Congress and future Congresses to embark upon. But as we have discussed before, the proposition that was offered this morning would lose a substantial amount of revenue we now have. The proposal did not offer methods by which that would be made up. I think we have to do that. That is precisely why it violated the Budget Act. 
I have heard a great deal of debate by a number of Senators here on the floor--the Senator from Kansas, from Missouri, and others. As the Senator knows, there have been other proposals to address the marriage tax penalty on the floor of the Senate that have also gotten a number of votes, and I have voted for addressing that issue, because I think it is a worthy issue to address. 
So I just thought it was curious that we had a proposal that I think costs over $100 billion or so that had a blue slip problem and a problem of violating the Budget Act, that we debate it and then we have a tabling motion, and we allow people to vote not to table it, and then stand up and say those who voted not to table it care about dealing with the marriage penalty and, by inference, those who voted to table it do not care. Then the vote is over and it is not tabled, it is still prevailing here in the Senate, still pending as the Senate business, and then it is withdrawn precisely because it has the problems those who voted to table it allege that it had. 
I just want to make the point, you will find support and we will find support, I think, when you and a number of us together address the marriage tax penalty in a thoughtful way and in a way that does not bust the Budget Act and does not create a blue slip and does not propose solutions for which there are not revenues in order to make up the shortfall. 
I appreciate the attention of the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Missouri. Let me end by saying, again, it is a worthy subject for the Senate to consider, but we cannot consider it in ways that violate the Budget Act. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a few comments about the amendment that has just been offered to the Senate. 
The sponsor of the amendment asked the question: How long? How long, he asks, will it take to get rid of the current Tax Code? 
The answer to that is simply a long, long time, if the Senator who offers this amendment, and others, suggest to us that we should, for example, have a national sales tax of 30 percent or more. If the folks who have gotten rid of this Tax Code have implemented a 30 percent national sales tax--and, yes, that is what would be required to be implemented to replace it--if you buy a house, they will say, `Yes, that house is $120,000, but then there is a 30 percent sales tax on top of that.' A fellow named William Gale from the Brookings Institution wrote a policy brief on this: `Don't Buy the Sales Tax.' 
The reason I am discussing this is, the Senator does not tell us with what he would replace the Tax Code. He simply says, `Let's get rid of the current Tax Code.' 
There is plenty wrong with the current Tax Code. Count me among those who would like to change the things that are wrong, but count me among those who ask the question of the Senator who offers this amendment, What do you propose to replace it with? 
My understanding is, the Senator who offers this amendment at one point was a cosponsor of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for a national sales tax. My understanding is, he took his name off of that bill. Am I mistaken about that? Did the Senator add his name?

Mr. DORGAN. Let me reclaim my time. 
I appreciated the Senator's response. My understanding was--and we can determine this--but my understanding was that early in this Congress, the Senator added his name as a cosponsor to a resolution here in the Senate calling for a national sales tax. My understanding is he subsequently withdrew his name from that, but we can discuss that, I guess, with respect to the people who have the records. 
My point is this, Mr. Gale, who writes about the sales tax down at the Brookings Institution, says that if you had a national sales tax and are going to include all of the things that you need to include to make up the revenue, that you have to have a sales tax of 30 percent or more. 
The only reason I am raising this question is, What do you intend to replace the current Tax Code with? A value-added tax? A national sales tax? Or any one of a half dozen other iterations? I do not know. 
Then I ask the following question: With whatever you replace the current tax with, do you intend to provide for a deduction for home mortgage interest paid by someone who has just purchased a home and is banking in the coming years on being able to deduct that home mortgage interest? Is that part of some future plan or not? 
Does one intend, for example, to provide for a deduction for health insurance costs? Our current tax program in this country largely provides for that as a business deduction. I am told that if that deduction is eliminated, studies show that anywhere from 6 to 14 million more Americans will no longer have health insurance coverage. 
Or what about charitable giving? Would what is proposed to replace this with--whatever that is; we don't know what that is--would it provide for a deduction for charitable giving? Some 1.4 million tax-exempt organizations worry about that. At least one study suggests that perhaps charitable giving could be reduced by some $33 billion. 
So I ask the question, What does one propose to replace this with? I say to my friend from Arkansas, I certainly do not mean to misrepresent your record. I had been told that the Senator had at one point added his name to a sales tax resolution. It is not my intention to misrepresent that. If that is not the case, then I do not intend to assert that. 
But whatever the case is about the Senator from Arkansas and what he harbors to replace this tax with, whatever that is, at some point someone is going to have to say, `By the way, here is what I feel this should be replaced with. And here is how it is going to affect you.' 
So I ask the Senator from Arkansas, since he is proposing that we eliminate the current Tax Code by a certain date, could he tell us--and I would be glad to yield for an answer--could he tell us what he proposes to replace it with? 
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask a more specific question. 
I think the Senator said: I don't know what we should replace this with. I think that was the answer. Let me ask a more specific question. If, in fact, one of the alternatives would be a national sales tax--and certainly that is one of the alternatives--and if it would require about a 30-percent tax rate, as it would according to studies, would the Senator believe that that is an inappropriate replacement for the current Tax Code?

Mr. DORGAN. I think what the Senator is saying, in response to my question, however, is he does not know what he would replace the Tax Code with. He does not know how it would affect the American people, does not know its impact on the economy. That represents a fear by a lot of people. For example, it represents a fear by the group of folks who represent the largest corporations in this country who work on the tax policies for--I could read the list of corporations, but it is virtually a who's who--Hewlett Packard, BellSouth, Alcan Aluminum, so on and so forth. Here is what they say. Listen to what they say: 
We're writing to express the institute's serious concern about proposals to sunset the IRS Code on a designated date without specifying a replacement tax system. In our view, these proposals reflect either a misapprehension of the importance of certainty and predictability to business enterprises and individuals or a disregard for the consequences of terminating the tax system. They illustrate the folly of making tax policy by sound bite, and it ought to be rejected. 
I know these are the folks who run America's businesses who say we need some certainty and predictability. They are not against reform. That is not what they are saying. But they are saying that they need to understand what it is you want to do. 
You want to sunset the Tax Code on the one hand, and then I ask the question, `But what do you want to do on the other hand?' You say that just as the Sun sets in the evening, it is going to come up in the morning. That is true. Just as you sunset the Tax Code now, you are going to replace it with something. That is true. The question is, With what? And you do not have an answer. 
So is it reasonable for us to ask the question, Is part of the answer a national sales tax or not? If it is not, let us decide it is not. Is part of it a value-added tax or not? If it is not, let us say it is not. If it is, let us decide who it impacts and how it impacts in the American economy.

Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, I do understand what the Senator is saying. Let us force a solution. But he does not have a logical solution. Let us tell the person on A Street or B Street or 10th Street or 12th Street that we want to get rid of the current Tax Code--but he has no idea how he wants to replace it. 
There is a very big difference between those who would tax someone's income at 14 percent and those who would impose a national sales tax at 30 percent and those who would impose a value-added tax at 17 percent. There is a very big difference in how it impacts people. 
The Senator wants to suggest, `Gee, this is some innocent little proposal of mine. Let's just get rid of the entire Tax Code' which, by the way, violates the Budget Act. And he knows that. `Let's get rid of the entire Tax Code and leave for some future debate the ability to cogitate the kind of Tax Code we might consider for tomorrow.' 
Count me as among those who want to make changes in our Tax Code. I mean, do not count me as part of the target that the Senator was aiming at when he was talking about all of these `they, they, they' and `fear, fear, fear.' Just count me as part of the group who says, `Yes, let's make some changes in our Tax Code.' 
But also count me as part of a group who believes that if you are going to propose something to force solutions, you ought to have some notion in hand about what those solutions ought to be and how much is necessary to be collected in our revenue system in this country to pay for the needed social services? 
We build roads to go to market because we do not want to each build a road separately. That would not make much sense. We build schools together so we can send our kids to public schools. We do not need each of us to have a school in our own home. So we do things together. We provide for common defense. We have a Pentagon. We pay the men and women of the military to provide for the common defense of this country. That costs money. We, therefore, must raise that money. And the question is, How? 
We have an income tax system that isn't a very good system. You will not find disagreement here about that. But you will find profound disagreement about a proposal that says, let us simply scrap the current tax system with no notion in mind about what you might replace it with. Precisely for this reason, I have watched some people trot around this Capitol Building, and on a good day they even gallop and canter, alive and interested in their notion about how the Tax Code ought to be changed. Some of them very much want to go to a national sales tax and the Senator knows that. 
They want to go to a national sales tax. That will have a substantial impact on a lot of families; some good, some bad. Some of them want to go to a value-added tax . Some of them want to go to other forms of taxation. All of them will have significant consequences. 
But the Senator from Arkansas says let's not debate the ideas, consequences or the solutions. He says let's debate some mechanism to force the problem, which also probably violates the Budget Act. I don't understand that. I guess we will have a vote up or down on a proposal that sunsets the entire Tax Code, with the author telling me that he doesn't know what it ought to be replaced with and that we ought to just figure out some way to get from here to there by some protracted debate. 
I don't think that is a particularly good way to legislate. I think the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a man for whom the Senator from Arkansas has great affection, as he says, as do I, I think he has it exactly right. This is not a good way to make tax policy. There would be an opportunity for the Senator from Arkansas to bring to the floor his best idea about exactly how the Tax Code ought to be changed. He can do that at 7 o'clock tonight; the best idea he has or anybody has about how to change the Tax Code in this country. And then let people gnaw on it, chew on it and see what they think, and have a vote on it. But that is not what he and some others choose to do. They choose to bring some shapeless package to sunset the current Tax Code, and to replace it with nothing except some hope in the future that someone will do something to provide the revenue in some undescribed way. 
Again I don't believe that is a good way to legislate. Neither does the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, a Republican. Neither does the National Association of Manufacturers. Neither does the Tax Executive Institute, and many others.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. The Senator obviously misunderstood what I said. I was responding to a policy brief prepared by William Gale at the Brookings Institution that says `Don't Buy the Sales Tax.' 
I have yielded. Let me have the floor. 
I was talking about comparing the income tax to the sales tax. As the Senator would know, I think there is a substantially different base. Dr. Gale talked about this. I would like the opportunity to send it to the Senator's office for his perusal. 
On page 4 of the 10-page report documenting a study he had done, he says a 30-percent tax rate would be needed on the more familiar tax-exclusive approach on a national sales tax. He is one of the preeminent authorities on this issue in the country. I have met with him, talked to him, and enjoyed his work a great deal. I think he has done a lot of good work on the question, What would a national sales tax have to be? What would it look like? Who would it impact? 
One of the things I find most interesting, whether it is on the sales tax or the VAT tax, is that those in both the House and the Senate with specific tax plans to replace the current Tax Code always come up a couple hundred billion short in revenue. 
What they say is, I want to sunset the current Tax Code, and here is my substitute for it, and my substitute is a couple hundred billion dollars short. They won't say that, but that is the way they are evaluated when done fairly. Count me in on that. Gee, if you don't have to come up with something that responds to the same revenue base, we now have to meet the needs we have, then, gosh, maybe we should come up with something that raises only 50 percent of the revenue. Or how about 10 percent of the revenue. That is a wonderful way to do business. 
I see the people walking around with plans that would, A, increase the Federal deficit substantially; and B, impose substantial dislocations on a lot of folks and raise questions about whether you would have the opportunity to deduct your home mortgage interest or deduct your gifts to charities. Some of them, incidentally, say to people, we have decided to have a new form of taxation. 
I bet the Senator doesn't support another proposed new form of taxation, though. We will divide Americans into two groups: One group that works, and they get their money by going to work every day, and we will tax them because we have decided to tax work just like the current income tax does; and one who gets their money from investments, and we will exempt them. Tax work; zero tax on investments. 
I think that is the sort of thing that would be interesting to debate on the floor of the Senate. The quicker we get to that debate the better. Those who offer this amendment say we don't want to have that debate; we want to simply sunset the Tax Code, and we don't want to debate the sweet by-and-by. We don't want to debate the prospect of what we might propose. Just asking the Senator from Arkansas what he proposes, it occurs to me at this point we don't have a proposal. All we have is a suggestion, get rid of the current Tax Code and maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, we will come up with an idea so you can then debate that on the floor of the Senate. 
I have taken enough time. I hope when a point of order is made, as I expect it will be made because this does violate the Budget Act, that a good number of Members of the Senate will agree with the National Association of Manufacturers, Tax Executive Institute, with the chairman of the Finance Committee and others who say if we are going to sunset the Tax Code, first propose exactly to the American people what we would replace it with so they would have some knowledge and some certainty about what this debate is all about. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our health care system is in a state of crisis--a crisis of confidence. Many Americans no longer believe that their insurance companies can provide them with the access to care or quality of service they need. 
Today I continue our series of stories describing how some managed care plans seem to have put cost saving before life-saving. The experience of Clara Davis is just one more example of the pressing need for Congress to act now to protect the rights of patients. 
Clara Davis is a retired grocer from Bolivar, Tennessee. In 1995, her doctor placed her on the prescription drug Prilosec to control a bleeding ulcer. But her health provider changed from a traditional fee-for-service plan to an HMO, and they told her she would no longer be covered for that medication. The HMO would only cover cimetidine, the generic equivalent of Tagamet, a different prescription drug. 
Clara's doctor fought vigorously to keep her on Prilosec, which had greatly improved her condition, but to no avail. While on the generic alternative, Clara's ulcer worsened. At one point, her doctor removed her from that medication and began giving her office samples of Prilosec whenever possible. But it wasn't enough. 
The ulcer would not go away and required surgery. Thirty-five percent of Clara's stomach was removed. During recovery, she suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed on her left side. 
What happened to Clara Davis should not happen in America. HMOs should not dictate which medications a patient should receive when their doctors say otherwise. Patients should not have to face surgery when a simple switch in medication can remedy the situation. 
Whatever we do will not alleviate the stress that Clara Davis has endured. But we can ensure that a doctor's decision will not be overruled by an HMO bent on saving money. All medications are not the same, and health-care providers should be able to say what is most effective to treat their patients. 
Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient protections now. Experiences like Clara's can be prevented if we enact legislation such as our Patients' Bill of Rights which protects the doctor-patient relationship from interference by HMOs. Insurers should have to make available to patients all information on which drugs the insurer will be willing to cover, the possible interactions of those drugs, and the procedures available for appealing an HMO's coverage decisions.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to correct problems with the Federal `Son of Sam' law, as those problems were perceived by the United States Supreme Court. The New York statute analyzed by the Supreme Court, as well as the Federal statute which I seek to amend, forfeited the proceeds from any expressive work of a criminal, and dedicated those proceeds to the victims of the perpetrator's crime. Because of constitutional deficiencies cited by the Court, the Federal statute has never been applied, and without changes, it is highly unlikely that it ever will be. Without this bill, criminals can become wealthy from the fruits of their crimes, while victims and their families are exploited. 
The bill I now introduce attempts to correct constitutional deficiencies cited by the Supreme Court in striking down New York's Son of Sam law. In its decision striking down New York's law, the Court found the statute to be both over inclusive and under inclusive: Over inclusive because the statute included all expressive works, no matter how tangentially related to the crime; under inclusive because the statute only included expressive works, not other forms of property. 
To correct the deficiencies perceived by the Court, this bill changes significantly the concepts of the Federal statute. Because the Court criticized the statute for singling out speech, this bill is all encompassing: It includes various types of property related to the crime from which a criminal might profit. Because the Court criticized the statute for being over inclusive, including the proceeds from all works, no matter how remotely connected to the crime, this bill limits the property to be forfeited to the enhanced value of property attributable to the offense. Because the Court found fault with the statute for not requiring a conviction, this bill requires a conviction. 
The bill also attempts to take advantage of the long legal history of forfeiture. Pirate ships and their contents were once forfeited to the government. More recent case law addresses the concept of forfeiting any property used in the commission of drug related crimes, or proceeds from those crimes. Hopefully, courts interpreting this statute will look to this legal history and find it binding or persuasive. 
The bill utilizes the Commerce Clause authority of Congress to forfeit property associated with State crimes. This means that if funds are transferred through banking channels, if UPS or FedEx are used, if the airwaves are utilized, or if the telephone is used to transfer the property, to transfer funds, or to make a profit, the property can be forfeited. In State cases, this bill allows the State attorney general to proceed first. We do not seek to preempt State law, only to see that there is a law in place which will ensure that criminals do not profit at the expense of their victims and the families of victims. 
One last improvement which this bill makes over the former statutes: The old statute included only crimes which resulted in physical harm to another; this bill includes other crimes. Examples of crimes probably not included under the old statute, but included here are terrorizing, kidnaping, bank robbery, and embezzlement. 
Mr. President, our Federal statute, enacted to ensure that criminals not profit at the expense of their victims and victim's families, is not used today because it is perceived to be unconstitutional. I believe victims of crime deserve quick action on this bill, drafted to ensure that they are not the source of profits to those who committed crimes against them. I ask for your support.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences at the University of North Dakota, and its dean and founder, John Odegard who have been selected by the Federal Aviation Administration to receive its 1998 Excellence in Aviation award. In addition to being one of North Dakota's most outstanding entrepreneurs, John is also a personal friend of mine and I can attest to the fact that this honor is truly deserved. It accurately reflects the contributions that John and the college have made to aviation education and research to make flying safer in our country. 
Announcing the award, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey noted, 
The FAA formally recognizes significant aviation research accomplishments each year through the Excellence in Aviation award. This research plays a prominent role in ensuring that the nation's airspace system remains the safest in the world. 
`Aviation weather research conducted at the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences contributed to the development of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, which is used to detect wind shear near airports. The aerospace school, which has conducted aviation research, education and training programs for over 30 years, participates in a FAA-sponsored research project to chart wind conditions at the Juneau, Alaska, airport.

Mr. DORGAN. Within our state, John's achievements are well recognized. The North Dakota State Board of Higher Education has honored John by placing his name on the aviation college at the University of North Dakota. The Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences is one of our state's flagship programs and draws students from every state in the nation as well as many foreign countries. Airlines from around the world send its pilots to be trained at UND. Its size and number of employees means it is also a significant economic asset and has served to help draw the aerospace industry to North Dakota. 
Again, I want to offer my congratulations to John and all his faculty and staff at the Odegard School. We look forward to their continued contributions to the aerospace industry, not only in North Dakota but throughout the world.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this ought not to be a controversial amendment. 
The question is, simply, Is there an opportunity for someone to say, either in the Senate or the House of Representatives, that they are going to provide hundreds of billions of dollars, or a trillion dollars, of tax cuts under the current fiscal policy? Is there an opportunity to do that without using the Social Security trust funds? I can't see that that opportunity exists. While I would like to see some additional tax cuts, I happen to think that saving Social Security first and reducing the Federal debt would be much more meritorious for the future of this country. 
In any event, we ought not to be talking about tax cuts before there is money to give them. That money available for tax cuts does not include--I ask the Senator--and that money should never include, the Social Security trust fund money; am I correct?

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will continue to yield, if we are collecting more money than is necessary for the Government, it ought to go back to the folks who send it in, no question about that. 
But the question is, we have a debt of nearly $6 trillion and we have a problem in Social Security, as the Senator from South Carolina has pointed out. Just after World War II there were a lot of warm feelings around this country and we had the biggest baby crop ever produced in American history. People liked each other a lot and we had a lot of babies. Those babies are fixing to retire soon, and when they hit the retirement rolls it will be a maximum strain on the Social Security system. We have accrued surpluses year after year to meet that test for the baby boomers' retirement and those surpluses are invested in government bonds. 
When the folks over here say well, gee, now we have the Congressional Budget Office that tells us there is a surplus, they are taking one page of the CBO report. They are forgetting the other page. The other page says if you include the Social Security fund in your budget totals, there is a surplus. But if you don't count the Social Security fund--which you shouldn't be able to do, because that money is paid into a trust fund for only one purpose--if you don't count the Social Security trust fund, there is no surplus. 
Those folks are going to the second page, taking the number they want, and saying not only is there a surplus--which there isn't--but with the surplus we want to provide a big tax cut. 
When? The month before the election. Gee, that is Politics 101, I suppose, but it is not good government. That is the purpose of the amendment that is offered by the Senator from South Carolina. It says, let us do with the Social Security trust funds what we promised the American people we would do--that is, save them for Social Security needs when the baby boomers retire.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me inquire of the Senator from Kansas. I understand we are in morning business. I don't object and would not object to the Senator taking substantial time in morning business. As I understand it, we are allowed 10 minutes, but the Senator has, by unanimous consent, received permission to speak for as long as he chooses. Normally, in morning business when Senators want to speak, we can increase that time of 10 minutes. 
In this circumstance, we were about prepared to go to the legislative branch appropriations bill. Senator Bennett from Utah made an opening statement in morning business. I am the ranking member on that subcommittee and I was prepared to make an opening statement. I guess I would like to get some notion of how long the Senator from Kansas intends to retain the floor in morning business before I agree to other sets of circumstances, so I can try to gauge the time and understand what might transpire on the floor of the Senate. So reserving the right to object, I inquire of the Senator from Kansas as to what are his intentions.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas certainly has that right. In fact, when the bill is brought to the floor--the bill is not yet technically on the floor, the legislative appropriations bill--when the bill is brought to the floor, the Senator certainly has a right to offer any amendments. Nothing will prevent the Senator from his right to offer an amendment. 
I guess the issue is whether the Senator can offer his amendment, but other people are prevented from offering theirs. Maybe it will be worked out, but my expectation is that it won't get worked out. You used the term `tie up' the floor. I would really prefer that you not do that in morning business. I prefer that you find a way to do that the minute the bill is on the floor, if you so choose. But tying up the floor in morning business simply inconveniences others who would like to do some work here. 
I am sympathetic to the notion that there is a marriage penalty. I guess I am standing here, however, with the Senate in morning business, hoping that perhaps the Senator might allow the Senator from New York to proceed, and then allow me to proceed, and others who might want to proceed, and then it doesn't matter whether somebody talks until Sunday noon. I would like, in the morning business segment, or perhaps the opening segment of the appropriations bill, to be able to dispatch that business and let whoever wants to talk, do it until they are exhausted. 
You are speaking of a subject of some importance, I admit that. I am sympathetic to the issue you are raising. I hope that you perhaps would allow us to do the things we would like to do in preparation to get the bill to the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are at some time going to take up the legislative branch appropriations bill formally. I wanted to make a couple of comments in response to the comments made by the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch. 
Senator Bennett spoke about this work of the subcommittee. I have said before and I will say again I think he is an awfully good legislator. I appreciate very much the opportunity to work with him. We have worked in a cooperative spirit, in a bipartisan way, and have brought to the floor of the Senate a bill that I think reflects the right priorities and the prudent expenditure of the taxpayers' money for the things that are important and necessary. 
I especially wish to commend Senator Bennett. For those who don't know about his work on what is called Y2K or the year 2000 problem, I must say, having sat through all of the hearings we held, in every instance with every agency and every department, Senator Bennett has been very determined to make certain that we are on the road to addressing the problems that confront us with the turn of the century and the programming and the computer software that exists around our country, and he has, of course, since been named chairman of a panel on this issue. A lot of people don't think too much about it because it is a year and a half away, but it is a very important issue. Senator Bennett has been a leader on that issue, and I think the Senate owes him a debt of gratitude. 
Let me just for a moment mention a couple of items in the appropriations bill itself. We have in this legislation provided for a Trade Deficit Review Commission. With the announcement once again today that the trade deficit hit another record high, and the trade deficit continues to swell and balloon on us, I think it is important for our country to do a comprehensive review of what is happening and what is causing it, and what are the range of things we might do to address it. 
On this issue, we have worked, in consultation with the Senate Finance Committee, to make some changes that would be satisfactory to them. These changes will be reflected in the managers' amendment, and I think this process of constructing this recommendation has been a very useful process. It has been a collaborative effort with the folks in Senate Finance and others. 
As to this Trade Deficit Review Commission, the chairman of the full committee, Senator Stevens, has been a very strong supporter and a cosponsor; the ranking member, Senator Byrd, from West Virginia, a cosponsor and a very strong supporter as well. I think, especially given the news once again today, it is timely and important, and I appreciate, again, the cooperation of the chairman of the subcommittee. 
I want to mention the General Accounting Office which is funded in this bill. The GAO, which most people know it by, normally shows up in stories around the country that are written about the investigations they do. The GAO does first-rate investigative work. It is the investigative arm of Congress. It is not partisan, has never been partisan. It is a group of dedicated professionals who, at the direction of Congress, review and study, investigate, and evaluate a myriad of things we ask them to do about how the money that Congress appropriates is being spent. 
The GAO is a very, very important organization. We have cut the GAO substantially over a number of years and now we have tried to stabilize it with the right kind of investments. It is a smaller organization than it was, but it is a strong and assertive organization that does wonderful work for Congress. 
I am pleased that the recommendation we have in this particular appropriations bill reaches the level, albeit a much lower level of staffing at the GAO than had been there previously, a level which I think will give it the strength to do the job we expect them to do and the American people expect them to do. Anyone who has read their reports, read the news reports of the studies they have done, knows the value of the GAO. 
I do want to make a point that I have made repeatedly as well. I am profoundly disappointed, with respect to the GAO, that 21 months have passed since the departure of the Comptroller General, who is the person who heads the GAO. Comptroller General Bowsher headed the GAO for many, many years, a respected professional in every quarter in this community and around the country. 
Twenty-one months ago Mr. Bowsher left the GAO. That was not a surprise because he had reached the end of his rather lengthy term and had announced he was leaving. So we have had probably over 2 years' notice that position was going to be vacant. I am disappointed to tell my colleagues today that there is still not a permanent head of the GAO. We do not have a Comptroller General. We have someone who is acting. I have great respect for that person; he has done a very good job. But that is not the same as having a permanent head of an organization who is thinking in the intermediate and longer terms about what they hope to accomplish, how they want to run the organization. 
I say to my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, all friends of mine, I am sure, if you are one of those whose responsibility it is to help select from a list of premier candidates a new Comptroller General, and you have not yet done that in consultation, I might say, with the White House, please get about your business. Get it done. It is profoundly disappointing to me and many others, and I think the American people, to know that the Comptroller General's position has been unfilled for 21 months. That is not fair to the American people, in my judgment. Those responsible ought to get to work and get this done. 
One other item I might mention finally is the Congressional Budget Office. I was pleased that the committee report includes an exchange of letters that results from some items I have raised with the head of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill. 
The Congressional Budget Office was putting out information on a monthly and quarterly basis that talked about the surplus in the Federal budget. The law requires them to put out all the information, not just some of the information. And all of the information by law requires them to tell us not just what the so-called unified budget portrays, but what the budget looks like if you do not include the Social Security trust funds, and that is a different number. There is no budget surplus unless you take the Social Security trust funds and bring them over into the operating budget, there is no surplus. It doesn't exist. And so all of these rosy surpluses put out by CBO and used by some of my friends here in Congress to whet their taste for more tax cuts, all these surpluses are just fiction. 
We finally have the CBO now putting out numbers that describe, all right, if you use the Social Security trust funds, here is the unified budget surplus. If you don't use the Social Security trust funds, here is the deficit. Every piece of information they put out, I might say, includes a notation that the Federal debt will continue to increase even as on the unified budget they claim there is a surplus. So that in itself will tell you that the American people need to have all of the information. 
I think we are making progress there. I know that those who take the unified budget portion of the CBO reports will hire a band that plays fast music and will dance so fast we can hardly see them in the next couple of months to try to satisfy this appetite to construct a $50-, $100-, $200 billion tax cut bill. First of all, there is no surplus with which to construct that tax cut. And second, my judgment is that one of the first acts with any bona fide and real surplus ought to be to make some payment on that debt, just begin to ratchet that debt down. 
I have no idea whether the Senator from Utah agrees with that, but I do recall his presentations on the floor of the Senate, with a very interesting chart in which he looked at this fiscal policy in a way that was different from the way anyone else had looked at it. 
I do think it would probably be a wonderful signal to the American people if we would take some part, of any future real surplus--not a fictional surplus but a real surplus--and say we intend, during good times, to try to reduce the actual indebtedness. 
I just mention that because a lot of what we do relates to what information we have, and when the Congressional Budget Office is putting out information only about the unified budget and ignoring the section of law that requires disclosure of what the budget situation is if you do not use the Social Security trust funds, it, in my judgment, is giving information to people that is making them far more excited than they should be about a surplus that honestly, at this point, does not exist. 
Let me mention, finally, we have some very dedicated people who serve this Congress--officers of the Senate and others who run the agencies and departments. I would like to say many of them have testified before our subcommittee. Many of them do outstanding work. They are not often heralded for that work. There is not a lot of information about the work they do. But I know, because we work late hours and spend a lot of time here, they put in a lot of hours. Their employees put in a lot of hours. We are well served by some people who are in public service here who provide staff assistance to the Congress. We should make mention of that. 
One of the other agencies I want to mention finally is the Library of Congress. I know Senator Bennett and I have had talks with Dr. Billington and others who run that wonderful institution. I think it is an institution that has somewhere around 14 million volumes of work. It is, I am told, the largest repository of human knowledge anywhere on Earth. 
Just as an aside, I read a speech by the president of IBM. He was talking about what they are doing on storage technology. He said they are, he thinks, on the edge of research breakthroughs sufficient so that, in the not too distant future, they would be able to put all of the works in the Library of Congress--in other words, all of the largest volume of work of recorded human knowledge anywhere on Earth, on a wafer the size of a penny. Pretty remarkable, isn't it? 
But the Library of Congress is a wonderful, important treasury of information for this country. We have had the pleasure of working with them on a wide range of issues. I want to especially compliment the work they are doing, digitizing a lot of their records, and the other things that are happening at the Library of Congress. 
So let me conclude where I began, to say it is truly a pleasure to work with Senator Bennett. He is, I think, an outstanding legislator. I hope at some point we can get the bill up. I hope when we get the bill up, we can get the bill passed and get on with this. But as I indicated in response to the Senator from Kansas, the issue he is talking about is not an insignificant issue, it is a real issue and an issue of some importance. As soon as we can find a way to resolve all these issues, perhaps we can get the legislative branch bill to the floor and get it resolved with some dispatch. 
Let me thank the Senator from Kansas for his cooperation.

Mr. DORGAN. I did not intend to interrupt the Senator from Kansas, I think, three times. He doesn't understand why the Democrats object to a vote on this. Does the Senator understand, the Democrats, as he characterized it, are not objecting to a vote on this? The objection is to a unanimous consent request that says there would be a vote on what you are proposing, but no one on this side of the aisle would be allowed to present alternatives for a vote. 
We have a couple of people in the Cloakroom, I am told, who want to offer tax amendments as well, if you want to have a vote on tax amendments on the legislative branch bill. 
It is not a case of Democrats objecting to a vote on your bill. I want people who might be listening to the debate to understand that. The unanimous consent request would say, let us have a vote on yours, but prevent anybody else from offering anything. Obviously, we have some folks who object to that.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate his courtesy. I just observe, however, I don't want him to skip over this point. The point isn't that somebody on one side of the aisle in the Senate is objecting to what you are doing. If there is intended to be a debate about tax policy on this bill, I expect the Senator from Kansas would fully understand, in the name of fairness, that it wouldn't be just his amendment that would be in order to be offered, but that there would be others, probably on both sides of the aisle, who would want to weigh in with their particular amendments. 
The objection is to the unanimous consent request that would say you get to offer your amendment but no one else gets to offer their ideas on the subject of taxation. I hope that when you characterize this, it is not to characterize it as something that the Democrats are unfairly trying to do, because that is not the case. The objection is to allowing you to offer your amendment but preventing anyone else from offering their amendment on the tax issue. 
In conclusion, I expect we will have a very substantial and lengthy debate on the issue of tax reform and tax changes and tax cuts perhaps in the month of September. At least that is the way it is shaping up. I want to make sure this is characterized fairly. I don't believe the Senator was being fair to us when he was saying we object to your amendment. That is not what we object to. We object to a process that says you can offer yours but no one on this side can offer their amendments on the subject of taxation. I appreciate the courtesy.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be submitting today a Senate Concurrent Resolution recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. I am joined in this effort by our esteemed colleague from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, who by profession is a heart and lung transplant surgeon and medical researcher. An identical resolution has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Bill Young. 
Heart disease is our country's No. 1 killer and a leading cause of disability. Chronic lung disease is the fourth leading cause of death. Virtually all of us have a friend or a loved one who has been affected by heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, other cardiovascular diseases, asthma, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, or hemophilia. 
The NHLBI is the Federal Government's leading supporter of heart research, as well as research into diseases of the blood vessels, lungs, and blood. There have been wonderful discoveries made through research and wonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in these areas. For instance, the first open heart surgery did not occur until 1954. Today, surgeons routinely perform double, triple, and even quadruple heart bypass procedures. 
Yet there is so much we still do not know. It seems to me more and more research can unlock these mysteries and give us the opportunity to save more and more lives in this country. 
I might also add that there is another organization devoted to the reduction of death and disability from heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases that is also celebrating its 50th birthday--the American Heart Association. The American Heart Association has worked closely over the years with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in the fight against cardiovascular diseases. 
As many of my colleagues know, I have become increasingly concerned about what has been happening to the amount of money spent on heart and stroke research by the federal government. Even with the significant increases that Congress has been giving to the National Institutes of Health over the past decade, funding for heart research has simply not kept pace even though it kills more Americans than any other disease. 
In fact, funding for heart research at the NHLBI appears to be losing more and more ground. It constant dollars from FY 1987 to FY 1997, funding for the NHLBI heart program has decreased by 7.6 percent in constant dollars, while funding for the Heart Program has increased by 27.5 percent. 
We can do better, and we must do better. Our Nation must do a better job than this in the battle against America's No. 1 killer. 
During the commemoration of this 50th anniversary of the 1948 Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, I hope we can make more progress against cardiovascular and other insidious diseases by providing a significant increase in funding for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and particularly for research against heart disease and stroke.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in a few minutes Senator Conrad from North Dakota will send an amendment to the desk on behalf of himself and myself and some others that will deal with an indemnity program, an amendment that I think he has already described to Members of the Senate. I think this is one of the most important amendments we will vote on on this bill while it is on the Senate floor. 
I want to just describe again, as I think my colleague has and I have on other occasions, what causes us to feel the need and the urgency to respond to an agricultural crisis. The agricultural crisis is occurring in a number of States in our country in a way that is causing family farmers to lose their farms, to have the auction sales, to sell out and lose their hopes and dreams. We feel that because of collapsed prices and rampant crop disease, and other things which are not the farmers' fault, that we ought to do something to extend a helping hand and say to them that we want to help them over this tough period. 
I would like to show my colleagues a map that describes the problems we have had in North Dakota for family farmers. The red represents counties that have been declared disaster areas every year for 5 straight years. All of these counties have been declared disasters every year for 5 years in a row. That means if you are farming here, or here, any one of these areas, you have been out there farming in an environment and in a climate in which there is, in most cases, a devastating wet cycle with you being prevented from planting because the fields are full of standing water that has not left and has not absorbed, and if you did get a crop in, you have had it devastated by the worst crop disease in this century in North Dakota. 
The orange have been declared disaster areas for 4 years out of 5 years, and the yellow, 3 years out of 5 years,. The farmers in these areas have confronted a disease called scab. This picture doesn't mean much to a lot of folks. But it is the picture of a field of hard red spring wheat infested with scab disease. It is called fusarium head blight. But it is a devastating disease that decimates the quality of this crop, so that when and if the farmer gets a crop and hauls it to market, the farmer discovers it is worth very, very little. 
The cereal scientist, Bryan Steffeson, said, `I have never faced anything as tough as fusarium head blight. Make no mistake about it. This is the worst plant disease epidemic that the United States has faced with any major crop during this century.' 
This is very unusual and devastating to the pocketbooks of family farmers. 
With respect to wheat, I just described the previous chart; with respect to barley, the same plant scientist says, `North Dakota's barley industry is hanging by a thread, even though it is typically the leader in feed malting barley products.' 
As a result of crop disease and collapsed market prices, our farmers' incomes in North Dakota dropped 98 percent in 1 year--a devastating drop in income. And I think almost anyone can imagine if, in their neighborhood, or on their block, or among their friends, they had a 98-percent drop in income, they would understand this is very, very difficult to live through. A lot of family farmers aren't able to survive it. The result is they are forced off the farm and forced to sell out. 
This was in the New York Times accompanying a story on July 12. `Across the northern tier, farmers' income drops.' And it says we have a problem with farm income dropping in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and elsewhere. The point of that is that this is a pervasive, difficult problem that requires an urgent response. 
The Fargo Forum in an editorial yesterday indicates that, `The crisis in farming is for real. The social and economic damage piling up in farm country cannot be minimized. Politicians who believe the revolutionary Freedom to Farm law is working should spend some time in rural America, especially in the upper Midwest.' 
This is a paper, incidentally, that has editorialized in favor of the Freedom to Farm bill. They say that it needs some adjustments and changes. You can't ignore that. 
They say at the end of this editorial, `The least Congress can do now, while in the longer term enlighten lawmakers to revisit and revise the Freedom to Farm, is to try to pass some type of supplemental legislation that would respond to urgent needs for some payments in farm country.' 
A number of us, led by Senator Conrad, and joined by myself and others, have worked on a program that would provide the opportunity for some indemnity payments, which is just another way of saying those farmers who have had their income washed away would be given some short-term interim help with the passage of this amendment. The amendment would provide up to $500 million for the Indemnity Payment Program. 
It is supported by President Clinton. We were meeting at the White House yesterday with President Clinton. My colleague, Senator Conrad, myself, and a number of others from farm country, received a letter from President Clinton that describes in writing what he told us personally yesterday during the meeting--that he supports the amendment we are offering now, and it is part of a three-pronged approach that he himself espouses: No. 1, a supplemental benefit program of the type we have described, an indemnification program; No. 2, compensation for farmers who have flooded lands; and, No. 3, extended authority for emergency livestock needs. 
Mr. President, I mentioned earlier--I want to say again--that this is not a political or a partisan issue. Out in the country they don't drive Democratic or Republican trucks. They don't pull Democratic or Republican plows. They are only family farmers trying to make a living in a very difficult set of circumstances. They are some of the hardest working Americans. They get up early, work hard all day, and go to bed late. They risk everything they have. Everything they have is on the line--all of their hopes, all of their dreams--and all of their savings are invested in a crop that might or might not grow. If it is grows, it might or might not yield them an income that allows them to repay the expenses they incurred to put in the crop. 
That is the nature of family farming. I think family farmers have always understood that risk and always accepted that risk. But they have always hoped. And they have sometimes been the recipients as a result of that hope that when times are tough, when the bottom falls out, when prices collapse, when they are hit with devastating crop disease, that somehow there would be a basic safety net to try to be helpful to them to allow them to get over those price valleys; some kind of a bridge to allow them to cross that difficult period. 
If you are a very, very large corporation, you can cross that price valley. Things get tough, you can tighten your belt, and you can survive. But the thin financial nature of a family farm often cannot cross that price valley. When prices collapse, or disease conspires, then there must be some kind of a bridge, some kind of mechanism of support that says, `Let us step in and help.' 
That is what the amendment offered by Senator Conrad, myself, and others will do. It simply says, `Let us step in and provide some help to respond to a growing and urgent farm crisis.' 
Mr. President, with this, I would yield the floor. I believe we are close to having the amendment in order to send to the desk. When we do, I believe that Senator Conrad, a couple of others, and I will make brief additional comments. We would hope very much that our colleagues will respond favorably to this. 
We think it is thoughtful. It is supported by the President and it is supported by the Secretary of Agriculture. Editorially it is supported by newspapers that support the Freedom to Farm bill, because the editorials, others, and family farmers recognize this need is urgent and the response to it cannot be delayed. 
Let me commend my colleague, Senator Conrad, with whom I am privileged to work. We work on a lot of issues together but none more important than the issue of trying to respond to and to help family farmers survive during times of crisis and times of urgent need. His leadership and efforts on this legislation are significant. 
I am pleased to be a part of the effort today to offer this amendment, and I hope for the favorable consideration of our colleagues. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Let me make two points that I think Senator Conrad and I and others would want to make. One responds a bit to some comments made earlier. 
The potential benefits of this amendment would be available to people in a range of areas of the country who have suffered, in one form or another, substantial income loss and are going through an agricultural crisis. That includes Texas, South Carolina--a whole range of areas of the country. But I want to make it clear, this is not simply an amendment that would target one or two or three States. Farmers in many other parts of the country who face similar circumstances and a similar crisis would be eligible. 
Second, and I think most important, while there has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate about agricultural policy, I think it is important to make clear, this amendment is not a substitute for or a denial of the interest many of us have in some of the arguments that have been offered and proposed in recent days by others on the floor about the increased need for additional effort in trade. Some of our colleagues have stood on the floor and talked about the need for moving American grain overseas, for additional efforts in trade, additional use of the Export Enhancement Program, and other things. I support all of that. 
I think we ought to be more aggressive with respect to Food for Peace. I have mentioned that there are people starving around the world: A million people to a million and a quarter people face starvation in Sudan today. We can and should, in my judgment, with the quantity of grain we have, substantially increase shipments under title II and title III of Food for Peace. 
We can and should be more aggressive with the use of the Export Enhancement Program. We can and should be more aggressive with a range of other programs. The Secretary of Agriculture, I would say, has been very aggressive with the GSM program and others. But I would like our country to meet competition anywhere around the Earth. If the European Union wishes to deeply subsidize its grain and attempt to take markets away from this country, we ought to go to those markets and meet them and compete and win that competition. If that requires export subsidies to meet what the Europeans are doing, then so be it; that is precisely what we should do. 
So, those who insist on a much more aggressive approach in international trade will find no quarrel with me. I believe we should have a more aggressive posture with respect to trade issues. That is one, but only one, of the issues we need to address. 
Another of the issues we need to address is the issue of emergency response in times of crisis to farmers, particularly in some areas of the country that have seen almost a total collapse of their income. That is the purpose of the amendment we have sent to the desk. 
I, too, listened carefully to the Senator from Mississippi. I think he is an awfully good legislator. He is certainly fair. I hope we can achieve some bipartisan support here in this Chamber on this kind of legislation. I don't think there is any pride of authorship here either. My expectation is that in the coming period we will be able to discuss some of the specifics of this legislation and perhaps reach a conclusion on it. 
With that, I know my colleague from Montana is here, although he apparently is not going to speak at this point. Let me yield the floor to the Senator from Mississippi.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from Mississippi. I understand he wants to hear from other Senators. It seems to me that one of the suggestions he made makes a lot of sense. Having the opportunity to go to conference with a provision similar to this in the piece of legislation that comes from the Senate will put us in the position of sending a message to those areas that have been hardest hit, a number of areas of the country ranging from the Southeast, to the South, to the North, that we understand this is, in fact, a crisis; that we are responding as we did in the sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed earlier this week without a dissenting vote, that the ag crisis is something that we are willing to address. 
I accept the point made by Senator Cochran that there may well, in the coming days or weeks, be a need to change the response. Perhaps the response will need to be more aggressive. Perhaps the response may need to be characterized differently. But it seems to me appropriate to go to conference with a provision of this type in the legislation, because it is, I think, telling the family farmers in this land that this Senate does care, does want to respond, and understands that there is a crisis in certain parts of the country. 
Again, I certainly respect the interest of the Senator from Mississippi wanting to gauge the reaction of a number of Senators on this subject, but I hope when the day is out and this amendment is disposed of that it will be disposed of in a way--I guess `disposed' of is the wrong word--I hope that it is resolved in a way that reaches one of the suggestions perhaps offered by the Senator from Mississippi that we can include it in this legislation. 
I must say that I have watched the Senator from Mississippi for some days on the floor. I have always felt he has the patience of Job. He is one of the most gracious and considerate Members of the Senate. I know this is a trying time. I am on the Appropriations Committee with Senator Cochran, and I am also someone who will sit here as a ranking member on one of the subcommittees. I know it is a trying time to bring a bill to the floor of the Senate and discover that a lot of folks want to address this bill with peculiar amendments on a range of issues. 
I know he understands, because of the vote earlier in the week, that we face very unusual and, in fact, very difficult times in some parts of the country. The crisis we have in our State is unparalleled. I can't think of a time when we have suffered a 98-percent loss in net farm income. It has been devastating. The Senator from Mississippi understands that is what has occasioned amendments to be offered to this bill. 
I must say, again, he has enormous patience. Even in exhibiting that patience, he has a graciousness and dignity that all of us appreciate. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a number of issues we find strong agreement on today on the agricultural matters. And the matter that was just spoken about by the Senator from Idaho regarding sanctions is one in which I have very strong agreement with him, and also with the Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts of Kansas. All of us agree that it doesn't make any sense at all to use food as a tool of foreign policy and to tell farmers to pay the costs of sanctions, and so on. So I am very pleased that we were able, on a bipartisan basis, to work together to resolve that issue. I think we have done that in an effective way. 
I am also pleased that the amendment which we have just offered and was accepted and cosponsored by the Senator from Idaho. We have worked with the Senator from Idaho and others, including the Senator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, in discussions on a wide range of income issues dealing with family farmers. The reason I sought recognition is just to make one final point; that is, this amendment now becomes part of the agricultural appropriations bill. It then goes from the Senate to a conference with House of Representatives. That is likely, between now and sometime in September, as this agricultural crisis continues to emerge, to occur in a way that may require some changes and some adjustments. We all understand that. 
But I think this is an enormously important and a helpful first step to say to family farmers who are struggling that we recognize that this is, indeed, a crisis and we want to respond to that crisis. 
I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership, and the Senator from Arkansas for his leadership as well, and I thank my colleague, Senator Conrad, who is as determined and effective and tough a legislator as there is to work with. I am pleased to have joined him in working on this amendment as well. 
I think this is an important step, and it will be viewed as good news--not necessarily the final answer, but good news by family farmers, that on a bipartisan basis the Congress recognizes a crisis and is prepared to respond effectively to it. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me briefly rise in opposition to the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that has been offered. While I think there is much in that amendment to commend--and I support some parts of it--the first provision in that amendment is to suggest that Congress should bring up and pass fast-track trade authority. I could not disagree more with that recommendation. I cannot support a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that includes it. 
I want to just demonstrate for my colleagues with some numbers where we have been with fast-track trade authority. I know some people don't want to talk about the details; they want to talk about the theory. The theory is that if you have expanded trade around the world, that is good for everybody. I am all for expanded trade. Put me down as a `yes' checkmark on the line for expanded trade. Yes, this country ought to be a leader in expanding trade. But this country also ought to be a leader in saying that we demand and insist on fair trade agreements with our trading partners. And when we have trading partners that don't treat us fairly, this country ought to say, stop, wait, we won't allow that to continue to happen. We ought to say to the Chinese, Japanese, Canadians, Europeans and, yes, others that I could mention but have not, when we have a relationship with you, it must be different than the relationship we used to have just after the Second World War. 
Just after the Second World War, almost all of our trade relationships were foreign policy issues. How do you treat this country? Well, this country is weak and rebuilding, so let's give them concessions here and concessions there, and we will open our market up to their products, and they can close their market to ours, because we are bigger and better and stronger and tougher and we can beat anybody with one hand tied behind our back, and that is fine. For a quarter of a century after World War II, that is the way we thought and behaved, and it didn't matter because we succeeded anyway. Income in this country had increased, economic growth was substantial, and we were just fine. 
The second 25 years, post-Second World War, have been different. Our trading partners are now stronger, better, shrewder. We still have the softheaded notion that our trade policy ought to be foreign policy. We say to the Chinese, you can ratchet up in one decade a $50 billion or $60 billion trade surplus with the United States, or put the United States in a trade deficit position with China, and it is OK. Let the United States be your cash cow for your hard currency needs. That is OK. We are willing to do that. With Japanese trade, as far as the eye can see, there are $40 billion, $50 billion and $60 billion deficits every single year that we experience. 
We are urged to pass fast track authority. Now, fast track--which is the reason I am objecting to this amendment--is a specific, unusual procedure that says, let's have the American trade negotiators go somewhere and negotiate a trade agreement. Almost always, it will be in a closed room, and almost always, behind a closed door. They negotiate the agreement and then bring it back. Here is the catch: Fast track means that when it is brought back to the floor of the House and the Senate, there are no amendments--no democracy here--just up or down. There are no suggestions for improvement, no objections, no amendments. You must vote up or down, yes or no, and that is fast-track authority. 
Mr. President, let me just review a couple of the fast-track agreements we have had. Well, our folks went off and negotiated with Canada a fast-track trade agreement. At the time, we had about an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. So our negotiators got involved and got behind those doors. I don't know whose `jerseys' they were wearing. I kind of wish we could buy them jerseys and they would say `U.S.A.,' indicating that they represent the good old U.S.A., that they are on our team, that they are negotiating for us. I kind of wish we could put jerseys on them and send them into the room. I expect that the people wear white shirts, and they have all the theories in mind, and they talk back and forth about trade theory. 
In any event, when they did it with Canada, here is what happened. We had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. They went in and talked about their theories and did their little deal behind closed doors, and they brought it back to the Congress and said, OK, there's no chance for amendments. So the Congress passed it--not with my vote; I voted against it--Congress passed it, and guess what? The trade deficit with Canada doubles. It doubles. And the people that negotiated the agreement say, gee, didn't we do a good job? This is really working well. Well, what school did they go to? They do a trade agreement and our deficit doubles, and they think we are making progress? I don't know of any schools that teach that. 
So they say, well, that is not enough. Now let's do a deal that includes Canada and Mexico and call it NAFTA, and we will do it under fast track. So we get them all at the table, close the room, bring more chairs to the table and negotiate some more. Still no jerseys, I expect. But they negotiate and negotiate, and they come back. Now, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico as we started negotiating. 
They come back with a trade agreement, and they say to Congress, `Gee, you've really done a good job this time.' And Congress votes on no amendments with no opportunity to change it. I didn't vote for it. But Congress supports it, because fast-track trade authority prevents anybody from making any adjustments or changes. And the Congress then passes NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the time, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Guess what happened. The $2 billion trade surplus evaporates, and the $2 billion trade surplus we had with Mexico now becomes a $14 billion to $15 billion trade deficit--$14 billion to $15 billion deficit--and the same people who told us we ought to do it say, `Gee, this is working really well.' Apparently they went to the same school and took the same classes. 
Let me give you some numbers with respect to Mexico, just as an example. This is how they describe these trade agreements. They say, `From 1993 to 1996, do you know that we increased our exports from the United States to Mexico by $14 billion?' Why, give them a blue ribbon at the county fair--$14 billion increase in exports from the United States to Mexico. They don't read what is on the other page, do they? The other page says, `Oh, yes, we did increase our exports to Mexico some'--$14 billion. But imports from Mexico into the United States increased nearly double, from $39 billion to $73 billion--$34 billion increase in imports from Mexico. In fact, we now import more automobiles from Mexico into the United States than the United States exports to all the rest of the world. 
We were told with NAFTA, by the way, `If you pass NAFTA, guess what will happen. The products of low-skilled labor will come into the United States. That is what will happen with Mexico.' 
What are the three largest imports from Mexico? The products of high-skill labor: Automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics. 
But my point is simple. With Canada, with Mexico, the two most recent examples, they are saying: Take fast track, let us negotiate it, and we will essentially shove it down your throat with no opportunity for amendment, and things will work out just fine. If history is any guide, we ought to understand things don't work out fine. The NAFTA agreement was not a good agreement for this country. It is not working. It has increased this country's trade deficit. The agreement with Canada has not worked. 
My colleague from Minnesota and I know other people get tired of me saying this and referencing the Canada agreement. And I am going to say it again. The Senator from Iowa acknowledges that he either heard it before or is tired of perhaps hearing it. But there is virtually a flood of grain coming into this country from Canada. Mr. Clayton Yeutter, good enough fellow, was trade ambassador at the time. He went up to negotiate this. I was on the Ways and Means Committee in the U.S. House at the time. I have in writing from the trade ambassador a representation that the trade agreement between the United States and Canada would not result in the increase in quantity of grain being shipped across the border either way--in writing, a guarantee from the trade ambassador. That is what the two sides agreed to. It wasn't worth the paper it was written on. 
The agreement was passed. The fact is, we had this flood of unfairly subsidized grain coming in. We tried to enforce our laws and get the information that we ought to get from the Canadian Wheat Board. 
By the way, in the negotiations with Canada, we said, `We will allow your state monopoly trading enterprise to ship into this country.' It would be illegal in this country, by the way, to have a state monopoly trading enterprise like the Wheat Board. But we will allow that Canadian Wheat Board to ship into our country and unfairly compete with United States farmers and refuse to disclose information about the shipping costs and the cost of acquisition. 
So we finally decided to push really hard on this, and file complaints, and so on. Then we discovered a secret deal had been 
made with the Canadians by the trade ambassadors, and which had not been disclosed to any of us, which said in terms of antidumping, and so on, in the United States that we agree that certain payments under the GRIP payment system by the Canadian Wheat Board to Canadian farmers will not be included as acquisition costs for their grain, which means you would never be able to prove antidumping because, by definition, they excluded part of the cost of acquisition of the grain. It just essentially sold out American farmers. 
I will never go for fast track--never--under these circumstances. It is not in this country's interests. 
Is it in this country's interest to increase the Federal trade deficit? If so, how? Someone explain that to me. Is it in this country's interest to do another trade agreement that increases the deficit? I don't think so. Yet, what trade agreement have we in recent years negotiated that has not resulted in a substantial increase in this country's trade debt or trade deficit? Name one. No one in this Chamber can name one trade agreement that has turned out in recent years. That is because, as I have said before, our trade policies in this country are soft-headed and weak-kneed. And, yes, that is strong language, but it describes exactly what is happening to trade. 
We have negotiators that negotiate fundamentally incompetent agreements because they don't have the nerve and will, it seems to me, to stand up for this country's interests. I have even thought that maybe on an appropriations bill I would offer an amendment that says let's add at least four or five employees down at USTR, and we will name them `Backbone,' `Nerve,' and will add a couple other names, and see if we can't inject some kind of passion to stand up for this country's interests and to say that we care about America's farmers, that we care about America's jobs, and we are willing to compete with anybody in the world--anybody. But the competition must be fair with respect to farmers. It is not fair. 
If a state monopoly pushes the flood of unfairly subsidized grain across our border, it drops the prices for American farmers. It is not fair. It is not fair that factory workers in this country are told: `You compete against 14-year-olds that work 14 hours a day for 14 cents an hour somewhere on the other side of the globe.' That is not fair competition. Yet, that is precisely what is negotiated in these trade agreements. 
My only point is--I will simplify it because others want to speak. I was going to offer a second-degree amendment to strip out the first provision which would push for fast-track trade authority. But in deference to time--Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers are gallantly trying to run this bill through the Senate in a way that is thoughtful and favorable to everybody--in deference to that, I will not offer a second-degree amendment. I will just oppose the amendment that has been offered. I want to cooperate. I think other Members do as well. 
I do just want to say that while there is some in this amendment to commend it--some provisions to commend it, the first provision that says let's start doing again that which has failed us so badly, let's begin anew to stimulate trade policy that has resulted in such substantial increases in our Federal trade deficits, let's try once again and see if we can't do more trade agreements that have resulted in such unfairness to American farmers, I say there is no sense in that at all. 
Let me complete my statement by just showing a couple of charts. This is the trade deficit. If this isn't an avalanche of red ink, I don't know what is. Those who say this is a successful strategy, I say get me the names of the people who negotiated these trade agreements and let's make sure they do not negotiate again for this country. 
Let me just provide the one that shows what is happening with China. Our trade deficit with China is $50 billion and getting worse yearly. We don't get enough wheat into China. They displaced us as a major wheat supplier to China, as you know. We don't get enough pork into China. They consume half the world's pork. Our trade agreement with China, or the agreement by which we trade with China, is fundamentally unfair with us. If we take your trousers, shoes, shorts, and shirts, you take our beef and wheat, and don't tell us when you need to buy our airplanes from us, that you will only buy our airplanes from the United States if they come and manufacture them in China. 
That is not fair trade. 
Let's stand up for this country's interest. 
There are some who say, `Well, when you talk like that, you are a protectionist.' I am not a protectionist. I am for expanded trade. But I am darned sure for insisting that this country demand fair trade. 
Let me just, with one final chart, describe graphically what I have talked about now for a few minutes. 
In 1993, when we negotiated the trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico and an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. Two years later, three years later, that trade deficit went from $11 billion to $23 billion with Canada, and it went from a surplus of $2 billion with Mexico to a nearly $16 billion deficit with Mexico. 
If that is progress, you give them the names of people who call it progress, and I think they ought to be banned from further trade negotiations. 
So I cannot support the amendment that is offered because it calls for fast-track trade authority and the renewal of that authority. And while I will not offer a second-degree amendment to strip that, I will simply vote against the amendment for the reasons I have stated. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I would like us to have a debate. In fact, the Senator from Idaho was winning a debate we weren't having a few minutes ago. So that is the easiest debate to win. We weren't having a debate a couple minutes ago about price supports. We were having a debate about this amendment. But we did have a discussion yesterday about price supports, and the Senator from Idaho described the Democratic Congress previously that did so and so, and the President, and USDA. 
This is not about which party has forsaken farmers. This is about, after all, what can be done to help farmers survive in the future. I am all for this nation to say to farmers, `Get your money from the marketplace.' I would love for a farmer to load up a truck and drive that truck to the country elevator and raise that hoist and drop that grain and sell it and get a decent price for it. But I will you this: that farmer loses money on every load of grain and loses big money, not because of something they have done but because of a whole range of other reasons--because, first of all, we have bad trade agreements, we have unfair grain coming in undercutting their markets, we have trade sanctions that mean 10 percent of the international wheat market is outside of their ability to sell, when they market up into the neck of a bottle against grain trade firms that hold an iron fist around the neck of that bottle when they buy farm machinery and equipment--guess what. They pay for it. They pay through the nose because those prices are going up. 
When they try to get their grain to a flour miller, four milling firms own over 60 percent of the milling capacity in this country. The same thing with wet corn milling. The same thing with meatpackers. 
If the Senator from Idaho can tell me that a family farmer driving on that lonely road in an old truck, in most cases a 10- or 12- or 15-year-old truck, trying to get those few bushels of grain to market, hoping above hope that they will be able to get something for that grain that meets their cost of living and meets their cost of production--if the Senator from Idaho can tell me that the deck isn't stacked against those farmers, that we don't have virtual monopolies in every area they turn around, that they don't show up at a railroad track and find that there are not two or three railroads ready to serve them, there is one (and in my State they will double-charge because there is no competition)--if the Senator from Idaho can tell me that that farmer driving that truck is driving down the road towards free and open and fair competition, then I say that is just fine, then we ought to butt out. 
But if the Senator can't say that--and I do not think he can say that in a million years--then somebody, somebody, had better say that family farmers matter and the future of this country will be benefited and enhanced if we decide that family farming has value and merit. 
I said it yesterday, and I am going to say it again. There is something so fundamentally wrong with what is happening in this country with respect to agriculture. We have people starving on the other side of the world, people trying to eat leaves on trees because they don't have food, and we have people driving their trucks to the elevator, sweating all year and risking everything they have in life to plant a crop and harvest it, and they are told when they get to the elevator that their grain doesn't have value, their crop doesn't have value. That is a situation we must find a way to correct and change. 
So, while we agree on some things, the Senator from Idaho and I, one thing we don't agree on is suggesting, as he has suggested, that, `Gee, it is the Democrats here, Democrats there.' All of us, Republicans and Democrats, have a stake in whether there are family farmers in the future. 
I wish very much that we never again have to have a farm program that provides support prices. But I will say this, when grain prices collapse and crops are ravaged by disease, if someone is not available to step in to say to family farmers, `We are here to help; you matter,' if someone isn't around to say, `We are not going to pull the safety net out from under you because we want you in our future,' then they are not going to survive and we will have corporate agrifactories farming America from the west coast to the east coast. And some might be fat and happy about that, thinking it is good for the country, but it won't be me, because we will have lost something very important in rural areas of our country. 
I know the majority leader wishes to be recognized. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota remembers a couple of years ago this Congress--or a Congress passed a new farm bill, one that I voted against and one he voted against. Do you remember, following the passage of the new farm bill, some of the large corporate agricultural interests were celebrating? They said, `We won.' The big corporate agricultural interests said they won. So they were having a big celebration. 
It is not surprising, then, back when they were trying to push this kind of farm bill through, that those of us who voted against this farm bill said, `You are pulling the safety net out from under family farmers.' 
You have minimum wages for folks who work at the bottom of the economic scale in town. What they were trying to do 2 years ago, with the farm bill, is the same as saying to the minimum wage earners: Let's cut the minimum wage to a buck an hour and call it `freedom to work.' It would be the same thing on minimum wage: Let's cut it to a dollar an hour and call it `freedom to work.' 
What they said to farmers was: Let's pull your safety net out from under you and call it Freedom to Farm. What a bunch of baloney. Then prices collapsed, we have crop disease, we have disaster, we have family farmers going broke in record numbers, so many that we don't have enough auctioneers to handle the sales in North Dakota, and now we are back here a couple of years later and folks say, `Gee, the farm bill is working just fine.' It is not working just fine. This is not an accident. We don't have price supports that are sufficient. 
I would say the amendment before us, offered by the minority leader, is the most modest of amendments. We ought to go, at a minimum, to $3.75 or $4 on a marketing loan, triggered to the first 20,000 bushels of wheat produced, so that you target some reasonable support to family farms and say, with that, that family farms matter, they have merit and worth and value in our society. 
Does the Senator recall, a couple of years ago, the celebration by the corporate interests in agriculture over the passage of that farm bill?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughts expressed by the Senator from Minnesota. I want to follow on, just briefly, on the question of trade. It relates to this entire issue of how farmers are doing, because farmers are told by some: You go ahead and compete in the free marketplace. We will set you loose. Go ahead and compete in the free market. 
Then farmers discover there is no free market. When they market up, the large grain trade firms have their fists around the neck of the body of a few firms that control all that. Four firms control most of the flour milling; four firms control most of the meat packing--you name it. I have shown the list out here. In every area where farmers market, there are four firms that control the majority of the processing. 
With respect to trade--the Senator from Minnesota mentioned trade--farmers are told: You compete in the free market system. 
Let me tell you just about the United States-Canadian situation. The vote on the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, when I was in the House of Representatives and on the Ways and Means Committee, was 34 to 1; 34 to 1. Guess who the `1 ' was. Yes, that's me. It probably says one of a couple of things. It probably says I have no influence at all with the other 34 members. It may say that. They said to me, `You are going to be the only one who votes against this. Gee, this must be a unanimous vote. We must have your vote. Everybody else in this committee is going to vote for this.' 
I said, `This is a terrible piece of legislation for this country. You are selling out American farmers with this trade agreement, and you know it. And I wouldn't vote for this in 100 years.' And I didn't. 
Let me tell you what has happened. We have a woman from North Dakota who marries a Canadian, and they go back to southwestern North Dakota for Thanksgiving. She decides, `I am going to take some of that good hard red spring wheat that they produce in North Dakota--we produce in North Dakota, back to Canada, because I am going to crush it a little bit back there and bake some whole wheat bread.' She loves to bake bread. 
So they go back to Canada after their Thanksgiving break. She has a couple of grocery bags full of hard red spring wheat from North Dakota, so that when she gets back home she can bake a little bread. She gets to the Canadian border and she is told, `Oh, we are sorry, you can't take that wheat into Canada. You can't take a couple of grocery sacks full of wheat into Canada.' All the way to the border she meets semi-truckload after semi-truckload after semi-truckload of Canadian wheat coming south. 
Or a man with a pickup truck, and just kernels of wheat in the back, is told you must sweep out the back of the pickup truck before you can enter Canada with kernels of wheat. 
So he sweeps the pickup truck box out. All the time he is sweeping, Canadian 18-wheel semi-truckloads of wheat are coming into this country. In fact, we even had an agreement with Canada at one point to provide some sort of reasonable limit, and they exceeded the limit last year by 25,000 semi-truckloads--25,000 semi-truckloads. 
I went up to the border--I told my colleagues this many times before--with Earl Jensen, and we had a 10-year-old, orange, 2-ton truck with a few bushels of wheat on it. We almost had to use our windshield wipers to wipe away the grain splattering against our windshield on a windy day from Canadian 18-wheelers hauling all that flood of Canadian grain into our country. 
Guess what? When Earl and I pulled up to the border, we were told, `We're sorry, you can't get that American grain into Canada.' 
Free trade? Who negotiated that kind of soft-headed, weak-kneed trade agreement do we have that refuse to stand up for this country's interest, that say to other countries, `Yeah, you can close your borders to us and we will open our borders to you, and we will call it fair, and we will call it square'--what kind of a deal is that? 
In this town, everybody talks about free trade, never wanting to talk about the details. The fact is, every one of our farmers in North Dakota and every one of the farmers in Minnesota, represented by Senator Wellstone, confront that problem every day, and it is unfair. 
That grain comes flooding across our border, I am convinced unfairly subsidized, and we sent the Government Accounting Office up to the Canadian Wheat Board to audit their books and records, because we think they are dumping illegally in this country. Guess what they said? `We are sorry, we have no intention of opening our books and records to you; scram, get out of here.' So here we are. 
Prices collapsed because of unfair trade and, yes, Canada is a major part of that. Prices collapsed for a dozen other reasons. Rampant crop disease devastates the quality of the crop, and then we have farm families who for 30 years have been turning that yard light off and on every morning as they get up to do chores, gas their tractor, go out and plant their seeds and hope they can raise a crop. And now they are told, `Well, gee, we are sorry; we have free trade and a free market and if you can't make it in either, tough luck.' 
The plain fact is, there is no free trade and there is no free market, and anybody who thinks about the details and the specifics knows it. We owe it to the farmers of this country in a range of areas, whether it is international trade or price supports or other areas to say we want to stand for the interest of family farmers. 
Let me also say the Freedom to Farm bill was a bill that had a couple of propositions, one of which makes eminent good sense, and I support it, and that is, farmers ought to be able to choose to plant what they want to plant when they want to plant it. That makes sense to me, and I support that. But the other is to say we will now essentially withdraw price supports and tell farmers you operate in the free market, despite the fact the free market doesn't exist. That doesn't make any sense. If ever an example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater is appropriate, it is here. 
We didn't need, in order to give farmers planning flexibility, to decide that price supports don't matter. Eighteen years ago, the target price for wheat was $4.38 a bushel, and the loan rate was $3.65 a bushel. In every other area, prices have gone up for input costs; in every other area dealing with other earners, minimum wages have been increased some. But the compensation for farmers has been substantially diminished in terms of support prices. It is as if to say the economic all-stars in this country don't matter. They work hard, they produce well, they produce the best quality food for the lowest percent of disposable income anywhere on the face of the Earth, and they are told, `By the way, the value of what you produce does not have worth.' 
I said yesterday, and I say it again, because at least to me 
personally it is so perplexing and seems so Byzantine, this morning, as I speak, halfway around the globe, we are told there are old women climbing trees in Sudan to forage for leaves to eat because they are near starvation. A million, a million and a quarter people are on the abyss of starvation. And then halfway around the globe, again, we are told those family farmers, who raise food in such abundant quantity and such good food, that what they produce doesn't have value and doesn't have worth. 
The marketplace says to them--whatever this marketplace is--choked down on the top, choked from the bottom, choked on the sides by unfair trade by monopolies from railroads, to grain processors, to millers, you name it; they are telling the farmer in this distorted marketplace that what you produce doesn't have value. It costs you 5 bucks per bushel to produce; we will give you $3 for it. Want to lose $2 a bushel? That is fine. Lose your heritage, lose what your dad produced, lose what your grandad produced. And you go to these meetings and you find these folks who stand up at a meeting, as they have for me, and one sticks out in my mind--I have had many of them in recent weeks--a big, burly, husky kind of guy with a beard and with friendly eyes who said, `You know, I have been a farmer all my life. I love farming. My grandad farmed. My dad farmed, and I have farmed for 23 years.' He got tears in his eyes and his chin began to quiver as he said, `But I have to quit. I can't make it. I can't raise grain at $5 a bushel or $4.50 a bushel and sell it at $3.50 a bushel and my lender says I can't get enough money to put in the next crop.' 
When you see people like that begin to tear up and talk about what family farming means to them, then you understand this is not dollars and cents, this is not just some macroeconomic theory, this is something much more in this country. 
Family farming has always meant much more than just dollars and cents. Thomas Jefferson described it, as I said yesterday, as the most important enterprise in America. His words were more eloquent than that, but that is what he said. What he meant was these people who dot the landscape in America, the broad-based economic ownership that comes with family farming contributes immensely to our country. I have said before, it contributes to the family values of our country. Family values have always originated on family farms and rolled through to our small towns, nourishing our small towns and our big cities. 
There is much more here than just dollars and cents. I hope that as we begin these discussions we can remember this. At least the first amendment that we adopted yesterday says, yes, this Congress recognizes there is a crisis. In my State, family farmers have seen a 98-percent decrease in net income. Name anybody living anywhere, except the wealthiest among us, who could, at the end of a period where they have lost 98 percent of their income, stand and say, `Well, I am doing just fine.' Most everybody on every block in every community in every facet of life would be flat on their back losing 98 percent of their income, and we know that. 
It is not different for family farmers. They are now flat on their backs facing collapsed prices, rampant crop disease and fundamentally unfair trade in every direction, markets that are captured and cornered and collapsed by a few companies, a few companies that control those markets. 
It is one thing to say to farmers, `It is a free market and free trade, and God bless you, and what happens.' That is not, in my judgment, what this country ought to offer family farmers in terms of domestic policy.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, states it exactly as it is. I have said before, this particular amendment gives modesty an understated reputation, in my judgment. It is too modest for my taste. I certainly am going to support it. I certainly will support it because it does increase the loan rate, albeit to a level that is far too low. It does increase the loan rate some. It does extend the time in which a farmer can use that marketing loan to better market their grain; and certainly we ought to do that. 
If we say, as a consistent philosophy, farmers should go to the marketplace for their price, then you must give farmers the time to access the marketplace when the price might be better than it is just after harvest. Normally, just after harvest they truck that grain to the elevator and--guess what--they find prices that are not very high. It would be better for them to hold it and wait until it is in their advantage to market it. 
The Senator from South Dakota describes it as it exactly is. This does not, in any way, unravel the tenets of the current farm program. Would I like to unravel it? You bet your life I would. I do not support it. I never did. I think it is a terrible farm program. Does the planning flexibility make sense? Yes, it does. I support that fully. But the notion that somehow we ought to decide that in every other area we will provide some basic support because that area has merit and worth and value, but in family farming we will pull the support out because somehow that is of lesser value to this country--as I said earlier, this is a lot more than dollars and cents. 
That is what the farm bill debate missed a couple of years ago. The specific amendment which I intend to vote for but which is so incredibly modest--it really ought to be replaced by an amendment that says for a certain amount of production, 20,000 bushels of wheat, for example, we will provide a $3.75 or $4 loan rate, marketing loan rate--not the kind of loan where the Federal Government takes control of the grain but, in effect, it becomes a marketing loan where we pay the difference between what the farmer gets on the open market and what the support price is. That is what we ought to be doing. But this amendment is certainly worth supporting because, as the Senator says, it does not fray, undermine or unravel the tenets of the current farm program.

Mr. DORGAN. The answer to that is clear. The bigger interests win, the littler interests lose. That is why it seems to me that if you follow the philosophy of the current farm policy, you have to give them the flexibility of going to the marketplace when it is in their interest. And they do not have that capability now because most of them are forced to haul that to the market and sell it as soon as they get it off the ground because they have to pay back the operating loans. 
Anybody who says this isn't about big versus little is just flat wrong. Look, if somebody wants to farm an entire county, they 
have every right to do that. They can farm the entire county. They can buy 50,000 acres of land. They can plow as far as they can plow in 24 hours, camp overnight, and plow back as far as they can. They have a right to do that in this country. But they ought to join with the good Lord and their banker and figure out how they make ends meet. I am not terribly interested if they want to try to farm the whole county, how we offer price supports for them. 
But the family out there farming a family-size operation, they are turning on the yardlight, they are doing chores, they are taking enormous risks--do I want to provide some type of continuity and help for them? Of course I do. It seems to me, we ought to construct an approach that says to those folks, `You really do matter.' We have in North Dakota--you probably have the same in South Dakota, and I assume other States--we have 53 counties. Ten of them are growing and 43 of them are shrinking. My home county was 5,000 people; it is now 3,000 people. All that has to do with family farmers leaving the farm. And they are now leaving at an accelerated pace. 
I do not know that there is a magic answer to all of this. It is just that this particular amendment is an amendment that says, let us try to find a way to give farmers some flexibility to access the marketplace when it is more in their interest to do so rather than be forced to haul their grain to market and sell it when perhaps the prices are at bottom levels.

Mr. DORGAN. I have nearly completed my statement. I respect the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Mississippi. They both are wonderful legislators. We might disagree from time to time on some of these issues, but I know he has been here for some while. This is, as you might imagine, enormously important. Agriculture drives our State's economy. I feel very strongly about a number of these issues. But I certainly want the Senator from Indiana to be able to make his statement. 
Let me finish by saying, I do not come here trying to figure out who is at fault. While I have strong feelings about farm policy, when I think this current policy is not good farm policy, and I have opposed it in the past, I think everyone comes at this with good will and with their own strong feelings about what ought to be done. 
But I do think that family farmers out there, are struggling these days against the odds and circumstances where they cannot control their own destinies at all. It is not their fault they have been devastated by crop disease. That is not their fault. It is not their fault that grain prices have collapsed. They did not have anything to do with that. And it is not their fault that the Crop Insurance Program, that we advertised as replacing a disaster program, does not work at all for somebody who suffers five straight disasters. 
One-third of our counties in North Dakota have had a disaster every year for 5 straight years--every year for 5 straight years. It is not their fault that crop insurance does not work for them. Each succeeding year means you get less of a base because you did not get a crop the previous year, so you still pay those premiums and get less from the Crop Insurance Program. 
Again, farmers ought not to be faulted for these circumstances. We ought to find a way to create a connection here to something that does work, to say to them, `You matter. And we want to do something that makes a difference for you. We want to do something that gives you the opportunity to continue to farm.' If you are a good manager and if you are willing to take some risks, we're willing to stand for you and with you to say, `Yes, here's a disaster program. Here's an indemnification program. Here's a little better opportunity on a loan rate. Here's the ability to hold that grain a little longer. Here are a number of things we want to do to try to make your life a little easier.' 
If we do that together--and I hope we will--and if we work with President Clinton who some of us plan to meet with this afternoon--I hope that perhaps at the end of the day we will all have decided that we have made a difference for family farmers. And, more importantly, I hope that family farmers will decide that we have made a difference in their lives as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me applaud the Senator from Nebraska for a statement that I think was eloquent and filled with good sense. And I certainly want to associate myself with the remarks he has just made. And even though we were on different sides of the previous amendment, let me say, as I did previously, the Senator from Indiana is a very respected Senator, someone for whom I have great respect on foreign policy issues. 
I am pleased to be here to speak as a cosponsor of the amendment that he has offered. It makes good sense to me. And I say, I think, as the Senator from Nebraska said, I would only go further than this. I certainly support this. I think it is a step in the right direction, but there is even more that we can do. 
The question that is required to be asked now is, When we impose sanctions around the world, for various purposes, many of them important purposes that deal with national security and other issues, should those sanctions include the shipment of food and the shipment of medicine? 
Frankly, I wonder if anyone believes that Saddam Hussein has ever missed a meal because of sanctions imposed by this country. Does anybody believe that Saddam Hussein has missed a meal? I do not think so. We cut off food shipments to Iraq. And if Saddam Hussein is making all of his meals, guess who misses their meals? It is almost always the poor and the hungry who are injured when you cut off shipments of food. 
Does anybody believe that Fidel Castro does not eat well nearly every meal when he chooses to have what he wants to eat? But when we cut off food shipments to Cuba, we know that it will be the poor and the hungry who will be injured by that. 
Our country, for very legitimate reasons, says we are very concerned about what is happening in Iraq, Iran, Libya, Cuba, and more. For legitimate reasons we say that. I am sure the Senator from Indiana, at greater length than any others of us, could recite the foreign policy issues and the national security issues that attend to those countries and their relationship with us and others in the world. 
But the question before us is not, Should we be concerned about those countries? Of course we should. The question is, When we impose sanctions, what should those sanctions contain? Is it in our interest and in the interest of the hungry and the poor around the world to include in those sanctions the withdrawal of shipments of grain and the withdrawal of shipments of medicine? 
I have clearly an interest here on behalf of family farmers. I represent one of the most agricultural States in the Nation. And nearly 10 percent of the market for wheat is out of limits or off limits to our family farmers because we have decided to impose sanctions and therefore take those markets off limits to our farmers. Does that cost farmers money? You bet. It takes money right out of their pockets. They are, in effect, told by these sanctions, `You, Mr. And Mrs. Farmer, you pay the cost of these sanctions. You pay the cost as a result of lost income.' 
Where I would go further is, I would support and am a cosponsor of an amendment that will be offered by Senator Dodd, and I think cosponsored by Senator Hagel, saying, let us not include food and medicine in future sanctions. That is not appropriate as part of sanctions. I am a cosponsor of that amendment to be offered. I would go further to say, this country ought to decide, if it is to impose sanctions in the future, or for sanctions that now exist, it ought to reimburse farmers for the cost of those sanctions. Why should this country simply say, `Here is our desired effect, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer. You pay the cost of it'? If it is for national security, let it come out, then, of the national security accounts from which we pay for many other matters, and say to family farmers, `We'll reimburse you for those lost markets.' That is an amendment I am thinking of offering to this as well. We will see what results from that. 
But it is required, I think, to say, as we discuss this issue, as I said earlier today, there is some horrible disconnection in this world. 
Halfway around the world there are people in Sudan, we are told, old women, climbing trees to forage for leaves to eat, leaves because they are on the abyss of starvation; a million to a million and a quarter of them are on the edge of starvation because they don't have enough to eat. 
Turn the globe another halfway around and you will find America's farmers, who are the economic all-stars, produce food in abundant quantity, and they are told in our system that when they take that grain which represents that food to market, that their product doesn't have value, doesn't have worth. There is something that is terribly disconnected about that. 
I have been in many parts of the world. What I remember most about the desperate poverty and hunger that exists, for example, is in the desperate slum called Cite Soleil, on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. You see poverty as bad and conditions as desperate as anywhere else in the world. I leaned over a crib where a young child was dying of starvation in one of the worst slums you can imagine. This child had no one. The child had lost most of its hair; what hair was left was turning red as a result of severe malnutrition and starvation. This child, the doctor told me, was dying. 
I thought to myself, there is such a terrible, terrible, disconnection here because we produce food in abundant quantity. How on Earth can moving food around the world to all parts of the world that need our food in a way that connects our interests to the interests of those who need it, how on Earth could that ever threaten our national security? It does not and it could not. 
The Senator from Indiana offers an amendment on the issue of sanctions. It is very simple. It describes sanctions in the future. We ought to deal with sanctions that now exist, as well. It describes conditions for the imposition of those sanctions that deal with unilateral sanctions. It says the Secretary of Agriculture should use export assistance under various programs to offset any damage or likely damage to producers and so on. 
I fully support that and I am pleased to be a cosponsor, but I say again we have much, much more to do. Hubert Humphrey, many years ago, used to say, `Send them anything they can't shoot back.' What he meant by that is it will never injure our national security interests to send American food around the world, to sell it in markets where we can sell it, and to move it to other markets under title II and III under Food for Peace, and in some cases, title I, in other markets where they cannot afford to purchase it. It is always in our best interest. Is it in the best interest of farmers? Of course, but it also happens to run parallel to the national interests of our country. 
Let me finish where I began and say I am pleased to vote for this amendment, pleased to be a cosponsor, and will cosponsor an amendment that will go further, that Senator Dodd will offer, and may offer one myself, that deals with present sanctions and reimbursement to farmers for those sanctions, saying that the Government ought to not force them to bear the full burden of the cost of sanctions. 
But I thank the Senator from Indiana for offering this amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might respond to the inquiry of the Senator from Iowa, who has used the floor to describe his sense of the Senate resolution. The problem in North Dakota has been that family farmers lost 98 percent of their income last year as compared to 1996. They planted a crop and they discovered that the crop was devastated by disease. The worst crop disease in this century has hit our part of the country. It has also touched Minnesota, Montana, South Dakota, and some other areas, but none quite as devastating as in North Dakota. 
So a farmer plants a crop and hopes it grows. When it grows he hopes it avoids the insects, avoids the drought, avoids too much 
water, and avoids disease. Unfortunately, our crop didn't, it was devastated by disease. Then the farmer harvests those crops, or is what left of them. 
That is not easy. I have been out on harvests plenty of times in my life. It is tough work. The farmer drives his truck into town and pulls it up to the county elevator and unloads that grain. The harvest in that truck box has all of your hopes and dreams for an entire year. That harvest in the truck box determines whether you are going to be able to feed your family, whether you are going to continue farming, and whether you are going to be able to pursue your hopes and dreams on the farm. That is what is in that truck box. 
Then they unload that truck, and they put that durum, or the wheat or the barley, into that country grain elevator, and it is weighed, evaluated. And the elevator operator says, `Well, Mr. Farmer, Mrs. Farmer, we have decided that your grain is worth $2.75 a bushel.' You didn't get much for it because you had a lot of disease. But what you got is worth $2.75 a bushel. The farmer looks at the price and says, `Well, the problem is it cost me $5 a bushel to raise that grain.' 
That is in short exactly what has been happening in our State. It has been devastated by disease and low prices. 
Think of it this way: Ask any group of families living on any block of this country, any group of businesses on any Main Street of America, for that matter any legislators who are standing visiting in a circle. Ask them about what they would do if they were losing 98 percent of their income. Ask the folks on the block, the folks on Main Street, the legislators, anyone, how would you like to lose 98 percent of your income? Then ask yourself: How am I going to provide for my family? How am I going to meet the future and continue to farm? 
That is what has happened to our family farmers. I will read some letters. I will not do it at the moment, but I will read some letters of some farm families in North Dakota who were forced to sell out this year. They say, `Well, we are good farmers. We don't spend money frivolously. We are not going out at night. We work. We work to the bone, and we try. We try hard. And the fact is we are going broke. Yet, everybody else dealing with this grain that we produce is making money.' 
The people who haul it, the railroads, have record profits. The people who put it in the mill have record profits. The people who make it into breakfast cereal have record profits. Take some wheat, puff it up, call it `Puffed Wheat,' put it on the grocery shelf, charge $4 or $5 for it, or put it in bread. The farmer gets less than the heel. 
Farm prices have collapsed. Have bread prices come down? I don't think so. Have cereal prices come down? I don't think so. Yet everybody in the process, except the people who grow the food, is making money. 
There is one final point I want to make. I was on the floor of the Senate yesterday pointing out that half way around this globe of ours there are people climbing trees for food. Old women are climbing trees in Sudan to forage leaves to eat. They are eating leaves from trees because they are dying of hunger. Over 1 million people are at threat of starvation in Sudan. 
The people on this side of the world are told, yes, there are 1 million people facing starvation. They are eating leaves off trees. But the food you raise on the family farms somehow doesn't have worth. It doesn't have value. That is a terrible, terrible disconnection of what we ought to be doing. 
So the answer to the question of the Senator from Iowa is that our farmers have been devastated more than in any other State largely because we have been hit harder by disease. But all farmers trying to market wheat at this point are discovering that the price of wheat has collapsed. 
Today the price is $2.99 a bushel at one of our local elevators in North Dakota. It was $5.75 just 2 years ago. The price today is what it was decades ago when the price of all the inputs was much, much less. At today's prices, farmers are losing over $2.00 per bushel. 
So the question facing us is whether we are going to do something that gives family farmers an opportunity to make a living. Does family farming have value to our society? I believe it is more than just dollars and cents. If you believe as I do that it is important, then the question becomes what is the solution. What kinds of solutions and what menu of choices can we select that will say to family farmers, `You are not alone? When you hit price valleys, we will try to build bridges across those valleys because we want you in our future.' 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for asking the question. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence so that I could answer.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Iowa and the Senators from South Dakota and Minnesota who were here. We have offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the question of the farm crisis and will get a vote on that at some point. The Senator from Iowa indicated other amendments will be offered. Let me just provide a bit more context for some of this. 
I know a lot of folks in this country don't live on a farm, have never been on a farm, and don't know much about family farming. Perhaps they wonder why is there so much discussion about family farming. Why does it matter? 
I come from a small community of 300 people in southwestern North Dakota, which is where we raise a lot of wheat and livestock. I suppose one can look at those parts of the country where there are not many people who live in the area and say that is not a big population center and it doesn't matter much. But it is where we produce our food, by and large, in this country. 
When you get on an airplane and fly across the States at night, you look out the window. I am sure as the Senator from Iowa flies across the State of Iowa, just as I fly across North Dakota, he sees these yard lights out there at night. Take a look at them. See these brilliant little lights from the prairie that sparkle up to your airplane window and understand what is there. Underneath that light is a family out there. They have turned the yard light on, on the family farm. That is where they are trying to make a living. All those yard lights out there on the family farms represent the economic blood vessels that represent the rural lifestyle that allow these small towns to flourish and to live. That is where I grew up. 
I am a Jeffersonian Democrat. I believe, as Thomas Jefferson did, that this country will survive as a free country with the kind of political freedoms that our Constitution guarantees us so long as we also have economic freedom. Economic freedom and political freedom go hand in hand. And economic freedom is nurtured and guaranteed by broad-based economic ownership in our country. 
Jefferson believed in broad-based economic ownership. Small businesses and family farms dotting the prairies and populating our main streets represent broad-based economic ownership and, ultimately, represent the opportunity within economic freedom. 
The country these days has seen an orgy of mergers. Gee, every day you wake up and you pick up the morning paper and somebody else has merged. You see it in almost every industry. Recently, it has been banks. The biggest banks in the country discover they love each other, apparently, and decide they want to get married. We didn't even know they were dating, and all of a sudden the newspaper in the morning tells us they want to get hitched, so they merge and two big banks make a much bigger bank. 
Airlines have been doing it as well. Big airlines take a look at the little airlines and they don't like the competition. They say, `We want to buy you up and merge.' So they merge. Two big airlines decide they will be better off if they merge, and they merge. 
It doesn't matter what industry you look at. We used to have 30 or 40 class 1 railroads in this country. Now we have a handful at best. They all merged. 
Some say that would also be good for farming. Let's have them all merge together; we can have farmland farmed; just get the family out of there. That is what some say. They say we can have giant corporate agrifactories producing agricultural products from California to Maine and that we don't need family farmers living out on the farms. 
First of all, I think the people who ignore the question of size and mergers in this country do so at their own peril. And I think the people who ignore the question of the health of family farms do so at their own peril as well. Broad-based economic ownership in this country is important, and we ought to be concerned about it. We especially ought to be concerned about it on the family farm. 
In addition to hearing about mergers every morning, you turn on the radio going to work and you hear reports on America's economic health. It is always some gray-suited economist who comes from the same university and works for the same entities, in most cases, who tells us how healthy America is, and they tell us in the morning how healthy America is by their latest reports on what we consume. 
I actually used to teach economics a couple of years. I don't always admit that. Yet, I have been able to overcome that experience and, nonetheless, go on to lead a decent life. When I taught economics, I was one of those who didn't teach that our economic health in America is dependent on what we consume. No, it is dependent on what we produce. Real economic wealth is represented by what you produce. 
The most prodigious producers in our country are family farmers. They are the all-star producers, bar none. Yet, you can take a look at this economy of ours and who is doing well and who isn't. Then you will discover that this economy has decided, for a whole series of reasons, some of which are public policy reasons and others, that the producers on the family farm are somehow expendable; it doesn't matter whether they do well. 
I mentioned some while ago that in North Dakota family farmers lost 98 percent of their income in 1 year. I don't know of anyone who can withstand the loss of 98 percent of their income, not in theory, not in practice. When you lose 98 percent of your income, you lose your ability to continue. 
I am going to read just a few letters from some North Dakotans, because they say it much better than I can. 
A woman named Shirley in North Dakota. Their son is a beginning farmer. Shirley and her husband farm. Their son is a beginning farmer. She said:  
My son filled a sprayer with water, then checked the temperature at 4:30 a.m. this morning, June 3, 1998. Last night, freezing temperature records were forecast for all of North Dakota. 
They ran into a cold spell. 
She said: 
My son filled a sprayer with water, then checked the temperature at 4:30 a.m. because it freezes usually just before sunrise. He was prepared to go out and spray the beans with water to prevent them from being killed by frost. He probably already put in a 15- to 18-hour day, but at 4:30 a.m., he was up filling the sprayer with water to try to save his crop. 
He does carpentry work all winter to make ends meet. He serves on cooperative boards. He is a volunteer on the emergency medical team that runs two rural ambulances in our community. Last year, two quarter sections of his land were totaled by hail, and Federal crop paid almost nothing. He's been able to pay his $5,294-a-year health insurance bill only by giving up some farm-related necessities, like hail insurance. 
She said: 
This letter is my personal plea that Congress appreciate the value of family farmers in this country and do something to help stabilize their income. 
This is from Edwin from North Dakota. He said: 
If things continue as they are now, in 10 to 15 years, you'll find very few family farms. I believe when and if this happens and the farms get big enough, the price of food will go up drastically because the companies that operate these corporate farms will then be able to hold back production until they get what they want to make a profit. I farm a 1,200-acre farm. The original farm was homesteaded by my grandad, so I'm the third generation to be out here on the family farm. I'm 61 years old and have a son who would very much like to take over the farm when I retire, and I would like nothing better. But I have no choice but to tell him that as it is now, it is almost impossible to make a living on this farm anymore. 
The Federal Government says they want to keep family farms viable, but the freedom to farm bill is selling them down the river, in my opinion. 
Mr. President, a letter from a man named Kelly, a family farmer. He wrote to Secretary Glickman and sent me a copy of it. He said: 
You can say that a farm crisis is occurring in a small isolated area and that Mother Nature has caused all of this, but I disagree. First of all, this is not an isolated area. This is a huge area. The population is small because many farms have already been forced out of business. Mother Nature is something farmers are used to dealing with when they have the proper tools to manage the climate wrath that she can behold. But these tools have slowly been taken away from farmers as yield guarantees and crop insurance formulas are getting lower and lower each time a claim is filed. Secondly, farmers' marketing tools--export enhancement and restricted trade with Canada--have been thrown in the junk pile by two successive administrations. 
I am not going to continue to read more letters, but I think everyone understands the circumstances. Let me mention, finally, a paragraph from a woman named Kristen who talks about her father: 
I spoke to my father and he said if he doesn't have a good year this year, doesn't make it this year, he probably will have to get another job and sell the farm. 
She said: 
That broke my heart. My father worked so hard all his life to give me and my brother the best upbringing and education. He put me through undergraduate and graduate school. As a child, I remember not seeing him much from April until he started taking me to basketball practice in August. He got up before dawn and returned long after I went to bed. That is what family farming is. The winters were not idle, either. Intricate planning necessary to run a successful farm is done all year-round. The reason my father is struggling is not because he is not a good farmer. He doesn't spend money frivolously. There is an increase in disease ravaging his crops, and the government is cutting back the help to make up for these losses. 
Well, Mr. President, you get the point. But the point is more than just that. There is suffering and there is a farm crisis. The point is that somehow this system of ours has decided that everybody else can make money with the farmer's product. Yet the persons who grow it, it is OK if they do not make any money, and it is OK if they go broke. 
You raise some crops, as I mentioned a bit ago, on the farm, and ship them through the process. The people who are going to haul that crop are going to make money. We have a railroad through our State that is going to charge them twice as much to haul that grain per carload of wheat, than they would charge on another line where there is competition. From Bismarck to Minneapolis there is no competition, so a farmer is told, `You pay $2,300 a carload to ship your wheat to Minneapolis.' Yet, if you put the wheat on a train from Minneapolis to Chicago, which is about the same distance, you pay $1,000. Why do they charge us more than double? Because they can. That is the way the system works. 
The people who haul the wheat make money. The people who mill the wheat, the flour mills, are doing just fine. About four firms control about 60 percent of that. They are doing just great, probably making record profits. Grocery interests are doing just fine. 
Virtually everywhere you look, the people who turn it into breakfast food and puff it and crisp it and mangle it and shape it and box it and package it and send it to the store shelves and charge $4 for it, they do just fine. What about the person who produces it and takes all the risks and does all the work to produce the food out there in the family farm. They are the ones going broke in record numbers. In my State, they have had so many farm sales this spring they had to call auctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales. 
The question for the Congress is whether we are we going to do something that says to the family farmers: `You matter. You are important to this country, and we want to provide something that helps you in a range of areas?' 
We ought to help because we have a trade system in this country that, in my judgment, sells out the interests of producers. Our system of trade is not fair. We say to farmers, `We're upset with Cuba; therefore, we won't ship grain to Cuba, and you pay the cost of that lost market. We're upset with Libya; we will not allow you to ship grain to Libya, and you pay the cost, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, for that lost market.' 
Ten percent of the wheat market in the world is off limits to our farmers. And farmers are told that is a foreign policy judgment, and we want you to pay the cost of it. That is not fair. 
We also negotiate trade agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and many others. In every set of circumstances, somehow we end up losing. We send negotiators out and they can lose in a day. I do not understand that. Will Rogers said some 60 years ago, `The United States of America has never lost a war and never won a conference.' He surely must have been thinking about our trade negotiators. How can they lose so quickly? 
Let s talk about Canada. They negotiated an agreement with Canada which fundamentally sells out the interests of our farmers. Every day, in every way, there is a flood of unfairly subsidized grain coming into this country eating away at the profits of our farmers, diminishing our price. 
When we say to the Canadians, `We think you are violating the antidumping laws of this country, and we demand you open your books to our inspectors,' they thumb their noses at us and say, `Go fly a kite. You have no ability to determine the trade practices of Canada.' This incidentally is happening despite the fact that the 
trade negotiator who negotiated the trade agreement with Canada promised in writing it would not happen. That promise was not worth the paper it was written on. 
I can speak at great length about trade. Why can't we get more wheat into China? Why can't we get more beef into Japan? Why can't we get raw potatoes into Mexico? Why can you drink all the Mexican beer up here you can possibly consume in a lifetime, but try to order an American beer in Mexico. Yes, when I talk about beer, I am talking about barley. But rather than talk at great length about all of those trade problems that confront our farmers and diminish their price, my point is, this isn't their fault. 
The Federal Government, through a series of policy initiatives must take some responsibility. First of all, there were bad trade deals that were negotiated poorly, and then not enforced at all. Secondly, there has been a ravaging crop disease which decimates the quantity and quality of a crop. Then third, prices have collapsed following a farm bill that was passed by this Congress. which pulled the rug out from family farmers, and left them without a working safety net. 
When Congress passed the farm bill a couple years ago, the price of wheat peaked at $5.75 a bushel. They called it the Freedom to Farm bill. To pull the rug out from under family farmers and say, `We're going to get rid of the price supports for you,' would be like saying to the minimum wage folks, `Let's cut the minimum wage to $1 an hour and call it freedom to work.' That is what freedom to farm is all about. 
Since freedom to farm was passed, the price of wheat has gone straight down. Now it is almost $2 a bushel below what it costs the family farmer to raise wheat or to produce wheat. Family farmers cannot continue with prices below their costs of production. 
This Congress has to decide whether it wants family farmers in our country's future or doesn't it? If it does, the question becomes what can and must we do together? What can Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals and moderates do together? What can and must we do together to develop some kind of basic safety net to say to family farmers, `You matter. When prices collapse, and you are confronting monopolies on the upside and monopolies on the downside, or you are confronting unfair trade agreements, or you are confronting sanctions all around the world, or when you are confronting crop disease that is devastating your crops, then this Government cares about that, and the rest of the American people will provide some basic kind of safety net for you.' 
That is going to be the question that is posed to Members of Congress in the coming couple of weeks: Do family farmers matter? If they do, what can we do together to try to say to these people, `We'll give you some hope for the future. If you don't get a decent price at the marketplace, we'll provide a support mechanism of some type to get you over this price valley.' 
For decades, this country had decided that when farm prices collapse, we will build a bridge across those price valleys, because family farming matters and we want family farmers to be able to populate this country and retain broad-based economic ownership of the land in America. 
That is the question we have to confront in the next couple of days and couple of weeks as we talk about this farm crisis that gets worse by the day and is affecting more and more areas of the country. 
It is true that North Dakota is hardest hit. It is true that North Dakota had a 98-percent loss of net farm income for family farmers in our State. That is devastating. But it is also the case that crop disease called scab or fusarium head blight is spreading across this country. And it is also true that collapsed grain prices eventually will cause the same kind of problems they cause for our farmers in other parts of the United States. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to just talk briefly about two short items today, the first of which is the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which we hope the Senate will take up perhaps as early as this week. Some suggest that there isn't a need for legislation to ensure the quality of care provided by managed care plans. They believe, I suppose, as some insurance companies do, that things are just fine in managed care and health care in this country. But others, and that includes most of the American people, know better. They worry that health care in this country is now often directed not by doctors or other medical professionals but by some accountant in an insurance office 500 or 1,000 miles away from where the patient is. 
Let me describe, as we have nearly every day for some weeks, a case that illustrates why the American people are so anxious about what is happening in our health care system. This is the example of Mr. Vaughn Dashiell. Vaughn Dashiell is one more reason why HMO reform, or managed care reform, in the form of the Patients' Bill of Rights, should be brought before the Senate. 
Vaughn lived with his wife, Patricia, and their three children in Alexandria, VA, not too far from the U.S. Capitol. He owned and operated his own printing company. On November 20, 1996, Vaughn stayed home from work. He had awakened that morning sick, suffering from a sore throat, a dry mouth and tunnel vision that limited his sight to only 18 inches. He tried to get an appointment to see a doctor within his HMO network but was told there were no appointments available at his designated facility. He was able to speak only to an HMO-employed nurse on duty over the phone. She could have told Vaughn to go to an emergency room for treatment, but instead she told him to make a regular appointment, even though none were available. So here is someone who has health care coverage, wakes up ill, calls the HMO, can't speak to a doctor, instead speaks to a nurse, and the nurse says, `Make an appointment,' but no appointments are available. 
As Vaughn's symptoms worsened, he called his HMO again requesting permission to see a doctor somewhere, or to go to a nearby emergency room for treatment. He was told only to wait and that he would receive a call back from a doctor on duty. When the doctor on duty was consulted, he agreed that Vaughn should go to an emergency room, but neither made a call himself, nor followed-up to see that Vaughn was contacted. And that night Vaughn Dashiell was not contacted--not by the nurse, not by the doctor, or by any other HMO staff regarding his condition and the request he had made for health care. 
The next morning, Patricia Dashiell found her husband incoherent, with his eyes rolling. She hurriedly called the HMO hoping for an answer to Vaughn's problem, and they advised her to call 911. She called 911 and Vaughn arrived at the hospital at 9:18 a.m. in a diabetic coma. His blood sugar level was more than 20 times greater than the normal level. Just 2 hours after being rushed to the emergency room, Vaughn was dead from hyperglycemia. He was 39 years old. He had health insurance coverage, but he couldn't get care when he needed it, and he died. 
This should not happen in this country. Health insurers should not put profits ahead of patients. And too often these days, they do. Vaughn Dashiell's condition would have and could have been treated if his health plan had enabled him to get care when he needed it. But all over this country, we are hearing of patients who need health care and are told by those who have covered them with health insurance, `It is not now available.' 
The Patients' Bill of Rights we have offered in the Senate is very simple. This legislation says that people who have health insurance coverage ought to get the health care they need when they have an urgent need for it. They ought to be able to seek emergency room care if a reasonable person would consider it an emergency. They ought to be able to see the doctor they need for the health care problem they are experiencing. Patients have a right to know all of the options for the treatment of their problem, not just the cheapest, and there are a whole series of other provisions to ensure that medical care will be practiced in a doctor's office or a hospital room, not an insurance office 1,000 miles away. 
I have told, often, of the woman who, having fallen from a horse and hitting her head severely, was in an ambulance, with her brain swelling, on the way to the hospital. She had the presence of mind to tell the ambulance driver that she wanted to be driven to the hospital further away rather than to the nearby hospital. And when she recovered, she was asked why she had insisted, as she was lying there injured in the back of the ambulance with her brain swelling, on being taken to the hospital further away. She said it was because she knew the reputation of the closer hospital, and she knew that it was a for-profit institution with a reputation for being interested in its profit and loss margin than its patients' care. She did not want her body delivered to an emergency room where she would be looked at in terms of dollars and cents. 
That story and the tragic story of Vaughn Dashiell and so many others like it that we have presented to the Senate daily now for so many weeks, describes the anxiety and concern people have in this country. We have the best health care in the world in many respects, but it is available to people in need of health care only if they are able to access the kind of doctors they need when they have need for that medical specialty. 
It is available only if they are able to get to an emergency room when they have need for emergency care. When we have American citizens--thousands and thousand and thousands of them--who are denied care because someone in an office 500 miles away said, `Well, gee, that care is not needed, it is not to be delivered, it is not available,' then the American people have a right to say, `What on Earth kind of health care system is this?' 
One of the stories we presented earlier on the floor of the Senate was of a young boy with cerebral palsy whose managed care officials determined that he had only a 50 percent chance of being able to walk by age 5. And because he had only a 50 percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, plan officials decided that was a minimal benefit and they would withhold it from that young child; it was not cost effective. It was a minimal benefit to have a 50 percent chance of being able to walk when you are 5 years old. 
Shame on the people who make those judgments. Shame on them. 
We are saying with the Patients' Bill of Rights that those who need medical treatment in this country have certain rights, and those who deliver medical treatment certainly should be cost conscious, but cost ought not take precedence over quality. Those who have coverage for their health care needs ought to be able to expect to get their needs taken care of and responded to adequately. That is, regrettably, not the case in many parts of our country today. 
We are led to believe that perhaps this week we will take up some form of the Patients' Bill of Rights. If that happens, it will be the right subject to be debated. It is a subject Americans expect to be addressed. I, as a cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of Rights, feel, as will many of my colleagues, that it is time for us to address this important issue on behalf of the American people.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make some remarks on the subject of the farm crisis that exists in North Dakota and other parts of the country, and discuss some legislation a number of us intend to offer in the coming days and weeks dealing with that issue. 
As a way of describing that issue, the New York Times had a front-page story yesterday that talks about it. The article reports, `As the national economy is booming, lawmakers have begun to focus on one of the few places in the country where times are bad--the northern plains where wheat and livestock prices have plunged and many farmers are desperate.' 
The story goes on to describe the condition in North Dakota and some other States where we have a serious agricultural crisis. Collapsing profits in agriculture mean that we are seeing family farmers going out of business at a record pace. 
Let me describe that with one chart for those who watch these proceedings. In my home State of North Dakota, net farm income has dropped 98 percent in 1 year. That's right; a 98-percent drop in net farm income in 1 year. 
Then ask yourself what this statistic means. Ask yourself what would be the result for you, your neighbor, or your community, if you experienced a 98-percent drop in net income? That is what the farmers of North Dakota are facing because of collapsed grain prices and the worst crop disease in a century. The primary crop disease they face is called scab, or fusarium head blight, and it has devastated wheat and barley crops and some others. The combination of crop disease and a collapsed grain price has produced a farm crisis that is very, very serious and to which this Congress must respond. 
In the same New York Times article, it says some who wrote the current farm bill two years ago--which I did not support and voted against it--say that a free-market agricultural policy is the best. It quotes the authors of the farm bill as saying `Farmers can best be helped by people staying out of their hair and promoting export markets.' 
I want to describe part of the problem that farmers face with this kind of free-trade philosophy. There really isn't free trade 
for farmers. There isn't a free market for farmers. On both ends, they are pinched badly and hurt badly. On one end where they are trying to sell their product, they are trying to sell up through the neck of a bottle. The iron fist around the neck is the grain trade firms, the millers, the railroads where three, four, or five firms control virtually all of it and they squeeze back down resulting in increased costs for farmers and depressed farm prices. So there is no free market moving up. 
How about on the back side of it all? Is there a free market in trade? No; through our backdoor comes a flood of Canadian grain which is unfairly subsidized in my judgment, and undercuts our farmers and their prices. 
While that happens every day, I want to read another news story. It says: `Official's Beanie Babies Stir Furor.' I don't know what page this was on in the paper. It was a fairly large story about Beanie Babies--Beanie Babies, mind you. No offense to people who collect them and like them, but I have not spent a nanosecond of my life thinking about Beanie Babies. 
This story is about the U.S. Trade Ambassador who came home from China and apparently had purchased some Beanie Babies in China. She discovered, I guess to her embarrassment, that you can't bring 40 Beanie Babies into this country from China. The Beanie Babies are made in China for an American firm. They make the Beanie Babies in China, and then they ship the Beanie Babies back to the United States for sale in the United States. But you can't buy 40 Beanie Babies in China and haul them back here. Apparently, visitors are restricted to one Beanie Baby from China to the United States. I am told also you are restricted to one Beanie Baby from Canada to the United States. 
Those of us who live up near the Canadian border see a lot of things coming in from Canada. I went up to the Canadian border one day with Earl Jensen of Bowbells, ND. We had a little 2-ton orange 10-year-old truck. We tried to take a few bushels of durum wheat into Canada. All the way up to the border, we met 18-wheelers coming from Canada to the United States full of Canadian wheat. We saw truck after truck after truck after truck, all full of wheat, all the way to the border. 
Earl and I got to the border with this little 10-year-old orange truck. Do you think we could get one quarter-truckload of durum into Canada? They said: No, you can't do that. You can flood the market in the United States with Canadian grain, but you can't get one little orange truckload of durum wheat into Canada. 
When it comes to restricting imports to the United States, we say one Beanie Baby. Boy, we're tough on Beanie Babies. And if you exceed one Beanie Baby, you're apparently in huge trouble. But you can ship all the durum wheat, all the spring wheat and barley you want, and nobody is going to pay any mind at all. Nobody is going to care. In fact, if they unfairly subsidize it, as I am convinced they are doing, it still doesn't seem to matter. When we send auditors up to Canada to get into the books and records of the Canadian Wheat Board to check it out, the Canadian Wheat Board says, `Go fly a kite, we don't intend to show you any information; we intend to give you no records about our trade into the United States.' 
I say to those quoted in the New York Times and those in this Chamber who say, `Gee, what we should do is rely on this free-market stuff,' that there is no free market. There is no free market on either end, not the top end through which farmers market their products and not the back end through which they are facing unfair competition coming into this country with unfairly subsidized grain. 
We have farmers going broke in record numbers. We face a very serious farm crisis. A new farm bill was written 2 years ago. When that farm bill was written, it was written by folks who said, `Let's have the farmers operate in whatever the free-market system is.' Some of us said the problem is, there isn't a free market and if farmers run into price collapse, we are in a situation where they will not be able to get over that pricing valley. When they hit a price collapse, there needs to be a bridge over that price valley. If you don't help family farmers over that valley, then they go broke. 
Some people say, `That's okay, it doesn't matter, we don't care if we have family farmers.' I suppose some people don't. They don't care if we end up with big farms, agrifactories, farming from the west coast to the east coast. Does it matter? It seems to me it matters. 
For those who haven't been on a farm, if you look out the plane at night and you see the yard lights dotting the landscape, each of those lights is a family living on a family farm. 
These family farmers take more risks than almost anyone else in this country doing business. They risk whether they will get a crop. They put all their money in their crop, including the cost of seed and fertilizer, as they plant their fields in the spring. They have no idea whether there will be a dozen or more weather-related events that might destroy their crop. There is the threat of insects, the threat of hail, the threat of drought, the threat of too much moisture, among other things. Yet, if they are fortunate enough to get a crop, they might well end up seeing the market as it exists today with collapsed prices. 
And they are facing big interests that clap about that. They say, `Gee, that's great. We love collapsed prices.' The big grain millers, they think that is just fine. Only four firms control almost sixty percent of the flour milling in this country. I suppose the grocery manufacturers think that is just fine, because they seem to love low farm prices. 
The problem is family farmers can't survive. They are the seed bed of American enterprise and the home of family values that have always nurtured and flowed from family farms to small towns and into big cities. It is these family farmers, who are the ones that we lose. 
This is not just about dollars and cents. It is about something much more important to this country's future than just dollars and cents. And that is why during this week, next week and beyond, we feel the need and the urgency to propose some changes here on the floor of the Senate. We must deal with farm policy in a way that addresses the issue of trade, in a way that addresses the issue of the misplaced priorities within a system that worries about Beanie Babies on the same day that nobody seems to care much about family farmers. 
We think there are some things that can be done to extend a helping hand to family farmers, and to say, that they matter in this country's future. When we offer legislation on the floor of the Senate, I expect there will be those who say, as they did 2 weeks ago, that the current farm bill is working just fine. I dearly wish we could give them a deed this afternoon and say, `Here. You think it's working fine? Here is your farm. We'll give you 1,000 acres. Buy some fuel and fertilizers and seed, and farm until you go broke. When you go broke--and you will--you come back and tell us how well your farm policy works.' I just wish we could do that. But, of course, there is not time because this crisis requires action on a much more immediate basis. 
Mr. President, we expect to have a substantial debate about that in the coming days. I hope that Republicans and Democrats will understand the merit, the value, and the worth of family farming in this country's future. I hope that we will decide to embark upon a farm policy that says to family farmers that when prices collapse and when you are ravaged by the worst crop disease of the century, we want to help you over those price valleys. We want you to be a part of this country's future. 
We need a farm policy that tells family farmers that they matter from the standpoint of social and economic policy. Here we are in a country that produces the most wholesome quality food at the lowest percent of disposable income of anywhere in the world. Family farmers do matter in this country's future. I hope that will be the result of the debate we have here in the next month or two in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our health care system is in a state of crisis--a crisis of confidence. Many Americans no longer believe that their insurance companies can provide them with the access to care or quality of service they need. 
Today I continue our series of stories describing how some managed care plans seem to have put cost saving before life-saving. The experience of Vaughn Dashiell is just one more example of the pressing need for Congress to act now to protect the rights of patients. 
Vaughn Dashiell lived with his wife, Patricia, and their three children in Alexandria, Virginia. Vaughn owned and operated his own printing company. 
On November 20, 1996, Vaughn stayed home sick from work suffering from a sore throat, dry mouth, and tunnel vision that limited his sight to 18 inches. He tried to get an appointment to see a doctor within his HMO network, but was told that none were available at his designated facility. Vaughn was able to speak only to the HMO-employed nurse on duty over the phone. She could have told Vaughn to go to an emergency room for treatment, but instead, told him to make a regular appointment although none were available. 
As Vaughn's symptoms worsened, he called his HMO again requesting permission to see a doctor somewhere, or to go to a nearby emergency room. Vaughn was told only to wait and that he would receive a call back from a doctor on duty. When the doctor on duty was consulted, he agreed that Vaughn should go to an emergency room, but neither made a call himself, nor followed up to see that Vaughn was contacted. That night, Vaughn was not contacted, not by the nurse, the doctor, or any other HMO staff regarding his condition and requests for care. 
The next morning, Patricia found Vaughn incoherent, with his `eyes rolling'. She hurriedly called the HMO, hoping for an answer to Vaughn's problem. They advised her to call 911. 
Vaughn arrived at the hospital at 9:18 am in a diabetic coma. His blood sugar level was more than twenty times greater than the normal level. Just over two hours after being rushed to the emergency room, Vaughn was dead from hyperglycemia. He was only 39 years old. 
This should not happen in America. Health insurers should not be allowed to put profit before patients. Vaughn Dashiell's condition would have been treatable and curable if the health plan had enabled him to get the care he needed. But for an HMO driven by cutting costs, the needs of the patient did not come first. Had this HMO not placed their patients in the hands of a system weak in oversight and follow-up and instead allowed Mr. Dashiell the opportunity to see a doctor when he first felt threatened, he might still be alive today. 
Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient protections this year. We have a bill, S. 1890, that would prevent tragedies like this from occurring. Under our plan, Vaughn would have had guaranteed access to needed care, especially in the case of an emergency. Under our bill, members of HMOs would be able to go to an emergency room without seeking their plan's approval if they felt their life was in danger. 
This is only common sense. It should not be controversial. I will appeal once again to the Republican leaders of this body: Please bring our Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor for action. The President has promised to sign it into law. We are wasting valuable time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the Washington Post this week there was an article entitled `Sudan's Famine Overwhelms Aid Effort.' I want to read a couple of sentences from this article, because I was struck by the concurrence of what I read about what is happening in Sudan and what I know is happening in North Dakota and in much of the farm belt.  
As the gate is about to close for the night on the feeding center here, near-lifeless bodies start turning up everywhere. Three have collapsed just outside the reed walls of the compound, human skeletons so thin they look two-dimensional against the ground. 
Three, then four, then five, then, somehow, eight others have been carried inside and laid among the swarm of gaunt people still strong enough to beckon medical workers who have spent the day ministering to the hundreds gathered outside this place that has food. 
The workers move from body to body, feeling for a pulse, crumbling high-calorie biscuits into palms, pouring sugar water from gourd to mouth. The impossibly sunken cheeks of a man too weak to hold his head up by himself fall deeper into his face as he slurps. . . . 
Four months after aid agencies issued warnings of impending famine in southern Sudan--and two months after they marshaled public opinion in the name of heading it off--starvation has arrived regardless. Across a vast region unsettled by civil war and erratic weather, the United Nations now says, 1.2 million people are at risk of death from hunger. 
They are living on the leaves of trees. I heard a fellow who visited Sudan describe old women climbing trees to forage leaves to eat. When I think that halfway around the world people are dying of starvation, and people are climbing trees to eat leaves on trees, I can t help but think that on the other side of the world that our family farmers who produce food in the most abundant quantity anywhere on the Earth are being told that their production has no merit, and no value. 
The price of farm commodities collapses, and family farmers are told, `Well, that's the breaks. That is the way things are. You produce it, and it should be worth $4.50 or $5 to cover the cost of production, and then you go put it on a truck and drive it to an elevator, and it is worth $3. Somehow the market doesn't value it. Your crop doesn't have worth, and doesn't have merit.' 
I think to myself that there is something kind of Byzantine about a world in which that happens. Just detach yourself from the globe for a moment and look at a globe sitting out here with people on this side starving and people on this side who are operating family farms going broke because they are told their food doesn't have value. Gosh. 
This is not true with military equipment. Military equipment always has value. They ship it all around the world every day in every way, and there is plenty of money to finance it. The poorest countries in the world can buy military equipment. The poorest countries in the world can afford apparently the best jet planes, tanks, guns, and shells. But when it comes to food, the people who need it are starving, and the people who produce it--our family farmers--are told it doesn't have worth and they can go broke. 
Let me describe what is happening in our part of the world. I might say that I served for almost 10 years on the Hunger Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. I am well familiar with the famine that occurred in Ethiopia. I am well familiar with past famines in Sudan and other parts of the world where millions have died of starvation. This is happening on a planet where, in some parts of the earth we produce food in great abundant quantity and those who produce it are told it has too little value. 
We have family farmers today who have invested everything, their lives, 10, 20, 30 years into running a family farm far out in the country, with the yard light on at night, raising their family, sending their kids to school, getting up early to do the chores, working all day, doing chores at night, and discover when they check their books and records that they are losing money and losing their farms. 
Here is what happened to the price of wheat in the last couple of years. Wheat prices have fallen 53 percent since the current farm law was passed. Prices have collapsed like a down escalator, and yet some people say, `Gee, everything is working just fine.' In fact, I heard some people say the farm program is working just fine. It is not working just fine. 
The price of wheat is collapsing. On top of this, in our State we have the worst crop disease in a century. This is a crop disease that is pervasive. It is called fusarium head blight, commonly called scab. Farmers are hit by collapsed prices and crop diseases that are devastating. So we have, it seems to me, a twin failure here on this globe of ours. We have people who don't have anything to eat and are starving and dying in the streets in Sudan. Then we have families who are failing in the Farm Belt who have risked everything they have to run a family farm and are told, when they truck that wheat and barley that makes the foodstuffs that can be life-saving to others, that somehow this has no value. At least, they are told its value is so diminished that you can't make a decent living growing this grain. 
Let me show you what has happened to these family farmers in my State. In 1 year, there has been a 98-percent reduction in net income for family farmers. That's right, 98 percent. Go to any neighborhood, any street, anyplace in this country and ask anybody how will you handle it, how will you fare, what will your life be like, if somebody takes away 98 percent of your income? This describes a serious economic emergency. 
In my State, these red counties which make up a third of our counties, have been declared disaster counties every single year for 5 years--every year. Not just occasionally, every year. Incidentally, North Dakota is 10 times the size of Massachusetts in land mass. Those family farmers are trying to run a farm out here and trying to raise a crop they can plant and harvest. They have discovered that you cannot do it when you have these excessive wet cycles and pervasive crop disease so they don't get much of a crop. Then if they do get a crop, they send it to the market and it is underpriced because the price has collapsed. 
The reason I make this point is we have family farmers in North Dakota--and in other parts of the Farm Belt, but especially in North Dakota--who are suffering terribly. We need to do something about that. 
Do we need to respond to the Sudan with respect to food aid, substantially increased quantities of Food for Peace, title II and title III and others? Yes, we do. It is this country's obligation to do that. We ought to do it. Doing so, however, also obligates us, it seems to me, to do something to help those family farmers in our Farm Belt who are losing their hopes and their dreams. 
`This is the worst plant disease epidemic that the United States has faced with any major crop in this country.' Brian Steffenson of North Dakota State University said that last week. That is just one part of the price collapse and crop disease that has put us in a devastating situation. 
Steffenson also said, `North Dakota's barley industry is hanging on by a thread, even though it is typically the leader in feed and malting barley production in the nation.' 
Farmers not only face disease and low prices, but also have a problem of selling into highly concentrated markets. Family farmers are trying to figure out how they market their commodity effectively. If they are raising beef, four packers control 87 percent. If they raise pork, its four packers that control 60 percent. Four firms control 55 percent of broilers. If they have sheep, four packers control 73 percent of sheep slaughter. 
Grain facilities at our ports are controlled by four firms which have 59 percent. In flour milling, four firms control 62 percent. In wet corn milling, four firms control 74 percent. You get the picture. One farmer out there against that kind of market power that puts downward pressure on all these prices. 
My point is this: We have a responsibility in this Congress to care about economic injury to important industries in this country, and none is more important, in my judgment, than family farming. Family farming is, and always has been, since Thomas Jefferson so described it as the most important enterprise in this country. Family farming is still important in this country, and we must make a commitment to deal with the economic injury to people who are out there, threatened with the loss of their livelihoods and the loss of their homes and dreams on their family farms. 
In the coming week we intend to meet with the President. In the coming weeks we intend to come to the Congress and ask Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, all of them, to join us to say: We are not only profamily, we are profamily farming, and during times of emergencies we want to reach out and help. A country that can provide foreign aid can also provide some farm aid in times of trouble, and we have not had a time of trouble anywhere close to this for many, many decades. 
Just this morning one of the industry leaders in North Dakota indicated that he thinks we are headed towards a period that is about as bad as the 1930s on the family farm. We have an obligation to respond. I will ask the cooperation of the majority leader, the minority leader, and all people of good will here in this Congress who care, as I do, about the enterprise of family farming and the fortunes of those families in rural America. I hope we can pass a piece of legislation in the next several weeks to respond to this emergency. 
I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his indulgence.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to be a cosponsor of this particular proposal when it was offered by Senator Murray in the Senate Appropriations Committee. I know that Senator Murray offered it on behalf of herself and Senator Roberts from Kansas, and I was pleased then to cosponsor it. It is the right thing to do. I must say, however, it is inching along in the right direction. This is not taking giant steps today. It is inching along in the right direction. 
The question of sanctions, especially sanctions in international trade that say to the American farmer, you bear the entire cost of sanctions that we impose for foreign policy reasons; we are upset with Cuba so let's cut Cuba off so they can't get any grain. We are upset with Iran, Iraq, Libya, let's cut them off so they can't buy grain--10 percent of the world's wheat market is off limits to American farmers because, for foreign policy purposes, this country has decided that is what ought to be done. I fundamentally disagree with that. 
Hubert Humphrey used to say send them anything they can't shoot back. Translated, he meant we ought not cut off food shipments around the world. I don't think we ought to cut off food shipments. All that does is hurt the poor people and hungry people around the world. But the fact is we do have sanctions in place, and I think in addition to a piece of legislation today that says with respect to the sanctions now dealing with Pakistan and India, that it will not include GSM credits, which therefore would then facilitate the flow of grain from the Northwest in this case. That is a step in the right direction, albeit a small one. 
We don't ship grain to Pakistan. They are going to make these purchases largely from the Northwest. But farmers are farmers, and the wheat market is the wheat market. 
The fact is the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, described very well the crisis that exists in farm country today. Wheat farmers in this country have seen wheat prices on the international marketplace, on the national markets collapse, just drop to the cellar. 
In my State, we not only have just rock-bottom wheat prices, we have the worst crop disease in a full century. It is called fusarium head blight. We call it scab. It has devastated the crops. So a farmer takes all the risks. They plant the seed, hope it will grow, hope insects don't come, hope it doesn't get destroyed by hail, hope it doesn't rain too much, hope it rains enough. Finally, all of those things are OK. They hope they raise a crop, and when they raise a crop they hope it isn't devastated by disease. They take the grain to the elevator in their 2-ton truck and discover they get $2 a bushel less than it cost them to raise it. And they go out of business hand over fist. We have so many auction sales right now they are calling auctioneers out of retirement to handle them. 
We have a huge problem. We have to deal with the underlying farm bill. I know some people think it is working just fine. Gee, this is just great. It is not just great. It is not working just fine. We are pulling the rug out from family farmers in price support and calling it freedom to farm. It is like taking the minimum wage to a dollar an hour and calling it freedom to work. It doesn't make any sense. 
We need to deal with the underlying problem. We need to deal with the larger trade problems. We can't get wheat to China. Japan isn't buying enough beef. We have had a flood of unfairly subsidized imports come in in durum and spring wheat and barley from Canada. We have a whole range of problems. 
This bill deals with one small issue that is urgent and must be dealt with now. It deals with, in GSM, credit issues that will allow us to ship wheat to Pakistan and India. I support that. But we have a lot more to do. We ought to decide as a Congress right now that sanctions will not include food shipments, period. Let's get that 10 percent of the world wheat market back for American farmers. 
Second, we ought to decide if there are those who insist that sanctions include food shipments from American farmers to overseas markets, then farmers ought to be reimbursed for the cost and the loss. Why should farmers be told, here is our new foreign policy and you pay the price. You bear the cost. Why should farmers be sent that bill and told to pay up. If it is our belief that the best foreign policy is to shut off food shipments through sanctions to some part of the world, why not as a part of our foreign policy through the State Department or part of our defense policy through the Defense Department, why not reimburse family farmers who are told now they bear the entire cost of those sanctions. 
So I stand today to say again I appreciate this legislation. Senator Murray and Senator Roberts initiated it, at least on the Senate side, and I was pleased the day that Senator Murray introduced it on behalf of her and Senator Roberts. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. It is the right thing to do right now. But there is much, much, much more to do if we are going to address in a real and significant way the farm crisis. 
This is as tough as I have ever seen it in rural America. I am not going to go further talking about the farm problem and the trade problem because they are abiding and tough and difficult, and we must get about the business of dealing with it. And I expect that in the coming couple of weeks we are going to have a big discussion. I know some people don't have farmers in their areas; they don't have to deal with farm problems every day. I think it is an opportunity to deal with farm problems. Family farmers are the roots of our society. Family values originate on the family farm and they nurture small towns and big cities in this country and always have. 
I am pleased to represent a State of family farmers, and I think it is interesting to see people who wouldn't know a razorback hog from a pickup truck tell us here in Washington, DC, all about the theory of family farming. The fact is family farmers don't live on theory. They risk everything they have to try to raise a crop and hope when they have raised a crop to be able to sell it to make a decent living. Today the sad answer is this economy doesn't produce that because we have a whole series of problems, one of which, a small one, is addressed by this bill, and that is the potential cutoff of a foreign market for western wheat. This bill addresses it, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor. But I hope in the coming weeks we will do much, much, much more to address the crisis faced by family farmers. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting Senator Roth from Delaware. He is a serious, thoughtful legislator who does some awfully good work. There are times when I disagree very strongly with him; there are other times when I agree with his proposals. I think he does some excellent work in the Senate. I appreciate it. 
The conference report that is before the Senate contains some important legislative accomplishments. Some of the provisions in this conference report are useful, necessary, long overdue, and accomplishments that I very much support. I voted for this bill when we sent it to conference, and now it comes back from conference to the Senate as a conference report for our consideration. 
While this legislation has much to commend it and addresses some very important issues, it also, as is the case with a number of conference reports, attracted some lint, some dust, and some other material as it was massaged and manipulated in conference. 
One little provision that is, in fact, not so little, is Section 5001 of the bill. Page 332 of the statement of the managers explains this provision, and I want to read it for the Record. On page 332 of the report, it says: 
Title V. Additional Provisions 
A. Elimination of 18-Month Holding Period for Capital Gains. 
And then it says: 
House Bill 
No provision. 
Senate Amendment 
No provision. 
And it goes on to describe the `conference agreement.' 
That means, with respect to this issue, there was nothing in the House, nothing in the Senate, no debate, no discussion, no amendment, no vote. And all of a sudden, from the legislative darkness, a proposal emerged from the conference. It is like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, I guess. It is not surprising to those of us who watch conference committees. Senator Byrd was telling me today that he calls the conference committees `the Third House.' There is the House, the Senate, and then there is a separate body called `Conference Committees.' 
This is an example of what can happen in conference committees, of what can happen in that third body. 
Let me describe what this proposal is. This proposal expands favorable tax treatment for capital gains--that is, the lower tax rate for capital gains. It does that by reducing the holding period for eligibility for the lower capital gains tax rate from 18 months to 12 months. To get the lower tax rate, you only need to hold onto an investment for 12 months under this provision, rather than 18 months, as the law stands now. This proposal costs about $2 billion--$2 billion. 
Who will it benefit? Here is a chart that shows who it will benefit. Citizens for Tax Justice put these figures together. In shortening the holding period for capital gains from 18 months to 12 months, 90 percent of the benefit will go to taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 a year; over three-fourths of the benefit will go to taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 a year. 
I suppose those who talk about capital gains a lot will say, gee, this benefits everybody. Yes, it is kind of the cake and crumbs theory, with the cake at this end of the chart and a few crumbs down here. But the chart is clear enough. The benefit, by far, will inure to those whose incomes are very large. And the reduction, therefore, of the holding period from 18 months to 12 months is, in effect, a reduction in revenue of $2 billion, the benefit of which will go to the folks largely making $100,000 a year or more. 
As I indicated, that proposal was offered to the conference 
committee at the last minute, had never been considered by the House, had never been considered by the Senate, and was never debated or voted upon by either body. 
One would probably ask the question: Well, if there is $2 billion that is available to be used for one thing or another, how might it be used? Perhaps reducing the Federal debt. That might be one approach. The Presiding Officer shakes his head vigorously at that. I assume that a number of people would think maybe using that to reduce the Federal debt would be useful. 
Others still might say, well, this was done on about the same day, I believe, or within a day or two of the decision by the other body in this Congress--the House of Representatives --that they can't afford any longer to provide low-income energy assistance for home heating for poor people who live in cold climates. In the view of some members of the House majority, there is not enough money for that, so we will get rid of that. 
Or there is not enough money really to fully fund summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. So, what we will do is, we will just cut back on that. 
However, there are $2 billion available here, there is plenty of money for this--without debate, and without a separate vote in either the House or the Senate. But there is not enough money for some of those other priorities--priorities, for example, which I have come to the floor to talk about, of the needed investment in Indian schools. 
Indian schools--those are schools that are our responsibility, under the federal trust responsibility. I have talked about the condition of those schools and the repairs and investment that those schools need. I have talked about going into schools where the stench of sewer gas comes up into the classroom and requires children to be escorted out of the classrooms. I talked about schools I visited with 160 people sharing 1 water fountain and 2 bathrooms. It appears we don't have enough money to be helpful there. But someone found $2 billion all on its lonesome in the legislative darkness to be stuck into a piece of legislation, without debate in the House or the Senate, in a manner that will benefit a very few--benefit, in fact, those who probably need it least. 
So, what do we do about that? The conference report comes to the Senate and we are told: There is nothing you can do about that; that is the way it is. It is true you didn't have a chance to debate or discuss or vote on it. That is life. That is the way the system works. 
The problem is, there is a rule in the Senate called rule XXVIII, paragraph 2. I want to read the rule. This part of the Standing Rules of the Senate states that `conferees shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by either House.' 
Let me read that again: `Conferees'--talking about the conference committee and the conferees on the committee--`shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by either House.' That means if something isn't either in the House bill or the Senate bill, it is not an item that can be considered by the conference. That is the standing rule of the Senate, rule XXVIII, paragraph 2. 
So how does this provision get here? How do we, in the legislative crevices of conference committees, as they finish their work and as the world isn't watching quite so closely, discover that $2 billion can be spent just like that when a Senate rule says `conferees shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by either House"? 
Mr. President, I think the Senate will be advantaged, and I believe the other body will be advantaged, by a process that does not bring to us a piece of legislation dealing with the restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service that contains revenue provisions of this type. 
I don't have a problem with someone coming to the floor of the Senate and saying let's debate changing the capital gains provisions of the current Tax Code, let's debate changing the holding period, let's debate changing the rate; that is not a problem. I think it is perfectly appropriate that we have that debate. But I think it is inappropriate that the debate be prevented, as is now the case, when they stick in, during a conference, a provision that was neither in the House bill nor in the Senate bill--literally in the last few minutes of the conference--and there it sits as a $2 billion revenue item that a good number of other Members of the Senate might have used much differently--as I indicated, perhaps to reduce the Federal debt, or perhaps to restore money for low-income energy assistance for the poor, or for a number of other things. 
But this practice now exists that provides a way to avoid all the unpleasantness of debating these things on their own. So we now are in a situation where the conference report, which is a piece of legislation that has a great deal of merit and much to be commended, contains a provision to reduce the holding period for capital gains from 18 months to 12 months, which will provide $2 billion of tax reductions, 90 percent of which will accrue to those with over $100,000 in income, with no debate and no vote. In my judgment, that is not the best of what the Senate ought to be offering the American people.

Mr. DORGAN. I didn't know of any intention of delaying this. I don't think it would be a problem giving a couple of minutes to the Senator from Minnesota. I know he spoke earlier on the floor on the subject. As far as I am concerned, we are almost ready for a vote, except that the tabling motion came almost immediately. My appeal of the ruling of the Chair is a debatable motion, and the Senator from Delaware moved almost immediately to table, which prevented this from being a significant debate. That is the Senator s right, and I made my comments. But I wanted to respond briefly to the comments the Senator from Delaware made. I mean it seems to me that it wouldn't be a problem if I am allowed to speak for 3 minutes and the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Minnesota for a couple of minutes, and we can have a vote. It seems to me to be quicker to get it done that way.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are never going to be accused of legislative speeding around here. It is fascinating to me that this bill has been kicking around for what, 10 months or so? And all of a sudden in the last couple of minutes we are dealing with $1 billion a minute, if I get 2 minutes. If I get $1 billion a minute, and he gets $1 billion a minute, it is a $2 billion tax break provided in the closing minutes of a conference report. Gosh. Month after month after month has gone by. Then all of sudden we have to get to the intersection in a nanosecond. 
That is fine. Some days I might have objected, but I am in such an awfully good mood today that I am persuaded to speak for 2 or 3 minutes and then sit down. 
First point: It is not going to kill the bill if we dump a $2 billion provision stuck in the middle of this piece of legislation by folks that didn't want a debate on it, didn't want votes in the House or the Senate on it. Getting rid of that provision won't kill the bill. Do not be fooled by that. Nobody is talking about killing this bill. We are just talking about taking a sow's ear out of this bill. You know the old saying in my area, which is farm country, `You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.' There is nothing in this provision that you can make a silk purse out of, I guarantee you. 
This was not done in the regular way. The chairman indicated the 18-month holding period came not from the House or Senate. It came as part of a deal made by the White House and legislative 
leaders. That is true. That was a deal. It was a deal with respect to changing tax policy, and there was a lot of negotiation going on back and forth. 
That was a tax bill. That was a big tax bill. This is an IRS restructuring bill. All of a sudden, you have substantive changes in tax policy with no debate. That is the point I am making. 
Finally, it makes sense, in my judgment, to move in the direction of incentives for long-term holdings, not short-term holdings. That is precisely what the 18-month-rule did. It says there is a benefit to holding investments for the long term. Those who think in the longer term invest in the longer term. That is precisely what builds this country. 
But today we hear people say let's go back to the shorter term, let's think short-term, and let's provide big tax breaks to upper-income people who think that way. Those that have a couple hundred thousand dollars a year or more, if they will just think in the shorter term they get a big tax break. 
You talk about marching in the wrong direction. Get some drums and bugles here and just quicken the cadence. This doesn't make any sense at all. 
The reason I appeal the ruling of the Chair is we never had a chance to debate this. 
And I might add that the point of order that I raised would have been sustained prior to October 3, 1996, because for decades, going back to the 1930s, the rule that I cited had force. `Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by another House.' That rule of the Senate would have persuaded the Presiding Officer to rule in my favor. 
But on October 3, 1996, the Senate did something, in my judgment, that was very ill-advised. It overturned a ruling by the Chair, and we forever changed this rule until the Senate votes to change it back. This would be a good opportunity to do that, because this is precisely the kind of mischief--$2 billion worth of mischief--that occurs in a conference committee with an item that was never in the House bill, never in the Senate bill, never debated, and never voted on. But here we find it folded neatly between the covers of this bill, which was supposed to have dealt with IRS restructuring. 
You got $2 billion you want to use for something. I say to Members of the Senate, you got $2 billion you want to use for something. What is your priority? What is your priority? To search out those with $200,000 or more in income and say, `You know what you need. You need a tax cut, and that is the priority of the U.S. Senate. It is the priority of the U.S. House.' Boy. I don't think that would match the priority most people would want to expose in the middle of the day here in the Senate in a debate. 
So that is the reason I have asked for this vote. 
Once again, I appreciate the Senator from Delaware and the work he has done. Much of what is in this piece of legislation I commend. It has great merit, but this provision should never have been stuck in that bill. I think everybody in the Senate knows it. 
If we will vote to overturn the ruling of the Chair, we will solve this problem without killing the bill.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our health care system is in a state of crisis--a crisis of confidence. Many Americans no longer believe that their insurance companies can provide them with the access to care or quality of service they need. 
Today I continue our series of stories describing how some managed care plans seem to have put cost saving before life-saving. The experience of Jacqueline Lee is just one more example of the pressing need for Congress to act now to protect the rights of patients. 
Jacqueline Lee lives in Bethesda, Maryland. A lover of the outdoors, she took a trip to hike in the Shenandoah Mountains in the summer of 1996. While walking on one of the trails, she lost her footing, and plummeted off of a 40-foot cliff to the ground below. 
Luckily for Jacqueline, she was quickly airlifted from the mountain to a hospital in Virginia. Amazingly, she survived the fall, sustaining fractures in her arms, pelvis, and her skull. 
Incredibly, her HMO refused to pay the more than $10,000 in hospital bills. They said Ms. Lee had failed to gain `pre-authorization' for her emergency room visit. To this insurer, the fact that she was unconscious was no exception. For over a year, she challenged her HMO and faced personal bankruptcy. Ultimately, the Maryland Insurance Administration ordered the insurer to pay the hospital and fined them as well for their initial refusal to cover Ms. Lee's medical expenses. 
Yet her struggle wasn't over. Within a year, after follow-up surgery for her injuries, Ms. Lee found herself back in the emergency room, fearing that she was suffering complications from surgery. Not wanting to go through another ordeal, this time she called her HMO beforehand. They told her they would pay only for her screening fees because the visit was not considered `a medical emergency.' 
Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient protections this year. We have a bill, S. 1890, that would prevent situations like this from occurring. Under our bill, Jacqueline Lee would have access to emergency care without preauthorization, and when she feels her life is in danger--not when the insurance company tells her it's okay. Under our bill, Jacqueline would have been covered for her injuries--she would not have had the rug pulled out from under her by the HMO. 
We have only a few weeks of legislative business left to act. Whatever we do will not alleviate the stress that Jacqueline Lee has endured, but we can ensure that others do not have to spend time fighting insurers that would be better spent fighting for their health. We must guarantee patients the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their health plan will be there to help them recuperate, not deny payment because it improves their bottom line.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have come to the floor to talk a bit about the crisis in agriculture, especially the crisis facing family farmers in my State of North Dakota. But before I do that, I would like to talk just for a moment about a piece of legislation that I understand may be brought to the floor of the Senate tomorrow--probably tomorrow evening. It is the so-called IRS reform bill. 
In my judgement, there is much in the IRS reform bill that has merit. The hearings that were held in the Senate, which reviewed cases of harassment of taxpayers, some unacceptable behavior by Internal Revenue Service agents, and some other items clearly made the case for the need for some changes with respect to the Internal Revenue Service. Much of this piece of legislation, as I indicated, has merit. But I want to object to something that was done in legislative darkness in putting this conference report together. It is a provision that was not in either the House or Senate bills. It is a provision that had never been debated. It had not been put in either bill in the House or Senate. Yet at the last moment, in legislative darkness, it was stuck in this conference report in the conference committee. I don't understand by what rules they operate when they say we are going to stick something in the conference report that is not in either the House or Senate bill. 
Here is what they did. They said in the conference report that they will reduce the holding period of assets for capital gains from 18 months to 12 months. What does that mean? Well, it means that those with incomes in this country of over $100,000 a year are going to get 90 percent of the benefit of a $2 billion tax break. That is $2 billion in tax breaks. Ninety percent of it will go to people who make over $100,000 in income. In fact, 76 percent goes to people making over $200,000 a year or more. This was done without debate. This was one of those little nuggets that was stuck in the bill. It was not debated by the House or the Senate. 
The same day they said we have $2 billion to give away to the upper-income people, they said we don't have enough money to provide for low-income heating assistance during the winter for low-income folks in the northern climates. This majority in Congress doesn't have enough money for that. They don't have enough money for low-income people who are trying to heat their homes. They say we are out of money, so we will cut that program off. They don't have enough money for summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. Gee, there is not enough money for that. They say there is not enough money for school construction in Indian schools, where the schools are falling apart and kids are walking through school doors into classrooms of which we all ought to be ashamed. No, there is not enough money for that. 
But in the dark of the legislative night, there is enough money to stick $2 billion into the purses of the richest Americans. This is done with no debate in this Congress. To the people who behave and operate like that and carry those knapsacks full of money to the upper-income folks, I just say that is a terrible way to legislate. On one hand you say you can't afford to help people who really need help, and that you have to abolish low-income energy assistance. Yet, on the other side there is plenty of money to reduce the capital gains holding period, without even a discussion in Congress about who it is going to benefit. It seems to me this is not a very happy day, when you talk about what should be our legislative priorities around this Capitol Building. I will talk more about that when the bill comes to the floor of the Senate tomorrow evening.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, for the Record, I want to read a letter from Joni Flaten from Langdon, ND. I visited with her this afternoon. She sent me a letter some while ago. She is a farm wife. We have a huge farm crisis not only in my State of 
North Dakota, but also in the entire wheat belt. Grain prices have collapsed. We have been hit with the toughest, worst outbreak of crop disease in a century in North Dakota. So you take crop disease that devastates the crop and then you add collapsed prices, and you have a calamity for a lot of family farmers. 
Joni Flaten writes: 
My husband has been farming now for 18 years. He is a third generation farmer, and with my oldest son graduating last Sunday, we were looking forward to some day having the fourth generation. However, that will no longer be possible for we have been unable to get an operating loan this season due to low grain prices . . . 
I have 3 children and have stayed home for 18 years to raise them and help my husband on the farm. We are now going to be forced into giving up the family farm, and I'm not sure if there is a lot of need for a 38-year-old combine operator/tractor driver/trucker/run for parts person and be a mother in the work force in North Dakota. We have been a true family operation since the boys were able to see over the steering wheels . . . We have not been able to hire an extra man to help us, but we have pulled together as a family at planting and harvest times to get the job done. Now Farm Credit tells us we are unable to get a loan to operate our farm. FAHS tells us we can't have a loan and the sad truth is such a blow to all of my family. Not that you or anyone can do much about this but maybe somehow you can stop it from happening to some other family in the future. It is a good life here in ND but I think you will be 5 people less come this winter!!! 
This is from a woman named Joni Flaten, a farm wife, has been a farm wife for 18 years, and they are losing their livelihood, losing their family farm. 
Let me show you a picture of Bev and Jim McAllister from Oriska, ND. Jim McAllister came to a meeting that I had in Mandan, ND, a few months ago. You can see Jim is a pretty big guy. He stood up at that meeting and began talking about his family farm. He said his granddad farmed it, his dad farmed it, and he has farmed it for 23 years. Then his chin began to quiver and he got tears in his eyes. Then he said he is going to have to quit farming. Jim and Bev McAllister love farming. They are family farmers. They have raised their family on the farm. It is a way of life they say they wouldn't have traded for anything, and yet they are having to leave the farm. There family farm will be history. No more family farming for the McAllister family. 
Why is this happening? 
This is a picture of an auction sale in North Dakota. You can see what an auction sale looks like. There are a lot of folks standing around with an auctioneer auctioning off farm machinery. Here are pages from a North Dakota newspaper. It shows about 150 auction sales. It is all advertised in the same week's paper. These auction sales go out for a good number of weeks. This listing includes some 150 auction sales. 
They have had so many auction sales on North Dakota farms that they have had to call retired auctioneers back from retirement to handle the auction sales. Every one of these auction sales represents a family farmer who has tried to invest everything they have, and have worked hard, to run a family farm. And then they discover they can't make it. 
Why can't they make it? Well, farmers are beset by a whole range of problems these days. First, they wrote a new farm program in Congress two years ago. I didn't vote for it. I thought it was a terrible farm program. But those who voted for it--and the President reluctantly signed it--essentially said we are going to pull the safety net out from under family farmers. It doesn't matter what the circumstances are. If grain prices collapse, somehow we are going to still pull the safety net out from under family farmers and instead set up a decreasing scale of price supports, eventually hoping that family farmers will deal in whatever is the open market. They called this program Freedom to Farm. 
It would be like saying to the people in the workforce we are going to reduce the minimum wage to $1 an hour and we are going to call it `Freedom to Work.' It is the same logic, exactly the same logic. If they cut the minimum wage to $1 an hour and call it `Freedom to Work,' it would make as much sense as what they have done to family farmers. 
Here is what family farmers face in my State. Wheat costs somewhere around $4.50 to $5 a bushel to raise. When farmers plant it in the spring, in order to plant it they have to have equipment. They have to buy fuel for the tractor. They have to buy seed to plant in the ground. They have to buy fertilizer to fertilize it. They till and seed the ground, and hope and pray and cross their fingers and hope they get enough moisture. If they get enough moisture for that, and if they grow wheat, barley, or corn, they hope it doesn't hail and destroy the crop. Then they hope the insects don't come and eat the crop. And, they hope they don't experience crop disease that will in other ways ravage and decimate the crop. If all of that is avoided, then maybe in the fall they will have a crop that has come out of the ground and is high enough to harvest. Then they will buy fuel for the combine and they will go harvest the crop. When all of that is done, if they have been very lucky, they will have raised a crop that cost them $4.50 or $5 a bushel to raise, and they truck it to the county elevator, and they may get $3.10 a bushel for it. That means they go broke. 
On top of the collapsed prices, in North Dakota and a couple of other States, we have been ravaged by the worst possible crop disease. It is called scab. The technical name is fusarium head 
blight. I am told that this is the worst crop disease in this century. So these family farmers are trying to fight a crop disease that decimates their crop and then a price that is in the tank. The question is: Does anybody care? Does anybody care at all? 
We had a group of Senators a week and a half ago who held a press conference that said, `Gee, this farm bill is working just fine. We think things are on the right track.' What planet could they have possibly come from? Where on Earth did they get off the mother ship? How could they say, `This farm bill is working just fine?" 
I would encourage anyone who thinks that to go buy a quarter section of land and plant yourself a crop. After you plant it, raise the crop, and then sell it, then you will have the big loss that you are going to get under this farm program. After you have done that, then come and gloat about how the farm program is working. I dare you. See, if you have the courage of your convictions. Any one of those who think this farm program is working just fine, should go buy a farm and have the opportunity to lose some money for awhile. Then you will have your banker tell you it is not working out. Only then should you come back and give us your theory and tell us how great the farm program is working. Just do it. But don't come in here and preach these platitudes about a program working when it is a disaster. Freedom to Farm has been a disaster for family farmers. 
Let me tell you what else is facing family farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of family farmers out there. There are almost two million of them out there. You see them with a yard light on at night dotting the countryside. They are raising a family and planting crops. Let s say they are raising livestock and they go to market. Let's assume they are taking some cows to market. What they find at the marketplace is the neck of that bottle up through which they are trying to market is squeezed by four beef packing plants. Four beef packing companies in this country control 87 percent of the market. That is right. Four firms with 87 percent of the market. Ten years ago, it was 67 percent. Now those four control 87 percent of the market. They set the market. They tell somebody out there who is herding cows and raising cattle exactly what they are going to pay them. If they don't like it, tough luck. 
If you are not raising cows, maybe you are raising hogs. The top four pork packers in this country control 60 percent of that market. If you go into a packing house that slaughters hogs, 60 percent of the market is controlled by only four companies. With sheep, it is 73 percent of the market that is controlled by the top four companies. 
How about raising grain? The top four firms in flour milling in this country have 62 percent of the market. The top four grain elevator firms control nearly 60 percent of the Nation's elevator facilities at our ports. The top four corn milling firms control 74 percent of the market. In soybean crushing, the top four firms have 76 percent of the market. When farmers try to market through the neck of this bottle, it is squeezed with an iron grip by increasing monopoly pricing power by corporations that press down on these farm prices. 
If that is not enough for our farmers to face, then they have to haul their grain to the markets on railroads that are increasingly monopolistic. In 1980, there were 40 class-one railroads in this country. Now there are only four. 
In our State, when they come through with the railroad cars, they charge $2,300 to ship a carload of wheat from Bismarck, ND, to Minneapolis. The railroad charges $1,000 to ship a carload of wheat from Minneapolis to Chicago, which is the same distance. What is the difference? The difference is that on one segment there is competition and, therefore, lower prices. In North Dakota, there is not. Therefore, they charge us more than double. We get overcharged because there isn't competition. 
If farmers aren't discouraged enough by prices that are in the tank or by markets that are controlled by increasingly monopolistic tendencies, then they are beset by trade problems. 
The Canadian trade agreement that we have is unforgivable in the way it was negotiated. The United States negotiator went to Canada and negotiated a United States-Canada trade agreement and fundamentally sold out agricultural interests. I say that understanding exactly what I am saying. I am sure the trade ambassador got other concessions. But family farmers had the rug pulled out from under them. Every day we have carloads and carloads of grain coming across from Canada into our marketplace. In my judgment this is in contravention of U.S. law. Yet, the Canadians refuse to open their books to GAO audits. In fact, they just recently refused once again to allow the GAO at my request to go up and audit their books. I think they are guilty of violating American trade laws. But they say, `No. We are going to ship all of this product into your country and we don't intend to open our books to you.' 
The United States-Canada free trade agreement is an outrage. 
It takes money right out of the pockets of family farmers, and it has gone on for a number of years, and nobody seems to care much. It is not just grain that comes in from Canada. It is also truckload after truckload of livestock. But nobody seems to care much. 
It seems to me that farmers are told in every way that somehow it is a free market out there. They are told to go participate in that free market. Yet, when it comes to this country deciding that it wants to impose sanctions on Cuba, farmers are told: Oh, by the way, you can't sell grain to Cuba. Or they are told, by the way, you can't sell grain to Iran; and, you can't sell grain to Iraq; and, you can't sell grain to Libya. 
Farmers are told, you have to pay the cost of those markets that are closed to you. Farmers are told they have to pay the cost of lost wheat sales to China, because we don't have the backbone to stand up to China. We should say to China, if you send us your shirts, your trousers, your shoes, and your trinkets, you then have to buy our wheat. Yet, because we don't have the backbone to say to China that as a condition of our market absorbing all her products that China must buy American grain. Farmers bear the consequences of those kinds of incompetent trade agreements and the lack of will and the lack of nerve and the lack of backbone. Farmers bear the consequence of that. 
Most people probably don't know much about farming. Most people probably don't care much about farming. They probably in many cases think that food comes from a carton somewhere at the grocery store. 
I had a fellow come to North Dakota once. He was a Member of Congress, who had never been on a farm. I decided that since he votes on farm policy issues that I should really take him out and show him a farm. And we did. We went to a dairy barn. And the dairy business is as tough a business as there is. It is hard. You get up early in the morning and milk cows. The last thing you do at the end of the day is milk cows. There is no tougher job in the country. 
My friend was standing there in a blue-striped suit, which is the uniform for Congress, and he saw how hard this was. This fellow and his wife were in the dairy barn on a little farm north of New Salem, ND, and they were milking about 90 cows. That is tough. It was about 5:30 in the evening. The light was shafting through the barn, and it was beautiful. And my friend, this Congressman, watched this go on, and finally he said to the farmer, `How often do you have to do this?' The farmer was hooking up the milk machines. It is very tough work. He says, `How often do you have to do this?' The farmer, whose name was George, said, `Well, you have to do it twice a day. You have to do it every morning and you have to do it every evening.' 
And my friend, the Congressman from out east, thought about that a bit, and then he said, `George, do you have to do this on weekends, too?' And he didn't know. Of course, you have to do it on weekends. You milk 7 days a week twice a day. But he didn't know it. He had never been on a farm. 
Family farmers work hard, risk everything they have. In every circumstance, all they want to do is make a decent living. And what we are finding in North Dakota and across the farm belt these days is that we have the goofiest, most detrimental farm program you can possibly conceive. What does our farm program say to our family farmers out there? What does it say to some lonely farm family living on the farm with a yard light on at night, 5 miles from the nearest neighbor? 
What we say to them is that you are on your own. You fight the big grain trade firms. You fight the railroad companies. You fight the meat packing plants. And, when you are done with those fights, which by the way you are going to lose, then you go ahead and fight the European Union, because they are subsidizing their farmers. You fight China which keeps your wheat out. You fight Japan that doesn't buy enough beef. You go ahead and fight Canada that floods your market and takes money out of your pocket. 
We tell our farmers that they have to wage those fights alone, and we know they are going to lose. Yet, we have people on the floor of the Senate who chant, `Free market.' All they can do is chant, `Free market.' There has never been a free market in agriculture. There never has been, and there probably never will be. 
Nobody would like it more than I would if farmers could go to the grain elevator with their 2-ton truck, haul their wheat in and get a decent price. Nobody would like that better than I would, because farmers ought to be able to get a decent price from the marketplace. What if farmers can't? Does this country care whether there are any family farmers left? It is questionable whether at least some in the Congress care at all. But, if this country cares about whether there are family farmers left, then if farmers can't get the price at the grain elevator because the market is a manipulated market that is not a free market at all, then there has to be some mechanism, as other countries have done, that says to family farmers, here is a support price in the event you can't get a decent price at the marketplace. It is the only way we will keep family farmers on the farm. 
Now, we don't have much choice, it seems to me, in the coming weeks. We are going to have to decide that we are either going to do something to respond to this farm crisis or we are going to see wholesale farm bankruptcies all across the country. The very survival of family farms is what is at stake. 
Let me just briefly go through a couple of charts. 
Here is what has happened to wheat prices. Wheat prices have fallen 53 percent in the 2 years since the farm bill was passed. That is what has happened to wheat prices under Freedom to Farm. If you love Freedom to Farm, then vote Freedom to Farm. But here is what has happened to wheat prices. You can chant `Freedom' all you like, and it is not going to help families on the farm stay on the farm. As I said when I started, chanting `Freedom to Farm' and pulling the rug out from family farmers, would be the same thing as coming to the floor and saying what we propose is to cut the minimum wage to a dollar an hour and we will call it freedom to work. It is exactly the same principle. 
That is what has happened to grain prices. They have dropped from $5.75 per bushel to $2.72 per bushel. That is why farmers are in such significant trouble. 
Secondly, in addition to that, there is no longer a disaster program. Now when you suffer disasters, we cannot respond to it. That is also part of the Freedom-to-Farm approach. I want to show you what has happened to family farmers in North Dakota. 
This is only one State. The red area means that these counties and those farmers living in those counties have been living in a county declared a disaster area for 5 years in a row. The orange areas have had disasters 4 out of 5 years. You can see that takes up the entire eastern half of the State. Incidentally, this half of my State is equal to five times Massachusetts in land mass. North Dakota is 10 times the size of Massachusetts in land size. But this half of North Dakota has had a disaster declaration for every county 4 out of 5 years. A third of our counties have been declared a disaster every year. All of our counties were declared a disaster area this past year. 
Family farmers can't make it when they have disaster after disaster after disaster. Yet, we have people in Congress saying to them, `Well, so what. Go to the marketplace. It's a free market.' It is not a free market. 
When you have crop disease and disasters, resulting from the wet cycle, and collapsed prices, here is what happens to income: In 1 year, there was a 98 percent reduction in net farm income. Family farmers as a group in North Dakota lost 98 percent of their net income. Think of it. Can you think of anyone else in your neighborhood, anyone in your town, who would still be on their feet if they lost 98 percent of their net income? I don't think so; not with a 98 percent loss in net income. 
Here is what happened to the production costs for family farmers. They have to buy tractors, right? In 20 years, here is what happened to the price of a tractor? In the past 20 years, here is what happened to the price of a combine. Look at what has happened to the fertilizer costs and what has happened to the price of diesel fuel. And then I showed you what happened to wheat prices. All of those input costs increased dramatically and wheat prices come down. 
Well, there are a lot of solutions to this, some of which will appease no one in this Chamber, I suppose. Yet, we must decide as a Congress whether this matters. 
If we have big corporations in this country that get into trouble, gosh, there are all kinds of friends there willing to fluff up their pillow and give them an aspirin and get them to bed for a short nap, maybe give them a transitional loan. 
It is really interesting. While I am describing to you the problems in family farming, think of what has happened during this period of time when family farmers like Jim McAllister and Joni Flaten and others are losing everything they have. Yes, absolutely everything. What is happening on the front page of your newspaper? All the biggest companies in the country are finding romance once again. They are dating, and then they are getting married, and so we have these big mergers and combinations. Gosh, they love each other. The bigger, the better. At the upper end of this economic system, things are just swimming, I guess. There are record profits, and the largest mergers in the history of humankind. And at the bottom, the folks who are out there trying to raise a family 
and keep a yard light on and run a family farm are going broke in record numbers. 
There is something really wrong with that. There is something wrong with a system that doesn't reward what this country should value most and that doesn't connect effort and reward. You talk about effort? You know, family farmers are the ones who invest everything they have, work hard, risk everything they have, and then discover at the end of it that they don't have the capability of continuing. And this country has a policy that says that is fine; we don't care about that? 
We are going to have a big fight in this Chamber this summer to see who cares. Some people may say they don't care. Or they may say they care, but they have constructed these goof-ball policies and they just want to stand over in a corner and chant about free markets. That is one solution, I guess. But that solution will simply continue this decline, this spiral of failing our family farms. 
But there are other ways to address this. One is for this Congress to write a simple farm plan that starts with one single sentence, and that sentence says: The purpose of this farm bill is to maintain a network of family farms in this country. 
Otherwise, you will have corporate agrifactories farm from California to Maine. There won't be anybody living in the country, and the price of food will go up. That can happen and probably will happen unless this country decides that family farmers are in this country's best interests. Thomas Jefferson used to say that it is in this country's best interests to maintain a broad network of ownership in this country. Broad-based economic ownership is critical to the success of this country. 
Even if one doesn't care about family farmers, one ought to care about the disparity that exists here. We should care about the massive failure at the bottom of the system affecting people who really produce real things, and the orgy of mergers that is occurring at the top with the big getting bigger. 
One of the things that bothers me the most about all of this is the people who are out there raising a kernel of wheat or corn or barley to take it to the market are the very ones who are failing. And then everybody else who gets hold of that seems to be making record profits. Go to the grocery store and buy a box of cereal and look at the price. Somebody took that kernel of wheat or corn or grain of rice and they might have puffed it. Now that it is made into puffed wheat, does its price bear any relationship to the price that the farmer gets for the wheat? No, not at all. The farmer gets a pitiful price that is insufficient to keep the farmer in business. But those who process it, those who haul it, those who puff it, those who crisp it, those who shred it, they are all making record profits. There is something wrong with that. There is something wrong with the method by which this system values what people contribute to our economic system. 
Some people might say to me, `Gee, you come from North Dakota and you have a different view of economics. You didn't go to the University of Chicago, the School of Economics; you don't understand free markets,' and so on. No, I understand it. I understand the difference between the theory, the chanting and all the nonsense and the reality that exists every day confronting people who produce every day. 
So I know there will be some in this Chamber who will be upset this summer that we are going to push them very hard on these policies. Those of us who have other ideas and believe there is a better way and different approach and believe there is a way for this Congress to stand up for family farming. We need to say to our family farmers, just as the Europeans have said to their family farmers and other countries have said to theirs, that you matter. Your presence as a producer, as a family farmer in this country, makes a difference to us. It strengthens this country. It nurtures this country. 
The formation of family values in America always came from family farms. The seed bed of family values came from family farms. They have rolled into small towns and rolled into the cities, nurturing and refreshing the family values of this country. 
So, therefore, family farming matters. It is more than just dollars and cents, and it is more than just economics. Family farming, as an economic and social policy, matters in this country. 
Those who have currently gained the upper hand politically on this issue have constructed a farm policy that says, `We are going to pull the rug out from under you even as we negotiate bad trade agreements. We are going to pull the rug out from under you on support and there will be no disaster programs for massive crop disease.' Those folks are not going to like what some of us feel we must do this summer to try to force the issue to deal with family farming. 
Mr. President, I think of Joni Flaten, a 38-year-old woman from Langdon, ND, who writes a letter with resignation. She and her husband have invested in their farm and in fact they are losing their farm, and they wonder what to do next. She says, `. . . I'm not sure if there is a lot of need for a 38-year-old combine operator/tractor driver/trucker/run for parts person and be a mother in the workforce in North Dakota.' That is what you do to run a farm. Everybody does everything. 
Some, I guess, as the old saying goes, understand the cost of everything and the value of nothing. That is what we have here, in my judgment. We went through this debate a couple of years ago on the Freedom to Farm bill and I was never made quite so despondent about a U-turn in public policy as I was by those who said, `Gee, family farmers really don't matter very much. We have this market system they can work in.' 
Everybody here knows. The statistics I have just used are not foreign to anybody here. They say to the family farmer: You operate in this market system. We understand the grain trading firms have a hammerlock on price; we understand the railroads have a hammerlock on your transportation; we understand that meat packing plants have a hammerlock on your marketing system, but, still, you go ahead and operate in the free market. 
I think it would be perfectly understandable for farmers to start their tractors and gas them up and head them towards the byways and highways that haul policy makers to legislative forums where they extol about a free market that doesn't exist and see if they cannot persuade them that family farming matters and that their futures and their fortunes matter as well. 
We expect in the coming weeks to have discussions about a disaster program or an indemnification program, either one; about a price support program; about a range of other issues that need to be addressed, including the question of concentration in the meat packing industry and other issues. But through it all, I expect we will debate these issues in the month of July. 
Now that the Senate will be back voting tomorrow, we will see work on appropriations bills. Will we see business as usual? Will we see the kind of legislative sleight of hand that I mentioned at the start of this discussion? Will we see conference committees come to the floor of the Senate in which a $2 billion item was offered in legislative darkness that will butter the bread of the richest folks in America? Then the same people who decide they want to do that will say, `Gee, we don't have enough money to help poor people who can't afford home heating.' 
We will see all that kind of thing that goes on around here because people can do it, and they do do it, and that is unfortunate. That is not the bright side of legislating. That is the dark side of legislating. But, hopefully, enough of us will force enough of others of us in this Chamber to confront these questions. Does farm policy work when farmers are told that whatever they get in the marketplace is all there is, and the marketplace collapses like a used accordion, and the farmers are then told, well, it's tough luck; some big corporation will come and farm all that land and America will be just as well off with an agrifactory? 
In my judgment, it won't. I recognize I come from a town of 300 people in a small rural area of North Dakota. But the people who farm in North Dakota and up and down the farm belt are some of 
the best people in this country. They don't deserve to be whipsawed by an economic system that is unfair to them, that treats them fundamentally unfairly with respect to trade agreements and sanctions, and markets that are unfair, markets that are clogged. It is not the right way for this country to treat its family farmers. 
So, again, Mr. President, in the coming couple of weeks, the leadership of the Senate should expect to confront these issues. I hope those who feel strongly about the current farm policy will bring their notebooks, bring their theory, and sharpen their chants, because they are going to have an opportunity to tell us about free markets once again. We will have an opportunity to visit about farm families who are going broke under that very same set of circumstances. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my hope and the hope of many of my colleagues, that, when we return following the Independence Day break, we will take up a piece of legislation called the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
We have, over many weeks, come to the floor of the Senate to talk about cases around the country that illustrate the critical need for us to do something about a health care system that has increasingly herded people into managed care plans in which profit and loss, or the bottom line, becomes more important than a person's health care needs. That is why the American Medical Association and many others support the Patients' Bill of Rights that we have introduced. My fervent hope is that the Congress and the Senate will find time to address this issue in July. 
Let me talk just for a moment about a woman, Phyllis Cannon from Newcastle, OK. In September of 1991, Phyllis Cannon was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia. She underwent a regimen of chemotherapy, which her HMO did pay for, and her leukemia went into remission. But her doctor, her oncologist, fearing that her cancer would again surface, recommended that she undergo an analogous bone marrow transplant. However, her HMO contended that this procedure was still experimental for first remission patients, and it refused to pay for the bone marrow transplant, even though a bone marrow transplant procedure was covered under the terms of her plan. 
Phyllis Cannon's oncologist fought vigorously for this procedure. He supplied the HMO with the latest medical literature on the procedure, knowing that an urgent transplant was critical for Phyllis' health. But, once again, the HMO denied coverage. Phyllis, her husband Jerry, and the doctor continued to fight, and finally, after another month had passed, the HMO relented and said it would pay for the bone marrow transplant. 
But the HMO officials, once they had agreed to cover the transplant, didn't notify Phyllis of the decision until a month later, and by then it was too late. The leukemia had returned, and Phyllis died 6 weeks later. 
Because Phyllis received her health care coverage from her employer, her HMO was protected under a law called ERISA. Employer-sponsored plans, like the one covering Phyllis, are governed by ERISA, which gives HMOs immunity from the harmful effects their decisions might have. So, for Jerry Cannon, ERISA left him no chance to hold the HMO accountable for its decision which led to his wife's death. And this story, one more story, of Phyllis Cannon, demonstrates the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
Increasingly, as health care becomes more a function of profit and loss, it is straying from the central purpose of health care. 
Let me share with my colleague what Phyllis' husband Jerry said. This is a picture of Jerry holding a photograph of his wife. 
[Telling my wife that the HMO was not going to provide the transplant she needed] just devastated her. She gave up after that. Oh, it was horrible. Once I got off the phone, I could see all hope leave her. 
This is just one person, one person among thousands and tens of thousand in this country who now fear a health care system in which they are herded into this big chute called HMOs or managed care, and some insurance company accountant in a back room 500 miles away will make a decision about whether a medical procedure is covered. And when they make a mistake in that back room of the insurance office, no one can hold them accountable. If the doctor makes a mistake, that doctor is accountable. But the health care plan has no accountability. 
In fact, they have special protection under the law. We suggest as the remedy a Patients' Bill of Rights supported by the President, by the American Medical Association, and by a vast array of groups around this country that represent patients. 
Let me describe one more time, as I have before when I have come to the floor to talk about this issue, why the American people are demanding we do something about this problem. 
There was a story in the paper several months ago about a woman who was injured quite severely by a fall from a horse. Her brain was swelling, and bystanders called an ambulance to take her to the hospital. While this woman was in the ambulance, with her brain swelling, she said, `I don't want to go to hospital X,' which was the nearest hospital. `I want you to take me to hospital Y,' which was further away. 
She survived this brain injury and was asked later, `Why did you, while you were in this ambulance suffering from a serious injury, ask to be taken to the hospital that was further away?' She said, `Because I had read a lot about the hospital that was closest, and it was all about profit and loss, all about the bottom line. I didn't want to be wheeled into an emergency room in that hospital and have someone look at me in terms of dollars and cents, in terms of profit and loss. That is not the way I wanted to be treated as a patient.' 
Our Patients' Bill of Rights says that every patient has a right to know all the medical options available for treatment of their disease, not just the cheapest option. Our Patients' Bill of Rights says that people have a right to go to an emergency room when they have a medical emergency. You think that is something that is understood across this country? It is not. There are plenty of instances when people are not getting coverage for emergency room visits. 
Our Patients' Bill of Rights says that when someone is in need of a specialist to treat their disease, he or she has a right to see that specialist. You think that is routine in managed care organizations today? I am sorry to say it is not. 
And our Patients' Bill of Rights--unlike the bill that was unveiled just yesterday, I believe, in the other body--says patients have a right to sue their health plan if its decision harms them. We take away the special exemption that is given these organizations so that when a health plan makes medical judgments that can deny someone like Phyllis the cancer treatment she needs the folks who made that decision are made to take responsibility for it. That is why President Clinton and a good many in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, say it is time to do something about this issue. 
I suppose that one can make the case, `Well, there's only so much money in the system.' Doctors make the case that they want to practice medicine in the doctor's office, in the hospital room. 
I have met with a good many doctors in my State to talk to them about the health care system. Increasingly, they tell us that managed care organizations are taking the decisions out of the doctors' offices and out of the hospital rooms, and making them instead in some insurance office hundreds of miles away by someone who knows nothing about the patient and nothing about the patient's needs. 
Doctors are angry about that, and justifiably angry in my judgment. It is time--long past the time--to pass a piece of legislation that says to these organizations, there are certain basic rights that ought to be available to every American when they are ill, when they are in need of help from the health care system. 
Among those rights, as I just mentioned, is the right to understand, from your health care provider, all of the options available to you to help treat you, not just the cheapest option available that the managed care organization is willing to provide. Those are the kinds of things that we will address and discuss and hopefully deal with when we bring a Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor. 
Again, I am pleased to say this is not one of those issues that is a partisan issue. There are Republicans and Democrats who feel strongly and have spoken aggressively on the floor of the Senate and the House about this issue. 
The power to schedule here in the Congress is a very important and very significant power. We hope that those who have the power to schedule will put on the agenda of the U.S. Senate the Patients' Bill of Rights. No, not some watered down, lukewarm version like was introduced yesterday that is designed only to allow Congress to say it dealt with this issue. I am talking about a real Patients' Bill of Rights, one that addresses and solves the health care problems that Americans are forced to deal with every day and that, regrettably, Jerry Cannon and his poor wife Phyllis discovered a few years ago in a very tragic way. 
We can solve these problems, and we should. We owe it to Phyllis and Jerry and the other families around this country who confront this every day in the doctors' offices and in the hospital rooms. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to compensate farmers if we choose to continue using food as a weapon. I do not support the use of food in this way, but if this country chooses to use food as a weapon, then the producers of that weapon deserve to be compensated, just as all other weapons manufacturers are compensated. 
Today, ten percent of the world's wheat markets are off limits to American farmers because of sanctions. If we include the recent loss of the markets in Pakistan and India, sixteen percent of the worlds markets are not available. Farmers in my state, and farmers across this nation, cannot afford to pay for this foreign policy option out of their own pockets. 
This bill amends an existing statute which is so narrowly drawn that, despite ongoing sanctions, the statute has not required any compensation to farmers. The existing statute requires that the sanction be imposed by the executive branch of government, be unilateral, and not be joined by any other nation. It also limits compensation to three years and allows the Secretary of Agriculture to choose between direct compensation and export assistance programs. 
This bill eliminates all of the restrictions in the existing statute which preclude it from being of any assistance to farmers hit by declining prices caused by lost export markets. The new statute will make it clear that, if our government chooses to use food as a weapon, then those who produce that food will not alone bear the financial burden. I ask that my colleagues join me in passage of this bill to ensure fairness in our foreign trade policy.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not use all the time allotted to me. I just want to make a couple points. 
There isn't any question, I say to my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, that the base-closing rounds have saved money. I don't think there is a quarrel in this Chamber about that. Base closings save money. They do cost some money in the short term--there is no question--but they save money. 
I have voted for four rounds of base closures, and it is likely that I will vote for additional base closures, because we need some restructuring. But the real question is this: Will we have the information we need to make the right decision as we cast that vote? 
As my colleagues will recall, both the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office are skeptical about the Defense Department's savings estimates. Let me share what the Congressional Budget Office said about this a while ago: 
The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. 
Then the Congressional Budget Office says: 
That consideration, however, should follow an interval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far. 
About a couple dozen of the bases that have been ordered to close are not yet closed. We ought to finish the job we have done in the previous rounds before we begin a new one. 
I have another question about this issue, and I think all of us should bear this question in mind. What does the Defense Department mean by requesting two additional base-closing rounds at the same time that folks at DOD are talking about building and developing new superbases? Where? How big? At what cost? Let's answer some of those questions before we proceed. 
Finally, let me respond to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona about civilian employees. The civilian employee standard has been in law for some 20 years. This amendment modifies it or adjusts it some. But as a standard for the Department's authority in this area, the number of civilian employees is not new. 
So I am happy to join the Senator from Oklahoma in authoring this amendment. 
Again, I think some base closings will save money. I think we will do that at some point, but this is not the time. We have nearly 30 that were ordered closed that are not yet closed. Let's finish that job.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I had not intended to come to the floor to make a few comments today until I read a story about a press conference that was held in the Senate here yesterday by some Senators about farm policy. A group of Senators held a press conference on farm policy of this country and said, `We've got a good, solid farm policy. The problem is not the farm bill. The problem is the farm bill is not being implemented properly.' 
We have a good, solid farm policy? Are they kidding? What planet are they living on if they think we have a good, solid farm policy? What we have is a new farm policy written by people who don't know much about farming and it is called the Agricultural Market Transition Act, and what it is transitioning is family farmers straight out of business. 
Farm families are going broke in our State in record numbers. In fact, there are more auction sales of family farmers this year than ever before, and they have had so many auction sales of family farmers in North Dakota that they have had to call auctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales. 
There is a lot more than statistics about losing these farmers. Farmers plant a seed in the spring and then hope it will grow. They hope it doesn't hail and insects don't come and the crop doesn't get diseased. And if it does come above the ground and then eventually if they escape all those weather disasters, they harvest in the fall and they hope maybe they will get a decent price for their crop. 
These families struggle hard, they work hard and they risk everything they have. Guess what? This current farm policy is a mess. We have prices that are in the tank for grain, and family farmers out there, who are raising grain and trying to take it to the market these days, discover that they have lost their shirts. And then we have people saying that we have a good, solid farm policy. 
I had a farm meeting in North Dakota and a fellow stood up. He was a big rugged fellow, kind of a husky build. He had kind of a black beard. He stood up and he started speaking. He said, `My granddad farmed, my dad farmed, and I farmed for 23 years.' Then he got tears in his eyes and his chin began to quiver, and he said, `The problem is, I can't continue anymore.' That is more than just losing a business. That is losing their life's dream. And, now, we have people who say we have a good, solid farm policy. 
I didn't vote for this previous farm bill that was passed a couple of years ago. There were people involved in writing that who wouldn't know a dairy cow from a Dairy Queen. The fact is, they don't know much about farming. I would counsel them, if they think it is a good farm policy: Go buy yourself a farm. Go buy yourself a farm, take your suit off and gas up the tractor and plant a crop. Then risk your money and hope all summer you are able to harvest, and when you do, then truck it to the elevator and sell it for $3 a bushel after you put $5 a bushel into raising it. 
Then add up your bank balance, and then ask yourself if you think it is good farm policy? Ask yourself, after you have lost your shirt and lost your suit and lost your savings, ask yourself whether you think it is a good farm policy. 
Of course it is not a good farm policy. The fact is, the little guy is going broke; the big guys are getting rich. I am talking about the folks who take the product off the farm and they haul it and they process it. They take that grain and they puff it and they crisp it, they do everything with it. The miller and grocery manufacturers and everybody else are all making money. But it is the person out there who is trying to run a family farm who is not doing well. 
I find it interesting, the people who do not seem to care much about that are the same people around here who bellow every day about being profamily. Nobody in politics in this town is profamily if they are not willing to stand up and be profamily farmer, in my judgment. 
Let me show a chart that demonstrates part of the problem in my State, the State of North Dakota. This area here, the red area, means that these folks have had a disaster declaration every single year for 5 years in a row, weather related. One third of our counties, you can't do much about that. That is not a family farm's fault. These are weather-related disasters, 5 years in a row, every year. The orange one-half our counties is 4 out of 5; the yellow two-thirds of our counties have had disasters 3 out of 5 years. 
In addition to having the weather problem--here is what has happened to the price of wheat. It has fallen like an elevator, straight down. The price of wheat was up here when the Freedom to Farm bill or the Market Transition Act was passed. Here is the price of wheat now at a five-year low. 
Here is what happened to net income to North Dakota farmers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics. North Dakota's net farm income dropped 98 percent for family farmers. That is 98 percent. They virtually lost all of their income. 
What has happened to those family farmers out there struggling with grain prices that are terrible, and with weather problems? 
The price of a tractor goes up, as you can see. The price of a combine goes up. The price of fertilizer goes up. The price of diesel fuel goes up. So their income goes down, way down, and all the prices they pay for their input go up. 
Then what has happened to the folks who take that grain and do something with it? Bread profits, the price of a bushel of wheat goes from $5.50 to $3. Do you think you see lower bread prices in the grocery store? You don't. What happens is the profits for the folks who are making bread go right here. 
These folks who constructed the farm policy that we have in this country today called this `Market Transition Act'; that is, transitioning family farmers right off the family farm. They said, `We don't need a price support anymore for family farmers. Let them take their own risks, and if the market price for grain is dropping, too bad. Tough luck.' So they set up a circumstance where you end up having no deficiency payments. They put, instead, a declining payment, which at the end of 7 years phases out and goes to zero. 
It is interesting, at the press conference yesterday that was held by some Senators, they said the problem is we cannot retreat. The rest of the world is not going to retreat. The fact is, in much of the rest of the world they understand family farmers are important and they have policies that try to support and help family farmers and keep them on the farm. It is this country that has decided, as a matter of policy by the majority party in this Congress, that family farmers really don't matter very much. Oh, giant agrifactories will farm the land from California to Maine, I suppose. They don't seem to care who farms the land, because they think family farmers don't matter. 
They say, `We can fix all this. First of all, the policy is sound, and we can fix it. We will fix it with fast track, fast track trade authority.' 
Gosh, there is a new idea. Fast track trade authority. We send an American trade negotiator up to Canada to negotiate with Canada; send him to Mexico to negotiate with Mexico; send him to Geneva to negotiate GATT. We had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada and we negotiated with them and it went from an $11 billion deficit to a $23 billion deficit. Does anybody think that is going to help family farmers? And, incidentally, the trade deficit with Canada is exacerbated by a flood of Canadian grain coming to our border, undercutting our grain. It is unfairly subsidized. Nobody seems to be willing to do much about it. 
We have a $2 billion surplus with Mexico, negotiate a treaty, and the surplus goes to a huge deficit, $15 billion deficit. It doesn't look like that is progress to me. 
Do you want to see how the Mexican trade agreement works? Look at it through the eye of a potato. Try to take a potato across the Mexican border, a raw potato. You can't do that very easily, but you can see french fries coming north. Or how about a bean? How about a bean going across the Mexican border? Do you think we can export unlimited quantities of beans? I am sorry, no, our negotiator said no, we don't care much about beans. 
What about beer? Do you like Mexican beer? You can buy plenty of it in the United States. You like American beer, in Mexico? I am sorry, you will have great trouble finding it because our negotiators, in my judgment, did an incompetent job in negotiating the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. 
And, yes, GATT. When I say the GATT agreement, do you know a ship pulled up at a dock in Stockton, CA, a few weeks ago loaded with European barley. This was feed barley, which in fact is not worth very much, probably a couple of dollars a bushel or less--subsidized by $1.10 a bushel by the Europeans, shipped into this country where we already have a surplus of barley, and guess what, it was legal. It was legal under GATT. You can do that under the trade agreement our negotiators negotiated, you can ship in barley with a subsidy that is almost 50 percent of the market price of the product. Who are these people kidding? 
Do we want to send negotiators out to negotiate more of these agreements, and they are going to help our country? I don't think so. 
The fact is, the people who held a press conference yesterday and said this farm policy works just fine don't have the foggiest idea of what is going on on the family farm. They say, `Well, let's go to fast track and have more of this trade.' All that has done is set you back. I am for opening foreign markets and forcing opportunities to market more of our grain overseas, but that is not what is happening with our trade agreements. 
I find it interesting. They said one of the ways that will solve this farm problem is farmers' savings accounts. Oh, yeah? Where are the farmers going to get the savings? If you are able to raise wheat and lose $2 a bushel for selling it, you are going to get a lot of savings, so we are going to produce farmers' savings accounts. 
Maybe the people who held the press conference will be able to tell farmers where they are going to get savings, when the price for wheat is in the tank, and when they pulled the rug out from under family farmers saying they don't need a safety net. They said, in effect, we don't care if there are family farmers left in this country. 
What we need to do, Mr. President, is to reestablish a safety net and recognize that this transition program doesn't make any sense. Yes, farmers ought to have all the planning flexibility in the world. This Congress ought to decide that family farmers matter, and we ought to do as Europe and others do and decide there ought to be some basic support mechanism for family farming. We have a minimum wage for lower-income working folks, but we say to the family out there on the farm, `You're on your own. Oh, you can try and market your beef to big packing plants'--where four of them control almost 85 percent of the beef packing and they have a fist around the neck of the bottle. They say to the farmer and rancher, `You go ahead and market up in that direction and the big packing plants are going to tell you what you're going to get, and if you don't like what you get, tough luck; you're out of business.' 
Or people raising wheat or barley, we say, `You can market with the grain companies. They have an iron fist around the neck of the bottle where you are going to market, and if you don't like the price, tough luck; you're out of business.' 
The fact is, when we get an industry or a big special interest in this country that has a headache, you have a dozen people in the Senate rushing to see if they can't pat their pillow and give them aspirin and help them take a nap. 
The big interests in this country have plenty of friends around here. It's just the little guy who is left in the dust. You have family farmers who don't have a lot of money. They don't have a lot of clout. They are not like the tobacco industry. They are not able to spend $50 million or $100 million worth of advertising on their issue. The tobacco industry this week was able to turn back this tobacco bill because they were able to advertise all across this country. 
What about the issue of stopping teen smoking. Well, the tobacco industry won; kids lost. The tobacco industry had money, kids didn't. If you're a big interest, you have big money, and you can find plenty of folks to care about your interest in the Congress. 
The question is, Will there be enough people caring about the interests of family farmers in the coming weeks to decide we are going to intervene and try to save a network of family farms in this country? We ought to resurrect the safety net. There ought to be at least some sort of marketing loan that gives farmers a decent price if they don't get it from the marketplace. I much sooner they get it from the marketplace, but if it is not there, farmers need some help. They ought to get some indemnity payments for the crop diseases that have been pervasive in my State and other States. The crop disease is called scab. We ought to have a Crop Insurance Program that works, and if it doesn't work, let's make it work. 
We ought to have something in place that starts to do something about market concentration. Yes, let's look into the livestock industry, the railroads, the big packing plants, and in all the areas where concentration exists. All that concentration squeezes down on family farmers and takes potential profits away from family farmers. 
Finally, those who talk about trade, it seems to me ought to spend their time not talking about going to some sort of fast track where the record has been a disaster for this country and for our producers and, yes, especially for our farmers. They ought to talk about sanctions. 
We don't like Cuba, so we say we are going to have sanctions against Cuba. We don't like Libya, so we have sanctions against Libya. We don't like Iraq, so we're going to have sanctions against Iraq. We don't like Iran, so we're going to have sanctions against Iran. India and Pakistan detonate nuclear devices, so we're going to have sanctions against those countries. 
Ten percent of the markets in the world are off limits to 
farmers. These sanctions have something to do with national security decisions. The defense authorization bill deals with national security. It seems to me if you are taking markets away from family farmers, you ought to pay them for it. Why should family farmers lose markets and be told, `Well, you're going to contribute now to our national security interest because we are taking this market away from you; yes, your price is going to go down, and, yes, you are going to lose money. Be a good American; you accept the cost.' 
In virtually every other area in this country, we do something about that. If it were big business, we would come in with a big policy to reimburse them. You don't think when the big exporters lose money that they are not reimbursed? It is interesting to me that virtually every time something happens that causes a substantial disruption in part of our economy, somebody is here saying we ought to do something about it, but there is not much discussion about family farmers, and I really regret that. 
I know some people say, `Well, this country is New York and Los Angeles and a few big airports in between, and what you fly over and look out at is just rural territory.' Food doesn't come from a plastic bottle; food doesn't come from a package. It comes, in most cases, from the land, and the rural people in this country. These are people who come from my home area in Hettinger County, ND, who decided long ago they love the land and they want to live on the land. They want to raise their children on the land, and they have 500, 800, or 1,000 acres. They have risked everything they have and everything they own to try to make a living. Yet, we come along with this farm policy that says we are different from Europe, from Japan or other countries. We have a policy that doesn't care whether family farmers continue to exist. Our policy says if the marketplace gives them a decent price, fine; if it doesn't, tough luck, because we believe in the free market. 
There is no free market in agriculture. What an absurd contention. There has never been a free market in agriculture and will not be a free market. Our farmers are asked to compete not just against European farmers, they are asked to compete against European farmers and the European Governments. Our farmers are asked to sell in circumstances where our trade negotiators negotiate agreements and you can't get enough T-bone steak into Tokyo. 
Did you know that T-bone steaks are roughly $30 a pound into Tokyo? Do you know why? Because we can't get enough beef into Japan. Why can't we? Because their market is closed. We are getting more than we used to. 
We have a $50 to $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, but we still don't get enough beef into Japan. We don't get enough wheat into China. I can stand here all day and talk about the problems we impose on family farmers to interrupt their markets because of incompetent trade negotiators and unenforced trade agreements. We negotiate an agreement and we forget about it in a month. They were bad agreements to start with, and they are rarely enforced, if at all. I am just saying that the economic all-stars in this country are its family farmers. If this Congress doesn't decide that broad-based economic ownership matters in this country, then it will have made a very large mistake. 
I am standing on this side of the aisle. So that means I am a Democrat. That is how I came to Congress. I ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, and I believe in the Jeffersonian strain of the Democratic Party, and its support for broadly-based economic ownership. We believe that the broad-based economic ownership provides the guarantee of economic freedom and, therefore, the guarantee of ultimate political freedoms in this country. I think that is a very, very important issue. 
I have come to the floor of the Senate recently talking about concentration in this country. Every day you hear about a new merger, when two huge behemoth American corporations decide to get married. We didn't even know they were dating or having secret discussions. All of a sudden, we discover they have taken out a marriage license. They love each other. What they love is the profits. 
Now we have bank after bank, telecommunications companies--you name it--they are all marrying up. The bigger the better. The free market in this country and the market system in this country works only when you have broad-based ownership and robust competition. Concentration means less competition. 
Family farmers, individuals all across this country turn on the yard light at night, worship at their local church, and try to send their kids to school, and do a good job, and make a little profit on the farm. All that those family farmers ask is to participate in a market system that works. Almost in every instance they discover that all their input costs are increased by the largest corporations in the land that produce these products. And when they go to market with the products they raise, they discover is worth very, very little. When they try to market it up through an income stream, they find that if they are marketing a cow or a hog, they are marketing through packing plants that are too concentrated to have what is called a `free market.' And the same is true with grain. 
So, Mr. President, in the coming week or so, you are going to see a lot of activity on this issue. Our family farmers deserve the same kind of interest, in their long-term economic health, as the large special interests get here on the floor of the Senate. 
The piece that I referenced at the start, written by Curt Anderson, an Associated Press farm writer, referenced a press conference yesterday. To all of those who attended the press conference yesterday, telling us that we have a good solid farm policy, I say nonsense; this farm policy is a miserable failure. Anybody here who cares about family farmers as I do, and anybody here who cares whether we have family farmers in this country's future ought to be coming to the floor of this Senate and helping us change this farm policy to one that really provides some help to families who are struggling in this country, trying to run their family farms. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand that we are in morning business. However, the pending business, beginning at 2 o'clock, is the Energy and Water appropriations bill. I will make a couple of comments about the legislation brought to the floor by Senator Domenici and the ranking member, Senator Reid. 
I am a member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water, and I support this piece of legislation. I think Senator Domenici and Senator Reid have done a wonderful job. I understand that a lot of the details of this legislation will not be discussed at great length today, but I want to mention a couple of things in this bill just for purposes of alerting people that there are some significant problems that are being addressed, especially in the State of North Dakota, in this legislation. 
One piece of this legislation deals with funding for something called the Garrison Diversion Project. Now, that is a foreign language to most people, and no one really would be expected to know much about the Garrison Diversion Project in North Dakota. But I want to give some history, just for a few brief minutes, about this project and why it is important. 
Many years ago, the Missouri River--which was an aggressive, large river coming out of the mountains in Montana--was untamed, and during the spring flooding it would race down over its banks, and in the lower regions of the Missouri River down in Kansas City and elsewhere you would have massive flooding, flooding, in fact, all the along the way, including cities in North Dakota. It became a huge problem. Federal officials said let us try to harness the Missouri River with a series of dams. They proposed a series of `stem' dams on the Missouri River and one would have been in North Dakota. 
In the 1940s, the Federal officials said the folks downstream want the river harnessed so it won't flood, so they don't have all the problems downstream. What we would like to do is build a dam in your State. We would like to have a flood come to your State--behind the dam--that comes and stays forever. The flood in your State of North Dakota will be a 500,000-acre flood about the size of the State of Rhode Island. So they said to North Dakotans--in the 1940s--if you will allow us to put a permanent flood in your State by building a dam and damming up the water behind it, put a permanent flood that comes and stays forever in your State, we will give you the ability to move that water behind that dam in that reservoir around the State for a whole range of important purposes, including municipal, rural and industrial water needs. 
People of North Dakota thought, that is not a bad deal. We will accept the flood that comes and stays forever, but then we will get this promise from the Federal Government of being able to take water from behind that dam and moving it around the State to improve water supplies to farmsteads, cities and so on in North Dakota, to provide water for industrial development and a whole range of things that will create more economic growth in the State. 
So they built the dam. President Eisenhower came out and dedicated the dam. Then they created the flood. So the dam is there, the flood came, the flood stayed, and we have a Rhode Island-size flood in our State forever. 
So we got the cost, we are now hosts to a permanent flood, but we have not yet gotten all of the benefits. And that is what the Garrison Diversion Project and the funding in this bill is about. 
With the consent of the Presiding Officer, I will show my colleagues, or at least provide a demonstration today for those watching, the quality of water that we are talking about in some of our communities.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I brought to the floor a little container of water. Now I know this looks very much like coffee. It is not coffee. It is well water from a well at Keith and Ann Anderson's place in North Dakota. The water that comes from that well, looking like the color of coffee, is water that will be replaced by water behind the Garrison Dam from the Missouri River. 
That new water, the fresh water, coming out of the mountains from Montana in that large reservoir now in North Dakota can be moved around our State and can replace this water and we will have safe, wholesome and healthy drinking water in communities and on farmsteads in our State. 
That is one part of this project. This chart shows what I have just showed a moment ago, the color of some of this water, the quality of the water that is being used, forced to be used in some communities, in some farmsteads in North Dakota and why we must find a supplemental supply for it. That is what this project is about. Water delivered to rural North Dakota by pipeline behind the reservoir looks like this clear water, and it replaces this brown water. 
Is that good for people's health? Of course it is. Is it good for our State? Is it a good investment in our future? Of course it is. Is it, more importantly, keeping a promise to a State that got the cost of a flood that comes and stays, keeping the promise to be able to use that water for economic development for our future? Yes, that is an important promise for this government to keep. For that, I appreciate the work of the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nevada today on this piece of legislation. 
I will make a point about one additional provision in this legislation dealing with some construction money for what is called an emergency outlet at Devils Lake, ND. I show a photograph that was taken in 1965. This is a woman standing next to the bottom of a telephone pole. She is looking up to the top of the pole. The pole actually ended about here. This lake, 
is now way up to here, far, far above her head. This is Devils Lake, which is part of a basin the size of the State of Massachusetts. It is one of two closed basins in the United States. One is the Great Salt Lake and one is Devils Lake. 
In this basin the water runs down, just like any funnel, except there is no place for it to go. This lake has gone up and up and up. You can see, relative to this picture in 1965, where the water is today. This graph shows it even better. It shows what has happened over 150 years with respect to the water level. It is at 1,445.5 feet now. The cumulative damages from all of this are substantial: hundreds of millions of dollars, threatening people's homes, inundating farmland, threatening cities. This has been a huge problem, and there is no obvious solution for it--at least there is no one obvious solution. 
We are working on a range of things to try to resolve and respond to this issue: No. 1, upland storage, up in the upper part of the basin, to store water so it doesn't flow down to the lake, building dikes to protect cities; No. 3, raising roads, which is expensive, we have had to raise roads and then raise them again; No. 4, an emergency outlet to try to take some pressure off of that lake--an emergency outlet that would go over to the Sheyenne River. That is what is in this piece of legislation--another component of financing for an emergency outlet from Devils Lake. 
I know for those who have never seen or heard of Devils Lake that this doesn't mean very much. But this means almost everything to the people in the region and who are now threatened every day by this lake that continues to rise. The lake has doubled in size and tripled in volume in just a few short years. It now threatens a very substantial city in our State, cripples an economy, inundates roads, and it is a very, very serious problem. 
The piece of legislation before us provides another increment of construction funding for an emergency outlet. The outlet would not be huge; it would not be an outlet sufficient to let a lot of water off of the lake. But the outlet would remove a foot to a foot and a half a year of water from the lake depth. Marginally, over a period of years, it would help to take some pressure off of that lake. 
So that is the story of these two projects. Once again, I wanted to simply indicate that both of them are very important. We have had the cooperation of the chairman of the subcommittee, the ranking member, and others, on the appropriations subcommittee, to get some funding for both of these projects. Both projects will be good investments in our country and in our country's future. 
I commend the Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Mr. Domenici, and the ranking member, Mr. Reid, for the consideration given to the people of North Dakota in the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The people of North Dakota are most thankful for the Appropriations Committee's support of the state's priority water projects, particularly the Devils Lake emergency outlet and the Garrison Diversion project. 
I am privileged to serve on the Subcommittee and I note that Senator Domenici, in his statement before the Full Committee, remarked that he was able to provide only between 60-70 percent of the optimal funding level for water project construction in this bill. He faced enormous difficulties in this bill brought on by a budget request which was $1.8 billion below the level required to continue ongoing construction projects at their optimal level. 
In the face of these difficulties, the Subcommittee supported funding for an emergency outlet from Devils Lake--a body of water that normally has no natural outlet. It's a body of water that is rising inexorably and with a vengeance, displacing people, rendering formerly productive fields and roads useless. The devastating flooding in the Devils Lake region is very similar to recent flooding at Salt Lake, Utah--the other major closed basin in the United States. 
A headline this week from a local newspaper reads: `Economic costs of Devils Lake flood are staggering.' More than 170 homes have had to be moved. Damage to roads, bridges, and other property is estimated at around $250 million. And 70,000 acres of prime land have disappeared. The long-term effects of this flood emergency on personal incomes, on regional agriculture and local businesses, and on the local tax base are as yet undetermined. But the short-term impacts are unmistakable as bankruptcies multiply, farm auctions become routine, and local governments scratch to pay for mounting costs with dwindling revenues. 
The Senate Subcommittee and Full Committee honored the President's request for funding to address this emergency. Some predictions are that the lake could keep on rising and eventually spill into the Sheyenne River, resulting in a flood of unknown magnitude, but sure to result in the loss of key roads, vital infrastructure and thousands of acres of farmland. Such an uncontrolled outflow from the east end of the lake, with extremely high levels of dissolved solids, would create environmental havoc for the water supplies of downstream communities. 
For these reasons and others, the Committee wisely provided additional funding for an emergency outlet from the west end of the lake, where water quality is compatible with the Sheyenne River. Controlled releases would also be managed so as to avoid any downstream flooding. 
I would further point out to my colleagues that the project must meet tough fiscal and engineering tests, besides complying strictly with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The latter requirement involves full consultation with the International Joint Commission in order to address potential concerns of the Government of Canada. 
Finally, let me emphasize that the appropriation for an outlet bars the use of these funds to build an inlet to Devils Lake. Despite the lingering fears of some interests, neither the FY 1999 appropriations nor the prior appropriations would allow for an inlet. Moreover, pending legislation to revise North Dakota's main water development project, the Garrison Diversion Unit, includes no provision for either an inlet to or an outlet from Devils Lake. This reflects a joint determination by the bi-partisan elected leadership of North Dakota on how to proceed with these projects. 
This FY99 funding bill also addresses another emergency situation near Williston, North Dakota. There again rising waters are threatening to render useless thousands of acres of farmland in the Buford-Trenton project and to displace farmers. The funding provided by the Senate will allow for the purchase of easements which are authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 1996. This is another extremely important project which the Senate has supported at a reasonable level. 
The Subcommittee has added $6 million to the budget request the Garrison Diversion project, in order to meet the federal responsibility for critical water development needs in our state. Let me state that the key to economic development in North Dakota is water development and that the key to water development is the Garrison Diversion project. 
Let me illustrate the importance of this project. Garrison funding will ensure that Indian tribes can provide clean drinking water to tribal members that often have to use some of the worst water in the nation. It will also deliver reliable water supplies for irrigation, industry, and residential use in semi-arid regions of the state and to communities whose normal drinking water looks more like tobacco juice. Moreover, the bill will continue to support environmental enhancements and wildlife habitat by means of such Garrison programs as the Wetlands Trust. 
In a word, the Garrison funding will help to fulfill the federal commitment to develop a major water project in North Dakota to compensate the state for the loss of 500,000 acres of prime farmland. This land was flooded behind the garrison Dam in order to offer flood protection and inexpensive hydro power to states downstream. 
I would also advise my colleagues that North Dakota's elected leaders are working on legislation to revise the Garrison project to meet the state's contemporary water supply needs in a fiscally and environmentally responsible way. The Garrison revision bill will refocus the project to provide municipal, rural and industrial water supplies to regional water systems, Indian reservations, and the Red River Valley while enhancing fish and wildlife habitat. 
Finally, the bill before the Senate has supported funding which will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed on a long-term flood protection plan for the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota on the Red River. Approximately one million dollars included will be used for preparatory studies and planning of the permanent levees to protect the sister cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota that were devastated in the catastrophic floods of 1997. 
My purpose today is to thank the leadership of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, and the Full Committee leadership, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Byrd, for addressing in this bill projects of critical importance to North Dakota. Their leadership is appreciated. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are two lessons that we are learning here today: First, money talks; second, the tobacco companies have money and kids don't. 
We have heard people say this is an issue of taxing and spending. Of course it isn't. They are trying to change the subject. The issue is very simple. When the roll is called, the question is, Who do you stand for? Do you stand for the 
tobacco companies or do you come and stand on the side of kids? If you stand for the tobacco companies, understand this: If enough of you do it, and you prevail, this issue is not over. It is coming back and back and back again, and eventually enough Senators will stand for the interests of kids and the interests of preventing teen smoking in this country. And we will prevail.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would end federal funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, known as NED. 
Last year the Administration asked for $30 million in NED funding, and after a Senate debate on the program, the Congress met that request. This year the Administration has requested $31 million for NED for fiscal year 1999. 
In my view, the time has long since come for Congress to end our subsidy of NED. Let me take a brief moment to explain why. 
NED began back in the early 1980s, during the darkest days of the Cold War, when Solidarity was on the ropes in Poland and a former KGB chief ruled the Soviet Union. As we all know, Solidarity has given birth to political parties that have governed Poland, and Lech Walesa, the Solidarity union leader, was elected Poland's president. The Soviet Union and the KGB are no more, and Russia has a multi-party political system. There is no Warsaw Pact. In fact, the Senate has just decided to admit into NATO some of the countries that NED used to help. 
The historic fall of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the successes of democracy worldwide in the past 15 years should make us wonder whether NED is as necessary now as it was at the height of the Cold War. Democracy is on the march worldwide, most recently perhaps even in Indonesia. Yet the American taxpayer is still coughing up $30 million a year to foot the bill for NED. 
It's also worth noting that when NED started, back during the Cold War, it was supposed to be a public-private partnership. Federal money was supposed to `prime the pump' of private contributions. Private corporations, foundations and philanthropists were supposed to foot much of the bill. But it didn't happen. 
Since 1984 the American taxpayer has spent over $360 million on NED. And according to NED's most recent annual report, in 1996 NED's total revenue was $30.9 million, but its revenue from nonfederal sources was only $585,000. In that year, it took 53 taxpayer dollars to leverage one private dollar contributed to NED. 
These statistics show that NED is a very poor investment for the Federal Government. There is no public-private partnership funding NED. It's the public, the Federal Government, all the way. 
Of course, the Federal Government has some private partners when it comes to spending NED funds. Year after year, NED distributes taxpayer dollars to the same `core grantees.' This is despite the fact that everything we know about good government says that there should be competitive contracting for government work. 
NED isn't one sole-source contract. It isn't just one set-aside. It's four. 
Four private institutions got just over $4 million each in 1996 and 1997. These private groups are: the National Democratic Institute, also known as the Democratic Party; the International Republican Institute, better known as the Republican Party; the Free Trade Union Institute, which is really the AFL-CIO; and the Center for International Private Enterprise, which we all know as the Chamber of Commerce. 
Mr. President, these four `core grantees' get the lion's share of NED funding, year after year. As our former colleague Senator Hank Brown of Colorado said four years ago, `How long does it take for people to realize that what we are doing is not promoting democracy, but promoting these four organizations?' 
What do these four groups do with this money? They use it to send well-connected Democrats and Republicans, and business and labor leaders, around the world. These folks visit various countries and try to promote democracy. 
It sounds fine until you consider that this activity duplicates work done by the United States Information Agency, the Agency for International Development, and the Departments of State, Justice and Defense. In 1996 alone, AID spent $390 million, USIA spent $355 million, and the Defense Department spent $38 million, all to promote democracy. 
There's no reason for another Federal program to achieve this same goal. The American people know that the time is past when we could spend money we didn't have on programs we don't need. 
Last year, I thought that my hope of ending federal funding for the National Endowment for Democracy had come true. The Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill actually zeroed out this program. Let me quote from the Appropriations Committee's report language on this issue: 
The Committee does not recommend funding for fiscal year 1998 for the National Endowment for Democracy. . . . The NED was originally established in 1984 during the days of the cold war as a public-private partnership to promote democratic movements behind the Iron Curtain. Limited U.S. Government funds were viewed as a way to help leverage private contributions and were never envisioned as NED's sole or major source of continuing funds. Since the cold war is over, the Committee believes that the time has come to eliminate Federal funding for this program. 
Unfortunately, the full Senate approved a floor amendment that restored the requested $30 million for the NED. 
So I am here today to call on Senators to accept the dictates of common sense this year, and to accept the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee. We are having great difficulty allocating funding among the different discretionary programs. The Senate is having to make difficult choices about federal spending. We need to determine what is a priority. 
I strongly believe that NED no longer deserves the Senate's support. The Cold War is over, and we have other, more effective ways to promote democracy abroad. I hope that the Senate will act favorably on the bill that I am introducing today, and that we will save the American taxpayer $30 million a year.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico makes a point that I feel strongly about. If we don't finish this product now, if we don't get a tobacco bill completed in the Senate, in my judgment, we probably will never get it done. 
We have come a long, long ways. We are, I think, close. I don't think there is any question but if the tobacco bill were voted on by the full Senate, it would pass. I don't think there is much question about that. 
There are some in the Senate, however, who are intent on trying to kill the legislation. So we have been tied up here in legislative knots, going through some amendments, but going through a process that has led some to conclude that maybe this bill ought to get pulled, maybe we ought to go to something else. 
I ask the Senator from New Mexico, as it was stated this weekend by the majority leader that perhaps we have to move to some other legislation, is it the belief of the Senator from New Mexico that if we don't get this bill completed now, it is likely we will never get this piece of legislation?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield further, I point out that I, and I think a number of others in this Chamber, would resist strongly an attempt to move to some other piece of legislation. That would require a motion to proceed, which obviously some of us would resist strenuously. We think it is important to finish this bill. 
I think that some have missed the point. You go through this process and have a debate. Some have missed the point. 
The point here is about trying to prevent children from smoking in this country and trying to prevent the tobacco industry from targeting kids with their tobacco products. That is not rocket science. We can do that. 
The piece of legislation that is before the Senate is a good piece of legislation which has a series of things in it which are very important--smoking cessation programs, counteradvertising programs, prohibitions against advertising in ways that will target children, getting rid of vending machines in areas where children have access to cigarettes--a whole series of things that try to make certain that in the future we will not have the tobacco industry able to target kids to addict them to cigarettes. 
We know every day 3,000 kids start smoking in this country. We know 1,000 of those 3,000 will die. We know 300,000 to 400,000 people in this country die every year from smoking and smoking-related causes. We also know that smoking cigarettes and the use of tobacco products is legal for adults and will always remain legal. No one is suggesting that it be illegal. But we are saying with this piece of legislation that we ought not have a tobacco industry get its new customers from teenagers. 
I read yesterday and the day before a whole series of statements we have now unearthed from the bowels of the tobacco companies which demonstrate that they understood that their customers are teenagers, their future customers come from teenagers. If you don't get them when they are young, you don't get them. The industry's own documents suggest that--that if you don't get them when they are kids, almost never will they reach age 30 and try to evaluate, What am I missing from life? come up with the idea they are missing smoking, and go out and start getting addicted to cigarettes. That almost never happens. 
I say to the Senator from New Mexico, and I ask him this question, it seems to me we have kind of lost our way here on this bill as it has been on the floor of the Senate for some weeks now. It seems to me that we have, through amendments, gone zigzagging across the landscape here and forgotten what the central premise of this piece of legislation is; that the central premise, is it not, is to try to make certain that we are not having an industry targeting our kids to smoke, and also providing a whole series of steps--smoking cessation programs, investment in health research, counteradvertising, and a range of other things--to try to make sure that will not happen in the future; is that not the case?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take another minute or so of my time. I know the Senator from Kansas wishes to seek the floor. 
Virtually everything we do represents a series of choices. We have a choice now here in the Senate; we can choose to succeed, or we can choose to fail on this tobacco legislation. As Senator Conrad has indicated, we have come a long way, and we have had people all along the way who are detractors. I can remember how controversial it was just to put a warning label on the side of a pack of cigarettes. Do you remember how controversial that was? It was the right thing to do, obviously. Would someone vote now to take the warning label off? I don't think so. 
The legislation before the Senate is very important. We as Senators and as a body can choose to succeed or fail. To those who want to choose to fail and say this bill cannot become law, we are going to pull the bill and go to something else, we simply want to say that some of us will resist that with great effort. We will resist every decision to move to other legislation before we complete work on this legislation. We hope the bipartisan leadership of the Senate will decide that this bill is important enough to finish, and it can be finished, in my judgment, this week or next week. We have traveled too far a distance on this to fail in the final week on a piece of legislation this important to our country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago a couple of Members of Congress came to the floor of the Congress to announce Bob Hope's death. Bob Hope was having breakfast in California at the time. This weekend, we had some legislators talking about the tobacco bill and predicting that the tobacco bill was dead. Well, the tobacco bill, or the tobacco legislation, that is being debated by the U.S. Senate is not exactly having breakfast--clearly, this has been a struggle to get a piece of legislation through the Senate dealing with the tobacco issue--but, the tobacco bill is not dead by any means. I hope that those who tell the American people that the Senate cannot pass a tobacco bill will understand that the Senate fully intends to pass legislation dealing with tobacco. 
I want to describe just for a moment why I think those who predict its death are wrong, and why those who call this a bad bill are wrong, and why those who believe that Congress will eventually not act on tobacco are wrong. 
Let me go back to the start of this issue. Why are we debating a tobacco bill? Why tobacco legislation? Simply put, it is because we now know things we did not know 25, 50, and 100 years ago about tobacco. We know that tobacco can kill you. The use of tobacco, we know, causes from 300,000 to 400,000 Americans a year to die from smoking and smoking-related causes. 
Tobacco is a legal product and will remain a legal product. But we also know that it is illegal for kids to smoke, and we know that tobacco companies have targeted our children to addict them to nicotine. 
The majority leader this weekend said, `Well, the tobacco bill is so bad that it should not be passed in its current form,' and so on and so forth, and `If we can't get to a conclusion on it this week, we've got to move on.' That is another way of saying, `We're going to leave this carcass in the middle of the road and just drive forward.' 
Fortunately, we learn a lot as we go along here in this country and in life. One of the things we ought to learn is, this piece of legislation dealing with tobacco, and especially dealing with the tobacco industry targeting America's children--we must resolve this issue; we must pass this legislation. 
Let me describe for my colleagues some of the evidence that has been unearthed from depositions and from court suits, and so on, in recent months. 
A 1972 document by a tobacco company, Brown & Williamson. It says: 
It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered. 
Talking about sweetening cigarettes because teenagers like sweeter products--does that sound like a company that is interested in addicting kids to their product? 
How about Kool--the cigarette Kool? 
KOOL has shown little or no growth in share of users in the 26 [and up] age group. 
This was written by a Brown & Williamson person. It is a memo from 1973. It says: 
. . . at the present rate, a smoker in the 16-25 year age group will soon be three times as important to KOOL as a prospect in any other . . . age category. 
Talking about their 16-year-old customers for Kool cigarettes. 
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . . 
This is according to a report by a Philip Morris researcher. 
You say that they are not targeting kids? 
1974, R.J. Reynolds. A marketing plan submitted to the board of directors of the company says: 
As this 14-24 age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume--[in the] next 25 years. 
Or if you are still unconvinced--that there is no need here; that the industry has not targeted our children--how about a Lorillard executive, a cigarette company executive, in 1978:  
The base of our business is the high-school student. 
A cigarette company executive saying, `The base of our business is the high-school student.' 
Philip Morris, 1979, says: 
Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger category, capturing over 50 percent of this market. 
It is like they should have a fiesta here. They capture over 50 percent of the 17-year-old and under market. And you say the industry isn't targeting kids? 
Well, cigarette smoking is addictive. It is legal but addictive. 
Here is something that was picked up this morning. It is actually a piece from Marlboro. It talks about river rafting, cookouts, fly-fishing, bonfires, mountain biking, and bands. And it is advertising, of course, cigarettes. It has the warning, as we require by law, `Surgeon General's warning: Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.' 
The question for the Congress is: Do we want an industry to try to addict our children to this product? And the answer is no. And if not, if we do not want the industry to continue to do that--and they have in the past; the evidence is quite clear--if we do not want them to continue to do that, if it is our position that it is wrong for the industry to target children--and that is our position--then the question is, What are we going to do about that? Is the Congress going to pass a piece of legislation that prohibits this industry from targeting our children? And that is the legislation that is on the floor of the Senate. 
Some do not like it; and some, for their own reasons, want to kill it. But they will be on the wrong side of history if they succeed in killing this legislation. 
Oh, we have done a lot of things over the years that were controversial at the time we did them. Even things like giving women the right to vote in this country was controversial, wasn't it? For more than half of this country's history, women were not allowed to vote. Or skip forward to the Civil Rights Act of the early 1960s. Who in this Chamber now would decide that the things that we provided for in the Civil Rights Act in the early 1960s they would now support? 
A good number of them opposed it back then. 
Things like requiring labels on food--that was controversial. Requiring companies that produce our food in the grocery store to actually put something on the label that states the fat content, the sodium content, or the carbohydrates--that was big government intruding on those who manufacture the food. How could we require that someone put on the can of peas what is in that can of peas? We did it. 
Now you can go down the grocery store aisle and see traffic jams of people, taking that can or package, and trying to figure out what is in it, how much fat it contains, how much sodium is in a product. It was controversial at the time. 
A lot of things that were controversial at the time turned out to have been the right thing. The tobacco bill will turn out to be the right piece of legislation for this country. 
How many in this Chamber who spend a lot of time on airplanes remember, going back 10 or 20 years, getting in the middle seat of a 727 and as the airplane takes off, the person in the seats on the right-hand side and the left-hand side light up their cigarettes. Because then there were no restrictions on smoking anywhere on airplanes? Eventually they put the smokers in the back of the plane. That meant everybody breathed the same smoke, although they were separated by distance. Then, finally, you shall not smoke on airplanes in this country. It was controversial at the time. I voted for that. It was the right thing to do. 
This piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate talks of a range of issues, most especially the issue of teen smoking. In an industry that knows the only customers it has access to are kids--because almost no one reaches adult age in this country and tries to figure out what they have missed in life and comes up with the idea of smoking; nobody 30 or 40 years old says what will really enrich my life is if I started smoking--kids are the only source of new customers for tobacco companies. The tobacco companies say it themselves in the research material we have provided. 
This legislation provides a range of programs, including providing smoking cessation programs, trying to help people who are now addicted to quit; prohibits advertising that targets our children; provides for counteradvertising, that actually tells our kids that smoking is not cool and that smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and so on. 
The resources in this bill help us invest in the National Institutes of Health to continue to develop the breathtaking achievements in medical research that we see day after day and month after month in the National Institutes of Health. It seems to me this is a remarkable bargain for the American people. 
This legislation, I think viewed 10 years from now, will be seen as something that was right for the time. Ten years from now, those who vote against this legislation will say, `How on Earth did I ever come to that conclusion?' Of course it made sense for us as a country to decide cigarette companies cannot target our children. Of course it made sense for us to have counteradvertising and smoking cessation programs and more investment in the National Institutes of Health to deal with the range of medical problems caused by smoking. Of course that made sense. 
So let me conclude by saying that those who this weekend were on the talk shows and were speaking to the press about what will happen to this tobacco bill, they have prematurely announced its death. This tobacco bill is not dead. There are some who wish it were dead. There are some who this week will work against it and will try with every bit of energy they have to kill it, but they will not succeed because this is the right thing to do. We have made the case effectively that at this time in this country we ought not allow the tobacco industry to target our kids to the addiction of cigarettes. This piece of legislation moves us in that direction in a very, very significant way. 
The majority leader and others who speak about this legislation need now, I think, to provide some leadership to help 
us pass this legislation. A bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator McCain, who has spent a great deal of time on this legislation and someone for whom I have great admiration and I commend him for his work, Senator Conrad on our side and others, a great many people have spent a lot of time crafting this in a bipartisan way. Now we need this week to finish a job and pass it through the Senate and get it to a conference with the House so that the American people can look at the job the Congress has done. And then make the judgment that they have done a good job on behalf of our children, they have stood up for our children and have told an industry that addicted our children, you can't do that anymore; we are not going to let you do that anymore. That is the right position for our country. 
I know that the Senator from Rhode Island is about to talk about an amendment, I think, that he has pending in the Senate. Let me, as I conclude, also commend him for the work he has done. The Senator from Rhode Island, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and a number of others have worked a great deal on this legislation, including the Senator from Massachusetts, and I mentioned the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. 
This is a tough piece of legislation. The toughest thing in the world is to propose. The easiest thing in the world is to oppose. It doesn't take any skill to oppose. I think it was Mark Twain who once was asked if he would be involved in a debate and he immediately accepted, `provided I can take the opposing side.' They said, `You don't even know the subject of the debate,' and he says, `I don't have to, as long as I am on the opposing side.' 
It takes no time to prepare. We are proposing a piece of legislation in the Senate dealing with smoking, tobacco and children that is right for the time. Those who stand in its way will be on the wrong side of history. Those who predict its death are dead wrong, because we fully aim, this week or next week, to pass this legislation through the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am interested to see that at a time when the tobacco bill is on the floor of the Senate, we are debating the marriage tax penalty. It is unique, I suppose, that in the U.S. Senate one does not have to talk about the subject that is on the Senate floor at that time. We experienced, earlier in this session, the majority leader bringing to the floor a piece of legislation which created a parliamentary situation where no one could offer any other amendments except those he would prefer to have offered because he was afraid someone on this side of the political aisle would offer an amendment not related to the subject. So we had a legislative logjam on a number of pieces of legislation. That was his right, and I complained about it at the time. And at the same time, the majority leader was complaining that somebody might offer an amendment that had nothing to do with the bill on the floor of the Senate. 
Well, here we are. We have a tobacco bill on the floor of the Senate and what have we been talking about now for a number of days? The marriage tax penalty. We had a tax bill on the floor of the Senate some long while ago and we debated that. But now, on the tobacco bill, we are talking about the marriage tax penalty. 
I don't think the Senator from Texas will get anybody to swallow the bait here that a marriage tax penalty is justifiable. The Congress has worked on the marriage tax penalty attempting to fix it, to reduce it, to abolish it, and to otherwise change it for a long, long time. Long after this debate is over, there will be discussion about this so-called marriage tax penalty. Should it be abolished, should it be fixed? Of course, it should. Easier said than done, but we ought to do it. 
But we are now on a tobacco bill. I bring this discussion back to the reason that we have a bill on the floor of the Senate dealing with tobacco. I want to read again, for some of my colleagues and those who are interested, what persuades those of us in the Senate who support this tobacco legislation and think this legislation is necessary. 
I was on the Senate Commerce Committee when we passed the legislation out of the committee. I voted for it, and I supported it. Senator McCain was the principal author of the bill, and Senator Conrad, my colleague from North Dakota, has also written a piece of legislation which found its way, or at least in large part, into the McCain legislation. I compliment both of them, and others, including the Senator from Massachusetts, and a number of others who have worked hard on this legislation. 
But why tobacco legislation? Because many of us believe that it is inappropriate in this country to allow the tobacco industry to continue to try to addict America's children to nicotine. Some say, `Well, gee, that is not what has been happening.' Of course it has been happening. Several court cases have now unearthed the memoranda and the information from the bowels of the tobacco companies that they didn't want to disclose but were required to disclose. This information showed exactly what their strategies were in recent decades to try to addict America's children to tobacco. 
Almost no one reaches adult age and discovers that what we really wanted to do and have failed to do is start smoking. Does anybody know a thoughtful adult who scratches their head and says, `Gosh, what have I missed in life? I know what it is. I need to start smoking. That is what I am missing. That is what will enrich my life.' Did you ever hear of anybody doing that? I don't think so. The only way you get new smokers is to get kids to smoke. 
On Friday, I described for my colleagues some of the data and the memoranda that were in the files of the tobacco companies. I want to read some of them again, because I want us to be talking about the subject of tobacco on the floor of the Senate. 
But why do we want to do something to tell the tobacco industry they can't addict America's children to nicotine when it is legal to smoke, and it will always be legal to smoke. It is an adult choice. But it is not legal, and ought not be legal nor morally defensible for anyone to say we are going to try to addict 15-year-old kids, or 13-year-old kids, to our cigarettes in the name of profit. 
So let me proceed to describe some of the documents, that we have unearthed in various court cases and elsewhere, that describe what the tobacco industry has done. At the end of that, I will ask my colleagues if they think this behavior is defensible. If you don't, then we ought to pass this kind of legislation and stop talking about other subjects. 
In 1972, Brown & Williamson, a tobacco company: `It is a well known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered.' 
In 1972, they are talking about adding honey to cigarettes. Why? Because kids like sweet products. Does that sound like a company that is trying to addict kids to cigarettes? It does to me. 
In 1973, RJR, a tobacco company, says: `Comic strip type of copy might get a much higher readership among younger people than another type of copy.' 
They are talking about advertising. Does this sound like a cigarette company that is interested in trying to get kids to smoke? It does to me. 
In 1973, Brown & Williamson: `Kool'-- 
This is a quote. The cigarette brand Kool:  
Kool has shown little or no growth in the share of the users in the 26 and up age group. Growth is from 16- to 25-year-olds. At the present rate, a smoker in the 16- to 25-year-old age group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad age category. 
This is a company that is talking about 16-year-olds and how attractive it is that 16-year-olds are using their cigarettes. 
Philip Morris, 1974: `We are not sure that anything can be done to halt a major exodus if one gets going among the young.' 
`This group'--now speaking to the young, according to Philip Morris--`follows the crowd, and we don't pretend to know what gets them going from one thing or another. Certainly Philip Morris should continue efforts for Marlboro in the youth market.' 
Is this a company looking at selling cigarettes to kids? I think so. 
In 1974, R.J. Reynolds, they write, speaking of kids: `They represent tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14- to 24-age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total 
cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years.' 
This is a company talking about the 14-year-old smoker. 
In 1975, a researcher for Philip Morris writes: `Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers 15 to 19 years old. My own data, which includes younger teenagers, even shows higher Marlboro market penetration among 15- to 17-year-olds.' 
Does anybody who reads believe after reading this that the tobacco companies weren't vitally interested in selling cigarettes to these kids? Of course they were. 
In 1975, RJR-Nabisco talks about increasing penetration among the 14- to 24-year-olds: `Evidence is now available to indicate the 14- to 18-year-old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR Tobacco must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained.' 
In 1976, that is RJR saying about 14- to 18-year-olds that we have got to get a new cigarette out there to attract these people if we are going to retain our position. 
In 1978, the Lorillard Cigarette Company said the following: `The base of our business is the high school student.' 
`The base of our business is the high school student!' This from a tobacco company. 
In 1979: `Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger category capturing over 50 percent of the market,' Philip Morris writes proudly. 
In the name of profit, they say: Our cigarettes dominated the 17-year and younger category. We capture over 50 percent of the market. 
They make it sound like a county fair, don't they? A blue ribbon--a fat steer gets a blue ribbon. We were able to get 15-, 16-, and 17-year-old kids to smoke. We win. 
Now tell me that this industry doesn't target young kids to smoke. 
Marlboro Red, a derivative of Marlboro, I guess--I have not seen a Marlboro Red cigarette. But a Marlboro Red in 1981, a Philip Morris researcher writes: `The overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while in their teens. At least part of the success of our Marlboro Red during its most rapid growth period was because it became the brand of choice among teenagers who then stuck with it.' 
I think maybe `stuck with it' is a misnomer. I think maybe `who were addicted to it' rather than `stuck with it.' The whole purpose, of course, is you attract a 15-year-old to start smoking and you have got a customer for life. 
Smoking is legal in this country, and it will always be legal. Adults have the right to make the choice to smoke. Three hundred thousand to four hundred thousand people a year die in this country from choosing to smoke, from smoking and smoking-related causes. Three hundred thousand to four hundred thousand people a year die from having made that choice. You have heard the statistics: every day, 3,000 kids will start to smoke; 1,000 of them will die from having made that choice. 
The question for us is, will we as a country continue to sit on our hands and say to the tobacco industry, `It is all right, we understand your future customers are our children; it is all right, our sons and daughters are available to be a marketing target for you? Should it be all right to say that you can advertise to them; you can make pitches to them; you can provide all kinds of subtle approaches to our kids that smoking is cool, smoking is something you ought to do, smoking tastes good, smoking feels good, your peers smoke so you ought to smoke'? Is that something this country wants? Is that something this country is going to allow to continue? I don't think so. 
Let me continue. 
The tobacco industry in 1983, says Brown & Williamson, will not support a youth smoking program which discourages young people from smoking. In 1983, you heard all of the references that I used about the pitches that were made by the industry to the children and the importance they placed in having those children as their customer base. 
And then in 1983 they say this tobacco company `will not support a youth smoking program which discourages young people from smoking.' 
Well, I guess that is because they knew who their customers were. They knew where their future profits would come from. 
`Strategies and Opportunities,' a memorandum, 1984, from R.J. Reynolds, and I quote:  
Younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last 50 years. They will continue to be just as important to brands [and] companies in the future for two simple reasons: The renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-old smokers. No more than 5 percent of smokers start after age 24. . . . Younger adult smokers are the only source of replacement smokers. . . . If younger adults turn away from smoking, the industry must decline, just as a population which does not give birth will eventually dwindle. 
Let me read again what the tobacco industry understood. 
No more than 5 percent of the smokers start after the age 24. 
If you don't get them when they are kids, you are not likely to get them. If you don't addict someone in childhood to nicotine, you are not likely to be able to addict them when they become adults. 
In 1986, R.J. Reynolds--they were talking about their advertising for Camels: 
[Camel advertising will create] the perception that Camel smokers are non-conformist, self-confident, and [they] project a cool attitude, which is admired by their peers. . . . [They aspire] to be perceived as cool [and] a member of the in-group is one of the strongest influences affecting the behavior of [young adults]. 
It is pretty clear. And this is just a smidgeon of the evidence that has come from the tobacco industry about what they have been doing over the years to appeal to a customer base coming from our children. 
Now, they have always insisted they have not been doing this. In fact, until a couple of years ago the CEOs of tobacco companies insisted that nicotine was not addictive. Nicotine was not addictive. They are the last Americans, apparently, to be willing to testify under oath that nicotine was not addictive. But, of course, now most of them admit they understand nicotine is addictive. And we raised the question in a piece of tobacco legislation whether this country wants to continue to countenance this behavior. Smoking is legal, but should we allow tobacco companies to target children to become addicted to nicotine? The answer clearly ought to be no, and the answer ought to be delivered with some urgency on the floor of the Senate. 
We have a tobacco bill that was brought to the floor of the Senate which had a number of very important goals, the most important of which, in my judgment, was to interrupt, intercept, and stop the tobacco industry from appealing to our children. Among other things, it will raise the price of a pack of cigarettes. But what will happen as a result of that price increase and the revenue that comes from it will be a range of programs such as smoking cessation programs, so that those who are now addicted to cigarettes and want to get off of that addiction will have the opportunity, the resources, and the wherewithal to do that. 
Also, the bill had a prohibition on advertising directed at children and a prohibition on vending machines in areas that are available to children. The smoking cessation programs will be supplemented by counteradvertising programs. Counteradvertising programs that tell America's children that smoking does not make sense, smoking can injure your health, smoking can cause death, smoking is a contributing factor to causing heart disease and cancer and more. Counteradvertising will be very helpful, it seems to me, to warn kids away from cigarettes. 
Additionally, the resources will be used to invest in the 
National Institutes of Health where research occurs every single day to try to respond to the health consequences of not just the addiction to cigarettes, but cancer and heart disease, and a range of other problems as well. I cannot think of anything that gives me more pride than to decide that we are going to take substantial new resources and invest them in the National Institutes of Health which will result in exciting, wonderful, and breathtaking new changes in health care and medicines. 
That is the subject for the Senate: Do we want to stop the tobacco industry from trying to addict our children? Do we want to put together an approach that does all of these things, counteradvertising, smoking cessation, investment in the National Institutes of Health, and a whole range of things? I think most people would say, absolutely, this legislation makes a great deal of sense? 
And so the bill comes to the floor of the Senate, and to describe the pace in the Senate as a glacial pace is to describe a condition of speeding. I mean, glacial doesn't begin to describe the pace of the Senate when we have a bunch of people who are determined to slow something down. Glaciers at least move forward by inches. You bring a tobacco bill to the floor of the Senate and then we have somebody who wants to speak for 46 hours on the Tax Code. Well, God love them, they have every right under the rules of the Senate to talk about whatever they want. We could talk about almost anything that anybody wants to come and talk about on the floor of the Senate, and so today we are talking about the marriage tax penalty. 
The Tax Code is a fascinating subject, and if ever there was anything in need of reform it is America's Tax Code. It seems to me that there is a time and a place for us to work together in a thoughtful way to reform the Tax Code, to fix the marriage penalty, and to do a whole range of other things that decrease its complexity, make the code much more understandable, and much fairer. But I wonder if we ought not keep our eye on the ball this afternoon and see if we can't pass the tobacco bill, see if we can't do what this piece of legislation that we designed will do, and that includes the five or six steps I have just described. 
If one thinks they are unimportant, I suppose you can conceive of a dozen other things that you want to do to change the subject. We could have a discussion, I suppose, this afternoon about the space station. Gee, that is a controversial subject. You could have an amendment here and we could debate the space station for the next 4 or 5 hours. Or we could have a discussion about the nutrition of canned soup from the grocery store shelves or our trade problems with Australia. 
There is no end to the subjects if somebody wants to change the subject. There is no end to the other things to ruminate about or talk about if one doesn't like the subject of this bill, which is producing a piece of legislation that deals with the tobacco issue the way I have just described it. 
Let me go back to where I started. After having read the evidence and information that comes from the files of the tobacco industry, if anyone does not yet believe that these companies were targeting children because they knew the only opportunity for them to profit in the future would be to get a customer base among young people, if anyone doesn't yet believe that, they are not prepared to believe anything about this subject. 
The evidence is clear. It is not debatable. It is in black and white. The industry didn't want to give it up. They were forced to. And this country now should make a decision: is this behavior tolerable or should we stop it? I hope at every desk of this Senate when the roll is called and the Senator is named, I hope they would stand up and say that we ought to stop it. No company in this country has the right to try to attract a 14-year-old son or daughter in an American family to become addicted to tobacco. No company has that right. Tobacco is a legal product for those age 21 or over. It ought not be right for any company to try to addict our children to tobacco. 
That is what this is all about. It is not about the marriage tax penalty. It is not about the space program. It is not about Food for Peace. It is not about the Food Stamp Program. It is not about any of that. It is about the tobacco issue. 
I am as patient as anybody. I can be here 2 weeks from now and we can be talking about new discoveries in the habits of earthworms or whatever it is somebody wants to talk about 2 weeks from now. 
But in the end, this Congress will have to deal with this bill. Are we going to pass a tobacco bill? And to those who do not want to pass it, those who do not want to vote for it, I would say: Just give it your best shot and then stand up and vote against it. If you don't like it, vote against it. But don't thwart the will of the American people to pass legislation that will stop the tobacco companies from addicting our children. Don't do that. You will be on the wrong side of history on this question. 
Ten years from now, 5 years from now, you will look back at that vote, you will look back at this debate, and you will have to ask yourself, if you vote the wrong way--How on Earth could I have been so out of step with common sense? How on Earth could I have been so out of step with what this country needed to have done at that time? 
I notice my colleague from North Dakota is on his feet, waiting patiently to speak. I have only 25 more minutes--I am, of course, only kidding. Senator Conrad from North Dakota has been a principal author of a piece of legislation that has become a part of the bill that is now on the floor of the Senate. I mentioned the role that Senator McCain and Senator Conrad and others have played. I think it has been very important. I know there are people outside this Chamber who watch this debate and whose teeth you can hear gritting a mile away, they are so upset about what is going on here. Tough luck. Just tough luck. Times have changed. 
With Senator Conrad's help and Senator McCain's help and the help of others who have done, I think, remarkable work on this kind of legislation, we will in the end--whether the opponents like it or not--pass this tobacco bill. There will be enormous pressure on the House of Representatives to pass a similar piece of legislation. We will have a conference. I predict we will have a new law in this country before the end of this session of Congress that does something that we can be proud of and should be proud of on behalf of our children. 
So as I yield the floor, let me compliment my colleague, Senator Conrad, for the work he has done for so many months on this legislation. And, as I do, let me also pay a compliment to the chairman of the committee on which I serve, Senator McCain, who similarly has done some wonderful work on this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator Reid and I are introducing legislation to help address a number of budgetary excesses and accountability lapses at the Federal Reserve Board. 
When the General Accounting Office (GAO) released its comprehensive and historic report about the management of the Federal Reserve system--which took over two years to assemble --we learned about disturbing financial practices and management failures within the Federal Reserve system. The report is packed with examples of where the Fed could substantially trim costs, and it makes specific recommendations for changes in Fed operations. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve dismissed most of the GAO's recommendations as irrelevant or unnecessary. 
The GAO report shows that during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Federal Reserve expenditures jumped by twice the rate of inflation, while the rest of the federal government has been downsizing. This runaway spending is remarkable given Chairman Greenspan's advice about the need for belt-tightening in the rest of government. 
The gold-plated hood ornament of the Federal Reserve System's questionable practices is, in my judgment, its huge cash surplus account that's funded with billions of dollars in taxpayer money to protect against losses, despite the fact that the Fed hasn't suffered a loss for more than 80 consecutive years. When the GAO's report was released a couple of years ago, the Fed had squirreled away some $3.7 billion into the surplus account, which was up some 79% from its level in the late 1980s. Now the Fed has increased the surplus account by another 40% to about $5.2 billion--even though the GAO concluded that `it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will ever incur sufficient annual losses such that it would be required to use any funds in the surplus account.' 
Our bill, the `Federal Reserve Fiscal Accountability Act of 1998,' includes many of the changes recommended by the GAO. It would do the following: 
First, the Federal Reserve is required to immediately return to the general fund of the federal Treasury the $5.2 billion of taxpayer's money that has unnecessarily accumulated in the Fed's surplus fund. In addition, the bill asks the GAO to determine the extent to which the Fed's future net earnings should be transferred to the federal Treasury each year. 
Second, the GAO, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, will identify and report to Congress a list of the Federal Reserve System activities that are not related to the making of monetary policy. After the report is completed, all non-monetary policy expenditures, as identified by the GAO, would be subject to the congressional appropriations process. 
We do not intend to inject politics into monetary policy with this provision. However, over 90 percent of the Fed's operations have nothing to do with interest rate policy according to the GAO. And there is simply no good reason why the Fed's non-monetary expenditures are immune from the same kind of oversight and review required of other federal agencies. 
Third, the regional Federal Reserve banks and the Board of Governors will be subjected to annual independent audits. This provision merely codifies what the Federal Reserve has been doing for the most part in recent practice. The detection of any possible illegal acts must be reported to the Comptroller General. 
Fourth, the Federal Reserve will be required to follow the same procurement and contracting rules that apply to other federal agencies. These rules should help to prevent the examples of favoritism highlighted in the GAO report and increase competition among contract bidders with the Fed. This requirement ought to substantially reduce procurement costs on a system-wide basis. 
Finally, we've made some changes to require the Fed to compete more fairly with the private sector in providing a variety of payment system services, such as check clearing and transportation to banks and other financial institutions. 
I invite my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this much-needed legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak just for a moment about the Patients' Bill of Rights that we have introduced in the Senate and that many of us in the Senate hope can be considered on an expeditious basis by the U.S. Senate. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights is a piece of legislation designed to address some of the concerns we have about managed care. In many instances, health plans are denying patients the right to know all of the treatment options available for their not just the cheapest treatments available. The Patients' Bill of Rights would guarantee that right, along with the opportunity to understand your rights with respect to emergency care and a range of other rights that we believe should be inherent. 
I want to tell the Senate another story, as we have done almost every day the Senate has been in session, that describes, again, the urgent need for passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
This is about a young woman named Paige Lancaster from Stafford, VA. In 1991, when Paige Lancaster was 11 years old, her mother took her to see her HMO pediatrician because she had complained of nausea and severe daily headaches for some long while. 
For the next 4 years, Paige repeatedly sought medical treatment for headaches from two other HMO pediatricians available. They prescribed adult-strength narcotics but never once consulted with a neurologist nor did they recommend during all this time an MRI, CAT scan, EEG, or any other diagnostic test, for that matter, to diagnose Paige's condition. 
Then in 1996, Paige's school counselor worried about this young girl's deteriorating high school performance. She recommended to the doctors that they perform some diagnostic tests to determine the cause of this young lady's debilitating symptoms. 
Mr. President, 4 1/2 years after the first visit by this child complaining of severe headaches, the doctors finally ordered an EEG and an MRI. The MRI revealed a massive right frontal tumor and cystic mass that had infiltrated over 40 percent of her brain. One week later, Paige underwent surgery to remove the tumor. However, the surgery was unsuccessful because of the tumor's size and maturity. Paige then underwent a second and third surgery and radiation therapy, and she is, we are told, likely to require additional surgery and ongoing intensive care. 
What is so outrageous about this case is that the HMO covering Paige had in place a financial incentive program under which her physicians would receive bonuses for avoiding excessive treatments and tests. 
This is not something new. We know of managed care organizations in which the contracts with the physicians require that, if a patient of the physician shows up in an emergency room, the cost of that emergency treatment comes out of the payment to the physician--an unholy circumstance, in my judgment, because it creates exactly the wrong kind of incentive for physicians. 
In this case there is the same kind of incentive in reverse. The HMO had in place a financial incentive under which physicians would receive bonuses for avoiding excessive treatments and tests. Clearly, physicians should not prescribe excessive treatments and tests, but, just as clearly, physicians should not have to consider their own financial circumstances when determining whether they should prescribe a test. 
The Lancasters, Paige's parents, challenged the HMO's handling of Paige's case, but, unfortunately for them, the insurance for their children was provided by Mr. Lancaster's employer and was subject to something called ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Under ERISA, the only available remedy to the 
patient is the cost of the benefit denied, in this case the $800 cost of the MRI. In other words, under ERISA, the HMO cannot be sued. The piece of legislation that we have proposed in the U.S. Senate, the Patients' Bill of Rights, would hold HMOs accountable by allowing patients to sue when their HMO's coverage, or lack of it, has caused them harm. The bill will also require HMOs to disclose any financial incentives that might cause the HMO doctors to skimp on patient care. Any incentives that exist between the HMO and the doctor must be disclosed to the patients. 
This young girl, Paige Lancaster, waited nearly 5 years for a diagnosis, one might argue, in part, because the wrong incentives existed between an HMO and a doctor. The incentives were about saving money rather than providing quality health care. 
We very much hope we can get back to the notion in this country that practicing medicine ought to be done in doctor's offices and hospitals, not in the office of some insurance company accountant 500 or 1,000 miles away. It is our hope that we will be able to bring to the floor of the Senate the Patients' Bill of Rights because we think this country needs it. We hope the Senate can debate it and pass it in the coming weeks. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I spoke 2 weeks ago on a subject that I care deeply about. I want to just make a couple of additional points about it, and that is this orgy of mergers that is occurring in America today. You can't wake up and take a look at the business section of any newspaper in the country without seeing another big megamerger announcement. 
I come from, I believe, the Jeffersonian side of my party and share very deeply the notion that the broad-based political freedoms in this country are nurtured by broad-based economic freedom. Broad-based economic freedom comes from dotting the landscape all across this country with individual entrepreneurs, businesses, broadly based and owned businesses all across this country. That represents the free enterprise system, people having dreams and hopes and starting a business and nurturing this business. 
It doesn't mean to say that big is always bad or that small is always beautiful. It is just to say this country works best, our free enterprise system works best and the market system works best when this is not dominated by enterprises that choke competition. We have decided in law a long, long while ago those that are choking down competition and trying to clog the arteries of the marketplace are violating the law. There is precious little enforcement these days. Antitrust activities are kind of out of favor. But we are seeing an alarming growth of mergers in this country. 
As I start, let me again say not every merger is bad. I am not here to say that. There are times when the mergers of a couple companies make sense. But what is happening now is a wave of mergers that ought to be alarming to this country. Former Senator Hart, Phil Hart from the State of Michigan, did a lot of work on this issue. There is a building named after him here on Capitol Hill. He is probably the last person in Congress to talk much 
about merger activity and antitrust enforcement. It is not sexy and it does not win any friends. But it does lose friends. 
Let me describe what happens. This chart shows merger completions in the last 15 years. Take a look at the exponential growth of mergers. This merger mania means you have fewer enterprises. They are buying each other, merging, some hostile takeovers, and two become one. It is like getting married. You have two people that court each other; you have two companies that court each other and they get married. You read it in the paper, but you don't even know they are dating. Sometimes it is a forced marriage as the case with hostile takeovers. 
Here on this chart are all the marriages going on in corporate America--two become one. The railroad industry--we used to have a lot of railroads. Now we have a very few railroads. They tell us what they are going to haul and how they are going to haul it. If you don't like it, tough luck. The airline industry--we used to have a lot of airlines in this country. Now we have a few. They have retreated into regional hubs and dominate the hub and say here is where we will fly and here is what it will cost. If you don't like it, go buy a jet. The telecommunications industry--you talk about what is happening in telecommunications. All of these big telecommunications companies are looking around for suitors to find out who they can romance and who they can add to their collection. Pretty soon, ten companies become five and five become one. We have Baby Bells--they are not so baby anymore. Now they are getting married. So there are fewer Baby Bells because they are combining. 
Let me just go through a couple of other charts to describe this circumstance. Here we have the value of merger activity in this country. In 1998, $1.7 trillion. It is moving up exponentially. Those who say that we believe in the free enterprise system, those who say that the market system is critically important to the success of this country ought to be concerned about this. 
Let me show a chart briefly with respect to the largest mergers. I showed this 2 weeks ago and it has since changed because we had a chemical company and a pharmaceutical company that started dating and then they decided to announce they were getting married--Monsanto and American Home Products. On this chart are the 25 largest corporate U.S. mergers through June 2, 1998. Seventy billion, CitiCorp wants to join with Travelers Group. Fifty-nine billion, BankAmerica wants to join with National Bank. 
While I am speaking about it, the banks, they of course, are a go-go industry with respect to mergers. Last year, there were 599 bank mergers. The biggest banks are merging as quickly as you can open your paper these days. About 75 percent of the domestic banking assets are held by 100 of the largest banks. The Federal Reserve Board has a policy. In fact, if you are big enough, they call it `too big to fail.' If you are big enough, you are never going to be allowed to fail because the consequences of the failure would be too detrimental to the country. There used to be 11 too-big-to-fail banks. Eleven is now 21 because all the big banks are getting bigger. So the next merger you see with one of those banks, there is no risk to them. They can't fail. The American taxpayer has to pay the risk of a merger that turns sour. 
Small community banks especially understand this problem. Let me talk about the testimony of the president of the Independent Bankers Association of America. He says `The evidence shows that increased concentration in banking has not benefited bank customers.' He adds that `larger banks charge higher fees, bank mergers have an adverse effect on consumer deposit prices, and small business lending receives a short shrift in a world of ever-larger banks.' 
Banks are just one area. I just stop to say that if you take a look at this list, it is banks, railroads, telecommunications companies, defense companies. Frankly, I think it is alarming. I think Congress ought to pay some attention to this. 
I represent a lot of farmers. Family farmers aren't merging. They are out there fueling up a tractor, trying to plow in seeds, hoping to get a crop. But when they market, they market back up through the neck of the bottle. If they market meat, if they are raising a cow and are going to market the meat from the cow. In 1980 the big four packing plants had 36 percent of the market. In 1994, the big four meatpacking plants in this country had 82 percent of the market. This means that if you are a farmer trying to market up through the neck of that bottle, the products of meat--in this case perhaps pork or beef--you are discovering that you are marketing up towards a monopoly. On the top they tell you what they will pay you for it. The same is true for the grain farmer. 
My point is it doesn't matter whether you are on Main Street or running a family farm. If you are operating in an economy in which big interests are clogging the marketplace arteries, you have to be concerned that this system doesn't work for you. Congress has a responsibility and there are laws on the books that would require us to look carefully and closely at merger proposals to see, is this in the best interests of the country or will this injure the marketplace? Will this injure the free enterprise system? 
In some cases, maybe not; in some cases, maybe it will. In those cases, Congress has a responsibility to act. 
We had a circumstance with respect to airlines. For example, not too many years ago we had a whole raft of merger proposals go to the Department of Transportation. The then-Secretary of Transportation never met a merger she didn't love. It didn't matter what it was. `Just bring them up, and we'll try to merge them. We say amen, and we stamp `Approved.' The result is that we have had fewer airlines that retreated into regional monopolies. I think whether it is railroads, airlines, meatpacking plants, banks, or telecommunications companies, this country functions best and our market system and free enterprise system functions best when you have robust, aggressive competition. I worry very much that those who are supposed to be minding the store are paying precious little attention to some of these issues. 
Finally, let me say an encouraging word about one person who is paying some attention, and that is Joel Klein over in the Justice Department. I will not talk about any of the specific cases before them, because I am not interested in doing that. But he is someone who heads the Antitrust Division. I hope this Congress provides substantial resources so that he has the capability and the people over there to investigate these mergers to determine whether they are in the best interest of the country or whether they violate the law with respect to antitrust. I want those who are supposed to be the referees with respect to the market system to make sure that competition abounds and the market system works. I want Mr. Klein, head of the Antitrust Division at Justice, to have the resources necessary to do that, and I hope my colleagues agree with me. 
I am going to speak at greater length at another time. I apologize to the Senator from Arizona. He has been waiting. I wanted to make the point on mergers. I hope my colleagues on both the Republican and Democratic sides who have an interest in this issue and an interest in making certain that those mergers that are fine proceed unimpeded, but those that restrict and constrict and impede the market system ought to be looked at with a fine-tooth comb to determine whether they ought to be approved or rejected. I will have more to say on this at some point later. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have been debating the tobacco bill in the U.S. Senate and will continue to debate that piece of legislation into next week and perhaps even beyond. I will begin a discussion on the subject of kids and smoking, and I will read into the Record pieces of information from the tobacco industry itself. Then, at the conclusion, I will ask the question and have all Americans ask the question: Were the tobacco companies and was the tobacco industry in America targeting our children as customers for their tobacco products? 
If the answer is yes, then the question is not any longer whether there should be tobacco legislation; the question will be exactly what kind of legislation must we pass and how quickly can we enact it. 
Let me begin with a few quotes. These are quotes from the tobacco industry that have been unearthed in various lawsuits and discovery proceedings. 
Brown & Williamson, a 1972 company document: 
It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered. 
Talking about the potential of adding honey to cigarettes to make them more appealing to teenagers. 
RJR tobacco company, 1973: 
Comic-strip-type copy might get a much higher readership among younger people than any other type of copy. 
Talking about advertising, clearly a strategy that says--how do we advertise to kids? This from the RJR tobacco company. 
Brown & Williamson, 1973: 
Kool--The brand Kool--has shown little or no growth in share of users in the 26-and-up age group. Growth is from 16- to 25-year-olds . . . at the present rate, a smoker in the 16- to 25-year-age group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad-age category. 
Is this a company interested in getting kids addicted to cigarettes? Sure sounds like it to me. 
Philip Morris, 1974: 
We are not sure that anything can be done to halt a major exodus if one gets going among the young. This group--now speaking of the young, according to Philip Morris--follows the crowd, and we don't pretend to know what gets them going for one thing or another . . . Certainly Philip Morris should continue efforts for Marlboro in the youth market . . . 
R. J. Reynolds, 1974: 
They represent tomorrow's cigarette business . . . As this 14- to 24-age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume--for at least the next 25 years. 
In a 1975 report, a Philip Morris researcher writes: 
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . age 15 to 19 years old . . . my own data, which includes younger teenagers, shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15- to 17-year-olds. 
That is a 1975 report from a researcher in Philip Morris. These are internal company documents: 
To ensure increased and longer-term growth for Camel filter--This according to a 1975 RJR memo--the brand must increase penetration among the 14- to 24 age group which has a new set of more liberal values and which represent tomorrow's cigarette business.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we near the summer of this legislative session and discuss the agenda remaining for this Congress, I want to raise, as my colleagues and I have for many, many days in this Chamber, one of the pieces of legislation we want considered in the Senate during this session of the Senate. That legislation is the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
About 160 million Americans are now enrolled in managed care organizations. HMOs--health maintenance organizations, one of the main types of managed care--can save money and they can improve care. But by the same token, managed health care organizations can cause real serious problems for many Americans. I want to describe just a few of them and describe why we believe a Patients' Bill of Rights should be enacted by this Congress. 
To describe part of the problem with managed care organizations, let me tell the story of a woman who had just suffered a brain injury. As she was lying in an ambulance being hauled to a hospital, with her brain swelling, she advised the ambulance drivers that she wanted to be taken to the hospital that was farther away, rather than the nearest hospital. 
She survived and was asked later why she issued directions to be taken to the hospital farther away. She said she had learned a lot about the hospital that was nearest to the ambulance at that point, and it was a hospital that by reputation had made health care a function of its profit and loss statement. She did not feel comfortable presenting herself to an emergency room where her care was going to be a function of someone else's profit and loss. 
And that is something that concerns a lot of the American people these days, especially as health care moves more towards for-profit health care, more towards managed care. Let me give you another example. 
This example, whose name is Wendy Connelly, a wife and mother from Sherwood, OR, is yet another reason why we need a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
In 1994, Wendy Connelly experienced symptoms of what she feared was a heart attack, including heaviness in her chest and a heart that began beating wildly, at a rate approaching 150 beats per minute. She thought she was having a heart attack, so Wendy sought treatment at the local hospital emergency room, as one would likely do in that situation. Fortunately for Wendy, the doctors on call treated her for what was not a heart attack, but rather, a previously undiagnosed thyroid imbalance. When she first began to fear the worst, Wendy had contacted her HMO's on-call physician for advice. Obviously, he was unable to make an over-the-phone diagnosis for her, and he told her to seek emergency room care if her symptoms did not subside. And so she did. But when the bill came due, the HMO denied payment of Wendy Connelly's claim. They said that her case was not deemed emergency care. The HMO was basing its decision on the final diagnosis, not the heart-attack like symptoms that sent her to the emergency room. 
Wendy Connelly, to her credit, felt that the HMO was wrong in its denial, and so, for more than a year, she sent letters explaining what had happened. Even her doctors and the hospital that treated her urged the HMO to cover that claim. Finally, the HMO conceded and she was no longer liable for the costs that she incurred more than a year before. But she decided that she would help others in this situation who were being unfairly denied coverage, so she filed a complaint against the HMO with the Oregon Department of Insurance. It was found by the Department of Insurance that what had happened to Wendy Connelly was a routine practice for this insurer. If a person went to the emergency room but found that the final diagnosis is not something that would require emergency care, despite what the presenting symptoms were, then the claim was denied. 
Here is what Wendy said: 
I went to an emergency room (because) I thought I was having a heart attack. . . . I felt that if I went somewhere else or delayed longer, I would (have been) putting my life in jeopardy. 
But all across the country now we discover these cases, time after time after time, of the managed care organizations deciding that they won't cover someone showing up in an emergency room. Or, in fact, some of them have clauses in their contracts with their doctors that say if a doctor's patient shows up in the emergency room, it comes out of the doctor's compensation for the managed care organization. You talk about a terrible incentive; you talk about a conflict of interest; that is it. 
We have proposed a Patients' Bill of Rights, proposed by Democrats and Republicans, in the Congress. Let me go through, just for a moment, what some of these rights would be. 
Patients in this country ought to have an opportunity to know all of the medical options available to treat their illness or disease--all of the medical options, not just the cheapest. A number of managed care organizations have gag rules in their contracts with their doctors. They will only allow their doctors to tell patients what they want the patients to know. If there are other treatments available, perhaps better treatments, treatments that are more appropriate but perhaps more expensive, then they have no obligation to tell the patient that there are other treatment options. Many patients worry, and some investigations confirm, that often the patients learn not all of the treatments available but only those which are the cheapest. 
You have a right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need, including specialty care. One person from my home state of North Dakota whose employer recently switched to a closed network health plan has a chronic heart condition. But his new health plan has refused to allow him to see the cardiologist who has been caring for him for this heart condition for a decade. This employee has no option to choose a health plan that will allow him to continue seeing his cardiologist, even though he says he is 
willing to pay for that right. So under the Patients' Bill of Rights, patients will have the right to choose the doctor they want for the care they need. 
You have the right to emergency room care whenever and wherever you need it. In fact, a Missouri managed care organization plan sent all of its customers a letter saying a trip to the emergency room with a broken leg, or a baby running a high fever, should not generally be assumed to be covered. The letter read like this: 
An emergency room visit for medical treatment is not automatically covered under your benefit plan. 
An Arkansas woman suffered a broken neck in a car wreck and was rushed to the hospital. Her managed care company refused to pay for her emergency room care--this is a patient with a broken neck from a car accident--because she failed to get prior authorization. Managed care organizations think that the first thing to do when you break your neck in a car accident is to seek prior authorization to get to an emergency room? So, another of the patients' rights is the right to emergency room care whenever and wherever you need it. 
You also have the right to a fair and speedy process for resolving disputes with your health care plan. You have the right to considerate, respectful care without discrimination. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. 
Why is it important that these rights be made available to patients? Because too many managed care organizations are denying those basic rights to American citizens and to those who are sick right now. We have a proposal that has been dealt with by the Senate, dealing with mastectomies. Why should the Senate be talking about the length of hospital stays available for a woman who has a mastectomy? Because managed care organizations are taking these women into hospitals for mastectomies, radical mastectomies, and 8, 10, 12 hours later, with tubes coming from their bodies, sending them home. And the same is true with drive-through baby deliveries. That is why Congress addressed that particular problem in 1996. 
Is this body part by body part legislation the best way to address these issues? No, not for Congress to be dealing with these specific procedures. But why are we even confronted with this? Because health care all too often--regrettably, for those who are sick, for those who are in need of health care--has become more a function of dollars and cents, more a function of someone's profit and loss, than someone else's critically needed health care. That is why we want a Patients' Bill of Rights passed by this Congress. 
Some say this will cost a lot of money. No it will not. The ultimate cost for the American people is to deny treatment, to deny coverage, and deny opportunity for those who are sick to get the treatment they need. If you want to mushroom the health care bill in this country, then keep doing what we are doing and say to the American people: If you break your neck, we won't pay for emergency services for you because your first stop should be some accountant's desk to get prior authorization. Your first stop, before the doctor's office or the hospital room, is to appeal to some accountant in an insurance office 500 miles away to ask what kind of health care delivery that managed care plan will give you, your child, your parents, or your family. That doesn't make any sense. 
Doctors all across my State and across this country support the Patients' Bill of Rights, because they understand medicine ought to be practiced in the doctor's office and in the hospital room, not in some insurance company's office by some junior accountant who is 500 or 1,000 miles away from the problem the patient is suffering. 
Mr. President, I hope very much that in the coming weeks this Congress will include on its agenda a Patients' Bill of Rights so that all Americans will understand their rights and all managed care organizations will understand their obligations to people in this country when they need health care.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I finish my time I want to turn to a separate matter for a moment to discuss some meetings that I held in North Dakota during this past week. While the U.S. Senate was not in session, I held a number of farm neighbor meetings around North Dakota to talk about the farm crisis that exists in our part of the country. It is not something you read much about, but it exists and it is serious. 
We have seen all kinds of natural disasters and they break your heart. We have seen tornadoes, earthquakes and floods. We have had floods in North Dakota, our neighboring State of South Dakota had devastating tornadoes over the weekend. They are all tough to deal with. 
But there is another kind of crisis and disaster that occurs that does not come from a single event that climaxes in massive, visible immediate destruction. I am talking about a farm crisis that is devastating farm families in States like North Dakota. Chronic grain disease, such as scab that results in vomitoxin, chronically low farm prices, a wet cycle, diminished production, and a range of other things have combined to put literally thousands and thousands of family farmers in harm's way. By harm's way, I mean these farmers are not going to get financing to put in another year's crop. They are going to see their lifelong dream of operating their family farm gone, ripped apart and torn to shreds. 
At one of the farm neighbor meetings I had, there were three generations of farmers sitting there--a granddad, a dad and a son. The son was about 20 years old, kind of a husky young man. The granddad started that farm many, many decades ago, and the father took over that farm. Now the son is getting ready to graduate from college and would like to come back and farm as well. But the son said he wasn't sure he was going to be able to do that. In fact, the dad wasn't sure he was going to be able to hold on to the farm even if his son did want to farm it. Three generations of farmers and their hope for the future is gone. 
At one of the farm meetings we had, the sky clouded up with big black storm clouds to the west. A storm was imminent, when one of the farmers stood up and explained what a lot of people probably do not understand. 
He said, `You know, I've lost money 4 years in a row. I run a small grains farm. I put my kids through college. This is what I love to do. It is what I know to do,' and he said, `yet, the grain prices are far below my cost of production. We have had crop disease and every problem you virtually can conceive of, and I don't know how long I can keep farming.' 
He said, `See that cloud bank out west. Those storm clouds that will be here in an hour or so, that's pressure. That's pressure for us, and people don't understand that. That might ruin what little crop that has started to come. That might wash out seeds that haven't yet sprouted. That is pressure.' 
You don't think much about that until you sit on those farmsteads and visit with the farmers who are trying to make a living under very difficult circumstances. 
Farmers are the only business men and women in this country who have the following kinds of problems of risk: One, when they plant a seed after they plow the soil in spring, they have no idea whether the crop is going to grow, whether it be wheat, barley, flax, or corn. If it grows, maybe a month later the grasshoppers come. Maybe it is insects, maybe it is hail, maybe crop disease or maybe a dozen other things conspire to destroy that crop. 
But maybe the crop doesn't get destroyed and the farmer harvests the crop and takes it to the grain elevator. Then maybe, as is the circumstance today, that farmer gets $2 a bushel less than it cost him to produce the wheat. Then the farmer wonders, `I took all these risks and end up losing all my money, all my equity, and then I am told by my banker that the U.S. Congress changed the farm program and reduced price supports so I can't cashflow anymore. Because Congress changed the farm programs, I no longer have the loans available to me to put in the spring crop.' And 
they rightfully wonder what is happening to our country. 
We must, as a country, do something if we want to save family farmers. This country has an obligation to stand up in international trade and farm policy. We need to say that a network of family farms in our country's future matters to this nation. 
We can do better in a range of areas. We need a better crop insurance program, a better price support program, and better trade policies that prevent other countries from unfair trade practices against us. We can do all these things. 
This Congress, in my judgment, has a responsibility now to respond to the growing farm crisis. I hope my colleagues who come from farm States will understand that this is not some parochial issue. It is not some parochial concern that is of no consequence to anyone else. 
It is of consequence to everyone in this country whether or not our family farmers have an opportunity to survive and succeed. I think it is interesting, Mr. President, that the price of wheat has gone from $5.50 a bushel to $3.50 a bushel, nearly $2 below the cost of production for a bushel of wheat. And yet, at the same time, the folks in town go to the grocery store and they discover the price of bread has increased a bit. The price of wheat has dropped like an anvil, and the price of bread keeps going up. The price of wheat drops, the price of cereal keeps going up. What it says is that family farmers are down there at the bottom of the economic totem pole. Yet, they are the ones who produce. They plow the ground in the spring, they harvest it in the fall, they take all the risks in between and, in all the circumstances, they are the ones who lose the money. At the same time the big millers have record profits and the big grocer manufacturers have record profits. You can take a look at the big grain trading companies--record profits. 
Everybody profits, except those who have to put on work clothes to plant the field and harvest the crop. It is everybody who doesn't have to work in that kind of a situation who makes a record profit, while the farm families are going out of business. 
In my home State, they have had to call auctioneers out of retirement to handle the number of auction sales for family farms going out of business this year. There is something wrong when we say as a country, `Gee, our economic policy is working quite well,' and then we see all these family farmers going out of business. 
One part of this is trade, and I might just finish today by mentioning trade. In almost every circumstance, this country has refused to stand with its producers on trade, and that is especially true with farm producers. It has refused to do what it should have done on United States-Canada grain trade in which this country is flooded with subsidized Canadian grain. It refuses to do what it should do with respect to China, Japan, and Europe. 
Just last week, we finally began confronting unfair trade, when the Secretary of Agriculture took action against the European Union for sending a ship that docked in California loaded with barley. That barley was deeply subsidized, to the tune of over $1 a bushel. Secretary Glickman, to his credit, took the first action. It was a step, it was a baby step, but, nevertheless, a step in the right direction. In taking it Secretary Glickman is saying to the European Union: `You can't do that to this country. You can't do that to our farmers. You can't take money directly out of our farmers' pockets. In this case of unfair trade, you can't do that with impunity. This country will not allow you to do that.' 
Mr. President, I am going to speak later this week about farm policy and some of the related issues that we have to deal with--crop insurance, trade, price supports, investment in research for crop disease, and a whole range of other things. 
I say to my colleagues, this is critically important. There is, indeed, a farm crisis and we have a responsibility to respond to it in a thoughtful and important way. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I add my congratulations and my thanks to Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus especially. My colleague, Senator Conrad, has described how important this piece of legislation is. I know both the chairman and ranking member worked very hard for a long, long while to make sure that the result was a result that is fair to all parts of this country. 
A lot of people don't think much about road issues. Not many people think about roads when they are driving on a good road. They don't think about roads much until they hit a bad road. They don't think about bridges until they read a story or see a bridge that is in disrepair or has fallen down and caused a loss of life. 
The investment in this country's infrastructure--roads and bridges--is critically important. In a State like North 
Dakota, that is 10 times the size of Massachusetts in landmass, yet with only 640,000 people living in the State, it is very difficult for us to maintain a broad network of roads and infrastructure without the kind of investment that will be made possible in this legislation. 
The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, mentioned the increase in funding that will exist with this legislation--from $111 million a year to about $170 million a year, just in excess of a 50-percent-per-year increase. That comes from the gas taxes that people pay when they drive up to the gas pumps and fill their car. That gas tax is used to invest in this country and invest in its infrastructure--roads and bridges. That is what makes possible this kind of legislation. 
This is a wonderful step forward. I know some debated the size and debated the formula, but the fact is, this is the kind of investment that makes you feel this is a better country because of it. If you go to other countries--I won't mention them--if you go to a half-dozen or dozen other countries and drive on their roads, you immediately understand that they have trouble financing their infrastructure. Their roads are in disrepair, full of potholes, some barely built, some not graveled. 
All you have to do is look at a country's infrastructure to see what kind of country it is. Is it a country which devotes the resources to roads and bridges and the things that make transportation possible and the transportation of grain and commodities and items of commerce back and forth possible? The answer is yes. One of the important things about this bill is, we decided long ago that transportation should be national in scope. If you are going to haul fresh fish or frozen shrimp from the State of Washington to the State of Maine, you are going to need roads across the center of the country, even if it is not very populated. Yes, you might drive through Wyoming and North Dakota. There aren't many people there. It is a lot less crowded than New York and California. But the roads to get from here to there are just as important as a mile of road in New York City. That is what the need of a national highway program is all about. 
When Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to build an interstate highway system, he didn't say, let's spend all that money just where people live; he said, we are going to build an interstate highway system and we are going to build it to connect the entire country, and we are even going to make that investment in sparsely populated States because that is what allows people to move around this country. 
That is the long way of saying this is a good bill and advances the interests of our country. 
Let me make one final, quick point. 
I have worked 5 years on a small piece of legislation that probably will not mean much to some, but it is in this piece of legislation we will consider this afternoon. In five States, it is perfectly legal in America to put one hand on the driver's wheel of a car and another on a fifth of whiskey. Drink and drive and you are perfectly legal. You just can't be drunk. No problem drinking while you drive. In 22 States, if the driver can't drink, it is fine for the people in the back seat or the person in the front seat next to the driver to drink while you drive. 
For 5 years, I have tried to get that changed. Some say I have no right to tell some State that they have to have a 
prohibition on open containers in their State. Maybe they think I have no business doing that. I have a right to say to anybody anywhere in this country who drives into an intersection in any city, any State, that they ought to have some reasonable expectation they are meeting a car in which the driver isn't drinking or in which there isn't alcohol being consumed in the car. We have a right to aspire to that in this country as a sense of national purpose. 
Drunk driving is a major problem in this country. Every 30 minutes, another family receives a call. My family received the call. A loved one was killed in a drunk-driving accident. Every 30 minutes, every hour, every day. This is not some strange and mysterious illness for which we do not have a cure. We know what causes it, and we know what cures it. 
This piece of legislation today includes a provision that States will enact a prohibition on open containers, and it has a sanction if they do not. The sanction is not quite as strong as I proposed, but, nonetheless, it is still a sanction. 
This advances some things that I have felt strongly about and worked on for 5 years. The Senate voted on this provision. It was somewhat controversial, but it passed the Senate, and I am very pleased that, in the conference with the House, we were able to keep this provision. I also know that because this provision exists and because this Congress took this step, lives will be saved. I commend those who worked with me to fight for that piece of legislation. 
Finally, let me say thanks again to all of those who worked so hard. A lot of folks worked around the clock a couple days on this. Their names probably will not be called on the Senate floor, but thanks to them for their commitment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding of the unanimous consent request made by Senator Coverdell was that he wants to get two on the majority side to use 10 minutes each. And we thought that was acceptable. Senator Enzi wanted to introduce a bill. I now understand that Senator Enzi wishes to consume up to 10 minutes. The difficulty with that is I must be somewhere downtown at 10:30. If I had understood that Senator Coverdell was seeking 30 minutes on that side before anyone was recognized, I would have had a different view, although I recognize that Senator Enzi came, in fact, before the previous two speakers this morning. I understand that. But we did it as a matter of courtesy to say it was acceptable to us to have two Republican speakers to go for 10 minutes each provided we then be recognized. The Senator from Wyoming, I understand, wants to introduce a bill. 
Does the Senator from Wyoming intend to consume up to 10 minutes?

Mr. DORGAN. I think there has been a misunderstanding. I will, as matter of courtesy, not object. But I would have objected earlier if the request was that we had 30 minutes on the majority side uninterrupted, because Senator Wellstone is here and I was here. The Senator from Wyoming, I know, was here as well before the other speakers. As a matter of courtesy I will not object. I regret that there has been a misunderstanding.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about two challenges as we begin a break, now, for the Memorial Day recess here in Congress. We are talking about a wide range of things: Iran, missile sanctions, tobacco, appropriations bills, and a wide range of subjects. There are two subjects on which there is deafening silence here in Washington, DC, and in the Congress, and I want to talk about both of them because I think both are challenges for this country. One is our worsening trade deficit and the announcement 2 days ago that, once again, our merchandise trade deficit for 1 month reached another record $20 billion in a month; and, second, the new wave of mergers in this country. I want to talk about both of them just briefly. 
First, a chart. This chart shows in recent years the average monthly trade deficit in this country, the average monthly merchandise trade deficit. You can see what is happening--a month in 1991, $6 billion; it is now 1998, $20 billion, February through March, in a month. Some say the trade deficit doesn't matter much. If it doesn't matter much, they must be just ecstatic. If ignorance is bliss, those who think trade deficits don't matter have to be just ecstatic. Look at what is happening here. This red represents a flood of red ink in international trade. 
Our all-stars in international trade are our farmers. Yet, farm imports into this country are going up and farm exports are going down. I think today there is a ship docking in California with a load of barley from the European Union. It is going to dock in Stockton, CA. It has feed barley being sent into this country with a $1.10-a-bushel subsidy. Shame on us for letting that ship dock. That is unfair trade no matter how you describe it, and it undercuts our producers, undercuts our farmers, takes money right out of American producers' pockets, and it doesn't seem to matter much to anyone. It just seems the trade deficits are OK, there are not problems, and nobody seems to want to do much about it. 
That unfair trade on that boat is just one small example. The flood of grain coming in from Canada, unfairly subsidized grain, in my judgment, being illegally dumped in this country--nothing is done about that. 
How about the closed markets, yes, in Japan and China? Take a look at the figures this week and see what is happening with China. There is a $12 billion trade deficit in the first 3 months, $12 billion the first 3 months with China. That is a $48 billion, nearly $50 billion yearly trade deficit with China. Mr. President, $15 billion the first 3 months with Japan, that is a $60 billion a year trade deficit with Japan. This doesn't make any sense. This hurts our country. Trade deficits must be repaid. It is not free money. And it must be repaid in the future by a lower standard of living in this country. 
That is not a theory. That is real. These deficits must be repaid, and those who react with glee to this do not understand what this means. It means we are borrowing, and borrowing heavily, for a trade system that is out of balance. 
With all due respect to all those who negotiate our trade agreements, I will say this: Will Rogers once said the United States has never lost a war and never won a conference. 
Why do we send trade negotiators overseas to lose in 3 weeks? And they do. I can't think of a trade agreement negotiated recently that represented this country's national economic interest. We have incompetently negotiated trade agreements and trade agreements that are rarely enforced, and it is time for this country and this Congress to understand this is heading in the wrong direction. 
I am not suggesting cutting off all imports. I am saying to our trading partners, as a country it is in our economic interest that when we take your goods, you be required to take ours. We need to get more wheat into China, more pork into China, more manufactured goods into China and Japan, more beef into Japan. 
I can spend an hour talking about these problems. Nobody works much on them, because trade policy too often has become foreign policy, and the State Department has its mitts in all of this. It worries that if we get tough with Japan and say, `You can't run a $60 billion trade surplus with us every year,' Japan will be miffed. Well, let Japan be miffed. Let's talk about this country's interests. Let's talk about our long-term interests. 
Having gotten that off my chest, I hope the deafening silence on trade deficits will no longer continue. I hope this Congress, in the coming months, will consider the legislation that I, Senator Byrd, and Senator Stevens have introduced which talks about the creation of a commission on an emergency basis to make recommendations to Congress to deal with this trade deficit, to focus on it and respond to it. 
Mr. President, I have one final item, and that is the wave of mergers in this country. In the last century, there have been five merger waves. We are in the fifth. This is far, far in excess of any mergers in the past. 
I want you to take a look at the line on this chart, going back to 1983, on the number of merger deals, and it goes up like this, as you can see. The projected dollar amount on mergers and acquisitions is up to $1.1 trillion for this year. 
What does all this mean? Are mergers always bad? No. Can you get into a merger wave that strangles our marketplace? Of course you can, and that is what is happening in this country. 
I want to go through some of the mergers. Some of these companies decided to get married, and we didn't even know they were dating. All these secret talks were going on, and two companies were so fond of each other that they decided to get married. We have Citicorp and Travelers Group at more than $70 billion. They were romancing for a couple of weeks and announced to all of us, a huge bank and a huge insurance company want to get hitched. 
BankAmerica Corp., NationsBank, that is not surprising. We have banks throughout this list. The big banks are getting bigger. Down at the Federal Reserve Board, they have a list. It used to be a list of 11 banks. It is called `Too Big to Fail.' It means these banks will not fail because we cannot let them fail; the consequences to our country and economy will be too significant. 
That list now is not 11, it is now 21 banks and growing. Twenty-one banks are too big to fail. And that is what these mergers are giving us--bigger and bigger banks, too big to fail --while the little folks out there, the family farmers and Main Street business enterprises, are apparently too small to matter. These folks have their merger risks guaranteed by the taxpayer, and the rest of the folks find choked markets and higher prices. 
Take a look at the banks. You are paying higher bank fees. Banks are getting bigger and merging all over the country, and customers are paying higher bank fees. Take a look at the meatpacking industry. Three or four companies control the neck of 
the bottle on meatpacking. It pushes down low prices on the backs of farmers and ranchers. 
Take a look at the airlines. We deregulated the airlines. Now we have about six major airlines in America that have retreated into what are largely regional monopolies without regulation. 
What about railroads? We've seen merger after merger after merger. Now we have just several major railroads left in America. What happens is the people on Main Street, the consumers, the farmers, and others are told by the railroads, `Here is the way we are going to serve you. We are going to bring our cars by here. You better have what you want put on there in time, or you lose out. We will tell you what you pay, and if you don't like it, tough luck.' 
That is what a merger is. Concentration of markets means you injure the marketplace. When you have two big companies merge and you have one behemoth company, this country has lost something by diminishing the marketplace because you have less competition. 
Our marketplace works based on competition. When you have less competition and more concentration, it hurts our marketplace. I hope there is energy in the Congress to help the Justice Department and others who review these mergers to find out are they more than just good for the companies, are they good for the country. 
This list of the 25 largest corporate mergers completed or pending through May 11 is a fascinating list. There are a lot of banks, as you might well know, and communications companies. This next list talks about mergers and acquisitions over $1 billion involving U.S. companies between 1983-1998. In 1983, we had 10 deals over $1 billion. This year, there were 143 separate merger deals over $1 billion each. Of course, the largest ones are just behemoth, setting all kinds of records. 
I am not saying all mergers are bad all the time. I know of circumstances where two companies have merged and it was beneficial to everybody. I understand that. But we have an orgy of mega-mergers going on in this country today that I think does threaten the marketplace. I say to Joel Klein over in the Justice Department, and others, be active, be aggressive. He recently testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that he needs some more resources in antitrust to deal with these issues. I am somebody who says, let's give him the resources. 
I want this marketplace to work. It works when we have robust, aggressive competition. It chokes and clogs when we have concentration at the top. So I bring to my colleagues' attention these charts just to say we have gone from 10 mergers over $1 billion in 1983 to 20, 26, 34, 35, 47--it goes on up. Now we have 143 different merger propositions over $1 billion each, something we ought to care about. 
There has not been anybody around this Congress for a long, long while to care about it. Senator Phil Hart, a great Senator for whom the Hart Building was named, spent a lot of his career here worrying about the issue of mergers and concentration. I hope, once again, we will see some from this Justice Department and from some in this Congress who will take a close look at all of these. That is not to say they are all bad, some might make sense, but to say there is more than one interest involved in these issues. There is more than one interest. 
One interest might be the two companies who want to make more money and grab some markets. The other interest must be the interest of the American people and a free-market system that will only remain free if we have competition and only remain free if we don't have concentration and monopoly that chokes down markets. 
I hope, perhaps in the coming months, that I can stimulate some additional discussion about this issue with some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Mr. President, I see my time has expired. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, for bringing the tobacco legislation to the floor of the Senate this week. He had indicated previously that he would do so, and he has kept that commitment. I think it will be helpful in this country to debate that issue this week on the floor of the Senate.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an issue dealing with agriculture. Later this week, sometime this weekend, a boat will pull up at a dock in California loaded with 1.4 million bushels of European barley. This barley was sold into this country with a subsidy of well over $1 a bushel. It is now being hauled from the European Union to the shores of the United States, deeply subsidized, unfair trade, undercutting our family farmers. It is an outrage, and it should not happen. We suggested that the sale be terminated when it was announced, but it was not. I suggest today that perhaps somebody ought to refuse to unload the barley when it reaches the shores of California. 
Let me describe for a few moments why this is just a symbol of a very serious problem in the farm belt. I want to show a series of charts because I want the American people and my colleagues to understand that we are confronted with the question of whether we want any family farmers in this country's future. We are seeing family farmers going broke in record numbers. In my State, there was a 55-percent increase in auction sales over last year. They are calling auctioneers out of retirement to handle the auction sales, because there are so many sales of family farmers having to quit. 
Now, farming isn't just a business. These are families living on the farm. There is a yard light that illuminates the place that represents the dreams of a family that wants to farm. These farms represent the economic blood vessels that pump life into our small towns. It is a way of life that is very important to this country. 
There is a real difference between family farmers and the agri-factories that farm from California to the State of Maine with large mechanized corporate farming. The family farm makes a difference in our society. It is the seedbed of family values that has nurtured and rolled itself from the family farms to small towns, to America's cities. If America decides it doesn't care about whether there are family farmers, it will have lost something valuable. 
I received a letter from a farmer just the other day. Its just one of many such letters from other farmers. I am getting many calls and considerable mail from farmers. This particular letter says, `It has come to my attention now as a farmer that the United States is preparing to let an entire industry'--that is, family farmers--`die. If an airline strikes, the President intervenes; if UPS strikes, the President intervenes; if a railroad suggests a strike, the President is up in arms. But when farm commodity prices fall and family farmers are in peril, nobody seems to say much.' 
Let me describe the circumstances of our North Dakota farmers. I met with a group of North Dakota producers this past Saturday with my colleague, Senator Conrad, in Fargo, ND. We visited, once again, about the problems and what can be done about them. Here is what they face. Our three largest crops--spring wheat, durum wheat, and barley--had a 41-percent reduction, a 21-percent reduction, and 41-percent reduction in gross income from reduced yield and price. Ask yourself, if you were in business and you have a 40-percent reduction in your gross sales and a reduction in your price, what is going to happen to your business? 
These are family farmers. They don't have deep pockets. So here is what has happened, as a result, to net farm income. Take all the farmers out there in North Dakota and evaluate what happened to the net farm income. Net farm income in 1996 was $764 million, divided among 30,000 farmers. In 1997 net farm income was down 98 percent, down to $15 million in net farm income. Divided among all those farmers, that is less than $500 net income per farm. But this doesn't tell the whole story, because almost all of that net farm income goes to the state's largest farmers, and almost all of the middle- and lower-income farmers are seeing huge losses. Let me show my colleagues what has happened to the price of wheat. 
One can make the case, or not make the case, that this has something to do with what Congress did. It probably has some small amount to do with what Congress did in passing a new farm bill, and maybe it has something to do with a lot of other things happening in the world. 
Let's look at the price of the wheat. We passed a new farm bill back in April 1996. You see what happened to the prices received by farmers for wheat since May 1996. It has gone down, down, down, way down. It is now at the lowest level in five years. That is what farmers live on. The price determines whether they are going to make a living and stay on the farm. The price of wheat has gone down 44 percent. It is down, down, way down. 
Let me show you what has happened to farmers' costs of production. Seed, fertilizer, fuel. They are all up, up, up, way up, month after month, year after year. 
Let me show a chart, if I might, that talks about some of these specific trends. If you are a farmer, you need to have a tractor to plow. We don't do it with mules anymore; we do it with tractors. What has happened to the price of tractors? Farmers can tell you in an instant. The price goes up, up, straight up. The price of a combine is also up, up, straight up. How about the price of anhydrous ammonia, the fertilizer needed to provide the nutrients to these crops? You can see what has happened. There has been a huge spike in the last few years. The price of fuel is up. In the last five years, there has been a 70-percent increase in the cost of the inputs that many farmers have to buy to put a crop in the ground. 
This isn't like other businesses. When you are a family farmer, you can't pass these costs along. People do not think much about family farmers, unfortunately. They get their butter from a carton; they get their milk from a bottle, or a carton; food from a can, or perhaps a box. But it all comes from the farm. It all comes from someone who gets up early to do the chores, and then gasses up the tractor, and goes out and plants the field. 
Will Rogers some 60 years ago said, `If all the cows in the country failed to show up at the barn one morning to be milked, why, that would be a problem.' He said, `If all the lawyers and accountants in America failed to show up for work one morning, we wouldn't miss a lunch.' He was describing what is really important. Where does all of this come from? It comes from the ingenuity and risks taken by families who decide they want to farm as a way of life. 
The price of a loaf of bread has almost no money in it for farmers. Here is the price of a loaf of bread. Here is what the farmer gets. Just about the heel, if that much. 
So wheat 2 years ago was $5.50 a bushel, and now it is $3.20 or $3.30. Has anybody seen the price of a loaf of bread come down? I don't think so. What is happening is, the people who make the bread are making record profits. The people who haul the grain on the railroad tracks are making record profits. The people who put it in a plant and then perhaps puff it and then sell it on the grocery store shelf as Puffed Wheat are making a profit because it is more profitable to puff it than it is to grow it. 
I wonder if there is not something wrong with this picture for America. The snap, crackle, and pop, the puff, and the crisp all have more value than the wheat. The package, the advertising, and the transportation have more value than the wheat. 
This country can't decide on a policy that says family farming has merit and it is important to this country? 
Finally, bread profits soar at the same time that wheat prices come down and family farmers go broke. Something is wrong with that picture. 
This chart shows it on the same page. Bread costs continue to rise, and the price of wheat continues to fall. 
I went to a small school. There were nine students in my class. They taught math at my school, maybe not higher math, but I can add and subtract. I understand what adds up and what doesn't. This doesn't add up. It does not add up if you care 
about whether this country has a future for family farmers. Farming is not just a business. 
There are a lot of reasons that we are in trouble on the farm. Farmers are told by Congress that, we are not going to have a safety net for you anymore, and that we are going to pull that safety net out from underneath our farmers. 
Farmer are unlike most other business. They take huge risks: First, they risk that when they plant a seed, it may not grow. So the cost of that seed might represent a loss in the farmers' pockets. Second, if the seed grows, it may be in June or July that a hailstorm will come and destroy the crop. Or the bugs will come and eat the crop; or crop disease, scab or vomitoxin, will come and destroy the crop. 
Maybe none of those things happen. Maybe you plant a seed and it grows and none of those natural disasters occur. Then you combine the crop to get it off the field and take it to the grain elevator, only to discover that it costs you $5 a bushel to produce it and you get just $3.35 a bushel to sell it. The result is that your family is going to have to move from the farm. That yard light is going to go out. Someone will farm that land. It will be a big operator, or a big corporate farm. They will just fold it into their bigger corporate farm, and there will be tractors that will plow for miles. But that yard light will be out forever, and that small town will continue to die. The county will shrink. The rural life style will wither. 
A wonderful author from my home State, who was a world-renowned author, died a couple of years ago. He made a prediction in his book. He stated it more eloquently than I can . He said that this country resulted from an agrarian lifestyle which created the family values that nurtured America and refreshed America. He reminded us that the family values that refreshed America continually came from the family farm, where neighbors understood that you have to help each other because the people can't do it alone. Without our family farms, those family values that rolled from rural America to our cities will be lost. 
It is not to say that farmers are better than anybody else or have more value. It is just that farming is different. It is a family occupation. Yet, it has enormous risks. For years in this country we decided that we were going to try to provide some help to offset those risks. They do it in every other country. 
We are the only superpower. We are the only nuclear superpower, military superpower, left. We are certainly an economic superpower. Almost any other country with any economic clout decides that, as part of its budget, it makes sure it continues to have a network of family farms. Therefore, it provides some price supports against all of these risks that family farmers face. But not us. We decided farmers should compete in the open market despite the fact that there isn't an open market. 
As I said when I started, the ship that is going to dock in California at the end of this week will haul 1.4 million bushels of European Union barley subsidized to the tune of more than $1.10 cents a bushel. There is no American farmer that can compete with that. It is simply unfair. 
But that is just the tip of the iceberg. In every direction you look in international trade, our farmers are injured. The California dock is not the only place. Go to the Canadian border, where we are flooded with unfairly traded Canadian imports. Go to the Mexican border and see what NAFTA has done with respect to the unfairness of agricultural trade. Go to China and ask why we can't get sufficient amounts of wheat or pork into China. Go to Japan and ask why it costs $30 a pound to buy a T-bone steak in Japan because you cannot get enough American beef in Japan. 
We are rife with trade problems that injure the American farmer every single day. And our trade policy is apparently to sit on our hands and do nothing about it. 
It seems to me that we can't enforce trade agreements. But first of all, we need to negotiate good agreements. Let me mention Will Rogers once again. Some 60 years ago, Will Rogers also said that, `The United States has never lost a war and never won in a conference.' 
First, we ought to get trade negotiators to go out and negotiate good agreements for this country. They ought to be hard-nosed economic trade agreements and not some soft-headed foreign policy negotiations about what we ought to do to help other countries. 
I am not against helping other countries, but first I am for helping family farmers. We need trade policies that do not injure them. We need to help them. If they had any gumption, they would be at that dock out in California this week meeting the ship and suggesting that the ship should never be unloaded on American shores because it is symptomatic of everything that is wrong with our trade policy. 
Second, we ought to decide that it matters to have a support price for family farmers. No, it would not be a giveaway nor a subsidy to farmers. The subsidy in American food policy is that we have the highest quality food anywhere in the world for the lowest price anywhere in the world. We have a cheap food policy that provides a subsidy to the consumer. This is at the expense of family farmers who can't make a living because what they grow they have to sell at well below the cost of what it took them to grow it. 
That adds up to a deficit, and that adds up to serious trouble. 
In my judgment we ought to use every tool that is available to us as a country. Could the export enhancement program help? Maybe. Is it being used now? No. Why have we decided to disarm ourselves? The European Union uses their export subsidies to sell their grain from their family farmers into North African markets and they have 10 times the subsidies we have ever considered using. So, why does our country say, if they are going to take our African markets away from us, that is just fine, and we can't do anything about it? Would we disarm in any other way? Why would we disarm on trade competition? Why would we not say, on behalf of American producers, that we will stand up for you? This country believes in you. This country cares about you. Why on Earth will this country not decide that it will stand up for its producers? 
We, in my judgment, must begin as a Congress now to evaluate whether the path we are on from the previous farm bill passed a couple of years ago is the right path or the wrong path. It was called the Freedom to Farm bill. Part of it was just fine. Part of it was to take government out of the decision of what crops a farmer was going to grow. I supported that part. But part of it was a devastating blow to farmers. It said, by the way, we are going to pull the rug out from under you in price supports, and we are going to say to you, compete in the free market when in fact there is no free market. 
It asks our farmers--the Johnson's, the Larsen's, the Olson's, because I come from that part of the country where we have a lot of folks with those names--it asks those farmers to compete not just against French farmers, not just against German farmers or Italian farmers. It asks them to compete against all those governments as well that deeply subsidize their sales into foreign countries. 
I ask the question today of Congress and also this administration whether they are willing to stand up and ask some tough questions about agricultural policy in this country. Do family farmers matter? Do you care? When you fly across the Dakotas and Nebraska and Kansas and the breadbasket of our country at night and look out the window of an airplane, do you care whether you see yard lights? Do you care about our farmers out there who are trying to make a living with great risk? Do you care whether they really have an opportunity to make it? Do you think they provide worth to our economy? Or is this just an economy now which says bigger is better, concentration has virtue, and that mergers and combinations have merit, because they have the financial clout and the capability to suggest that an economic system that rewards size and rewards bigness is the best system. I don't necessarily believe that. 
Oh, I think the market system is a wonderful system, but I also believe that in this country agricultural producers have never experienced a free market and will never experience a free market unless substantial changes are made not just in this country but other countries as well. 
I want to make one additional point. We now have a number of countries in this world in which our farmers can't market because we have embargoed them through sanctions. We have said we don't want to do business with Cuba; we don't like Fidel Castro. So wherever Cuba is going to buy wheat, it is not going to be from the American farmer. In Libya, we don't like Qadhafi. So where is it going to get its grain. It is not going to be from this country. Iraq, well, in the last year or so, we have shipped them a bit, but not much. Most of Iraq's grain comes from elsewhere because everyone knows the problems with Iraq. 
I can go through a list of countries in which the American farmer pays a price because we have decided to embargo them. I happen to believe that you ought never under any circumstances decide to cut off shipments of food. Nobody is going to shoot food back at you. It seems to me it makes good sense in this country as a matter of public policy to decide that food shipments and food 
sales ought to be the last thing you would ever sever. We have a lot of hungry people in the world. It makes no sense to me to see a country with as bountiful an opportunity and as bountiful a harvest as we often get decide that somehow this grain doesn't have value. Gosh, I think this grain is more valuable than nuclear weapons. I think this grain is more valuable than most of what people produce. This is a hungry world and a growing hungry world. 
It breaks my heart to see family farmers write to me day after day and come to me in North Dakota as they did this weekend and call day after day and tell me that their dream is ending. 
A woman called a couple of weeks ago, and she began crying on the phone. She and her husband, just out of high school, began to farm. They have never done anything else. And they scraped and struggled and rented some land and then bought a little bit of land. She said, `We don't go to town on Saturday nights. We don't buy frills. We scrape by and we have always scraped by. We do nothing that is extravagant.' 
She said, `But, we finally have come to the end of the road. We are now in our mid-thirties. We have farmed for nearly 15 years and we have no other skills, but we just can't continue to make it unless farm prices improve. Our banker won't give us a loan. We can't put in the spring crop.' 
When you hear those stories, it breaks your heart because we are losing something valuable. 
I would conclude today by simply saying this: My colleague, Senator Conrad and I, have spoken on the floor I guess a half dozen times on this subject. We want people to understand that this issue matters. This makes a difference to our country. There is a big difference between the right public policies and the wrong public policies. One offers people hope and one despair. One will help move us forward in trying to nurture and protect and help family farms in our future and one will move us backward towards farm failures and desolation and despair on the family farm. 
Let me end as I began. North Dakota State University did a study and showed us that just in the last year there have been almost $400 million in losses in net farm income. That is $400 million just from those three crops: spring wheat, durum, and barley. The problem is that in that circumstance I have described in our State, family farmers just can't make it. 
Something has to change. We need better trade policy, better price supports, commodity loan rates that give farmers a chance to market when it is advantageous to them, not just to the miller or the grocery manufacturer. We must fight for changes in policies. I know my colleague, Senator Conrad, and others will be talking about this issue, but it is critically important. I will come to the floor again and again to talk about what we must do to solve this problem. 
Recently, Dale Thorenson, a farmer from Newburg, ND wrote an opinion letter for the New York Times. He had received a gift subscription to the New York Times from his father-in-law, and thought that as a new subscriber he should write an article about the conditions facing farmers in North Dakota. I don't know if it has been printed yet in the New York Times, but it did get printed in the Grand Forks Herald. I hope the Times does print it because he eloquently captures the economic and policy dilemma that now surrounds our nation's family farmers.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with the permission of the Senator from Michigan, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
Mr. President, I support the strongest possible defense against the most credible threats to our Nation s security. But I do not support this legislation, and I want to explain why. 
Nearly 30 years ago, the Department of Defense spent $21 billion in today's dollars on an antiballistic missile system. It was built in my State of North Dakota. The military declared that antiballistic missile system operational on October 1, 1975. On October 2, 1975, the next day, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to close it--mothball it. It was too expensive to run, and it didn't offer us much in the way of more security. It wouldn't protect this country. Mr. President, $21 billion for what? 
The bill on the floor today would require us to deploy a system as soon as it is technologically possible. A quarter century ago it was technologically possible to spend $21 billion and build an antiballistic missile site in North Dakota. That system had interceptor missiles with nuclear warheads on them. That was technologically possible. It was completely irresponsible, but it was technologically possible. 
I don't know whether this bill relates to that technology. The bill itself doesn't tell us what kind of technology we'd be required to deploy. 
I assume it relates to a hit-to-kill technology, where you try to hit one bullet with another bullet. The failure on Monday of a test flight for THAAD, a theater missile defense system, suggests that hit-to-kill is not nearly as possible as some suggest, at least not now. 
But I would ask the question: If it was technologically possible to create an antiballistic missile system in Nekoma, ND, a quarter century ago, it is technologically possible now, using the nuclear interceptor approach. Does this bill, then, require immediate deployment? 
Let's step back a bit and look at this bill in the context of the security threats this country faces. One threat is, indeed, a rogue nation, or a terrorist group, or an adversary getting an intercontinental ballistic missile and putting a nuclear warhead on it and having the wherewithal to aim it and fire it at this country. That is, in my judgment, a less likely threat than, for example, a terrorist group or a rogue nation getting a suitcase-sized nuclear device, putting it in the rusty trunk of a Yugo, parked on a New York City dock, and saying, `By the way, we now threaten the United States of America with a nuclear device.' 
The threat of a truck bomb or suitcase bomb, is that addressed by this bill's requirement to deploy a national missile defense system? No, this system doesn't defend us against that. How about a chemical weapon attack in the United States? No, this wouldn't defend us against a chemical weapons attack. A biological weapon attack here? No. A cruise missile attack, which is far more likely than an ICBM--a cruise missile attack? Cruise missiles are proliferating all around the world. Putting a nuclear device on the tip of a cruise missile and aiming at this country, would this bill defend us against that? No. It wouldn't defend us against that threat, either. A bomber attack, dropping a nuclear bomb? No. Loose nuclear weapons inside the old Soviet Union that must be controlled and we must be concerned about, does this deal with that? No. 
Obviously, this bill deals with one threat. And it is probably the less likely threat--an ICBM with a nuclear warhead aimed at this country by a rogue nation or by a terrorist group. 
But this bill tells us to deploy as soon as technologically possible--notwithstanding cost, whatever the cost. No matter that the cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office range up to nearly $200 billion to construct and maintain a national missile defense system. Cost is not relevant here, according to 
this bill. It requires us to deploy when technologically possible. 
This bill also requires us to deploy notwithstanding the impact on arms control. The fact is that strategic weapons are being destroyed, nuclear weapons are being destroyed. Different systems are being destroyed today in the Soviet Union as a result of arms control: arms control has destroyed 4,700 nuclear warheads; destroyed 293 ICBMs and 252 ICBM silos; cut the wings off of 37 former Soviet bombers; eliminated 80 submarine missile launch tubes; and sealed 95 nuclear warhead test tunnels. 
That is an awfully good way to meet the threat--destroy the missile before it leaves the ground. Arms control is giving us missile defense that works right now. 
I have shown my colleagues this before, and with permission I will do it again. This is a piece of metal from a silo in Pervomaisk, Ukraine. The silo held a Soviet missile aimed at the United States of America. There is no missile there anymore. The warhead is gone. The missile is gone. The silo is destroyed. And where this piece of metal used to be, in a silo holding a missile aimed at this country, there are now sunflowers planted. Not the missile--sunflowers. How did that happen? By accident? No. By arms control agreements, by treaties. 
But this bill says, deploy a national missile defense system notwithstanding what it might mean to our treaties, notwithstanding what it might mean to future arms control agreements, notwithstanding what it might mean to arms reductions that occur now under the Nunn-Lugar money that we appropriate, which has resulted in sawing off bombers' wings, resulted in digging up missiles buried in the soil of Ukraine and Russia. 
I just do not understand the rationale here. How can we get this notion of defending against a small part of the threats our country faces? This bill doesn't address the cruise missile threat, or the suitcase bomb threat, or a range of other threats. It just tries to address this sliver of threat. 
And this bill requires us to deploy a system as soon as technologically possible notwithstanding any other consideration, notwithstanding how much money we are going to ask the taxpayer to pay, notwithstanding what the credible threat is at the moment, notwithstanding the impact on arms control agreements. I just do not understand that logic. 
I must say I have the greatest respect for the author of this legislation. I think he is a wonderful legislator. I hate to oppose him on this, but I just feel very strongly that we should continue with the national missile defense research program. I might add that the Administration is seeking over $900 million for research funding for this program this coming year. We should continue that aggressive research. 
We ought to continue working on a range of defense mechanisms to deal with threats, not just ICBMs, but cruise missile threats and a range of other threats, including the terrorist threat of a suitcase nuclear device in this country. But we ought not decide that one of those threats ought to be addressed at the expense of defending against other threats. 
Mr. President, let me make one final point. I have told this story twice before on this floor because I think it is important for people to understand what is being done in the area of arms control and missile defense right now--not what is proposed to be done in this bill. 
On December 3 of last year, in the dark hours of the early morning, north of Norway in the Barents Sea, several Russian antiballistic submarines surfaced and prepared to fire SS-20 missiles. Each of these missiles can carry 10 nuclear warheads and travel 5,000 miles, and can reach the United States from the Barents Sea. 
Those submarines, last December 3, launched 20 missiles that soared skyward, and all of our alert systems knew it and saw them immediately and tracked them at Cheyenne Mountain, NORAD, you name it. 
And in a few moments at 30,000 feet all of those missiles exploded. 
Why? Because this was not a Russian missile attack on the United States. In fact, seven American weapons inspectors were watching the submarines from a nearby ship. These self-destruct launches were a quick and inexpensive way for Russia to destroy submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which it was required to do under our START I arms reduction treaty. 
On the morning of December 3 of last year when, at 30,000 feet, those Russian missiles exploded, it was not an accident. And it was not a threat to our country. It was a result of arms control agreements that said we must reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, we must reduce delivery systems. The fact is, the Nunn-Lugar program, which we fund each year in order to further these arms reductions, is working. 
We also should, as we make certain Nunn-Lugar continues, be concerned about the ABM Treaty, be concerned about a range of other threats, and we ought to invest money in research and development on the ballistic missile defense system. 
But we ought not under any set of circumstances say a system here must be deployed no matter what its cost, no matter what the threat and no matter what its consequences to arms control agreements. That is not in this country's interests. That is not in the taxpayers' interests. 
Does our country need to worry about the proliferation of nuclear weapons? Of course we do. The nuclear tests by India in just the last 2 days demonstrate once again that we have a serious problem in this world with respect to the proliferation of nuclear devices. 
But what it ought to tell us is that we need to be very, very aggressive as a Nation to lead in the area of nonproliferation. We need to make certain that this club that possesses nuclear weapons on this Earth does not expand. We need to do everything we possibly can do in foreign policy to try to see that our children and grandchildren are not victims of the proliferation, wide proliferation of nuclear weapons that then hold the rest of the world hostage. 
But in dealing with the various threats we face, it seems to me the question for all of us is what kind of threats exist? And what kind of credible defense that is both technologically possible and financially reasonable can be constructed to respond to those threats? This bill is not the answer to those questions. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I understand the minority leader, he is talking about the desire to bring to the floor of the Senate for a vote the patients' bill of rights. As the Senator knows, we have every day brought to the floor of the Senate a discussion about the specific problems that patients are encountering out in this country who have been hurt by managed care institutions or organizations and find that their health care decisions are all too frequently not made by the doctor in the doctor's office or in the hospital but by some insurance accountant someplace 500 or 1,000 miles away. 
And the result has been catastrophic for some of the patients in this country who have not been able to get the health care they need. As I understand it, this piece of legislation talks about the ability to get the health care you need from the doctor you choose, the ability to get to an emergency room when you need one, and a full range of similar concerns that affect patients. 
Is it the request of the minority leader that we have an opportunity to vote on that legislation this morning? And if not this morning, at least at a time certain at some point this year? As I understand it, there are some who don't ever want us to have an opportunity to deal with this issue, because the insurance industry and some others, who certainly don't want anybody tampering with the circumstances at all, prefer we not vote on this. But the American people understand we have a serious problem here that needs to be addressed. Is it the intention of the Senator to get a vote on this today or at some specific point in the future?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me add my congratulations to Senator Collins on the work that she has done, and certainly to the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings has asked me to be present for him. He is tending to other Senate business at the moment. 
This is an important piece of legislation. We appreciate very much the bipartisan work that was done to bring it to the floor of the Senate. 
I would like to just, for a couple of moments, give an overview of where we are and then bring it to this piece of legislation--and I will be rather brief--after which I will be interested in hearing from the Senator from Maine as well. 
The breathtaking changes in telecommunications and in the telecommunications industry in recent years have been quite remarkable. No one could have anticipated what we would see in technology and in opportunities that exist from the changing technology. 
I, in a speech some while ago, held up a vacuum tube, a small vacuum tube that we are all familiar with, and then I held up next to it a little computer chip that was about one-half the size of my little fingernail, and I said, `The little computer chip equals 5 million vacuum tubes.' Sometimes we forget to equate what is happening in these little chips and in their power and in their capability, but it is really quite remarkable what has happened to speed, storage density, memory and all the other things that relate to these breakthroughs. 
The CEO of one of the large companies, IBM as a matter of fact, in a report to the annual meeting that I had read, I guess, about 6 or 8 months ago, talked about the research they are doing in the area of storage density, which kind of relates to all this technology. 
And I was struck by what he said. He said we were on the verge of a breakthrough with respect to storage density, such that the time was near, he thought, when we would be able to store all of the volumes of work at the Library of Congress, which represents the largest volume of recorded human history anywhere on Earth--we would be able to store all of that, 14 million volumes of work, on a wafer the size of a penny. 
Think of that--carrying around in your pocket to slip into a laptop a wafer the size of a penny that contains 14 million volumes of work. Unthinkable? No. It is where technology is heading. 
In my little high school, where I graduated in a class of nine, we had a library the size of a coat closet. That high school now has access to the largest libraries in the world through the Internet. All of this is made possible by the breakthroughs in technology and the telecommunications industry and the development of the information superhighway. Many of us are very concerned, as public policy develops in all of these areas, that we make certain that the benefits of all of this are available to all Americans, that the on-ramps and off-ramps for the information superhighway, yes, stop even in my hometown, in my small county. 
So as we develop legislation such as the Telecommunications Act, which Congress passed a couple years ago, and try to evaluate what kinds of policy guidance we can give as this industry grows, it is very important that we do this right. 
I might say, as I begin, that I am concerned about universal service, about the availability of universal service--especially in telephone service--in the years ahead, in the high-cost areas and rural areas of our country. I hope very much that the Federal Communications Commission will make a U-turn with respect to some of the policy decisions they have made which I think threaten universal service in the future. There is still time for them to make some recalculations and some different policy judgments. I have met with Chairman Kennard and others, and I hope very much that they will make some different judgments than what we saw from the previous Chairman of the FCC, which I think will implement the Telecommunications Act, which is very detrimental to high-cost areas and rural areas of the country. We are going to debate that more in the months and years ahead. 
Let me talk specifically about the telecommunications area that does work and works well. One of the areas that works and provides the fruits and benefits of competition to virtually every American is the competition in long-distance telephone service. This is an area--long-distance telephone service--in which there is robust, aggressive competition. Anywhere you look, you will find a telephone company engaged in selling long-distance service. If you don't think so, just sit down for dinner some night, and somebody will give you a cold call from an office somewhere in a State far away, and they will be trying to sell you their long-distance service. They apparently only dial at mealtime--at least into our home. But I think every American is familiar with these telephone calls--`Won't you take our long-distance service?' As I indicated, up to 500 companies are robustly competing for the consumer dollar. What has happened to the cost of long-distance service? It has gone down, down, down. That represents the fruit and the benefit of good competition. 
But one other thing has happened with respect to this competition. As is the case where there is robust competition, there are also some bad actors. In this case, `bad actors' means that people get involved in this business of trying to sell a long-distance service to a customer that already has a long-distance provider but decides they are going to sell it the shortcut way--they are not even going to ask the consumer whether they want to change providers. Through sleight of hand, they are going to engage in a technological stealing of sorts; they are going to switch someone's long-distance service and not tell them about it. That is, in fact, stealing; that is, in fact, a criminal act. One might ask, is that happening a lot? Yes, it is happening a lot. 
Here is a story about the king of slammers. I was trying to evaluate where this word `slammer' came from. Frankly, nobody knows where the word `slammer' came from. But the definition of `slammer,' as it is used in this context, is someone who goes in and changes someone else's long-distance carrier without telling them and without authorization. It is stealing. It is criminal. 
The king of slammers is Daniel Fletcher. Let me cite him as an example. The head of the FCC, William Kennard, said, `This is truly a bad actor. He is a felon who clearly had intent to violate the FCC's rules, and we're hitting him hard.' But not too hard, because they haven't found him. He changed a half-million people's long-distance carrier, and he, apparently, made $20 million. Is that stealing? Yes. Is that petty cash? No; that is grand theft. The fact is, that goes on across the country all too often. 
Yesterday, Mr. President, on the floor, I held a clipping from the newspaper in North Dakota. It just so happened that, 
coincidentally, the North Dakota papers had a story that said that the North Dakota Attorney General had been the victim of slamming. Someone had decided to change the attorney general's long-distance carrier without asking her. 
Now, am I suggesting that slammers are stupid? Well, not always. They certainly seem to steal a lot of money. But is it a stupid slammer that decides they are going to change the long-distance service of an attorney general of a State without telling them? Yes, that is pretty stupid. But this is not about being stupid or funny, it is about stealing. The hearings that were held by Senator Collins, and others, and the work done has been to respond to a very real problem that is significant. 
Now, the FCC complaints about this slamming--the unauthorized change of a long-distance service--increased from 2,000 five years ago, to 20,000 last year. The FCC indicates that there is a substantial amount of slamming going on, evidenced by the complaints to the FCC. The GAO did a report that, in fact, was rather critical of the FCC's enforcement on these slamming issues, saying that the antislamming measures `do little to protect the consumers from slamming.' 
We have a problem; yet, we are not able to solve that problem with the regulatory agency, either because it is not doing what it ought to do, it doesn't exert enough energy, or perhaps it doesn't have enough authority. But whatever the reason--and it might be a combination of all of those reasons --this problem is not going away; it is growing much, much worse. 
In 1997, with 20,000 complaints, the FCC obtained only 9 consent decrees from companies nationwide that paid a total of $1.2 million in fines because of slamming. In the same year, California, by comparison, suspended one firm for 3 years because of slamming, and fined it $2 million, and ordered it to repay another $2 million to its customers. One State, the State of California, did far more than the FCC. I hope that this piece of legislation we will pass will give the FCC the authority, energy, and resources to join us and do what we must do to respond to this slamming. 
Now, let me read what the legislation does. It strengthens the antislamming laws and requires the FCC to establish the following consumer protections: 
One, it prohibits a carrier from changing a local subscriber's long-distance service, unless the carrier follows the minimum verification procedures prescribed by the FCC--sets up specific procedures that must be followed. 
Two, it requires carriers to keep an oral, written, or electronic record of a subscriber authorizing a change in their carrier. 
Three, it requires a carrier to send a written notification to the consumer informing them of the changed service within 15 days of the change in service. 
Four, it requires carriers to provide consumers with the information and procedures necessary to file a complaint at the FCC. 
Five, it requires carriers to provide slammed customers with any evidence that authorized that change. 
It allows the complaint process to impose stiff penalties, up to $150,000, and a range of other important issues that I think will give us much more enforcement against this slamming process and the slamming practice across the country. 
Once again, let me conclude by saying that this is not some minor nuisance issue; this is an issue in which some have taken advantage of consumers who are the victims. It is true that the company that has been changed is also a victim, a company that was serving a customer and is now not serving the customer. 
But the ultimate victim here are the consumers who only understand later after they have taken a look at a bill somewhere and discover they are the ones that have been victimized. 
This bill also, incidentally, would prohibit some other practices that are deceptive. There are a whole range of practices that have allowed people or persuaded people to sign a coupon in exchange for having an opportunity or a chance to get something, or get a free door prize, or get some sort of free gift. So you sign this little coupon. On the bottom in tiny little script it tells you that despite the fact that you have never read it, you have just signed away and changed your long-distance carrier. That is cheating. Where I come from, and I think where all of us come from, when you cheat and steal, somebody ought to be after you to get you. 
That is exactly what we want to have happen with respect to the enforcement against this kind of behavior and practice that is making victims of millions of Americans all across the country. 
This one fellow took one-half million households, changed their long-distance carrier, got $20 million into an income stream into shell corporations that he set up, and now he is gone. What does this mean? It means that one-half million Americans were cheated. This fellow stole from not only the companies but especially the Americans who expected to have a long-distance service they had contracted for and discovered someone else changed it. 
Let me again, as I began, say thank you to Senator Collins to Senator McCain, and to Senator Hollings and so many other. I am a cosponsor of this, as are a good number of our colleagues in the Senate, because it is good legislation and will do the right thing for consumers in this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I feel very comforted knowing that the Senator from Utah is a cochair of the task force along with Senator Dodd. I compliment the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senator Daschle for putting together a commission of the type they have established. I know, serving as ranking member of the legislative branch appropriations subcommittee of which Senator Bennett is chairman, that he has, in every circumstance, at every hearing, gone through in some detail this Y2K problem. He knows it well and is very concerned about it. 
As he properly indicates here in the Senate, this doesn't just deal with Federal agencies. In fact, that is only a very small fraction of what can be affected, unless this problem is dealt with as a nationwide priority. But I wanted to just say, as I have said before on the floor, I think Senator Bennett is one of the finest people serving in this body. He has devoted a lot of attention to this issue. If this is not handled properly all across this country in both the public and private sector, this could have catastrophic consequences. If handled properly, we probably won't even know that this situation came and went. But I just want to tell you that I feel comforted by his leadership. I thank him very much for all of the attention and 
time he has devoted to this. He and Senator Dodd will spend a substantial amount of time between now and the year 2000 on this very significant issue.

I was in China the day Wang Dan was sentenced to 11 years, I believe, in prison in China for criticizing his Government. And I saw Tiananmen Square, I say to the Senator, and I thought about that young man in the white shirt. 
You remember the picture during the demonstration in Tiananmen Square when the tanks came to break up the demonstrators and this young man in a white shirt walked out and stood in front of this column of tanks in front of the first tank and forced the tank to change course. Then he moved over again in front of the tank. 
I watched that. I thought, What on Earth must be inside of this young man? What kind of courage must it take to say, `I am going to stand in front of a tank and risk my life for freedom'? 
That is what the Senator from Minnesota is talking about with respect to the price that is paid by, in many cases, young people, and older people as well, who demonstrate to resist regimes that are oppressive and regimes that tend to try to squelch freedom of speech. 
So I think this country should always be vigilant about the need to stand up for those around the world who do that at their own peril. They are asking for only what we understand in this country makes a good society. That is freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of movement.

Mr. DORGAN. I would respond to the Senator by saying that I think, and have always thought, that our foreign policy must always have a human rights component to it. That is, it seems to me, what we owe to others around the world who struggle for freedom. And I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Minnesota in this matter. He is once again today calling the Senate's attention to the importance of human rights.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak first about the Congressional Budget Office, which last week released its monthly budget projection. And I noticed that this projection, this estimate, received prominent coverage in the Washington Post and in other major daily newspapers around the country last week. 
Actually, those papers may have mentioned this CBO report twice. First there were news stories saying says that the Congressional Budget Office now predicts that in this fiscal year --1998--we will have a budget surplus, they say, of anywhere from $43 billion to $63 billion. And in the next 24 and 48 hours, there was a spate of stories about a group of people telling us what they would like done with this alleged surplus. 
Just as quick as you can light a candle around here, any discussion about a surplus brings people who want to spend it or give it back in tax breaks. And very quickly they clustered around that flame of the surplus and told us what they thought should be done about this. 
I would like to simply say that the Congressional Budget Office does us no service when it gives us half the story. The Congressional Budget Office is a fine organization, and I mean no disrespect to the work of CBO or the people who do that work. And CBO is right to say that we have made substantial progress dealing with fiscal policy, and especially the Federal budget deficit in recent years. For a number of reasons, our deficits have shrunk dramatically. We have made remarkable progress. 
But we are not there yet, and we will not have and do not have a surplus this year. We will continue to have a deficit this year, 
albeit a much smaller deficit--shrunk dramatically from its previous size. We are continuing to make great progress, and we will have a surplus soon, but we will not have a surplus this year. Let me explain why. 
On April 2d of this year, this Senate passed a budget. I might add that this House still has not yet figured out what it wants to do on a budget. But in the Senate budget resolution, which billed itself as providing a budget surplus, on the fourth page, I believe, it admits that the actual deficit for fiscal year 1998 is going to be $95.6 billion. 
That is very much at odds with the Congressional Budget Office, which says, `Gee, things are rosy, and they are getting better. In fact, we will have a very significant surplus.' And we have people slicing up this estimate of a surplus, figuring out how to give it back or what to do with it when, in fact, our budget resolution says we are going to have a deficit this year of $95.6 billion. 
The key to the difference is in the Budget Act. The Budget Act says--this is law--`The concurrent resolution'--that is, the budget resolution--`shall not include the outlays and revenue totals' of the Social Security system. 
In other words, we have enshrined in the law the principle that the revenue of the Social Security system is dedicated tax revenue going into a trust fund to be used only for Social Security. And the revenue will be used for Social Security--because it will be needed in the long term. We all understand that. But this provision of law says that you can't use that revenue, you can't bring it out of that trust fund over here to the budget and say, `By the way, we have all of this revenue we are using over here and the budget looks great.' 
The law says you cannot do that. But the Congressional Budget Office report just ignores that law. They don't admit they re using the Social Security trust fund, but they, in fact, do it because that is the way they report. They say, well, we are going to have a $43 billion to $63 billion surplus in this year. How do they get that? By taking the Social Security trust fund money, adding it in as other revenues and saying, wow, we have a surplus. And so we have folks who are going to spend this alleged surplus, or create some new tax breaks to give back the supposed surplus before a surplus really exists. 
Now, my own vote on the surplus, if one develops, is to say let us begin to reduce the Federal debt just a bit. If for 30 consecutive years you increase the Federal debt, it seems to me that when times are good and you begin to have some significant progress in fiscal policy and you begin to run a real surplus, the prudent thing would be to begin to reduce the Federal debt. So that would be my vote. 
But we are not there yet. And I certainly do not support those who rush to this flame now and say, well, if CBO says there is a surplus, here is how we ought to deal with it: Let's provide some more tax breaks. Let's provide some more spending. 
What about let's do some honest accounting? What about let's say that the CBO, when it reports, if it reports, it must follow budget law and report to the American people the facts, not just half the story? 
So I come to the floor not to say there is not a parade going on--I guess there is a parade--but they are celebrating the wrong thing. Let us celebrate some success. We have had some major progress in fiscal policy. That progress is due in no small part, in my judgment, to the President's 1993 recommendations on a new fiscal policy. That plan required some effort to vote for it, but we did, and things are better. I would also say some restraint on spending by the Republicans and Democrats here in the Congress and also a growing economy have also helped our budget picture. 
All of that contributes to a better story on fiscal policy. But we are not at a real surplus yet. And the Congressional Budget Office knows better, as do the newspapers that print this. In fact, I sat with a reporter last Thursday just briefly just to say hello. We happened to see each other accidentally, and I said I read the story about the supposed budget surplus. I said, `You know that's not in surplus.' 
Well, that reporter understood about unified budget surpluses and on-budget deficits. But the fact is that CBO was reporting half the story last week, and the press dutifully reports it the way CBO says it, and CBO and everybody here knows they are wrong. 
So I hope those who began last week to talk about what they want to do with all this alleged surplus, and who will likely waste this week trying to figure it out, I hope they will take a look at page 32-33 of The Economic and Budget Outlook produced by CBO in January. There--not in the monthly review, but in the annual January report--CBO has a line that describes what the real deficit is. 
But that line is nowhere to be found on their monthly reports that they put on the Internet that resulted in last week's press statements. I hope CBO will change that, and put the information about the real state of our budget in its monthly reviews. And I hope the press picks up on that information and starts reporting it. 
That information will add enormously to our budget discussions this summer. Then we might have an honest debate on whether there really is going to be a surplus at the end of this fiscal year, a surplus that can be used for purposes other than Social Security. I don t think there will be, and I look forward to making that point.

Mr. DORGAN. And I shall object, but under my reservation let me point out, as I think the Senator from Arizona pointed out, no such agreement has been reached between the majority and minority leaders on these pieces of legislation dealing with the procedures under which they will be considered. All of the unanimous consent requests provide a limited time and limited amendments. I think in most cases only the managers' amendment would be allowed, which would then preclude amendments from other Members of the Senate. It is my hope that some kind of an agreement will be reached by the majority and minority leaders, but until such an agreement is reached, I am constrained to object, so I do object.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I do not think the question here is about the particular issues the Senator proposes to bring to the floor. In fact, most of them will have rather wide support. The question deals with the conditions under which they will be brought to the floor and on the restriction on amendments. As the Senator knows, that is a product of having to consult with other members of the caucus and the consultation between the majority leader and the minority leader. I know they are visiting, and I would expect and hope that that is resolved. But until it is resolved we must object, and I appreciate very much the understanding of the Senator from Arizona.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I certainly share the sentiment offered by the Senator from Arizona about the excitement of the Internet, the fascinating, remarkable growth of the telecommunications industry and all that it means for the future of our country and the world. Things are moving so quickly, and changing so rapidly, it is just breathtaking and very hard to keep up with. From a public policy standpoint, regarding the kind of legislation that will be brought to the floor of the Senate at some point--for example, such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act--it is very important that we understand exactly what we are doing and what the consequences of what we are doing might be now and in the future. 
I would say the increased commerce over the Internet, that is increasing at a very dramatic pace, illustrates that there is nothing at the moment, nothing anywhere that I am aware of at the moment, that impedes the transaction of commerce on the Internet. 
The very growth of that commerce suggests there are no impediments. One way to do commerce in this country is to set up a web page and advertise and sell books, automobiles, travel services, or whatever it is you want to advertise over the Internet. That is one way to do business. 
Another way to do business is to rent a storefront someplace to get some inventory moved in, hire some people, open the door and put `Open for Business' and invite customers to come in and look at your merchandise and sell merchandise that way. 
Still another way is to have your merchandise in a warehouse somewhere and send a catalog through the mail and do business through mail-order catalogs. 
If the Congress decides to change the state and local Tax Codes related to all of those different ways of doing business, it is very important that we not create a circumstance where one way of doing business has preference over another way. I certainly hope that whatever we do to those involved in Internet transactions, we will say, `To whatever extent you are advantaged by this new legislation, the Main Street businesses will be similarly advantaged.' 
The Internet Tax Freedom Act is very controversial in my judgment. The concerns Governors and many others have about what impact it might or might not have on the State and local revenue bases are serious. The Internet Tax Freedom Act is a very significant piece of legislation and it is very controversial. 
Another issue that the Senator from Arizona mentioned is the slamming issue. For those who are not familiar with slamming, it refers to the unauthorized practice of a company changing a consumer's telephone exchange service or telephone toll service. In other words, a company says if you are using one long distance service, we are going to change that and your new long distance carrier is XYZ, and all of a sudden you begin getting bills from XYZ when, in fact, you never authorized changing your long-distance carrier. That is called slamming, and it is a growing, continual problem in this country. 
The FCC had about 20,000 complaints of slamming in the last year. We understand the `king of slammers' identified by Chairman Kennard of the FCC is a man named Daniel Fletcher. GAO investigators allege that Fletcher switched at least a half million customers' long-distance service without their knowledge or consent. 
I noticed a story in the paper this past weekend in North Dakota that one of the victims of slamming was the attorney general of North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp. `Heitkamp Victim of Phone Billing Scam' reads one headline. 
This company that was slamming would have been well-advised to stay away from the attorney general of that State. 
I am confident that the North Dakota attorney general is on the case. She is aggressive and tough and will get to the bottom of who is involved in this slamming. 
To all the slammers out there I will say, `Senator McCain, I and others will bring a piece of legislation to the floor that will attempt to shut the door on slamming. But, slammers might want to stay away from attorneys general and law enforcement officers, because it is against the law. We hope, prior to the legislation being passed, we can count on State authorities and the FCC to take appropriate action to levy fines and other penalties against those who are involved in this kind of activity. 
There are a number of other issues we will discuss when we talk about slamming. I expect the U.S. Senate will pass this legislation by a wide, wide majority. It is a good piece of legislation. I compliment Senator McCain for bringing it to the floor. Only because the majority leader and minority leader have not talked and reached agreement on the question of procedure we are not able to proceed at this point. But I expect in the coming hours, when Senator Lott and Senator Daschle will find a mechanism by which we are able to consider this legislation. 
I just received a note from someone else, from another Senator 
in the Chamber that says, `I've been slammed twice.' I don't know if that Senator wishes to be identified. In any event, it is not something that only relates to attorneys general. I have not been slammed once, and I am not looking forward to the first slam. Hopefully, before that happens, this kind of legislation can pass. Those who have been victims will be victims no more, and those who have been involved in slamming will begin to pay a significant price for criminal behavior. 
Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the issues that we think is very important and needs to be addressed by this Congress is the issue of managed care. A number of us have, every day the Senate has been in session recently, brought to the floor stories of what is happening in health care in this country and examples why a Patients' Bill of Rights, which we would like to see the Congress enact, would be beneficial to the American people. 
Today I want to tell you about a man named Frank Wurzbacher of Alexandria, Kentucky. Fred received monthly injections of a drug called leupron as treatment for his prostate cancer. Under his retiree health plan, that treatment, which cost $500 per injection, was fully covered. 
When a different insurance company took over as the plan administrator, however, the new company notified Mr. Wurzbacher that his coverage for this treatment was reduced from 100 percent to only two-thirds of the total cost. In other words, rather than paying the full $500 for the shot, the company would pay only $320. 
At the time, Mr. Wurzbacher was a 66-year old retiree. He didn't have the extra $180 a month for the leupron injections, so he asked his physician what his alternatives were. The physician said the aggressiveness of the cancer suggested that the only other alternative was the removal of the patient's testicles. 
The surgery was approved. Mr. Wurzbacher had that surgery and then returned home from the hospital to find a letter from the insurance company notifying him that it had made a mistake and that his plan would, in fact, pay the full $500 for the monthly leupron injection. But by then, of course, it was too late; the surgery had been done. 
That should not have happened to Mr. Wurzbacher and would not happen if the Patients' Bill of Rights were law. Under the Patients' Bill of Rights, there would have been an appeal of the new plan administrator's decision and that appeal, perhaps, would have then disclosed that the coverage for leupron was in fact fully available. Mr. Wurzbacher would not have had to go through his operation. Of course, no one can turn back the clock, and Mr. Wurzbacher is just one more victim of decision-making by those who all too often see medical care as a function of dollars and cents and the bottom line, rather than as a function of saving someone's life. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights simply says that those 160 million Americans who are now herded into managed care organizations for their health care have certain rights. One of those rights ought to be the right to be told all of your medical options for the treatment of your disease, not just the cheapest option. 
You also ought to have a right to appeal an adverse decision that is made about your health care by your managed care plan. Such an appeal may very well have prevented the kind of tragedy that was visited on Frank Wurzbacher of Alexandria, KY. 
Mr. President, we hope very much that Republicans and Democrats together this year will agree that the issue of managed care and the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights should be brought to the floor of the Senate and addressed not only in the Senate, but also by legislation enacted by Congress this year. We will continue to discuss on the floor of the Senate the stories of the problems people face, one by one across this country, with managed care when managed care organizations view health care as a function of someone's profit and loss statement. 
Let me conclude by describing, as I have on previous occasions, an interesting front-page story in the New York Times about a woman who had suffered a severe brain injury and was being transported by ambulance to a hospital. She had the presence of mind, as her brain was swelling from this injury, to tell the ambulance driver she wanted to be transported to the hospital farthest away. She said this because she knew that the closer hospital, which was affiliated with her health care plan, had a reputation for treating emergency room care as a function of the bottom line. She wanted to go to an emergency room in which someone looked at her and did what needed to be done in every circumstance, against all odds, to save her life. She was fearful enough of going to a hospital where she would be viewed as a function of someone else's bottom line that she wanted to be transported to the hospital farther away. 
That relates to this issue. Should health care that relates to a specific patient's condition be practiced in a doctor's office or a hospital, or should decisions about a patient's health care be made in an insurance office 2,400 miles away by some accountant? The American people understand what the answer to that question should be. The answer is embodied in a proposal called the Patients' Bill of Rights. That proposal has been introduced here in the Senate, and I hope very soon that we can bring a proposal of this type to the floor of the Senate and discuss these central questions about health care in this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me associate myself with the remarks just made by the Senator from New York, and let me also say that the work that has been done by Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan to bring this legislation to the floor is work that will benefit all of America. I think this legislation has a great deal to commend it to the Congress and the American people. 
It is true that in recent hearings evidence of misconduct and mismanagement, and, yes, in some cases the abuse of taxpayers by the Internal Revenue Service by a few employees of the Internal Revenue Service, has cast a shadow over that organization. 
A recent speaker indicated, I believe it was Senator McCain, that he was certain--and I share that view--that by far the majority of the men and women who work in the Internal Revenue Service are good people who do good work and try to do the best job they can. But because of the abuse by some few agents in the Internal Revenue Service, we must take steps to make sure it never happens again. 
This piece of legislation brought to the floor of the Senate creates a nine-member oversight board. The purpose of that board and its duties is to oversee the administration, the management, the conduct, to provide some assistance and some guidance and some additional management, to make certain that we never again convene a hearing and hear of abuses by IRS agents of the American taxpayers. In short, this legislation, in many ways, is an attempt to restore credibility by restructuring the Internal Revenue Service and creating an oversight board. 
The two goals, it seems to me, are: One, to make the changes necessary to make certain that this behavior never again occurs, and to prevent this kind of taxpayer abuse from surfacing again, because we want to prevent it from ever happening again; No. 2, to enforce the tax laws so that the many citizens in America who pay their taxes will have some confidence that the few who try to avoid them will be required to meet their responsibility. Those are the two elements that are important here. 
The amendment offered by the Senator from Florida would strike from the nine-member oversight board the Treasury Secretary. I agree with the Senator from New York, who says that this board will not be a significant and important board unless it has as part of its membership the Secretary of the Treasury. Part of it is about accountability, but part of it is about whether or not this will be a significant oversight board. I believe very strongly that the membership on this board is going to contribute to the effective workings of the Internal Revenue Service, but it must include the Treasury Secretary. 
For all of the reasons I think that have been articulated by others who have spoken before, let me just again say that I hope we will defeat this amendment and I hope we will pass this underlying piece of legislation with a very significant vote today. 
I must say as well, I regret opposing an amendment offered by my friend from Florida, for whom I have the greatest respect. I know he supports the purpose of this bill, to give assurance to the American people that we have an agency that can do what we expect a tax collection agency ought to do, while at the same time protecting the rights of all the American people. 
I will vote against this amendment but will be pleased to vote for the underlying bill. 
Again, I commend Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for the work they have done to bring this to the floor of the Senate. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. I venture to say most Members of the Senate are not very familiar with this issue because the bill was brought to the floor and a mechanism to pay-for--it is brought to the floor this morning; I guess it was disclosed yesterday. 
As I looked at it, it seems to me it is exactly as the Senator from Nebraska described. But even more than that, it is a device by which you bring some money here and say this is really paid for but. In fact, the cost in the outyears is very substantial. 
It is just a timing issue, kind of a clever timing issue, but in my judgment not a very thoughtful way to do this bill.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Reid from Nevada. I believe the amendment has been worked out. 
Let me describe it briefly. As I describe this amendment, let me say that the issue that is addressed in this bill dealing with the behavior of the Internal Revenue Service is an important issue. Stories with respect to hearings that have been held here in recent months, stories of abuse and taxpayer harassment, are stories that reflect horrible mismanagement, in my judgment, at the Internal Revenue Service. 
This bill serves notice that that kind of behavior will not ever be tolerated at the Internal Revenue Service. This piece of legislation gives taxpayers some muscle to fight back when and if this occurs, and this piece of legislation makes some management changes at the Internal Revenue Service, some structural changes, to make sure the mismanagement does not occur again. 
Now, there is another issue, however, that is important and this issue has not been the subject of hearings. That is the issue of enforcement. You must have a tax system to collect the money to do the things we need to do as a country--provide for our common defense, to pay for roads, to pay for health research, to pay for food safety, to pay for environment protection. So who pays those taxes? What kind of agency collects them and who pays the taxes? 
We want to make sure our tax laws are enforced sufficiently so that some of the largest economic interests are not getting by paying zero taxes while the working families, who get out, go to work and work all day, and have a salary or a wage and have withholding taken out of their check, pay their taxes because they have no choice and no flexibility. 
A recent study done by the GAO says foreign-controlled corporations doing business in the United States and not paying taxes equal 73 percent of all foreign corporations doing business here. Let me say that another way. If you think of the brand names of foreign products that you purchase in this country, just the most common brand names of companies who sell billions of dollars' worth of products in this country, and make billions of dollars in net income in this country, you can be sure that some of those names you just thought of are part of this 73 percent who do business here, make money here, and pay no taxes here--none, none at all. Seventy-three percent of foreign-controlled corporations doing business in the United States pay zero in Federal income taxes. 
Now when they come here and compete against a U.S. corporation that does business only here and must pay taxes only here, they are engaged in unfair competition because they do business here tax free while our domestic business pays a tax to our country. This deals with tax enforcement. 
The reason I offer this amendment is I want to just describe in a moment how tax avoidance occurs in this area and why it is important to have an Internal Revenue Service that is making sure these corporations pay their fair share of taxes in this country as well. 
There have been a number of studies--a GAO study, a Treasury study, an IRS study, a study by two professors from Florida, Pak and Zdanowicz. Let me show Members what these studies have told us. Corporations, in this case foreign corporations doing business in this country, can simply inflate the cost of what they are selling to their U.S. subsidiary that they wholly own, and when they inflate the cost of the product they are selling to their wholly owned subsidiary, their subsidiary in the United States ends up doing a lot of business but ends up paying no taxes because they say they made no profits. 
Let me give you an example of pricing. Tweezers. A pair of tweezers for $218. You have been to a drugstore or a grocery store and bought tweezers. Did you pay that for tweezers? I don't think so. Tweezers are priced at $218 so that a foreign corporation can overcharge to the domestic subsidiary and, therefore, take all the profit out of that subsidiary and claim they made no profit in the United States. 
How about safety pins for $29 each? That is $29 for a safety pin. That is another way to price your profit out of the United States and show no income and pay no taxes to the United States. 
How about a toothbrush imported into the United States from France for $18 apiece? Has anybody here bought a toothbrush for $18 apiece lately? 
There is another way to do this, by the way, which is that corporations can have a foreign subsidiary in another country and they underprice their export to that foreign subsidiary, and that tends to move profits away from the United States as well. 
Let me tell you what they do there. How about a piano, selling a piano to a company in Brazil for $50? Or what about tractor tires, selling a tractor tire to France for $7.69? Do you think U.S. farmers are able to buy a tractor tire for $7.69? How about a bulldozer for $551? You all know what a bulldozer looks like. Do you think you can buy that for $551? How about a missile-rocket launcher for $58? That is the way you move income around and end up not paying income tax to the United States of America, when all the rest of the taxpayers here pay the tax. 
My point is very simple. How do you enforce what is called arms-length transactions between related corporations? Well, you take all their transactions and try to put them back together and measure whether they are priced in a way that would represent fair market prices. That is like taking two plates of spaghetti and trying to attach the ends of the spaghetti. It cannot be done. The result is billions and billions and billions of dollars--some estimates are over $40 billion a year--are lost to the U.S. Treasury through massive tax avoidance, while we are worried about whether people who go to work every day pay their taxes--and they do pay them because they don't have any flexibility; they can't get out of it and they can't overprice tweezers to $18 and tractor tires to $7.60. They pay their tax. 
I want the IRS to worry about enforcement of our tax laws with respect to those who are doing business here to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, earning income here to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, and paying zero to this country in taxes. American firms that do business here must pay taxes; so too should foreign companies. 
The amendment I offered is very simple. It simply requires the Internal Revenue Service Oversight Board that we are creating to conduct a study of whether the IRS has the resources needed to prevent the tax avoidance by these companies. In other words, do they have the resources to enforce in this area, No. 1; and No. 2, to analyze how much we are losing in this area of tax avoidance. 
It is, in my judgment, scandalous. I refer anybody who is interested to the study by Pak and Zdanowicz, released not long ago. They are two Florida doctors who say that the U.S. Government was cheated out of $42.6 billion in tax revenues in 1997. That is a huge area. 
I heard all this discussion on the floor about the IRS targeting low-income folks. That represents a different sort of enforcement. That deals with the earned-income tax credit. That is why that is happening. What about targeting the folks doing business here and not paying taxes here, who are earning billions of dollars every year in the United States in profits and using price transfers to price their income out of this country and shield it from the U.S. taxpayer? Shouldn't they have to pay income tax on their profit as well? 
My amendment requires the oversight board to do certain things and report back to Congress within a year. I hope that perhaps this will stimulate some activity to take a look at this area and to see if we can't get the taxes that are owed this country by foreign corporations doing business in this country, making a great deal of money and paying nothing--literally zero--in Federal income taxes. My understanding is that this amendment has been cleared on both sides and, if so, I would only need a voice vote.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, Senator Conrad has raised the farm issue the last several days on the floor of the Senate, and I appreciate the comments he has made, as well as the comments of the Senator from Montana. 
This is not just about dollars and cents. And it is not just a lesson in economics. My great-grandmother homesteaded in North Dakota when her husband died. She took six kids and homesteaded on the prairie, pitched a tent, homesteaded 160 acres, and began to run a farm. It was a hard, tough life, I am sure. Farming is not easy. They live out in the country. They have a yard light burning at night. Farmers get up in the morning to do chores, and they work all day. If they have enough money to put in a spring crop and plant some seeds, they wonder whether the grasshoppers will come, whether crop disease will come, whether it will hail and wipe out their crop. Maybe none of that will happen and they will raise a crop and that crop will come out of the ground. Then they will combine it in the fall and they wonder, will there be a price so they can sell the crop at something more than it cost to produce. 
The answer, sadly, except for one year in the past 20 years has been no. There is no price for your crop above the full economic costs of production. You do what you love to do and you lose money. 
The article in the Wall Street Journal referenced today by Senator Conrad talks about these farmers who decide they can't do this anymore. They just quit. They have to quit. 
I had a banker call me about two hours ago and he said, `You know we only call when there are real problems, and you know I have one of the most conservative banks in the state.' He said, `The fact is I am now turning away good farmers. Year after year after year I have given them operating loans to go into the field in the spring. I can't do it this year because they can't cash flow. And they will have to quit farming.' He said, `That is what is happening out here in rural America.' 
One might ask, why does it matter? And some people in this Chamber think it doesn't matter who farms. Why does it matter that we have a family farmer out on the land? Well, you can have corporate agrifactories gassing up their big tractors and farming coast to coast and you won't have anybody living out in rural America. 
Is there a difference between having a network of family farms, and farm families that dot the landscape of this country, versus having corporate agrifactories that gather up land by the sections and the townships and the counties and then farm as far as the eye can see forever? Is there a difference? It seems to me there is a huge difference for this country. 
For social and economic reasons, this country ought to care about having a network of families out on the farms in this country being able, year after year, to produce food for this country. If 
we continue to go in the direction we are headed, we will see thousands and thousands of family farmers leaving the land. It is because we have a farm policy that says you can't make a living out there. It tells family farmers you can't make it. Then this country will have lost something significant. 
The seedbed of family values in this country that we hear so much about has always been the family farm. These values roll in from the seedbed of the family farm into small towns and into America's cities. We will lose something important in this country if we do not decide family farms are important and that we will do something to try to protect them. 
Some say in this Chamber, let farmers operate in the free market. Well, there is no free market. Do you think farmers can raise a cow and ship it to China? I think not. Can they raise a pig and sell it in China? I don't think so. Do you think farmers can compete against Canada, which sends unfairly subsidized durum into our markets? Can farmers compete against the European communities that subsidize their commodities at 8, 10, and even 12 times the level of U.S. subsidies in recent years in trying to get foreign markets for European wheat? Is that fair? Is that free? I don't think so. Yet, we tell our farmers, you just go ahead and operate in that marketplace. We will just call it free. 
What happens in this free marketplace? What happens is that the people who haul the grain make record profits. 
The people who process the grain make record profits. The people who trade the grain make record profits. 
The only people who suffer the losses year after year, sufficient so that they are now going out of business in record numbers, are the people who buy the tractors, get up in the morning and plant the seed in the ground, harvest the crop in the fall, and try to sell it. Those are the people who are losing money. 
You go to your grocery store and ask yourself a question. When the price of wheat was $4.50 or $5.50 a bushel and it plummeted to $3.30 a bushel, ask yourself what happened to the price of a loaf of bread in the grocery store. Did you see that price come down? I don't think so. How about when the price of beef plummeted? Did you go to the meat counter in your grocery store and see that the price of beef came down? I don't think so. 
What does it say about this economic system of ours when we say to the people who do the hard work, the people who wear the work clothes, and start the tractor, and plow the ground, and plant the seed, and harvest: `You can't make any money. It is everybody else in this process who can make record profits. But if you grow the seed, you lose money.' 
When they take that wheat into a processing plant and puff it up and sell it on the grocery store shelf as puffed wheat breakfast food, they can charge more for the puff than the farmer is going to get from the wheat. One suffers and goes out of business, and the other makes a record profit. 
If this Congress and this country doesn't start caring a bit about whether we have family farmers in our future, this country is going to lose something very important. When we talk about this subject around here, everybody talks about economics and dollars and cents. This isn't just about dollars and cents. This is not about knowing the cost of something. This is about knowing the value of something. We need to know the true value of family farmers in this country. 
I am enormously frustrated. This article in the Wall Street Journal chronicles what we see and what we know every day in the streets of North Dakota, in our small towns, and out on the country roads, and the same is true in Montana. We have heard it farmers who come to our meetings and stand up. One farmer comes to mind who came to a meeting of mine. He was a big, burly guy and had kind of a beard. It was not a long beard, but kind of a short beard. He had friendly eyes. He stood up. He was a tall fellow. He said, `My granddad farmed, my dad farmed, and I have farmed for 23 years.' And then his chin began to quiver. He got tears in his eyes, and he said, `But I have to quit this year because I don't have the money to continue. I'm out of business.' 
He was the third generation in the family to farm. He was going out of business because this country has a farm policy that says we are going to pull the safety net out from under family farmers. Now, we had better reconnect that safety net if this country cares about having a family farmer left in its future. 
Senator Conrad, myself, Senator Baucus, Senator Daschle, Senator Wellstone, and so many others on both sides of the aisle, care about the future of family farmers. We must, it seems to me, convince the rest of this Congress that this current approach is an approach that leads to failure. 
Let me read a paragraph in the Wall Street Journal article:  
The situation in Kittson County suggests that deregulation-- 
Which is the description of the current farm policy, which I voted against proudly-- 
is staying, and for a grim reason: Farmers are giving up. Nobody is organizing the type of protests that attracted national attention the last time so many farmers here were in trouble. That was in the mid-1980s debt crisis, when Randy Swenson would travel from his Kittson County farm to Fargo and Bismarck to join demonstrators demanding a federal bailout. Now, the 46-year-old grower is just quitting. 
I say to those out there on the family farm who have 
struggled, who risk everything in trying to make a living every single day--and I hope my colleagues will join me in this--that they ought not to give up hope. There are plenty of us in Congress who understand that family farming is a way of life that this country ought to nurture and protect and help in its future. 
I hope, as we proceed to discuss this in the coming weeks, that we can impress the need for a change upon those who were the architects of this farm program. The current program puts farmers into the marketplace, whatever that marketplace happens to be. There are those who think this is fine, because after all they think it is a free marketplace. I hope they come to understand that the marketplace is not free. It has never been free. 
We can't have farmers compete against unfair trade. We can't have farmers compete in a marketplace dominated by millers who want low prices in the marketplace and grocery manufacturers who want lower prices in the marketplace. We can't ask them to compete against scab disease that will wipe out the crop yield and crop quality. We can't ask them to compete against a railroad that will haul their grain to market but charge them 20 or 30 or 40 percent more than is justifiable. 
If somebody thinks that is a free marketplace, then somebody doesn't know what `free' or `marketplace' really means. We can do better than that. There are enough of us here to raise enough dust to require that we do better, so that in the coming days some of this policy can change to be helpful to family farmers.

Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. I just hope that as we finish these comments now, we will all understand that there is work to do. When you see reports like this--reports that don't surprise us because we have been hearing it for some long while--we should understand that while part of this country is doing quite well and there is a lot of good economic news, there are also troubled spots in our economy that are causing enormous hurt and pain to people who don't deserve it. 
America's family farmers are wonderful people. They are the people in this country who work, who grow, who risk, who come together, neighbor to neighbor, to help each other. But they can't help each other when they go to the market and discover that the price of wheat is $3 or $3.30, or when they go to the field and discover that scab wiped out half the quantity of their grain, or when they go to the railroad and discover that the price to haul the wheat to market is vastly inflated, or when they go to the border up in Canada and discover unfair shipments of grain that undercut their prices, or when they say, I would like to sell my wheat to China, or my beef to China, but you can't get wheat or meat into China in any meaningful quantity because we don't have open markets overseas. 
It is not fair to put farmers in that position, and we should not. It seems to me that we have a responsibility to provide a basic safety net if we want to protect a network of family farmers to be present in this country's future. I think we ought to do that. I think it is a priority for us in this Congress, and I hope 
that a number of us can work together on a bipartisan basis to see that this occurs in the coming weeks and months. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the story that was just described by my colleague, Senator Conrad, is one that occurs all too often across this country in this new era of managed care. Every day we intend to describe the circumstances of managed care in this country that require us to bring a Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor. Every day we will discuss this issue on the floor of the Senate, hoping that we will be able to persuade those who schedule the Senate to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights to the Senate. 
Every person in this country seeking health care ought to have a right to know all of their options for treatment, not just the cheapest option for treatment. Everyone seeking health care in this country ought to have a right to show up in an emergency room and get necessary treatment for an emergency medical need. The list goes on. That is why we want to see a piece of legislation called the Patients' Bill of Rights brought to the floor of the Senate.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for the remaining moments I will speak on the subject of agriculture. I know it is probably something a lot of people do not think about or don't want to talk much about. Family farmers in my State are in trouble. At night when you fly across my State in a small airplane and look down, those family farmers have the brilliant yard lights that peek up at you. Each of these points of light represent a family living in the country, trying to make a living on the family farm. 
Recently there was an editorial cartoon in the Forum newspaper of Fargo, ND, showing a truckload of family farmers going down the road surrounded by a landscape of farm problems, including low prices, crop disease, and inadequate programs. The road sign in the cartoon stated, `The point of no returns.' Why? Here is what is happening to the price of wheat. We passed a new farm bill and the price of wheat goes down, and down. Wheat prices are down 42 percent since May of 1996, following the passage of the new farm law. The point is that the new farm law pulls the rug out from under family farmers in terms of a safety net and tells the farmers, `Go to the marketplace to get your price.' Then the marketplace has a pathetically low price, and farmers go broke. 
I had a farm meeting in Mandan, ND, and a fellow stood up. He was a big burly guy with a beard. He said his grandfather farmed, his dad farmed, and he has farmed for 23 years. His chin began to quiver, and he began to get tears in his eyes, and he said, `I can't keep farming. I am forced to quit this year.' 
We have all heard the stories. One by one. I suppose people say that is just one farmer. Yet `one by one' means that across this country, there are hundreds and thousands of farmers leaving farming. It is especially evident in my State. When farmers can't make a living and go out of business, it seems to me that is an enormous step backwards. Family farmers contribute something very important to this country. 
Family farmers have had to fight several things in my State recently. They had to fight the weather. We went through a winter in which we had 3 years' worth of snow in 3 months. We had seven blizzards, the last of which put nearly 2 feet of snow on the ground. It was the worst blizzard in 50 years. Farmers had to fight that. Then they had to fight low prices. Then they had to fight a crop disease known as fusarium head blight or scab which wiped out a quantity of their crop. And, then they have to fight a Congress and a farm policy which has been constructed by people in Congress who say it doesn't matter who farms. 
These folk think agrifactories are fine. They can farm as far as the largest tractor will go, until it runs out of gas, and that is fine with them. It is not fine with me. If we end up with a land of giant agrifactories farming America's farmland, we will have lost something forever in this country that is very important. As a matter of social and economic policy, we ought to fight with every fiber of our being to make sure we have a network of families living out on the farms in this country's future. 
I watched one day when somebody came in that door, breathless, and walked to the floor of the Senate on the supplemental appropriations bill and offered an amendment for $177 million to be added to star wars national missile defense system. They added $177 million that wasn't even asked for. But that wasn't a problem. It was accepted by consent. A total of $177 million was added early in the morning. That was OK with this body because it was for star wars. 
But somehow we don't have enough money to provide a decent wheat price for a family farmer who is struggling out there. 
I got a letter from a man and his wife who quit farming recently. The letter is from George and Karen Saxowsky, of Hebron, ND. I will read just a couple of paragraphs, since I have 2 more minutes. It describes for those who don't know about family farming what this family went through. She wrote a Christmas letter and described part of what they went through in the storms. She talked about the last blizzard. 
I will read a couple paragraphs: 
As the storm abated Sunday evening I could hear Glendon yelling and ran to see what was going on now, but couldn't find him. Here, they had found a cow laying on its side drowning in muck. Glendon was laying flat on his belly holding the cows head out of the muck while George was trying frantically to get the tractor down to him. I plowed through four foot deep snow to help--the first tractor got wet and quit. [All during the storm we had distributor caps in the oven drying out!] He got the Bobcat--it quit; he got the next tractor and we made it down there, tore a fence down, put chains on the cow and pulled her out. She died; as did a calf that had been buried in the snow someplace in the ten feet we pulled the cow and we didn't even see, until the snow melted enough, that it was under her; as did those two calves in the basement; as did a calf that had followed its mother to the water fountain, got stuck in the snow and froze to death standing up--we must have walked by that calf fifty times but with the blizzard didn't see it--they get snow covered really fast; as did the cow in the corral with a roof over her head with water and hay right beside her; as did--well, you get the picture. It continued for fourteen days after the storm, every day we lost at least one cow and/or calf. We took them to the vets for autopsies and what-not but it just seemed there was nothing we could do to save them. One day we made it to 5:00 without any dying and thought the curse was broken but by midnight we had lost a cow and a calf. It was a terrible, terrible time, but we lived through it--but not alone. Friends were there for us. On the Friday after the storm one called to tell us to get out of the house and come to town for a Fireman's Dance--we were just too exhausted and depressed--but he was really pushy (he did the same thing for us after last year's cow incident on I-94). We went and visited with other farmer-ranchers who were in the same boat--it really was so helpful and encouraging? 
We were really dreading the first snow of this winter. Long about October, George started talking about quitting farming--I took it as a mid-life crisis; a one time slide. But he kept talking--and then started making plans. We would put in a crop in '98 and quit in '99. I still thought `this-too-shall-pass' but he just go more serious. In November I started getting calls asking if I would like a job off the farm? I have to tell you, I was so flattered that they even considered me capable of doing what they needed; I had been self-employed for almost 25 years! I turned them down, but it did start the wheels turning. Then, there was an ad in the paper for a job in Hebron with benefits. We talked about it and I applied; they offered me the job and I took it. This was not easy, now we couldn't put a crop in this spring as the job is 40 hours a week including every other Saturday and George can't farm without me. 
The bottom line is: a 47 year old, 4th generation farmer in this 27th year of farming is quitting farming. 
This is why this farm couple is quitting farming. It is not just because of the storm and the dead cattle. It is about making a living and getting some return for their efforts. 
North Dakota farmers had a decline of $750 million in farm income in 1997. Low prices, crop disease, weather. Senator Conrad pointed out that 98 percent of the net income of farmers was washed away by this set of problems. And, there is one more problem that farmers face. They face a Congress that doesn't seem to care whether there are family farmers. 
The new farm program pulls the rug out from under our family farmers. They are told to go to the marketplace to get their price. When they go there, the big millers are there and the big grocery manufacturers are there, and the big grain traders are there. They all want lower prices, so they drive prices down so when family farmers go to the marketplace, they find pathetically low prices, well below their costs of production for grain. 
The fact is they lose money year after year because farm prices are consistently below the full economic costs of production. Then they suffer through crop disease on top of it all, and find out the crop insurance program doesn't work. When they turn to the safety net, they find that, no, that has been pulled away. When they ask what is the loan rate on a bushel of wheat, they find it is the lowest it has been in decades. 
So the question is: Is somebody here going to start to care about whether we have family farmers or not? Or is the priority here that you can waltz through these doors and offer a couple hundred million dollars for star wars, and get plenty of money for things like that; but when it comes to family farmers we don't have enough money for a decent support price to help them stay on the farm? 
Mr. President, I and others will be talking about this in the coming days. I hope, as we search for some solutions, this Congress will decide family farmers are worth finding solutions for, and that we will develop a better farm program, one that really works to provide protection for family farmers. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to visit about a couple of things this morning. First, I want to talk about the highway bill that is in conference between the House and the Senate. It is now May 4, 1998. The highway bill, or a piece of legislation people commonly refer to as ISTEA (the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) was supposed to have been completed last year, but it was not. The highway bill was extended until May 1, and then the authorization for the highway bill expired. 
We are now on May 4 without highway legislation that is authorized, and the highway officials and Governors around the country are wondering, appropriately, what is going to happen to this highway bill? With what authority can I obligate money? What about the projects we have to do in our States to build roads and repair bridges? 
I don't blame State and local highway officials and others who are rightly furious with the Congress that it has not gotten its work done. It is a shame, in my judgment, that almost a year after the legislation should have been done, not only was the legislation not done, but we have already had an extension and that has expired. Now, here we are with no highway bill at all. 
I ask those who run this Congress and those who are convening the conference on the highway bill, let's decide to get this thing done. This isn't rocket science; it is building highways. We know how to do that. If the political will doesn't exist to do what is necessary to reach a compromise on a highway bill, then I suppose that those who run the Congress should say to the Governors and the highway commissioners, `We can't be counted upon to do this work.' 
I hope in the coming days people will understand the urgency of this. I come from the State of North Dakota, and we have a relatively short construction season. It is not fair to our States for this Congress not to do its work on time. We should do it, it ought to be done, and it ought to be done soon.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk for just a moment about the tobacco legislation that is to be brought to the floor of the Senate. My understanding is that we will consider, in the next perhaps month, the tobacco legislation that was enacted by the Senate Commerce Committee, of which I am a member. 
The Senate Commerce Committee considered a comprehensive tobacco bill. We passed it, and the vote was 19 to 1. The legislation is controversial, to be sure, and the tobacco industry has now ratcheted up an enormous amount of money and energy directed at trying to kill the bill. 
I thought it would be interesting to read into the Record a few comments here and there dealing with the tobacco companies and why they are so interested in killing this tobacco legislation. We will see an enormous amount of money spent on advertising to try to kill this legislation. 
My colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, chaired a task force on the issue of tobacco and created a piece of legislation. He has done a wonderful job, in my judgment, dealing this with issue, and the Senate could well take its cues from the work Senator Conrad has done. Incidentally, the Senate Commerce Committee took much from the legislation Senator Conrad introduced in the Congress. 
The reason we are concerned about the tobacco issue is the targeting of teenagers in this country to get them to smoke. I have said before on the floor that almost no one reaches age 30 and wonders, `What more could I do to fulfill my life?' and decides they should start smoking. Almost no one reaches majority age and says, `Gee, what am I missing?' and concludes what they have really missed is, they have not smoked and they need to start smoking cigarettes. The reason they don't arrive at that answer is that by that age, they know that cigarettes can kill you. 
Mr. President, 300,000 to 400,000 people a year die in this country from smoking and smoking-related causes, and the only future customers for tobacco are kids. The only conceivable future customers for cigarettes are children, and that is why many in this country, myself included, believe it is important for us to say to the tobacco industry, `Never again shall you target America's children to addict them to tobacco, addict them to nicotine. We won't allow it.' That is what the tobacco legislation is all about. 
What did the tobacco companies know, and when did they know it about the subject of nicotine? We are now hearing a lot of testimony and discussion about that. Tobacco companies have been at the forefront of nicotine research in the last several decades. In fact, the tobacco companies, since the early 1960s, claimed that nicotine was not addictive and anyone who smokes makes a free choice to smoke. 
By the 1960s, however, all of the reports we are now seeing, including confidential memoranda and data from a tobacco company, showed us they had developed a very sophisticated understanding of nicotine pharmacology and they knew very well that nicotine was pharmacologically addictive. The release of internal tobacco company documents makes it clear. They realize the impact and significance of nicotine. 
In 1963, a British American Tobacco document said: 
Nicotine is by far the most characteristic single constituent in tobacco, and the known physiological effects are positively correlated with smoker response. 
In 1969, a draft report to the Philip Morris board of directors said: 
In the past, we at R&D--that is research and development--have said that we're not in the cigarette business, we're in the smoke business. It might be more pointed to observe that the cigarette is the vehicle of smoke, smoke is the vehicle of nicotine and nicotine is the agent of a pleasurable body response. 
In a memo from 1978, Brown & Williamson, signed by H.D. Steele says: 
Very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison. 
That is a tobacco industry paper.  
There is little doubt if it were not for the nicotine in tobacco smoke, people would be less inclined to smoke than they are to blow bubbles or to light sparklers. 
M.A.H. Russell, 1974. 
1983, Brown & Williamson: 
Nicotine is the addicting agent in cigarettes. 
1983, Brown & Williamson: 
Raleigh and Belair smokers are addicted to smoking. . . . They smoke primarily to reduce negative feeling states rather than for pleasure. Given their low income, smoking represents a financial drain on family resources. Saving coupons for household items helps reduce guilt associated with smoking. 
How about the health effects of tobacco? What do the tobacco companies know about that? 
The vice president of a tobacco company, in 1963, said: 
At best, the probabilities are that some combination of constituents of smoke will be found conducive to the onset of cancer or to create an environment in which cancer is more likely to occur. 
That is `at best,' he says. That is a fellow who helps run a tobacco company. 
1970, lung cancer experiments that were done by the general manager of research prepared for the managing director of Gallaher Electronic Telegraph: 
One of the striking features of the Auerbach experiment was that practically every dog which smoked suffered significantly from the effects of the smoke either in terms of severe irritation and bronchitis, pre-cancerous changes or cancer. 
A top research official for the American Tobacco Company, 1970: 
[W]e believe the Auerbach work proves beyond reasonable doubt that fresh whole cigarette smoke is carcinogenic to dog lungs and therefore it is highly likely that it is carcinogenic to human beings. 
[T]he results of the research would appear to us to remove the controversy regarding the causation of human lung cancer . . . 
How about tobacco companies targeting kids? 
1981, Philip Morris, a report from a researcher to the Vice President of Research and Development at Philip Morris. He says: 
Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while in their teens. At least a part of the success of Marlboro Red during its most rapid growth period was because it became the brand of choice among teenagers who then stuck with it as they grew older. 
Teenage smokers. A memorandum from the tobacco industry: 
To improve our ability to forecast future trends, this report examines the demographics and smoking behavior of 14-17 year old smokers. 
This is a company now that is doing detailed research on 14- to 17-year-old smokers. `Forecasting future trends,' that means `they're our customers. We're interested in them. We want to keep them smoking.' 
One company was concerned because their share of teenaged smokers declined while the share of teenagers who purchased a competitive brand increased. That concerned the company a great deal. 
Another tobacco industry statement: 
It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer. . . . it is during the teenage years that the initial brand choice is made. 
And that is the statement from a tobacco company. 
Now, the consequences of tobacco smoking are quite clear. Tobacco is a legal product, and in my judgment shall and will be legal in the future. But it is not a legal product for children. An industry that has record profits and has targeted children, because it believes that children are its future customers, is an industry that, in my judgment, is sadly out of touch with its responsibilities.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, before I begin talking about an amendment I intend to offer on the piece of legislation we will consider this week dealing with the IRS, let me say that the Congress Daily this afternoon indicates the Senate majority leader says `the compromise tobacco bill developed by Commerce Chairman McCain may not be the base bill considered by the Senate when it takes up the tobacco issue. . .' 
I am quoting: 
When asked whether he plans to bring the McCain bill to the floor, Lott said: `I am referring to a bill; it could be McCain, a version of McCain, it could be something else.' 
Again, I was quoting. 
I would hope that Senator Lott, the majority leader, would understand that when the Senate Commerce Committee marks up a piece of legislation and passes it with only one dissenting vote, a piece of legislation that is embraced by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate Commerce Committee, that that would not be work that is discarded as we move to begin consideration of a comprehensive tobacco bill. 
There is a reason for a committee system in the Congress, and that is to work through committees to develop a proposal, and bring that proposal to the floor of the Senate. I would be very disappointed if the majority leader intends one way or the other to 
bring a piece of legislation to the floor which is vastly different than that which was passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Again, I know there is a tremendous amount of lobbying going on in this town and around the country by the tobacco industry to try to resist and fight this kind of tobacco legislation. I understand that and I understand why they are doing that. Literally hundreds of millions--billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake. But we must, it seems to me, in discharging our responsibility, pass a comprehensive tobacco bill. A good start in doing that would be to take the piece of legislation that we have drafted and marked up in the Senate Commerce Committee and bring that to the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
In response, I think, to the aggressive initiative around this country by the tobacco industry, some are saying, `Maybe we ought to back off. Maybe we ought to not be quite as aggressive.' 
The fact is the origin of the tobacco legislation comes from our determination to see that this industry stops targeting America's children. And if someone thinks that they have not targeted America's children, then I say read the evidence. The Supreme Court has just ruled in a manner that requires thousands of pages of evidence to be disclosed. That evidence from the tobacco industry itself demonstrates that the only source of new smokers has been to addict America's children. 
Smoking is legal. Tobacco use is legal, and will remain legal in this country. But it is not legal and should not be legal to attempt to addict America's children. That is why a comprehensive tobacco bill needs to be brought to the floor of the Senate. I urge the majority leader in the strongest terms possible to use the process that we have started here in the Senate, bring to the floor the piece of legislation I and others, with the leadership of Senator McCain, have developed, and use that as a starting point on the Senate floor to deal with comprehensive tobacco legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the agenda for the Senate this week will be to discuss the bill that deals with the Internal Revenue Service. Among other things, this piece of legislation creates an Internal Revenue Service oversight board to help take a look at the management of various things with respect to the running of the IRS. 
I spoke last week about hearings on IRS misconduct and abuse. I indicated that, while I think the IRS has many good people who work very hard to collect the taxes that our laws require to be collected in this country, it is clear from the hearings that there have also been abuses that ought never be tolerated. I commend the Chairman for holding last week's hearings. We must use these hearings as the occasion to understand what went wrong and make sure it never goes wrong again. The American people don't ever deserve an IRS that is not fully accountable and an IRS that in some cases will harass and badger taxpayers in ways disclosed during the hearings last week. 
Let me just tackle one other aspect of the Internal Revenue Code and the behavior of the IRS. The IRS is required to collect the taxes needed to run the Government. Now the question is from whom does the IRS collect the amounts that are due? The people who go to work every day? The families that make a salary at work, and when they earn that salary, they have withholding taken out of their paychecks. Their taxes are sent to the U.S. Government. They don't have a choice. There is no flexibility. They work, they receive a paycheck, and they have withholding. 
But there are others doing business in America that are not quite so compliant. We need an IRS that cares about what they are doing as well and makes sure they pay their fair share of the tax load in this country. Let me give you an example. In a recent year, we had a study completed by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative watchdog of Congress. One of the GAO's main findings was that 46 percent of the largest foreign-based multinational firms--that is, firms with over $100 million in assets--are transacting hundreds of billions of dollars of business in this country and paying zero in income taxes to our country. That is right--not 10 percent or 5 percent or 1 percent, they paid zero in income taxes to this country. 
Now how, you ask, would a company based overseas do business in America, do tens of billions of dollars' worth of business, earn billions of dollars' worth of profit and pay zero in taxes? I mentioned 46 percent of the largest companies with over $100 million in assets paid no taxes; 74 percent of all foreign-based corporations in the U.S. paid nothing, zero, in Federal income taxes. Let me say that again: 74 percent of all foreign-based corporations doing business in the United States paid zero in Federal income taxes to this country. How do they do it? Something called transfer pricing. 
It is not only the foreign-based corporations, incidentally, that have a problem here. Most corporations that are doing business all around the globe are finding ways to minimize their tax burden through transfer pricing. Of course, not all of them do that. Many corporations pay exactly what they owe and do the best job they can of accounting for it. 
But transfer pricing means that you overprice an import into the United States in order to inflate the cost of goods sold, and therefore reduce, if not wipe out, their profit here. Or the alternative would be to underprice something you are exporting to another country in order that your subsidiary in the other country earns a very large income which would be subject low or no taxes in the other country. Because you priced it so low as you exported it here in this country, you end up making no money. 
Let me give you an example of how this works. There are a couple of professors employed at Florida International University. Their names are Simon Pak and John Zdanowicz. I have met them. 
They have done a lot of interesting work on the issue of transfer pricing. It is a Byzantine, complicated area of tax law, so complicated that very few people pay any attention to it. Yet billions and billions of dollars of tax avoidance occur every single year. `U.S. Government is Cheated out of $42.6 Billion in Tax Revenues in 1997, Study Reveals.' Pak and Zdanowicz recently released a study showing a conservative estimate of tax loss during 1997 due to abnormal pricing in international trade was $42.6 billion. 
Let me give some examples. Tweezers--everybody knows what tweezers are. Tweezers are tiny little things you buy at the drugstore for $1, $2, or $3. Tweezers were imported from Switzerland at $218 each. Now, did somebody really pay $218 for a pair of tweezers? Sure--a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign-based corporation. The foreign-based corporation sells the tweezers at $218 apiece, and they are a controlled U.S. subsidiary. They can never, ever make a profit, if they so desire. So whatever that corporation decides to do in the United States, they control their pricing back and forth. They will do a lot of business, make a lot of profit, but by overpricing tweezers to the tune of $218 apiece, they will never pay an income tax to the U.S. Government. 
So they can come here and they can compete against a U.S. business that doesn't do business in 10 countries, just does business here, and when they make a profit, they must pay a tax. 
How about bulldozers? Everybody knows what a bulldozer is. You drive down the road and see a construction project, you can identify a bulldozer at first glance. It is one of the biggest things you will see. Bulldozers exported to Belize for $551. Does anybody know where you can buy a $551 bulldozer? 
Let me go through some of the rest of the examples. Safety razor blades, $13 a piece. Television antennas--everybody knows what a television antenna is--$1,738 from the United Kingdom. Venetian blinds--most everybody has priced venetian blinds at some point. This would be a company that sold venetian blinds abroad and sold them at a price that guarantees they can't make a profit here. They do it through controlled companies, so it is not real, just the way they price their transactions. Venetian blinds, 3 cents. How about a toothbrush for $18? Or better yet, a tractor tire shipped to France for $7.65? 
All of this represents tax avoidance in sophisticated swindles designed to prevent the U.S. Government from taxing a profit as they would do with a domestic corporation. 
The reason I mention all of this sophisticated tax avoidance that is that it is almost impossible to detect. When you have companies--a company wanting to do business in this country, in most cases it will be a large foreign-based corporation that creates a U.S. subsidiary. 
They will do business with their own subsidiary. And to try to construct their transactions back to some reasonable market prices is like trying to connect two plates of spaghetti together. It is impossible. Yet, that is what the IRS is attempting to do. It doesn't do very well; can't do very well. Enforcement here is abysmal. In fact, depending on who you ask, the tax avoidance per year is $40 billion, some say $25 billion, and some say $15 billion. There has been a study that says $4 billion and the IRS says only $1 billion. What is the truth? The truth is that it is far more than $1 billion or $4 billion that the IRS and Treasury are talking about. It is far closer to the numbers put together by Professors Pak and Zdanowicz. 
Well, I will speak more about the amendment at some point during this week when I offer it. The amendment I will offer is very simple. 
The amendment I will offer is to say the newly established IRS Oversight Board will review whether the IRS has the resources needed to prevent tax avoidance by companies using unlawful transfer pricing methods. In order to enable the board to carry out this duty, IRS shall conduct a study relating to its enforcement of transfer pricing abuses by multinational companies. Specifically, the IRS will review the effectiveness of current enforcement tools used by the IRS to ensure compliance under Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code and determine the scope of nonpayment of U.S. taxes caused by both foreign and U.S.-based multinational firms operating in the United States. 
Then the Board will report back to Congress its findings on the IRS enforcement of transfer pricing abuses and make recommendations for improving IRS enforcement tools. 
I understand what the response to this is by corporations who are engaged in tax avoidance by transfer pricing. I understand what the response is by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. Corporations will say: Well, none of this goes on, this doesn't happen. The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department will say: It happens, but we have done such a great job there is very little tax avoidance. 
But, of course, neither is true. The fact is that we have a very serious problem in this area, one that needs to be corrected, and it will not be corrected with the current enforcement method used by the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department. As we talk now about how to recast the Internal Revenue Service, develop new procedures, develop new protections for taxpayers, develop an IRS oversight board, I am asking that the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department--especially at the direction of this new oversight board--take a fresh, new look at this issue and try to determine how we can do better. 
In America, when someone decides to begin to do business and risk their capital in order to hold themselves out to do business and earn a profit, when and if they earn that profit, they must pay an income tax. The reason for that is, we tax profits and we tax income in order to pay for our common defense, in order to build roads, and do a whole series of things in this country that we need to do together. But we have some who do business in this country that pay no taxes. I especially point to the foreign-based multinational firms. The GAO report says they come to this country and approximately 74 percent of them doing business here pay no U.S. income taxes. Those who are listening to this will be surprised to learn that the brand names they are well familiar with every single day, often the brand names on foreign products sold in the U.S., mean that someone has done a lot of business here, made a lot of profit here, and ended up paying zero in income taxes. In my judgment this means they are unfairly competing in this marketplace. 
U.S. businesses with whom they compete in this marketplace, if they are doing so only in the U.S., must pay a tax on their income, and so, too, should foreign-based corporations doing business in the United States through their subsidiaries. 
Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, following the business of the Senate today, there was an hour of morning business and a number of Members of the Senate came to the floor to comment on the hearings that were held yesterday and, I think today, before the Senate Finance Committee. These are hearings about the Internal Revenue Service. I am going to talk about that in a bit because the hearings are dealing with, at least from what I have read, some abuses in the Internal Revenue Service. Some of the instances that have been disclosed in these hearings represent abusive behavior on the part of some employees of the Internal Revenue Service. I will comment on that in a moment, but first I want to talk about some other abuses first that relate to another agenda that many of us want brought to the floor of this Chamber to be debated as soon as is possible. I am referring to abuses in the area of health care, particularly with regard to managed care organizations in our country. 
We know that some in this Chamber and in the Congress do not want to address the issue of managed care because the largest insurance companies in the country do not want it addressed. It would be difficult and inconvenient for some insurance plans if the Congress addressed these issues, so there is some stalling going on. However, we intend to, every day that we are in session and have the opportunity, come to the floor of the Senate and talk about some specific instances of abuse that the American people have suffered at the hands of their health care plans. In many respects, we have a wonderful system of health care in this country--new medicines and procedures, breathtaking medical advances--but this is only true for the people who have the quality care available to them. 
Let me talk about one American named Buddy Kuhl from Missouri who is dead now. Buddy had a heart attack on his 25th wedding anniversary. He was told by his doctor that he required specialized heart surgery, but because the hospital in his hometown did not have the necessary equipment for that surgery, the doctor arranged for the surgery to be performed in St. Louis. When the hospital requested precertification for the surgery, the utilization review coordinator--that is quite a title, utilization review coordinator--at Mr. Kuhl's HMO refused because the St. Louis hospital was outside the HMO's service area. So the surgery was canceled. The HMO, instead, sent Mr. Kuhl to another doctor to determine whether the surgery could be performed locally. The second doctor agreed with the first one that the surgery had to be performed in St. Louis. 
So 2 weeks later, finally the HMO and the accountant who makes these judgments decided they would pay for the surgery in St. Louis, but by that time, the surgery could not be scheduled for another 60 days. By the time the doctors in St. Louis examined Mr. 
Kuhl, his heart had deteriorated so much that surgery was no longer a possibility. Instead, they concluded he needed a heart transplant. Although the HMO refused to pay for the evaluation for a heart transplant, Mr. Kuhl managed to be placed on the transplant waiting list in St. Louis. Tragically, he died waiting for that heart transplant. Mr. Kuhl was only 45 years old, and he left behind a wife and two children. And the Kuhl family attorney said this: `He did what his HMO told him. Unfortunately, he's dead because he did.' 
Mr. President, Mr. Kuhl's case is not an isolated one. There is case after case all across this country. Do you think this family has any recourse against their managed care organization? No, because that organization cannot be sued. They can make a decision that will lead to a patient's death but a law called ERISA, an acronym unfamiliar to the widow of Mr. Kuhl, prevents certain types of health plans from being sued. 
Some of us in this Chamber believe that health care ought to be a function of doctors providing the health care, rather than some insurance company executive prescribing what is necessary for the medical care of a patient 500 miles away. Yet that is the way health care has evolved. Ask any doctor and you will discover the truth of that statement. 
Some of us believe there ought to be a patients' bill of rights that would provide some very basic protections to consumers in their dealings with their health plan. For instance, every patient in this country should have the right to know all of their medical options, not just the cheapest, all of the medical options to treat their disease or their problem, not just the least expensive. And patients and their families ought to have the right to address the wrongs that are done them when a managed care organization's bad decision leads to long-term disability or death. 
When you hear the stories of the abuses in managed care, and, yes, they are abuses, it is perfectly understandable, I suppose, why many organizations resist every step of the way any effort to bring to the floor of this Senate a patients' bill of rights. But if we are talking about abuses in this Congress and it is perfectly appropriate to talk about the abuses in the IRS, let us also talk about abuses we can stop in the area of managed care. Just as we ought to stop the shameful abuses that are occurring at the IRS, let us also make sure that Americans who walk through a doctor's office door or through a hospital entrance understand that their care is not going to be a function of a profit and loss statement but rather a function of a health care provider responding in a caring way to their health care problem. 
Regrettably, that is not happening in this country today. We can remedy this if we understand exactly what is happening. We will come every day to the floor of the Senate to talk about the abuses in managed care until those who schedule the business of the Senate decide that this is an important enough issue for the American people that it ought to be high on the agenda of the issues to be considered here in the Congress. 
Let me finish by telling a story I read about not too long ago about a woman who had just been the victim of an accident and had suffered a brain injury. As her brain was swelling and she was laying in the back of the ambulance, she informed the driver of the ambulance that she wanted to go to a hospital that was farther away. After she recovered, she was asked why she told the ambulance driver she wanted to go to the hospital that was farther away even though it was the closer hospital that was affiliated with her health care plan. And she explained that she knew by having read and heard about what had happened with her neighbors and others, that the hospital would evaluate her care in the context of profit and loss, and she wanted everything that was humanly possible to be done by doctors and nurses to save her life. 
That is the concern of people about managed care. I am not suggesting that all managed care in this country has disserved the needs of the patients in this country. That is not the case. In some cases it has reduced the cost of health care and still provides decent service. 
But you know and I know that all across this country there are examples of managed care organizations that are forcing doctors to sign contracts that say to a doctor, `Don't let one of your patients show up at an emergency room. If you do, if one of your patients comes into an emergency room, guess what, we are taking it out of your pocket.' You talk about a disincentive. That represents a conflict of interest, yet that is what is going on in these managed care organizations, because it is becoming for them not so much a delivery of health care, it is a function of profit and loss. 
We ought to begin to separate that discussion just a bit by passing a patients' bill of rights. To those who say they don't want to bring that to the floor, I say you are going to be annoyed then, because every day we will come to the floor to talk about this, and one day, one way, sooner or later, we are going to debate this on the floor with a piece of legislation we call the Patients' Bill of Rights. You may not think that now, but before the end of the year it will be here and you will vote on it.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me go to a couple of other issues. 
About the Internal Revenue Service hearings that are being held in the Senate Finance Committee this week, let me say first that I think those hearings are appropriate. I think anywhere you find abuses of a taxing agency, they are repulsive and disgusting. Those who commit those abuses ought to be summarily fired and penalized in any other way the agency can do so. 
It is clear to me from the hearings that have been held that there has been mismanagement at the Internal Revenue Service and that some of the circumstances of abuses they should have known about, they didn't. On some of misconduct that they did know about, they didn't take appropriate action. And if these hearings accomplish anything, I hope it is that this agency simply cannot ever treat lightly the abuse of the American taxpayer. It is ugly and disgusting and must never happen. All tax agencies have a special responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen. 
I ran a State tax agency for some long while in a State capital, and I understand about it. We were the repository of hundreds of thousands of income tax returns having sensitive financial information of all the folks of our State. I understand the responsibility of taxing authorities to make certain that the agency behaves appropriately with taxpayers. And I am appalled by some of the stories that have come from these hearings. 
We ought to stop in its tracks any abuse that exists anywhere, anytime in the IRS, and we ought to do it now. And I will support the legislation that comes to the floor of the Senate dealing with changing some of the procedures down at the Internal Revenue Service. 
But I want to tell you something else we should stop, and we should do it now. We should stop the fundraising that goes on surrounding these issues. I hold in my hand a fundraising letter by a Member of the Senate. It was sent to people across this country, coordinated, I assume, to be timed with the IRS hearings in the Senate Finance Committee. It is, I understand, the second such fundraising letter that has gone out, possibly the third. The letters have been timed, I think--at least I am told--to coordinate somehow with the hearings on the IRS. 
This fundraising letter for a political party, signed by a Member of the Senate, talks about ending the IRS reign of terror. It goes on and on and so on. It says: We are on the right side. If you will just send us $25, $50, $100, $250, $500--if you will just send us some money, we will be your pen pal for life. We will keep sending you these letters. We will work hard in Congress on 
all the right things. I think it is the right thing to do to hold hearings in the Finance Committee about IRS abuse. It is not the right thing for the party that schedules those hearings to use the opportunity to send fundraising letters all across this country. In some cases, they have even boasted about the money they have raised in the first round of fundraising letters with respect to the hearings they held. What that suggests is, this is a lot more than public policy. It is a very heavy dose of money politics. 
There is no question that this country's Tax Code is in desperate need of change and repair, and we have more ideas to change it than there are Members of Congress. We have people who say, let's have a VAT tax, let's have a flat tax, let's have a national sales tax. There are dozens of variations on each. It is interesting that those who complain the loudest in this Chamber about the complexity of the Tax Code are those who have hauled the heaviest loads of legislation on the floor of the Senate to complicate the Tax Code. 
I believe the first tax form and return and instructions were a total of something like seven pages, with everything. Now it is like a huge mail order catalog, with all of the forms and all the instructions. I understand that people can't deal with that complexity and should not have to. This Tax Code is Byzantine. It is way out of whack. We ought to change it. We ought to simplify it. It is interesting that those who have made it complex have done so because they've wanted special deals for themselves, carving out special tax breaks for a few while others are asked to pay more. 
It wasn't too long ago that we would read stories about a corporation in this country that made $4 billion of income in a year. Do you know how much they paid in income tax? Zero, nothing, no tax. They were tax exempt. So we made some changes in the Tax Code to see if we couldn't get them to pay taxes like other Americans. All of those changes in the Tax Code changed the circumstances of the code to add lines to the code and make it more complicated. I understand all that. 
I am going through a list of things I think we can do to dramatically simplify the Tax Code. I have proposed some legislation that I think would allow up to 70 million Americans to never have to file a federal income tax return again. I will go through that and explain how I think that can occur. 
But I must say, I find it interesting that in this climate, what we have is fundraising letters coordinated with hearings designed, I think, to pave the way for a tax system to say to the American people, `What we would like to do is change your tax system so there is one rate for everybody.' Steve Forbes says that. I spoke at a banquet once when he was sitting in the audience. I said, `You know, only in Washington, DC, would a billionaire proposing a significant tax cut for himself be considered having a bold public policy statement.' Only in Washington, DC, could that happen. A single rate, so the richest American pays the same tax rate as the lowest person on the income scale when they file their tax returns? I don't think so. It doesn't make sense to me. 
It seems to me the person who is making $20 million a year can afford to pay a couple of percent more than somebody who is making $22,000 a year and trying to raise a couple of kids. So, should we have a one-size-fits-all, one-rate-fits-all tax system? I don't think so. 
How about a national sales tax? We have people over there on the other side who are offering national sales taxes. In fact, I was down at the Brookings Institution a while back and spoke. I saw a study they have just done that says if you have a national sales tax in this country, you are going to have to tax almost everything with this sales tax and you are going to have a rate that is in excess of 30 percent--30 percent, to raise the same money the current system uses. Wouldn't it be interesting to see how people would react if they said, `Oh, you are going to buy a home? Yes, that's the price, but there is one more little thing: You have to pay a 30 percent sales tax on the home.' How long do you think the American people would stand for that? It might sound kind of simple. The fact is, a 30 percent sales tax, or 35 percent sales tax, added on top of the local sales tax of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 percent in some parts of the country--I wonder if people are going to think that is a pretty healthy tax program. I don't think so. 
There is, it seems to me, an opportunity to do a couple of things.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we can pass some legislation that will be brought to the floor of this Congress that deals directly with some of the abuse that has been disclosed at these hearings. 
I agree with one of the other Senators this morning who said there are a lot of folks at the Internal Revenue Service who do good work and good public service. I received a letter the other day from a fellow in North Dakota, a conservative Republican businessman who is very successful and has done very well for many years. He said, `I don't want you to tell anybody that I told you this, but I am watching all this IRS stuff, and I have been in business for 35 years and have had a lot of dealings with the Internal Revenue Service. And I have never dealt with any one of them who weren't good, honest people and easy to deal with.' He had nothing but good to say. I jotted a note back and said, `Good for you.' 
That is probably the case for a lot of people. I think most people find their experience with the Internal Revenue Service is fair, but when they find it is not, when they find abuse, we have a responsibility to stop it, even if it is just the exception. 
We intend to pass a piece of legislation--and I intend to vote for it--that responds to that. Last November, the House of Representatives, incidentally, passed similar legislation by a vote of 426 to 4. We could have passed this legislation last November, or at the very latest in January when the Congress returned, but we did not. Delay, delay, delay and more delay, until now. We are probably ready to have the legislation brought to the floor next week. As I said, I will be supportive of it, but we could have passed this legislation long, long ago. I worry--and I hope I am not right--that it had a lot to do with these fund-raising letters that have gone out in some concert with these hearings. 
Let me describe just for a moment what we could do to the tax system. We could do something positive for tens of millions of Americans. I want to describe it. It is called the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan or `FASST.' I have worked with some of my colleagues on it in both the Senate and House. 
The proposition is this: Many Americans have as their only income the wages they earn at their workplace. They ought not have to file an annual federal tax return. Some 30 countries in the world have some kind of income tax in which you don't have to file an annual return. 
For someone who gets most of their money from their wage or salary at work, we can say to those folks, `Your tax withholding at work can be modified slightly so that it becomes your actual tax liability when it is sent to the IRS by your employer. You don't have to worry about filing any tax return.' No April 15 deadline. No waiting in line at the post office. No getting your records together. You don't have to file an annual tax return. Up to seventy million people, I estimate, could be taken off the tax rolls in this country with the returns that are now filed if we used a plan like this. Let me describe the plan to you. 
The plan would say that if you are a family earning up to $100,000 a year in wages, or a single taxpayer earning up to $50,000 in wages annually, and if your other income, that is non-wage income such as capital gains, interest and dividends is less than $5,000 for a couple, and $2,500 or less for a single person--then you simply fill out a W-4 form, as you now do at your place of employment. On your W-4 form, we will make a couple of other check marks. You change it very little. There will be a couple of additional check marks--one for child credit and the second for home ownership. 
When you complete that W-4 form at work, if you choose the option of using the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan, then you don't have to file a federal income tax return. Your employer, working from a table prepared by the IRS, will determine what your withholding is. When your employer sends in that withholding to the IRS that is your exact tax liability, no tax return is needed. 
Up to 70 million Americans would be able to do that easily, 
quickly, with no tax return filed and no records to be gathered. In addition, up to $5,000 in other income would be exempt from taxation because you are not trying to trace every nickel and track down every dime of some other income stream in order to have withholding from it. 
It is a wonderful incentive at that point because there is an incentive for interest and capital gains at the bottom that is nontaxable. The incentive for the rest of your wage income is to say that you are going to pay taxes at a 15% after claiming several important deductions. And you are not going to have to file a tax return. The W-4 is modified slightly so that you are still able to get credit for home ownership and a deduction for interest payments on a home mortgage. 
All of that can be done today. It can be done in Congress now. It is not complicated. Some 30 countries have some modified approach to this no-return filing system. 
Is it as aggressive as some saying, `Let's just get rid of the entire Code?' No, it is not. In fact, my plan would say every taxpayer has the choice. The choice is do you want to use the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax plan and not file a return or they can say, `I really don't want to do this. I fit the income requirements, but I don't want to do it. I prefer to file a return every year. I prefer to go searching for my records. I prefer to wait at the post office because I enjoy that. I just prefer to do it the hard way. I prefer the current system.' 
I don't think many would do that, but my point is this would be a choice for most taxpayers. However, those who do not fit in this system would file, as they do now, under the current system. I would make some changes to help simplify things for them too. 
I would eliminate, for a fairly sizable part of the population, the alternative minimum tax calculations which have become very complicated and were never intended to harness a bunch of taxpayers who are making $80,000 or $150,000. The alternative minimum tax calculations were designed to try to get the largest enterprises in the country that were making tens of millions of dollars and paying nothing, to start becoming taxpayers once again. 
I also propose for those who want to use the old system that they get a tax credit to help offset the cost of tax preparation. Businesses would get a tax credit to offset the cost of preparing the W-4 forms. There would be almost no added cost here for businesses, but I would provide some incentive for them. 
Again, this is an approach that can be done, and it can be done quickly and easily. This Congress could embrace it. It is the only plan that I am aware of that really relates to honest simplification of the Tax Code. Taking 70 million people out of the loop of having to file an annual income tax return is a huge step forward toward simplification. 
I hope, Mr. President, as we begin talking about what we do about this frightful complexity in the Tax Code, that we will decide as a Senate and a Congress that this is a plan that we can embrace. 
William Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute says:  
Roughly half of the U.S. taxpayers could be placed on a no-return system with relatively minor changes in the tax laws.' 
A no-income-tax-return system. 
The GAO says: 
No-return systems are proven. More than 30 countries, including Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom use some form of the no-return system. 
I hope that some of my colleagues will join me as I begin to discuss some of these issues in the context of tax reform in this Congress. 
Mr. President, I have a couple of other items that I wish to discuss today briefly. There was a substantial amount of discussion this morning about a range of issues, most of them dealing with taxation. I just wanted to cover a couple of other items--one, that I have spent a lot of time talking about on the floor of the Senate, but then I want to talk about the larger agenda issues those of us on this side of the political aisle in the Senate want to see brought to the Senate for debate.

Mr. DORGAN. I noticed that China decided recently that it is going to ban direct marketing in China. That means that Amway, Avon, Mary Kay Corporation and similar companies are told they cannot any longer direct market. Apparently, some scams were going on in China--not by these companies, mind you--that was causing some problems, so China just said no more direct marketing in this country. 
Our trade ambassador, Charlene Barshefsky, immediately went into action and met with China's Minister, Wu Yi, on Friday to discuss the issue. And that is fine. I do not know much about Mary Kay, Avon or Amway, but they are aggrieved. They are legitimate businesses, but China has banned them. They ought to be able to do business in China. I think it is fine for the trade ambassador to jump in and say, `Why don't you own up to our trade agreements here and let these people market?' 
But I just ask this: Could we be as aggressive on behalf of wheat and meat as we are on behalf of cosmetics? Could we be as aggressive on behalf of farmers who cannot get enough wheat into China? 
We have been dealing with China for a decade on this thing called TCK smut. China, for example, has displaced America as the major wheat supplier to China, even as they send us all their shirts and shoes and trousers and trinkets. And they have ratcheted up this huge trade surplus with us, but we cannot get enough wheat into China. We cannot get enough meat into China. We can't get hardly any pork into China. We can't get enough beef or chicken into China. 
I say to our trade representatives, that is fine. You be aggressive about cosmetics and you be aggressive about direct selling, but why don't you also start being as aggressive for wheat and meat? Why don't you be aggressive on behalf of individual American farmers who all across this country discover they cannot get their products into a country, China, that is ratcheting up a huge trade surplus with us? 
We have become an unbelievable cash cow for China's hard currency needs. Shame on us for a trade policy that allows that. I just ask the trade ambassador, get busy. Get aggressive. It is fine that you care about Amway, Mary Kay, Avon, and other direct sellers. But get busy on behalf of those who get up at sunrise and do chores, who plow fields, who produce wheat and meat and want to get that into China as well. 
Mr. President, that was therapeutic to say on a Friday anyway.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me talk about one last point, and that is the agenda of the Senate. The fact is, I come from a side of the political aisle in the Senate that does not control the agenda. The reason why is because we lost the election. The other side has more people, they elect the majority leader, and the majority 
leader decides the agenda of the Senate. I am not complaining about that. That is the way the Senate works and that is what the rules are. 
But we being a minority still have an agenda, and we still have certain rules in this Senate to work with to try to make certain our agenda is also considered. I want to mention just for a moment a couple of points in that agenda. I started out by discussing the Patients' Bill of Rights and the issue of health care quality in this country. We intend to see that there is a vote on managed care reform, the Patients' Bill of Rights, in this Congress. 
We also fully intend to see that a tobacco bill is brought up, and I think the majority leader now is going to a tobacco bill for consideration. We must as a country decide that this country will no longer countenance tobacco companies targeting kids. You cannot addict 30-year-olds. Who reaches age 30 and says, `What can I do to improve my life?' and comes up with the answer of smoking? The tobacco companies addict kids. They get kids when they are 14, 15, 16 years old and addict them to nicotine. Those are the new customers for tobacco. By age 30, you know tobacco causes cancer and heart disease and a whole range of enormous health problems that threaten the American people. So almost nobody who is not addicted to nicotine by age 30 discovers that they could improve their life by starting to smoke. 
We must decide that we will not any longer in this country allow tobacco to target kids. The tobacco industry does not have that right. We have written a piece of tobacco legislation in the Senate Commerce Committee under the leadership of Senator McCain. It is a good piece of legislation. It is not perfect. I voted for it. I proposed some changes to it during the Committee's consideration, and I will propose some changes on the floor of the Senate as well. But overall it is a good piece of legislation. 
Senator McCain should be commended for his leadership. And the product of his leadership will be brought to the floor of the Senate. We need a wide open debate on that. This Congress must pass a tobacco bill. And we ought to do it soon. 
We did just discuss education on the floor of the Senate and, frankly, many of us are dissatisfied. Obviously, we did not get what we wanted from that debate. The way that debate was structured, we had 30 minutes on this side of the aisle--30 minutes--to discuss an issue of substantial national importance, and that is the decay of America's school infrastructure. 
We proposed that the Federal Government just provide some help with respect to the interest costs on bonds that are used to build or modernize new schools. That is a significant priority, in my judgment. Yet the Senate said no, the priority should be to give tax subsidies, the bulk of which will go to kids who go to private schools. 
Last Sunday, I was in Fort Yates, ND, on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, at the Bureau of Indian Affairs school there. The elementary school has roughly 150 students, but it is closed now. If you go into the school building, you will see there is no carpeting, and the ceiling tiles have been removed. The lights were leaking PCBs, which is a carcinogen. And all the kids had to be removed from the school. That was February 13. The kids--these are mostly Indian children--are going to school in a gymnasium. The air is stale in this gymnasium, and there is no air-conditioning or ventilation that moves the air around. 
They have created classrooms by putting in big, make-shift plywood dividers that are not anchored to the floor. You just touch the dividers and they go back and forth. In some cases, the children are sitting on the bleachers and trying to do their classwork. And the noise from the 100-some kids in this gymnasium creates just a din. And that has been the quality of their education since February 13. 
And so one can talk about whether the condition of our schools matters. The school I just spoke of happens to be a BIA school. It is the responsibility of this Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It is not the responsibility of some local school district. It is our responsibility. 
Up the road 45 miles, I was in a school that I have mentioned a couple of times, the Cannon Ball Elementary School. This is a public school, although it happens to be on an Indian reservation as well. Nobody here in this Chamber would want to send their children to that school. There are 140 kids, plus teachers and staff, and only two bathrooms and one water fountain in the school. Part of the school is 90 years old and has been condemned. The choir room, which is a former janitor's closet, has to be abandoned once or twice a week because sewer gas seeps in and they cannot continue to have kids in that room. Nobody here would say that would be a good place to have their children attend school. It is a public school, but it does not have any money because its tax base is so poor. 
So what do school officials do when large parts of the school has been condemned, kids are crammed into a classroom 12 foot by 8 foot, with not 1 inch between their desks because it is so crowded, and with twice as many kids scheduled to go into that classroom the next year? What they will do is split that class up, and they will put them in a big, open room. One teacher will teach two classes at the same time, going back and forth between the two groups of kids. 
And you can say, well, school construction is not important or it is somebody else's job. That school district does not have the capability ever to build a new school on its own because it simply does not have the tax base to support a bonding initiative. The cost of building a new school of the size that is needed is about $2.5 million. Yet the maximum bonding capacity of that school district, because it is on Indian land and its tax base is so small, is only $750,000. 
So 140 children--mostly Indian children--will continue to go to a school that none of us would want our kids to attend unless we do something to help them. The teachers at the school there are wonderful. The administrator is a wonderful man. They do a terrific job under tough circumstances. But those kids deserve better than that. 
When those kids walk through that schoolroom door, they deserve better than that. 
A little second grader named Rosie Two Bears asked me when I was in the classroom, she said, `Mr. Senator, will you buy me a new school?' Well, I can't buy her a new school, but part of the debate about the education agenda ought to be is school construction important and is this a national problem and is there something we can do, at least at the margin, to say this is a priority? Is it a higher priority than giving a tax credit to somebody who wants to send their child to a private school? I think so. At least it ought to be, but we only had 30 minutes to make that case. And we didn't have the votes, unfortunately, to prevail on that amendment. 
Our point is that we have an agenda that relates to the center of what most people are concerned about and we want that agenda considered by the Senate. Most people are in their homes in the evening and talking at the dinner table. They are asking themselves pretty routine questions about life. How did the job go today, how is your job, do you have a job that pays well, has decent security? Do you have benefits? So how is the job? Or how about health care? Do grandpa and grandma have access to health care? How about the kids; do they have access to health care? What about the neighborhood; is it safe? Are the streets safe to walk in? 
Jobs and health care and education. What about our kids? Are they going to good schools? Are we proud in the morning when we send them off to schools? Those are the central issues--schools, health care, jobs, safety and security, crime. Those are the central issues that we must debate on the floor of the Senate. 
We have developed an agenda under the leadership of Senator Daschle and many others in our caucus. We don't believe we have the exclusive ideas that represent all the best ideas or the only ideas. We understand there are plenty of other people in this Chamber that have ideas of their own, some of which might fit better than the ideas we have, but we believe that the topics I just discussed are the central topics that relate to how most people live every day, and most of the conditions they have every day, and we very much want to see all of these topics --the agenda that the Republicans have and the agenda that the Democrats have--brought to the floor of the Senate for a full debate and have the American people weigh in on that discussion and tell us what they think is important. 
As we continue holding hearings and developing the agenda here in the Congress, I hope that agenda brought to the floor of the Senate will reflect the agenda we think is important. I say again, we fully intend to pursue this agenda with great vigor. For those who now suggest that they will keep it off the floor of the Senate--managed care reform, for example--I say to them we will be awfully annoying for a long time because we insist it come to the floor. 
Let me make another point that I think will represent a significant area of priority debate in this Congress, and that is there are these folks who stand up at the desks in the Senate and the House of Representatives and talk about the surplus, what we should do with the surplus. In fact, some are talking about how large a tax cut they can give this year to deal with the budget surplus. There is no budget surplus. There isn't a budget surplus. We have made wonderful progress in wrestling the budget deficit to the ground, but there is not a budget surplus unless you save the Social Security revenues for the purpose they were intended to be saved for. 
I say to all of those who are rushing to embrace their favorite tax cut plan, President Clinton said it in the State of the Union Address, and we still believe it, save Social Security first. When people, from their paychecks, make a payment to the Social Security trust fund in the form of a tax that is dedicated to be used only for one purpose, do not misuse it. Don't use it as other revenue. Don't count it as part of your budget calculation. Save it in the trust fund and save Social Security first. That is the responsibility of this Congress. 
All of those folks who have ideas either to provide tax breaks or to spend the money that doesn't exist, I say to them you have and we have a responsibility to save Social Security first. When we get to a budget debate on a budget conference report, we will once again, I assume, have that kind of contest about what ought to be done with respect to this budget. 
I say as emphatically as I can, you do not have a budget surplus until you have made whole the Social Security funds and kept the promise to the American people to save Social Security first. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, periodically, there are events that help focus and define the problems that this nation faces in its trade relationships with the rest of the world. Today, we are facing another glaring example of how this nation becomes the dumping ground for subsidized exports that violates any reasonable understanding of fair trade and level-playing fields. 
Earlier this month, a sale was made for the shipment of 1.4 million bushels of feed barley from Finland to Stockton, California. The irony and tragedy of this sale is that the United States is the world's largest producer of feed grains, as well as the world's largest exporter of feed grains. There is absolutely no reason for this nation to import a single grain of feed barley. 
The only reason that this sale was feasible was that this shipment is heavily subsidized to the tune of at least $1.11 per bushel through the European Union's restitution system of subsidies. 
At a time when farmers across this country are facing some very serious economic challenges, including low prices, escalating production costs, and adverse weather conditions, it is a serious economic blow for them to be undercut by the import of subsidized feed grains. At a time when many farmers are having difficulty getting credit to put in their spring crops because current farm prices do not cover production costs, we do not need unnecessary imports to put further downward pressure on our grain markets. 
News of this sale of European barley has already depressed feed barley prices by at least 24 cents a bushel in the California feed barley market. Since this market sets pricing trends for both feed and malting barley, this sale of 1.4 million bushels is producing enormous market losses for barley producers throughout the country. Market experts indicate that this sale will adversely affect U.S. barley prices for at least a nine-month period as this barley moves through the U.S. marketing system. It particularly hits home in North Dakota, which is the nation's largest producer of barley and normally produces one-third of this nation's barley crop. 
Compounding the pricing impact of this particular sale is the fact that there is something in the neighborhood of another 9 million bushels of feed barley that have been authorized for restitution subsidies by the European Union and which have not yet found a home. 
This morning at a meeting in the office of Senator Baucus, I and other Senators from barley-producing states met with the Ambassador of the Organization of European Communities, Mr. Hugo Paeman. We asked him to convey to the European Union that this sale should be 
terminated and that the European Union should take immediate steps to prevent any future occurrence of such subsidized sales into the U.S. market. While Mr. Paeman sought to assure us that this sale was a very unusual circumstance and was not a precedent for additional sales of subsidized barley into the United States, we continue to be greatly concerned about the impact it has already had upon markets and the danger of this sale opening a new channel of unfair trade into the United States. 
While I sincerely hope that the European Union will take our concerns seriously and take the appropriate actions to terminate this sale and prevent future sales, I also recognize that this nation also has a responsibility to fight for fair trade for our farmers. It's bad enough that the European Union would permit such an event to occur. It would be even worse if the United States took no action to stop it. 
The real tragedy of this situation is that it is very likely that this shipment of highly-subsidized feed barley is permissible under current rules of the World Trade Organization. The possibility that this sale is WTO legal doesn't make it any more acceptable to the farmers who have already been hurt by the price reduction that this sale has caused. 
This morning we were told that the European Union had not targeted the United States for this particular shipment of barley, and that it, in fact, had been intended for sale to Saudi Arabia. Yet, the reality is that this sale is currently scheduled to be shipped to Stockton. California. Again, it makes little difference to U.S. barley growers whether this shipment was originally destined for the United States. The effect on their prices is the same. The damage to our markets is the same. 
While this sale of heavily-subsidized European barley is unprecedented, once a channel of commerce is opened it is often extremely difficult to put the genie back in the bottle. That is why that I and my colleagues from other barley producing states are so deeply concerned about this particular event. We have seen a trickle of Canadian grain moving across our borders change into a perpetual avalanche. We have seen assurances and good intentions become the grease by which unfair trade policies have become structural. 
This particular sale of European barley is another example of many of the ongoing problems that our nation has in achieving fair trade with level playing fields and reciprocal market access. While I hope that this sale can be terminated and resolved quickly and effectively, I also believe this sale should become a rallying point for not only American farmers, but the entire nation in demanding fairness and justice in our trade policies and relationship. 
I am pleased that I have been joined by twelve of my colleagues in submitting a sense of the Senate resolution which calls upon both the European Union and our own nation to take the appropriate steps to not only terminate this sale, but also to ensure that such a sale will never occur again.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor of the Senate to support the amendment offered by Senator Warner. I have not yet been part of this debate. I have followed it closely and read a great deal and want to speak about the larger issue and then explain why I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia. 
The proposal brought to this Senate to expand NATO raises a range of questions that will still be unanswered as we vote on this treaty later this evening. Let me just describe a couple of them. 
First of all, the cost. The cost estimates for the enlargement of NATO range from a few billion dollars to $125 billion. Our major European allies have made it clear that they have little intention of spending another lira, another franc, another pound, to pay for the expansion of NATO. The question, then, is: What will be the cost to the American taxpayer? We don't yet know. 
Further, will there be a second round to expand NATO? The NATO Secretary-General said that there will be a second round, possibly including Romania, Slovenia, and three Baltic States. If there is a second round, what will that cost be? And if there is a third round, would it include some of the 19 other members of the Partnership for Peace in Central and Eastern Europe? Where does NATO expansion stop? We don't yet know. 
The other question is: What is the threat that requires the enlargement of NATO? What is the threat to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic that justifies NATO expansion? I am convinced these countries need economic integration into Europe rather than military integration into NATO. 
The Warner amendment says, let us take the time to answer these basic questions. Let's wait for three years before we admit any more nations into NATO. Let's pause and try to understand what all of this will cost, what exactly is the threat, and what our response should be. 
But more importantly, a three-year pause also will enable us to work with Russia to ensure our relations with Russia do not suffer as a result of the policy we seem about to endorse this evening. 
NATO expansion, make no mistake about it, will play a large role in determining whether we will have a cooperative or a confrontational relationship with Russia in the years to come. I don't say this because I am sensitive to the feelings of Russia. I say it because I am sensitive to our own security interests. 
I take a moment of the brief time that I have to describe why our relationship with Russia should play a role in this decision. 
I wonder how many of my colleagues are aware of an incident that occurred on December 3, 1997, in the dark hours of the early morning, north of Norway in the Barents Sea. Several Russian ballistic missile submarines surfaced on December 3, last year, and prepared to fire SSN-20 missiles. Each of these missiles can carry 10 nuclear warheads and travel 5,000 miles--far enough to have reached the United States from the Barents Sea. Those submarines surfaced and launched 20 ballistic missiles. Roaring skyward, they rose to 30,000 feet. U.S. satellites tracked their path. 
Last December 3, the radar and satellites in our Space Command NORAD complex and elsewhere saw that at 30,000 feet those Russian 
missiles exploded, they were destroyed. Why? Because this was not a Russian missile attack. In fact, seven American weapons inspectors were watching from a ship a few miles away as the missiles were launched. These self-destruct launches were a quick and cheap way for Russia to destroy submarine-launched missiles, which it is required to do under the START I arms control treaty. 
Mr. President, let me present one more piece of evidence about what is really important. This is a hinge, and with the permission of the Presiding Officer, I show it to my colleagues on the Senate floor. This is a hinge that comes from a missile silo in the former Soviet Union. This belonged to a silo that housed an SS-19 with warheads poised at the United States. This piece of a missile silo, with a missile and warhead aimed at the United States, comes from a silo that doesn't any longer exist. This comes from a silo which this picture shows is now gone. Silo removed, gone. The missile is gone. The warhead is gone. And where a silo once stood, sunflowers are planted. 
How did that happen, that a Soviet missile was destroyed by taking it out of its silo? This country, with a program called Nunn-Lugar, helped pay for the cost of that. With that program, and under our arms control treaties, we help destroy the weapons of potential adversaries so they can never be used against us. 
Now, the question for all of us is, What does enlarging NATO do to our relationship with Russia? There is no one on this floor who can stand and tell you with certainty what it does, but there is plenty of evidence that this is a step backward, not forward, with respect to our relationship with Russia. 
One of the great lessons of this century's history is that the United States gains when we respect a former enemy. We have been through the cold war with the Soviet Union. They lost. The Soviet Union no longer exists. 
Russia has enough fissile material to make 40,000 nuclear weapons if it wanted to. That's why our relationship with Russia is critically important. That relationship will determine whether we will see more nuclear missile silos planted with sunflowers, whether we will see bombers having their wing cut off --as this picture shows--whether we will see more progress in arms reduction. 
The principal threat, in my judgment, to peace in this world is not a threat of a land invasion of Poland, the Czech Republic, or Hungary. The principal threat is the threat of nuclear weapons--loose nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, or proliferation of nuclear weapons to rogue nations, or a resumption of the nuclear arms race. We are on a path in this country, because of our arms control agreements and cooperative relationship with Russia, where both sides are now destroying nuclear weapons. This is very, very important progress for humankind. 
We now are confronted here in the U.S. Senate with a question of enlarging NATO, a security alliance in Western Europe, at the expense of, in my judgment, our relationship with Russia. I don t want to see our relationship with Russia deteriorate into a new cold war confrontation and a resumption of nuclear weapons production. In my judgment, we expand NATO at the potential risk of reigniting a cold war and impeding and retarding progress on arms reduction. 
The Senator from Virginia brings an amendment to the floor that says if we go to a first round of NATO enlargement, and if the vote is successful tonight, before we expand further let us at least pause for 3 years to answer the questions I posed at the start of my presentation. What will this cost? What will this cost, and who will pay the bill? What is the threat, and where does the threat come from? And what does this do to arms control agreements that now, as I speak, are resulting in the destruction of missiles, the retirement of delivery vehicles, the sawing off of wings of Russian bombers? 
What does it do to that progress, progress that comes from arms control treaties and a bipartisan initiative here in Congress called Nunn-Lugar to help implement those treaties? In the Nunn-Lugar program we provide money to accommodate arms control agreements, to help the other side destroy their nuclear weapons. These are the weapons that were once housed in a silo that contained this piece of metal, near Pervomaisk, a former Soviet missile base. What does NATO expansion do to the progress that this piece of metal represents? 
This piece of metal was in a silo that housed a missile with a nuclear warhead aimed at our country, but it is now just metal, and the ground is now sunflowers. That is substantial progress, in my view, for this world. 
The question we need to ask, all of us, is, What does this issue, NATO enlargement, have to do with this progress? Will it impede this progress? Will it retard the progress of arms control? No one here knows the answer for certain. 
Our Nation's foremost experts on foreign policy are sharply divided. Yet, and I say this regretfully, the Senate seems prepared to vote on NATO expansion without understanding its potential consequences.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning the front page of the Washington Post has an article that says, `Interest Rate Fears Drive Stocks Down.' The article makes the point that the Dow Jones average tumbled 147 points yesterday. And John Berry, in the Post, who writes a fair amount about the Fed and about economic news, says the analysts on Wall Street indicate there was a strong concern by investors that the long-running bull market might be nearing a peak and that the Federal Reserve Board is looking at the potential of increasing interest rates. 
It is interesting to me that it is a front page story that the stock market is down 147 points. The fact is the Dow Jones industrial average is nearly 9,000. It is a stock market that has increased dramatically. We have had up days of 70 points, 90 points, 120 points. It is not surprising that we will have downturns in the market of 140 points or more when you have a market that is over 9,000 in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
But what surprises me is the notion somehow that the Federal Reserve Board somewhere behind closed doors at a March 19 meeting indicated that, gee, they were concerned that the economy was growing too fast and that maybe American workers are making too much money. They are concerned that maybe too many people in this country are employed. 
There is no amount of good news that will not give the economists down in the Fed a bellyache for a week or two. There is no amount of good news that does not cause them great concern. `Gosh, the economy is doing well, so we better have a heartache about how well the economy is doing.' It is interesting to me that the Fed has been consistently wrong. I know there are people in this Chamber who will stand up and say, the Fed ought to be credited with the good economic news in this country. In fact, just the opposite is the case. 
The Fed has been consistently wrong about this economy. They indicated time after time after time that if unemployment ever went below 6 percent we were going to be in huge trouble, we were going to see the new fires of inflation stoke up. Well, unemployment went below 6 percent and has stayed below 6 percent. We have not seen new waves of inflation. The Federal Reserve Board has just missed the fact that the global economy has put downward pressure on wages in this country. 
But having said that, the Federal Reserve Board now has short-term interest rates higher than it ought to be, higher historically than it should be by a full half a percent. This means the prime rate is higher than it ought to be and higher than it historically would be given the rate of inflation of well over 1 percent at this point. Yet, they are talking about maybe increasing interest rates down at the Federal Reserve Board. 
What on Earth can they be thinking? I mean, if the job of the Federal Reserve Board is to simply slow down the economy, my uncle can do that. There are five or six people in my hometown who can do that. We do not have to pay them a lot of money to do that. What can they be thinking? Too many people are working? We are starting to see maybe some increases in some salaries at the bottom of the economic scale? 
I would say to the Federal Reserve Board, if you have a lot of time on your hands, take off those gray coats you wear from those 
gray suits you wear to work every day and start thinking about bank mergers. Maybe start thinking of what the CEOs make at the top--not workers at the bottom, and wonder what it does to the economy. 
The Fed should be talking about the biggest bank mergers in the history of this country. What does it mean for consumers that all of the biggest banks of this country are getting together and deciding there is so much romance going on in the financial industry and they would like to marry up? 
The Federal Reserve keeps a list down there called the `too-big-to-fail' list. That is a list of the biggest banks in the country that will never be allowed to fail because the consequences of their failure would be too catastrophic for the economy. So they have the too-big-to-fail list. 
As more and more banks merge, of course, that list gets bigger, and it means the risks of the merger will be borne by the American taxpayer. So this monopoly game played by American giants passes off its risk to the American taxpayer. 
So I say to the Federal Reserve Board, if you have lots of time on your hands, don't sit around scratching your heads and increasing interest rates, when the short-term Federal funds rate is already higher than is justified, given the rate of inflation. Start thinking about what these bank mergers do to the American economy. Start asking yourself why--if you keep a list that is called `too-big-to-fail,' why in this economy do family farmers out there face a risk of serious financial problems right now? And they seem to be, in the eyes of the Fed, and others, too small to matter? Why is it that some are too big to fail and others, who are critical of this country's success, somehow too small to matter? 
I would just say to the Fed--when I read this story this morning, I wondered again about those we hire to do monetary policy and who think about economic policy. What they can be thinking about when they suggest--and have now for about 3 years--that any good economic news in this country is somehow a step backwards. 
I just ask the Fed to understand this economy is doing quite well, notwithstanding the Fed's advice. And there is no justification--none--for this Federal Reserve Board to be considering increasing interest rates. 
The Federal funds rate at the moment is historically higher than it should be, given the rate of inflation. If they take any action at the Fed, it ought to be to decrease the Federal funds rate to where it ought to be, given the current rate of inflation which, incidentally, is almost nonexistent.

Mr. DORGAN. Now, Mr. President, just a couple final points. 
The agenda of the Senate--I was talking here about the agenda of the Federal Reserve Board, something I do not control. I guess the same is probably true with respect to the agenda of the Senate, because the majority leader controls the agenda of the Senate. 
He determines what to bring to the floor of the Senate for debate, and the agenda for the U.S. Senate is a very important agenda. 
In front of us in the coming weeks I hope will be the following pieces of legislation, some of which are already very, very late. The so-called highway bill or ISTEA bill which is very important. It should have been passed last year. It is now in conference. We need to get that and get it done. It is important for this country, an investment of roads and infrastructure. 
The tobacco bill. We have just passed a tobacco bill out of the Senate Commerce Committee. It should be ready to come to the floor of the Senate. I hope it is done sooner rather than later. A supplemental disaster bill--that bill has been passed for some while, and the Senate is now in conference. In fact, I am a conferee. We will have a conference at 2 o'clock this afternoon. That ought to be done. There is no excuse, especially with respect to the disaster funds, for further delay. That ought not sit there waiting. This Congress has a responsibility to get that work done and bring it to the floor of the Senate. 
Another important issue that we want brought to the floor of the Senate as soon as possible is the Patients Bill of Rights, which deals with managed care and the abuses that are occurring in managed care in this country. 
Those are just a handful of bills we want to be brought to the Senate floor soon. Some of them have already been through the Senate and have been languishing in conference. The highway bill, for example, the supplemental disaster bill, others, need to come to the floor so we can make some progress on them. 
I ask the majority leader and all others on both sides of the aisle in the Senate that we do our work and do it on time and tell the American people that things like investment in infrastructure, building roads, repairing bridges, and the kind of things done in this important highway bill get done on time. They were supposed to have been done last year. It is now getting towards May of this year. It is in conference. A very, very important piece of legislation. I hope it is brought to the floor of the Senate soon. 
One more point. The tobacco legislation is very important. Some, I know, want to stall on that legislation, but we reported it out of the Commerce Committee under the leadership of Senator McCain. That piece of legislation, I think, because of the short year that we were involved with that piece of legislation, should be brought to the floor of the Senate as soon as possible. The later that it is brought to the floor of the Senate, the less likely it is that Congress will get its work done on the tobacco bill. I ask the majority leader, bring the tobacco bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate, and let's get it done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take just a couple of minutes. I understand that the Senator from Georgia will be yielding time to the Senator from Florida. But before he does that, let me take a couple of minutes to respond to some of what I have heard. 
There have been interesting discussions on the floor of the Senate about this legislation, and it is clear that different Senators see this issue from a different perspective. Many people come to the floor to talk about public education. Well, our proud tradition of public education began in this country in 1647. The Colonists in Massachusetts first developed tax-supported public schools, and we have had from that time on in this country an understanding about the desire and obligation to create a network of taxpayer-financed public schools in this country. 
I defy anyone to come to the floor of the Senate and show me a country anywhere in the world that is as successful as this country has been, that has produced as many scientists and engineers, as many mathematicians, as many well educated men and women coming from our public school system. In fact, even today, do you know a country out there that you would like to trade places with, a country with a better economy than ours? 
Oh, you can point to some areas where you might say, gee, this country has a better education system than ours. Many countries take only its top students and run them up the ladder and say to one group of students, you are more appropriately going into another area, and to the best group, we say we are going to direct you toward higher education. And we are going to compare that group to the American students, the students that have universal opportunity. What a great tradition we have of affording every young boy and girl in every school entering every classroom door the opportunity to be the best they can be because our public education system gives them that opportunity. 
It is interesting to me that there is a kind of `blame America first' notion that somehow nothing works here. Again, tell me, with what country would you change places? I have two children in public schools. They are wonderful public schools. Both have wonderful teachers. I am enormously proud of what they are doing. They are doing harder work in those public schools in both grades than I did--much, much harder work than I did when I was in school. 
I also read to a young boy in the Everybody Wins Program. Yesterday, my power lunch for an hour was reading with a young third grader in a school here in Washington, DC. And I understand 
the challenges of different schools. Some have more resources than others. I understand that not all is right with our education system. We have plenty of challenges, some external and some internal, in our education system. 
A week ago yesterday I was in the school in Cannon Ball, ND, on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation--in a public school in a public school district with a very poor tax base. This is a school with 145 students and 40 teachers and staff--180 people in a school, part of which is 90 years old and has been condemned as a fire hazard. 180 people using 2 bathrooms and 1 water fountain; second graders, third graders, fourth graders, fifth graders in a choir room that is about 12 foot by 12 foot, that they can only use occasionally because the stench of the sewer gas seeps into the classroom and drives them into another classroom. The other classrooms are only 8 foot by 12 foot in many cases, and the children sit in desks only a half inch apart with their desks touching because there is not enough room in that school and in those classrooms. And too many students they simply put in an open area, and one teacher will teach two classes at the same time by spending 15 minutes talking to one group and then 15 minutes talking to another group of students, in the same room, and by going back and forth all day long. 
The question I ask is, Who defends this underlying bill where we say here is the priority of need in education? It is a tax subsidy. The majority of the money from the subsidy will go to the parents of fewer than 10 percent of the children in this country who attend private schools. That is the priority of need identified in this bill. And the question of school construction and modernizing the school buildings so that the wiring will allow kids to access the Internet, those priorities somehow don't matter; they apparently represent some ranking of need well down below the tax issue. 
We are told, if we talk about the desperate repair and construction needs, that what we are talking about is decisions that ought to be made by the local school board. In this case, the local school board doesn't have any money. They have no tax base with which to issue bonds to repair this school. And there are plenty of other schools like it. To the second grader that I mentioned earlier this week, little Rosie Two Bears at that Cannon Ball school, who says, `Mr. Senator, will you buy me a new school,' I say, `Well, we are talking about that in Washington, DC.' 
Can we provide some help perhaps to that school district to deal with school construction, to give those kids some help? It seems to me the people who are defending the current legislation are saying that issue doesn't matter to us, that ought to matter to somebody else. Crowded classrooms, too few teachers, crumbling schools, those issues don't matter to us; they belong in some other debate. 
In fact, the amendment that was offered by Senator Gorton, who just spoke, is an amendment that says let us take a substantial amount of money in the Department of Education and block grant it. That is a seed that comes from the same garden planted by those who want to abolish the Department of Education. In fact, abolishing the Department of Education is a part of the 1996 Republican national platform. They want to eliminate a national role in education, but they don't want to say that publicly. They don't want to offer it publicly on the floor of the Senate, so they do something slightly different called a block grant. 
And I say to them, if you want to do that, why be a tax collector? Why collect the taxes, run it through Washington and send it back in a block grant. That's like passing an ice cube around; all you do is get a smaller cube every time you pass it. If you decide that safe and drug-free schools is not a program of national interest and national importance and you want to tell the States this is not something that represents a national interest, it is fine if 5 schools or 5 States want to do it, and if 45 States want to do it, that's OK, too; we will send you all the money for it, and you do whatever you want. If we decide there is not a national interest in having safe and drug-free schools or title I or, for that matter, a half dozen other programs, then why would we collect the tax money for it and send it back? 
Why not say to the local districts, you collect the taxes and you decide how to spend it. That is the way the system ought to work. 
We don't run the local school boards and we should not. We have done some targeted financing in certain areas that have been enormously successful. For example, with title I we have provided specific investments and opportunities for the very lowest income kids in this country. Those investments would not have been made and could not have been made by the local school districts. They are very important, and I am enormously proud of what we have done in this and other areas. 
Do I believe we should take those programs apart and block grant them? Absolutely not. Why take a giant step backwards? The defenders of the legislation before us are the folks who come here and say, `Well, gee, we should not worry about that. We are a U.S. Senate. This is not a national issue.' 
If education and achievement and competitiveness in the international arena is not a national issue--I am not talking about running the local schools; that is a local issue--then I do not know what is a national issue. 
So, I say to my friends who come here to speak in defense of the current bill, Rosie Two Bears was in school today in a school that in most cases none of you in this room would send your children to. That school is not going to get fixed with any help from us, despite the fact that President Clinton called for it in his State of the Union Address. I support this effort, and I think a number of others in this Chamber support some initiative to provide incentives to those school districts that don't have the opportunity and don't have the resources, `We are going to help you a bit,' because we believe that any kid who walks through any classroom anywhere in this country ought to have the expectation that they are going into a room that they can be proud of, a room in which learning will take place, a room in which education will prosper, a room in which young minds will blossom. That is not the case today in some areas, and we know it. 
I have great respect, incidentally--I have said this on a couple of occasions--for the Senator from Georgia. He has handled himself with great skill in this debate, and I have great respect for him. However, we differ with respect to the priority of needs. That's the only place we differ. I see our priorities as very different than he does. I would like very much for us, if we have $1.6 billion, to debate about what we do with the $1.6 billion. Let us consider the range of needs that represent what we think are the national needs in education and then start at the top, pick No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, and identify what we can do. 
We don't do that. We bring this bill to the floor and we say, no, we are not going to deal with the top priority needs. We are going to establish tax subsidized accounts, 52 percent of the benefits of which will go to parents who have fewer than 10 percent of the kids in schools and say that is what represents our priority of need. I just say to you I think this shortchanges a lot of children in schools in this country. I regret that we have been prevented from having the kind of debate we should have had on these issues. 
Thirty minutes of debate on our side--30 minutes on this question of school construction as a national priority--because that is what we were told was allowed to us under the time agreement for an issue of significant national importance. This was not the kind of free and open and aggressive debate that we ought to have had on the range of priorities of needs that exist in education in this country today. It didn't happen this time. Maybe it will happen in the future. I think the Senator from Georgia will win this vote and lose the battle. Because this bill will be vetoed. But then perhaps we will be able to debate the entire range of needs and try to determine from that debate what kind of priorities we can achieve from each side. 
I am not somebody who believes only one side has wisdom. I think, instead of getting the worst of what each side has to offer in this Chamber, 
both can offer. The only way to do that is to have a real debate, not a debate based on very narrow one-sided rules, but a debate in which we guarantee everyone in this Chamber can bring up the best ideas and we can have a real competition of ideas on the floor of the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I and some of my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation introduced the Air Service Restoration Act designed to help revive air service to those parts of the country that have suffered under deregulation. The revitalization of air service for small communities is of absolute importance to the economic and social well-being for these communities. While this legislation is no panacea, it will hopefully provide some tools to help small communities address the air service deficit that has hit them since deregulation. 
Some rural states, such as North Dakota, have not enjoyed the benefits of competition and deregulation that other regions of the country have experienced. In fact, the federal policy of deregulation has led to less service, higher fares, and less competition for my state and other rural areas. Unfortunately, the air service problems facing rural America has gone ignored for too long and we now have an air service crisis, in my judgment. This crisis needs immediate attention and the Air Service Restoration Act is a modest attempt to address this, the chronic air service deficit facing many small communities. 
This legislation is based on three principles. 
First, it acknowledges that since deregulation some communities have indeed suffered and there is a need for a federal role to address this small community air service deficit. It seems to me that we need to move beyond the broader debate over whether or not deregulation has been a good or a bad thing. It has been good for some and bad for others--creating an unacceptable circumstance of air service `have' and `have nots.' This legislation does not seek broad-sweeping policy changes that will dramatically alter federal aviation policy. Rather, the Air Service Restoration Act attempts to target some modest resources and policy objectives to address the problem areas, i.e., the `have nots.' This legislation will not threaten deregulation. Rather, it is an attempt to save it by addressing the casualties of a policy that has left some parts of the country behind. It is time that we develop `air service development zones' and allow all regions of the nation to participate in a national air transportation system. This legislation does that by identifying the problem areas and creating opportunities to attract new air service. 
The second principle of this legislation is based on the notion that the initiative and locus of solving air service problems for small communities must begin at the local level. There is no federal `silver bullet' and those communities that seek to improve or restore air service must roll up their sleeves and develop sustainable public-private partnerships that will make air service economically sustainable. This legislation is a market-based solution to improving air service for small communities. The only way small communities are going to succeed in 
attracting new air service is that local officials and business leaders will have to get together and identify ways to make it economically viable for carriers to add service. 
Finally, this legislation is based on the notion that there is clearly a need for a federal role. The U.S. Department of Transportation needs to play an active role by providing a means for small communities to access the resources and in making the regulatory changes necessary to allow new service to flourish. Under this legislation, a new office would be created within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose sole function would be to work with local communities and provide assistance to help them achieve their goals of improving air service by providing financial assistance to local communities and addressing regulatory hurdles that inhibit air service to small communities. 
Hopefully, this legislation will help reverse the air service deficit in this country. Since 1978, more communities have lost service than the number of communities that have been added to the air service map of the United States. Over 30 small communities have lost all air service since 1978 and many more have had jet service replaced with turboprop commuter service. 
Service decline is not the only disturbing trend plaguing small community air service. Consolidation is having its toll as well. As the airline industry continues its steady trend of consolidation, the major network carriers are pulling out of rural areas. Out of a total of 320 small communities that had scheduled air service in 1978, 213 of those were served by a major carrier. In 1994, only 33 of those small communities had service from major carriers. Prior to deregulation, North Dakota was served by 6 major carriers and every major market in North Dakota had 3 or 4 major carriers in each market, each providing jet service. Today, North Dakota has only 1 major carrier that provides jet service. 
The number of small communities receiving multiple-carrier service decreased from 136 in 1978 to 122 in 1995. Also, the number of small communities receiving service to only one major hub increased from 79 in 1978 to 134 in 1994. 
In 1938, when the Federal Government began to regulate air transportation services, there were 16 carriers who accounted for all the total traffic in the U.S. domestic market. By 1978 (the year Congress passed deregulation legislation) the same 16 carriers (reduced to 11 through mergers) still accounted for 94% of the total traffic. 
Today, those same 11 carriers (now reduced to 6 through mergers and bankruptcies) account for 80% of the total traffic. 
One export estimated in 1992 that since deregulation, over 120 new airlines appeared. However, more than 200 have gone bankrupt or been acquired in mergers and today, only 74 remain--most small and struggling. 
Between 1979 and 1988, there were 51 airline mergers and acquisitions--20 of those were approved by the Department of Transportation after 1985, when it assumed all jurisdiction over merger and acquisition requests. In fact, DOT approved every airline merger submitted to it after it assumed jurisdiction over mergers from the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1984. Fifteen independent airlines operating at the beginning of 1986 had been merged into six mega carriers by the end of 1987. And, these six carriers increased their market share from 71.3% in 1978 to 80.5% in 1990. 
These mega carriers have created competition free zones, securing dominate market shares at regional hubs. Since deregulation, all major airlines have created hub-and-spoke systems where they funnel arrivals and departures though hub airports where they dominate traffic. Today, all but 3 hubs are dominated by a single airline where the carrier has between 60 and 90 percent of all the arrivals, departures, and passengers at the hub. 
In a report by the General Accounting Office entitled `Airline Deregulation: Barriers to Entry Continue to Limit Competition in Several Key Domestic Markets,' [GAO/RCED-97-4], operating limitations and marketing practices of large, dominate carriers restrict entry and competition to an extent not anticipated by Congress when it deregulated the airline industry. The GAO identified a number of entry barriers and anti-competitive practices which are stifling competition and contributing to higher fares. The GAO issued a similar report in 1990 and the 1996 report said that not only has the situation not improved for new entrants, but things have gotten worse. 
The fact is that deregulation has lead to greater concentration and stifling competition. The legislative history of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 shows that Congress was as deeply concerned about destructive competition as it was with the monopolization of air transportation services. Thus, the CAA sought to ensure that a competitive economic environment existed. As we can see, deregulation is realizing the fears anticipated by the Congress in 1938. Competition has not become the general rule. Rather, competition is the exception in an unregulated market controlled largely by regional monopolies. 
It has been demonstrated that hub concentration has translated into higher fares and rural communities that are dependent upon concentrated hubs have seen higher fares. Studies from DOT and the GAO have demonstrated that in the 15 out of 18 hubs in which a single carrier controls more than 50% of the traffic, passengers are paying more than the industry norm. The GAO studied 1988 fares at 15 concentrated airports and compared those with fares at 38 
competitive hub airports. The GAO found that fares at the concentrated hubs were 27% higher. 
The difference between regulation and deregulation is not a change from monopoly control to free market competition. Today, nearly two-thirds of our nation's city-pairs are unregulated monopolies where a monopoly carrier can charge whatever they wish in 2 out of 3 city-pairs in the domestic market.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me make a couple of comments. 
First, I think the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, is a thoughtful legislator and I have agreed with him on a number of education policies, including last year his fairly controversial amendment on IDEA. I supported him on that and I thought his amendment was the right amendment. 
This is an area in which there is just some philosophical disagreement. Let us be honest, there are some--I don't think the Senator from Washington is among them, or perhaps the Senator from New Mexico--there are some who very much believe the Federal Government should not be involved in education in the elementary and secondary education at all. 
The Republican Party platform in 1996 said, `This is why we will abolish the Department of Education and end Federal meddling in our schools.' I am not suggesting that is what this amendment does, but philosophically there are people, and a fairly significant number in your party, who really believe there should not be a Federal Department of Education, who believe that these programs represent meddling, and it ought to all be done at the local level. 
My point is this: There have been certain national priorities that we have tried to address with the programs that we have developed for elementary and secondary education at the Federal level. By far the bulk of funding for elementary and secondary education is at the local level. They run the schools; they finance the schools. If we were to decide, `Let's not care about how these moneys are spent that go to State and local governments from the Federal Government for elementary and secondary education,' I would say then let's not be a tax collector here. That is what we would be. If we say we don't care how the money is spent, we will collect the money and throw it back there, all we end up being is a tax collector to add extra money for elementary and secondary education. In that case I say, raise the money at home. Why pass around an ice cube? All that does is mean you get less money back when you do it that way, so just raise the money at home. Don't do it at all. Just suggest there aren't national programs of national interest or national need. 
Some of us here believe very strongly that what we have done with the Department of Education and the kind of `gap funding' we have provided for certain title programs and other programs of some national importance and national interest and national need have advanced the issue of education in this country. It doesn't mean we have tried to run the school systems. We haven't and shouldn't and won't. It does mean that a number of these things we have done nationally strengthens the schools. It fills in areas of national need on issues of national importance that otherwise would not have gotten done. 
Again, I have great respect for the Senator from Washington, but I will oppose his amendment simply because I happen to think that what we have done in creating a Department of Education and in providing some directed gap financing for programs that represent national interest and national need--drug-free schools program being one, for example, and many, many others that are very important that I think have strengthened education in this country. 
I understand there will be a second-degree amendment offered here and that will allow a few more minutes of discussion. But let me just say again, I think this stems just from some philosophical differences. I respect those on the other side who say, `Well, you can spend this money better at home.' I say, if that is the case that there shall be no national purpose and no national interest with respect to some of these issues, let us not have tax collectors in Washington raising the money here and taking it away before they send it back home. Just have the folks back home raise all the money and spend all the money. 
If you believe there are certain things that are worthy--including programs like title I and so many others--that have advanced education in this country and been very helpful, not intrusive, but very helpful, to State and local governments who run our elementary and secondary school systems, if you believe that, then I think you support what we have done to improve it and strengthen it. 
I yield back the remainder of our time. My understanding is there will be offered a second-degree amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, once again I think we have a philosophical difference here. I don't see that parents, teachers, schools, and local officials are not free now. They are certainly free now to develop their own programs, raise their own money, and run their own schools. They do that. They are free to do that. They do it every day in every way. 
The local school in my hometown of 300 people is run by the local school board. They raise the money in the local tax district. The school board hires the teachers. They decide with the State government about the curriculum. They are perfectly free to do that, and do it every day. 
The Senator from Washington indicated this is not a debate about abolishing the Department of Education. He is absolutely correct about that. This, however, represents a seed from the same garden. That is why I mentioned that in the 1996 Republican National Party platform it says: `That is why we will abolish the Department of Education and Federal meddling in our schools.' 
It is a seed from the same garden that says, by the way, if there is any money going back from the Federal Government, let's make sure that there is no purpose for that money; let's make sure it goes back in the form only of general aid and not some kind of assistance, as has historically been the case for compensatory education for poor children. 
One-half of the Federal money that has been spent since 1960 for elementary and secondary education has been spent for compensatory education for lower-income children. It has been remarkably successful. 
Once again, let me emphasis that we don't run and never will run the local school districts, and we don't finance the local school systems. This is kind of gap financing for certain things that we have considered a national purpose, among which, as I mentioned, is compensatory education for lower-income children, but other areas as well. 
Let me mention just a couple of them: The School-to-Work Program, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. What if, for example, this amendment passes, and it is decided that in 45 States, while we have said there ought to be a national priority on the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, and here is the money for it, 45 States say, `Well, sorry. It is not our priority. That is not our priority. We are not going to do that.' Yet, we keep sending the money, and we have 45 States in which there is not a safe and drug-free schools program. 
My question to the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Washington is: Why would we want to keep spending the money in that case? Why would we want the Federal Government to become a tax collector for local school districts for no national purpose? They have said, `We want your money, but there is no national purpose served in having a safe and 
drug-free school program.' I don't think that makes any sense. 
I say just do this through the front door. If one really doesn't want the Federal Government to be involved in these programs, just end the financing for the programs. 
What we are suggesting here is not--the Senator from Washington is correct--abolish the Department of Education, although I certainly think there are plenty who want to do that. But I think the American people probably would not approve of that. So it is the kind of an approach that says, `Well, let's simply abolish the purpose for the money but continue to provide the money.' I just do not understand that. 
The Senator from Missouri made a general point about education. Let me say that I agree with what he said about education. Education works in our local schools all across this country when you have a teacher that is a good teacher, when you have a student who comes to school willing to learn, and when you have a parent involved in that education. Those three elements are critical and necessary for education to work. There is no question about that. 
We debated yesterday the question of the priority of school construction to see if there could be some incentive to promote further investment in school construction. That was not the priority yesterday. There needs to be other discussions. Regrettably, I wish it was. But that is also a rather important point. That child must go through the classroom door of the classroom that is a good classroom in good repair and not overcrowded. 
I mentioned a week ago that I was at the Cannon Ball school--at an Indian school, a public school, and a public school district--and a second grader named Rosie Two Bears, she is going to school this morning in a school that is not in good repair. You can have all the other things that work, and then to have classes where one teacher is teaching two classes back and forth at 50-minute intervals with kids with desks that don't have a half an inch between them, because there is not room with 140 kids and 40 staff people in a building that is 90 years old, part of which is condemned, and they have two bathrooms and one water fountain for 180 people, that is not in good repair. Does that school need substantial investment to make sure this second grader named Rosie who goes to school has the same opportunity that your kids and my kids do? Absolutely. 
We have a lot to do, and a lot of challenges. 
This issue, however, is not about the general financing of elementary and secondary education, because we do not do that. The general financing and the management of our elementary and secondary education system is done at home. That is where it ought to be done. We have, however, in recent decades indicated there are some basic issues of national purpose to be served by creating a title I program, a vocational education program, and a safe and drug-free schools program. That represents national interests and a national purpose that you would hope to see attained at every school district in every State all across this country. Some say, `Well, let's just retreat on this issue of national purpose. Let's just back up on this issue of national importance.' The Senator from Washington last year when he offered his amendment included, for example, title I in vocational education. He did not include it this year. I am pleased to see that because, frankly, it seems to me that if you just look at what has happened to the success of these programs you can't help but conclude that what we have done, while not perfect, has been enormously important in the lives of a lot of students, especially poor students in every school district in this country. 
The General Accounting Office recently found that the targeting of the Federal education programs to those with the greatest financial need has been very successful. 
In fact, they say for every dollar the Federal Government provides to a student, in general, it provides $4.73 to an impoverished student. 
What that means is what we have tried to do has largely worked to try to fill in some gaps to say that where there is not adequate funding locally and where we have a sense of national purpose about something that we know needs to be done, we are going to try to fill in that gap. 
It seems to me to say that we are going to retreat on that and say what we are going to send back now will just be general aid--I say the right approach for that is, if you are going to retreat altogether, just say we will not be sending categorical aid because we do not sense a national priority or a national purpose or a national interest and therefore we won't send the money either. 
Or, alternatively, you can end up deciding there is no national purpose here and we will not support the national interest in these programs, safe and drug-free schools being an example, but we will continue to be a tax collector and will collect the taxes and then send the money back. Gee, I think the folks back home would be much more impressed with a straightforward approach to this alternative, which I don't support, in which we say we do not support the programs and we will not collect the money for it; you do what you will back home. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me just make another quick point. 
You will not find a challenge anywhere in this Chamber by anyone who would stand up and say it is not important to have local people making local decisions, that some of the best decisions that can be made can be made locally. No one is going to contest that. 
The point I am making is this: Local governments, State and local officials who run the elementary and secondary school systems in many cases over now many years, have indicated they do not have the resources to provide the kind of help we provide in title I as a gap financing that moves certain kinds of assistance to poor children or children who go to poor school districts. 
Now, the amendment of the Senator from Washington does not put title I in this block grant category this time, as I indicated he did last year but does not this time, as I understand it. I address the Senator from Washington. Is that correct?

Mr. DORGAN. My understanding was that title I was not part of his amendment. We were trying last evening and this morning 
to understand exactly what the language would be. 
That makes his amendment much, much worse than I had previously thought. It does confirm then what I said earlier, that we have taken a successful approach in which we have tried to provide some compensatory education assistance especially directed at impoverished areas and at poor children, and have done it in a very successful way, and now say but all of that will become a pot of money that we send back, and we will just become tax collectors for local governments or for school districts and say, `You all pretty much retool this and rethink what you want to do with it along the lines that represent your priorities.' They have their priorities, and should have their priorities, and their priorities are to govern how they run their schools. And they are free to do that. 
Again, the discussion earlier was about they are not free somehow. Of course, they are free. State and local schools are run by the State and local school districts. They are free to raise their money, free to impose taxes, free with their State governments to develop curriculums. Of course, they are free to make those decisions. But in areas where we have provided some assistance based on what we perceive to be a national purpose, the amendment says, let us provide the money but no requirement that anyone sign up to this national purpose. And again I come to the issue of safe and drug-free schools. There are a good many of them: Eisenhower Professional Development, the Innovative Education Program, the Technology Challenge Grants, and so on--safe and drug-free schools. 
Have we decided, or should we decide, or will we decide as a country on a national need to have a safe and drug-free schools program across this country that is stimulated by some financing that we say you must pursue this and must have it because there is a national purpose for this, and we will provide some financing help because we are mandating something? Are we at a point where we say, no, there is no longer a national purpose for a Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act? Let's have a Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act, for example, in North Dakota, but the other 46 States say, `Gee, we don't want one; this is not a national priority.' 
Drugs and the issues surrounding drugs and young Americans and schoolchildren are a national priority. It is of national interest. And we have decided in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act that we want to provide some funding if we are going to provide a mandate here, some funding from the Federal Government to say to these school districts, `We would like you to do this as a sense of national purpose and national interest, and here is some financing to help you do it.' 
The amendment is an amendment that essentially says, well, let's convert all of those national interests and urges to some notion of general aid, and so we will then be tax collectors and we will just collect money and send it back. I say as I started, that is like passing an ice cube around. By the time you get to the sixth or seventh position on that ice cube passing, there is no ice cube left. 
A much more straightforward way of doing this would be to say we don't believe these are programs of national interest, and therefore let us say to local governments, `Raise your own money and spend your own money. We are out of the way.' We are, as their party would suggest in their platform, abolishing the Department of Education. Get out of the way and let everyone else do their thing. 
There is a different way, and the other way is to recognize that most all of elementary and secondary education is funded by, controlled by, the local people back in the home districts and the school district in the towns. It will always be that way. But there are things that represent a national interest, and those kinds of policies and those kinds of issues, debated over many, many years here in this Congress, resulted in the construction of a program called title I and other title programs. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act, the Technology Challenge Grants, and others have been, I think, enormously important to say to the local school districts, `While you are there, we are going to offer some help, for example, to see that you get your school wired up to the Internet. If you need help to do that, here is some help to do that, to see that you have a safe and drug-free schools program in your school district, in your schools.' 
That has been the nature of our involvement in education. Again, it is very seductive, I think, to say, well, gee, shouldn't local people make all these decisions. Yes, I think so. With their money they should make all their decisions in their elementary and secondary education programs. 
But isn't there a circumstance where we have some issues of national importance where our money, our resources, our investment ought to follow that urge of national importance on the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act? I think so. To back away from that, I think, would be a mistake. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Washington chooses an inappropriate example to begin with, the highway system. We provide Federal money to the State of Washington. But if I go to Washington and drive on roads that are constructed in the State of Washington by his State highway officials with Federal money, I know I am not going to drive on a roadbed of marshmallows or cork. Why? Because his highway officials must follow the Federal prescribed rules about what kind of highways they are going to build with those Federal funds. 
My only point is, if the Senator from Washington suggests that if, for example, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program is not a national priority, let's give them the money for it but not require 
them to do it, I think that is a huge step backwards. Is it in most instances the case that people closer to the problem can spend the money more effectively? Absolutely. That is why almost all of elementary and secondary education is done and managed and controlled locally. But there are some programs of national interest for which we provide the financing and for which we hope there is a national purpose and to which we will have all school districts subscribe. That is the purpose for all this. 
I find it interesting. You could make the same case about food safety. You could have exactly the same debate. Say, do you think back home they are not concerned about food safety? Why do we need national food safety standards? Do you think back home in every State they are not concerned about food safety? Of course they are. Of course they are. But it is something of national interest and national importance, and that is the gap financing that is involved here with respect to these kinds of programs. Are they perfect? No. Should they be changed? Yes. Should we retreat from them? In my opinion, I think that would be a huge mistake. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas may want to respond. But let me make a point that his amendment essentially, as the Senator from Massachusetts says, wipes out the Murray amendment dealing with class size and 100,000 teachers and reducing the class size of first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students. 
The point I made the other day is that this debate is about the priorities of need in education. The Senator from Georgia brings a bill to the floor and says the priority of need is a provision for a tax credit, the bulk of which will go to wealthy folks who send kids to private schools. That is his priority of need. It is not me saying that; it is now the Department of Treasury saying that of the legislation. 
The Senator from Washington says there is another need. We talked earlier about school construction. The President and the Senator from Washington has done a lot of work on this issue and 
talk about the need to reduce the class size of first, second, and third grades. We know that makes a difference in education. That is not rocket science. We know that works. That makes a difference in education. 
The second-degree perfecting amendment that has been offered essentially obliterates this and takes it out. The Senator from Massachusetts just indicated--he is absolutely correct--that we are going to get a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray. We have a right to get that vote. We will, because the Senator from Arkansas says he wants to obliterate that amendment. We will then come back and offer a second-degree at the end of his amendment, and we will get this vote later now rather than sooner. But we will get it. 
So I don't have any objection to somebody coming to the floor saying let's have 99 percent of the money spent on education going into the classroom. I have no objection to that. I have no objection to his amendment at all. What I object to is he comes to the floor and says--by the way, the Senator from Washington worked on this for some while, and it was one called for in the President's State of the Union Address--we will just wipe that out. That is not part of the unanimous consent. She has a right to vote on it. What we will do at 11:30 in the morning is just wipe it out. 
Finally, let me propound a parliamentary inquiry, if I might, to the Presiding Officer. Is it not the case that the Senator from Washington will be able to offer a second-degree amendment at the end of the perfecting amendment providing this perfecting amendment is approved by the Senate at some appropriate point in this process and get a vote on the second-degree amendment?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has offered an amendment that strikes the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington. We had a unanimous consent agreement in this Chamber on how we were going to handle amendments. It provided that she was going to have an opportunity to offer her amendment and get a vote on her amendment. I didn't use the words `dirty pool.' The Senator did. But my point is, if we had an agreement that she was going to be able to offer this amendment on the Senate floor and the Senator comes and strikes her amendment, it seems to me that is not what we agreed to some long while ago when we agreed to the rules of this debate. 
The Senator is within his rights of offering the second degree. I don't disagree. But my point is the Senator comes to the floor, not just advancing his ideas, but essentially prevents her from getting a vote on her amendment because the Senator strikes the Murray amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the honor bestowed upon the Grand Forks Herald last week. That newspaper received the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service news coverage, for its heroic efforts throughout the flood and fire that ravaged Grand Forks, North Dakota in April 1997. 
The actions of the Grand Forks Herald during the flood set a new standard for performance under pressure. Let me make clear that while the award they have deservedly won is a journalism award, their service to the community goes far beyond the borders of journalism. The fact of the matter is that while this community was being inundated by water and fire, the Grand Forks Herald helped to hold it together by providing information that reassured and reunited families. The Herald gave people the information they needed to assess the situation and make decisions based on facts and not rumors. I can't tell you how important it is to have facts at a time like this, when your world is being turned upside down, and anything, regardless of how outrageous it may sound, could be true. 
When the history books are written about the Grand Forks fire and flood of 1997, there will be many heroes. This was, in fact, a season of heroes in North Dakota; from the individuals who acted heroically to save lives and property, to all the men and women of the media who faced and passed similar tests. 
Of all the heroes, however, none will shine brighter than the Grand Forks Herald, which never missed an edition during the disaster. From the parent company right on through to the local management, administrative staff, news, production and delivery staff; all played a key role in holding the community together. All worked, despite enormous odds and tremendous obstacles, to be sure that as their world turned on its head, one thing would not change: North Dakotans could still pick up the Grand Forks Herald every morning and read the facts. 
The Grand Forks Herald has been honored with the most prestigious award in journalism and it is a well-deserved honor. I am immensely proud of what they did and as a North Dakotan, I am also grateful for the service they provided to Grand Forks and our state at their most trying hour.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to mention a couple of subjects on the floor of the Senate today. The first deals with the proposed marriages occurring in the banking industry. In recent weeks, we have seen proposals of marriage by a number of our biggest banks, totaling some $160 billion. Three of the largest merger proposals include Citicorp with Travelers--actually a very large bank with an insurance company, NationsBank and BankAmerica, and Banc One with First Chicago. I didn't even know there was any romancing going on, and then I open the papers and see that all these banks want to gather up and get married and be one. 
I think the fundamental question for this country is whether these mega mergers serve our economy and our country's best interests? Is this good for our country? Will this better serve customers, or will it result in bigger profits, perhaps, for the banks that merge and higher fees for their customers? 
It is clear to me that the kinds of mergers we are once again seeing in this country mean that when two large corporations become one and an even larger corporation, there is less competition in our economy. When there is less competition and, therefore, more concentration, it seems to me it clearly injures the market system which relies on competition as a regulator and, by definition, is therefore not good for consumers. Without knowing the specific details, I admit, about the individual proposals in these mergers, I hope very much that the regulators, the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency as well as the Justice Department, will review all of these mergers with a fine-tooth comb and determine whether this will result in less competition that is harmful to consumers, whether it will result in ever higher banking fees for their customers, whether it will result in something that takes us a step backward rather than a step forward in improving our market system in this country. 
As I indicated, I don't know much about the specifics of any of the merger proposals I have just described. It is not my intent to come and describe the deals or to pass judgment upon them. But I will say this: The judgment I have with respect to many of the largest mergers in our country, especially in this industry, is that we are left with less competition if the merger is approved. 
With respect to this industry, there is one peculiar and defining characteristic. The Federal Reserve Board determines by policy that there are certain banks in this country that are so-called `too big to fail.' That is, they are so large in scope that their failure would cause such an economic calamity for the country that the Fed will not allow them to fail. 
The Fed actually has a list of banks: `These banks are too big to fail.' All the other banks, the smaller banks, can fail and lose all their money. The deposits are insured so the depositors won't lose money, but the bank owners, the stockholders, can loose their money. The `too big to fail' banks cannot fail. They are on the list at the Federal Reserve Board as `too big to fail.' 
I asked the question, if you have a list of `too big to fail' banks and the big banks merge into even bigger banks, does it not mean then the American taxpayer will pay the cost of bad merger judgments if the merger goes sour? 
My friend James Glassman, who writes op-ed pieces for the Washington Post, a rather interesting guy, I think, and pretty good thinker--I disagree with him on a fair number of issues from time to time--but he wrote a piece last week about this. He said that most of this is pretty good news really. Some call all these mergers the `elephant mating system'--the best thing to do is stand back at a safe distance and watch. 
But Glassman says, well, this is really fine. He says at the end of his long piece, though, after talking about the virtues of these mergers, `Yes, there are some dangers. The mergers make institutions too big to fail. Knowing that regulators won't close them down in a crisis, bank managers could get reckless.' 
That ought not be the last paragraph, I say to my friend Mr. Glassman; that ought to be the first paragraph. 
The question of public policy on this issue of bank mergers, it seems to me, ought to be posed now to the Federal Reserve Board and Comptroller of the Currency and to the Justice Department. I asked them, do not any longer just be spectators on the question of mergers--suit up, be involved, get active and make judgments with respect to the question of what is best for the market system of this country, what is best for the American citizen, not what is best for the newly married two corporations that have become bigger and perhaps whose misjudgments will now be borne by the American taxpayer under a doctrine of `too big to fail.'

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week, tragically an 11-year-old boy was killed in an automobile accident in the Washington, DC, area. This young boy was killed by a man who was driving a vehicle apparently very, very drunk and hit four cars. In the last car was a small van that was driving down the road with this young 11-year-old boy listening to his favorite basketball star. He was listening to a Chicago Bulls' game, listening to Michael Jordan play basketball while seated in this family van driving down the road, when he was hit by a drunk driver and tragically killed. 
I have mentioned before that my family has been visited by this tragedy on a couple of occasions, and I have a special kind of anger in these circumstances when I understand that the person who commits this kind of murder is not just the man who got drunk that day and killed an 11-year-old boy. This happens every 30 minutes in America--every half hour someone else is killed by a drunk driver. 
So often, you will discover, as is the case in this particular instance, the driver has been drunk before. The first time he was drunk, about 6 or 8 months ago, he was fined $50. On March 23, which is just a few weeks ago when that young 11-year-old boy was still full of life, this driver was again picked up drunk with twice the legal limit, over .20. But then someone gave him a special license. Oh, yes, he is picked up drunk again but he got a special license to drive back and forth to work. I ask the judges who preside over these issues, where is the judgment? Where is the judgment that allows a driver like this to be on the road again with a temporary license to kill an 11-year-old boy? 
I tried to get the judge's name so that I could show my colleagues and all those listening who has this kind of judgment. I have done that before, and I will again. But where is the judgment to understand that when people commit acts of drunk driving, they ought to have their privileges of using America's roadways removed?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a point that since the Congress took a brief recess, once again, America's trade deficit has increased. It is now, as I predicted in previous discussions with the Senate, headed towards another record high. 
Everyone talks about the tremendous progress in this Chamber and in this Government at wrestling the budget deficit to the ground, and we have made great progress in doing that. But the trade deficit is at a record high and is continuing to set records, like a merchandise trade deficit of $199 billion last year. Now it is estimated to go to $224 billion this year. It is estimated by Standard & Poor's and by many others, incidentally, who gauge these things, that we will continue to have record trade deficits--record trade deficits. 
President Clinton was in South America recently, in Chile. The South American countries were concerned because the Congress did not pass what is called fast-track trade authority. It is interesting, when you talk about this hemisphere's trading, this country is not just the biggest kid on the block; it is the better part of the block. 
Eighty-two percent of this country's trading of $10 trillion is the United States of America. And to have some other country suggest to us that `Gee, we've got a problem because you didn't pass fast track trade authority'--what on Earth are they thinking about? The fact is, we have constant, abiding and difficult trade problems. I would say to President Clinton--who I think has done a remarkable job with this country's economy and has policies that I support in many areas--we must begin to deal with this trade deficit. We cannot ignore it. 
The Asian financial crisis will make that deficit worse. We cannot continue to ignore the deficit. Our trade deficit is ratcheting up with China. It continues to increase with China and Japan. We also have a significant trade deficit with Mexico, and a significant trade deficit with Canada. The issue is: Why? 
Let me show you a statement, just last Thursday, talking about our trade with China. We have a nearly $50 billion trade deficit with China. We are a cash currency cow for China for their hard currency needs. It makes no sense for this country to say to China, `Yeah, that's all right; you can ratchet up a $50 billion trade deficit with the United States.' It hurts this country. 
Here is what is happening in China. According to a Washington Post article, `Chinese sweatshops labor for U.S. retailers. In fact, the National Labor Committee, a private New York-based whistle-blowing group, conducted an investigation into 21 garment factories, and found workers paid pennies an hour, working excessive overtime, confined to crowded dormitories, fed a thin rice gruel and denied any benefits. 
Let me just add a few details. In China's southern coastal provinces, wages and benefits are being slashed to as low as 13 cents an hour, which is added to excessive overtime hours of up to 96 hours a week. Shifts of 14 hours, 7 days a week, are being imposed. They live crammed, 10 to a room, in guarded dormitories on the factory's premises, under constant surveillance. 
Is this fair trade? Is this, when you talk about trade competition, what we ought to be competing with? Is this the race to the bottom that we are talking about: Produce the shoes and handbags, and pay somebody 13 cents an hour? Get a 15-year-old and put them in a plant, and work them 90 hours a week, and ship their handbag to a store in Dayton, Los Angeles or Tulsa and sell it to the consumer? Does that mean lower prices for the consumer or fatter profits for the corporation? And is it fair trade? The answer is no. Absolutely not. 
This ought not to be what we compete against. So we compete against 13 cents an hour, and our trade deficit goes up--way up. That is fair trade? I do not think so. I would ask the President and others to understand that this Congress is not going to provide fast track trade authority for a President. 
I know that the President went to South America and said, `Well, fast track trade authority will happen.' It will not happen. Fast track trade authority is dead, and will remain dead until this country decides it is going to begin to solve the nettlesome, vexing trade problems we have, country by country and free trade agreement by free trade agreement. 
We have had NAFTA, we have had GATT, we have had a number of trade agreements, all of which have turned out to be sour. I can, but I will not, cite chapter and verse this morning about the avalanche of Canadian grain that is leaking across that border down into this country, undercutting our farmers' income right now, in violation, in my judgment, of all fair trade standards. But nothing is done about it. I talk about 13 cents-an-hour wages which we are expected to compete against, but nothing is done about it either. 
My point is, fast track is dead, and it will remain dead until and unless the U.S. Government decides these trade problems demand a solution on behalf of our country. It ought not be embarrassing for our country to say we do have a national interest and we are going to insist on that interest in our trade relationships with other countries. 
There are plenty of issues that will consume our time in this Congress between now and the middle of October when we likely will adjourn. I do hope between now and then, at some point someone will decide that this trade issue is of consequence to this country's long-term economic future. 
We are blessed, truly blessed, as a country to have a strong, growing economy. I have talked before on the floor of the Senate about the fact that things are going well. There is no question about that. Much of that relates to decisions that this President has made and this Congress has made--some very tough decisions, some by a one-vote margin. The result is we have a growing economy while some other countries are not so fortunate. 
We have a Federal budget deficit that has largely been wrestled to the ground. The unemployment numbers in this country are down, way down. The crime rate is down. The welfare rolls are down. A lot of good things are happening in this country. But it is not an excuse to ignore the other challenges we have. One of those challenges represents this abiding trade deficit that is getting worse, not better. We must, it seems to me, find a way to respond it to and deal with it. 
I again say that we must take a look at the Asian currency collapse, at the failure of the Japanese to deal with the devaluation of its currency, with the forced-labor problems in China, and the intellectual piracy that goes on. One of the reasons for what is happening with respect to that piracy is, when we try to send a video game or a compact disc from this country into China, guess what the tariff is: 50 percent. 
Here is a country that has a $50 billion trade surplus with the U.S: in other words, they are selling us far more than they are buying from us--and when we want to ship some intellectual property over there, they impose a 50 percent tariff on us. 
I was in China. I talked with the President of China. I said, `You can't do this. You can't shut off China to the U.S. pork market and stop pork shipments. You can't shut off China to wheat shipments from our country. You can't continue to produce, on a pirated basis, the kind of production that we see coming from China in compact discs and in other areas.' It is not something that ever ought to be countenanced, and yet we have agreements to try to shut it down, and it does not get shut down. 
My only point is this: This problem is getting worse. This shows the hemorrhage of red ink on international trade with this country. It is getting worse, not better, and I ask not just this administration but this Congress to decide that this challenge is something we have a responsibility to meet. 
Mr. President, this afternoon we turn to an education issue, and I intend to come back and visit a bit this afternoon on the Coverdell amendment and a range of amendments that will be offered to it dealing with the subject of education. In the meantime, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. If I might respond to the Senator from Georgia, I certainly would have no objection to some parity in time. My understanding is that more time has been consumed on that side during this day. I assume you would also want parity. My expectation is we have a unanimous consent request by which we will dispose of this bill. 
My intent and my hope was to be able to speak for 15 minutes inasmuch as this amendment was disposed of and another amendment is not now offered.

Mr. DORGAN. I have listened with interest not only to this debate but to much debate prior to this on this legislation. 
Since the year 1647, when the colonists in Massachusetts created tax-supported public education, we have had a long and proud tradition in this country of public schools. By far, the majority--in fact, well over 90 percent--of the students who attend elementary and secondary schools in our country will attend public schools as part of our public education system. 
We have substantial tax incentives that already exist in this country in our Tax Code to support education. I am holding a list of 16 such tax incentives. They provide over $78 billion in tax reductions over a 5-year period for various kinds of expenditures and activities dealing with education. One of them, $19.6 billion, is the deduction for charitable contributions to educational institutions. That is a method by which some make contributions to private schools and get tax deductions for that. 
All of these provisions dealing with tax incentives are important. This Congress has generally supported them and increased them substantially last year with HOPE and lifetime learning credits, deductibility for interest on student loans and various other devices. 
The question now is on a proposal offered by the Senator from Georgia. I have indicated to him previously that I am not attempting to trash the proposal itself. I think this kind of discussion begs the question, what is the priority of need? What are the rankings of need that exist with respect to education in our country? 
The Senator from Georgia comes up with a proposal that says the need is that we should provide other tax incentives that allow people to put away savings to be used for public and private elementary and secondary education. 
The Secretaries of Treasury and Education, in a letter dated February 9, says that this proposal, the way it is constructed, `disproportionately benefits the most affluent families.' This is the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education. This proposal `disproportionately benefits the most affluent families.' Further, they say, this will not generate much additional savings in any event. 
If one were going to do this, it seems to me one would want to do it the right way. The question that I come to the floor to ask is, what is the ranking of need that exists in education? What are the priorities? What represents the approach that is most in need of public investment? I want to take this down to 
the specifics. I know some will say this is just anecdotal and doesn't matter. 
Education is one child at a time in this country. It is not some theory. It is one child at a time. I want to tell you about a young woman that I met last Wednesday morning named Rosie Two Bears. Rosie is a little second grader, bright-eyed. She has a wonderful little smile, and she goes to school in Cannon Ball, ND, a school that I visited last Wednesday, among many other schools. The Cannon Ball, ND, school is on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, but it is a public school in a public school district with very little tax base. 
I want to tell you about the school, because Rosie Two Bears, when I entered her second grade class, asked me, `Senator, will you buy us a new school?' Well, I didn't have the answer for Rosie last Wednesday, but I want to tell you why Rosie Two Bears asks if we can buy her a new school. And I tell you this by virtue of saying this represents the need, the priority of need, not just in Cannon Ball, ND, but all across this country. 
This school is, in its oldest part, some 90 years old. It sits in a desperately poor school district. It has been condemned with respect to the older part of the school as a fire hazard, among other things. It has 145 students and 40 other staff and maintenance workers. For the 145 students in K through 6th grade there are two bathrooms and one water fountain. Let me say that again: 145 kids, two bathrooms and one water fountain. 
Now, one of the classes is held in what is called the choir room. It used to be the janitor closet. But they can't always hold class there because sewer gas comes backing up and you can't have a classroom when sewer gas creates such a stench that little kids will be made sick if they sit in that room. So what do they do when the sewer gas backs up and fills that old janitor's closet, which is now used as a room in which they sing and practice choir? They move those kids out of that room to some other hallway in the school. 
There is a little gymnasium, very old, but there are no locker rooms, so the fourth and fifth grade basketball players must change in the bathrooms--two bathrooms in the entire school. But there is not enough room in the bathrooms, so little fourth graders are changing out in the hallway. You wonder what is it like for a fourth grade basketball player to change into his basketball clothes in the hallway because there are no locker rooms and the toilets are full, with people trying to change for the same basketball game. 
You might say, what does this mean? It means, in our country, right in this country, we have schools that are in desperate condition, and we have bright-eyed, wonderful little children walking through the school door, going into a classroom where the desks are not a half inch apart--the desks are touching in every circumstance because the classroom is 8 feet by 12 feet and they have so many kids in there there is no room for even an inch between the desks. Next year, twice as many kids are supposed to be in that classroom, but they can't do that so they will break up the class. When they break up the class, one teacher handles two classes and spends 15 minutes talking to this group and then says, `All right, now I will be talking to this class for 15 minutes,' in the same room and will go back 15 minutes later, in a crowded room with two classes because that represents the overflow from other classes. 
I ask the question, how many of us would like our kids to walk through that school door and would say to our second grader, say to Rosie's classmate, `Yes this is a good education. Our country is proud of the education it gives to you.' We cannot afford to put another bathroom in that school, we cannot afford to add classrooms that are of adequate size. We cannot afford to fix a school that has sewer gas seeping up through the choir room. We can't afford it. We don't have the money. 
That is why I ask this question today about need. We see today a proposal coming to the Senate that says let's spend $1.6 billion on education in a manner that the Secretary of the Treasury says will `disproportionately benefit the most affluent families.' I ask the question, is that expenditure something that was determined to be more important than the Cannon Ball school? Because the Cannon Ball school is not about theory. The Cannon Ball school, on Wednesday when I visited, was about real needs for real little kids that are in the public school system hoping to catch up and keep up with every other kid that enters a classroom door in this country. 
What is the ranking of need? What do we decide is important? It is unfair for me to talk just about Cannon Ball. Down the road 40 miles, I met with a school board there on Wednesday, the Standing Rock High School, run by the BIA--in effect, this Congress. It is a wonderful school. Those boys just won the State class B basketball championship. That Indian school on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation is enormously proud of those young boys. Against all odds, no one expected them to win the State high school basketball championship, but they did. 
You know what is wrong with their school? They have classrooms in the gymnasium for 2 months. Their school has lighting fixtures that are leaking PCBs. It would be funny to see the national press go down and take a look at PCBs leaking from lighting fixtures or visit Rosie Two Bears in Cannon Ball. But somehow that is not sexy. Those kids aren't in classrooms, because the lights are leaking a carcinogen, so we have to clear the building out. 
Is that a priority? It is our responsibility. That school belongs to the BIA. The funds for that come from this Congress. Is that a priority? Is it less of a priority than providing a tax break, the bulk of which will disproportionately benefit the most affluent families. That is the question I ask. 
I am not suggesting this is wholly unworthy, or that it is an idea that has no merit. That is not what I come to suggest. I say if the U.S. Senate is prepared to say we have $1.6 billion with which to invest in the education of young Americans, then I say the Cannon Ball school ought to have some claim to that. Rosie Two Bears and her second-grade class, sitting in a building where sewer gas forces them out of their choir room, ought to have some claim to part of that at least. We at least ought to have the opportunity to have that debate here on the floor of the Senate. 
When you have unlimited wants, virtually unlimited wants and limited resources, then there is a responsibility, I think, to prioritize them. What represents our most important investment? We have a range of amendments that will be offered. There is an amendment, for example, that talks about exactly what I am discussing--school construction, the need to respond to crumbling schools, 
the need to be fair to Rosie Two Bears and her classmates in that second grade class. School construction. Can we help repair crumbling schools? That amendment is going to have 15 minutes of debate on each side. What an awful, awful thing for us to have done. 
I hope that however we dispose of these issues, that some day, some way, on the floor of this Senate we will truly have the capability of deciding what represents our priorities in education. This may represent the priority of the Senator from Georgia; it is not mine. My priority is to decide that we have enormous challenges in public education in this country. 
I am proud of our public education system. We have not come to this point in our history by accident. I mentioned when I started that, in 1647, the colonists in this country decided to begin a tax-supported system of public education. What an enormously important element in our country's future and our country's history, to have decided that every young American can become everything that his or her natural talents will allow, because we are going to create a public education system that allows every single one of them that opportunity. That has been our tradition and must be our future. 
When we talk about $1.6 billion, the question is, if that $1.6 billion is available, what do we use it for? What do we use it for? Do we use it to fix those schools that are falling down on these kids? Or do we add a teacher to a class that is twice the size it ought to be? Or do we provide another tax credit in which over half of the benefit will go to 7 percent of the students in private schools? 
I say to the Senator from Georgia, I have great respect for him as a legislator; I just disagree with the priority. Based on a ranking of needs, there is no question as to what the answer is. The answer is that we ought to, as a country, decide that our investment in the public education of this country is paramount. And when we have problems that local school districts can't correct, where they don't have the tax base and the resources to make investments on behalf of those kids, then we are going to try to help them some way or another. If $1.6 billion is what we have today, then I say that is the way we ought to use that money. That is the debate we must have. 
We have a good number of amendments pending or to be offered of legislation. I know that the Senator from Georgia has always maintained there has been a filibuster on this legislation. In fact, I maintain that there has been a lockout and has always been a lockout. The reason people have had a problem getting this to the floor is, they wanted to bring it to the floor by saying: This is our idea, and if you have another one, we may allow you to debate it, but only minimally. We are not going to allow the Senate to do its regular order, because we are not going to allow an amendment and allow you to debate the amendment for 3 or 4 hours. 
We were involved in that for a long while. Now we are back on the issue and we are stuck in a situation where, I guess, in order to have this bill considered and to have our amendments in order, we had to agree to 15 minutes of debate on each side on an amendment that addresses the central issue I have been talking about--investment in school construction.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Well, that makes my point. That is 30 minutes on each side to talk about the central issue in education, about the need for investment in infrastructure in education. You just can't expect these little kids to walk through a school door and say, `By the way, we know this school is in disrepair, falling down around you.' The Cannon Ball school I mentioned, they have a heater, but they don't have an automatic switch for it. And this school can't hook-up to the Internet because the wiring is so old. But back to the heater, they turn the heater on by climbing up a scaffold to the ceiling of the gymnasium and turning a manual switch. 
My point is that a half hour on each side is not enough. That is twice as much as I suggested, because that amendment gets a little more than others. But a half hour on each side is not nearly enough to debate the central problems of how much we should invest and how we invest in the needs of public education. That is my problem with the legislation the Senator from Georgia has offered. There are better amendments. I hope one will be approved as we move along, and I hope we will have a longer period of debate on education sometime later in this Congress.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the many achievements of Kati Sasserville on her retirement this week. Kati is ending her eleven years of service at Otter Tail Power Company headquartered in Fergus Falls Minnesota, just across the border from my home state of North Dakota. Otter Tail also serves many customers in my state. 
Kati is a trailblazer and a source of inspiration from many young women in the upper Midwest. Her years at Otter Power put her in the forefront of the debate on electric utility restructuring. A 1973 law school graduate of the University of Minnesota, Kati started her distinguished 23 year career as a trial attorney in the Office of General Counsel for the U.S. Navy. She served as a Minnesota Public Utilities Commissioner from 1975 to 1981. 
Kati has a professional and civic membership roster second to none. She won Harper's Bazaar Diamond Superwoman Award back in 1980. The Fergus Falls Daily Journal named her one of the City's `Eight Most Influential' citizens in 1987. In addition, Kati managed to balance her active professional career with the needs of her family. She managed to raise six wonderful children and now enjoys the company of six grandchildren. She is an example of someone who persevered and made it on the merits. 
Kati's a formidable advocate, and I will fondly remember debating the energy issues of the day. Her sense of fair play was always appreciated. 
Kati is the only person I know who would wake up in the morning and thank God for the Global Warming phenomenon. Any possibility of temperatures warming up in Fergus Falls is something to hope for in the future. 
I ask my colleagues to join with me in wishing Kati well in her retirement and in fulfilling her life-long dream of running a bed and breakfast in Fergus Falls.

Mr. DORGAN. 
Mr. President, we now have had two crop years under the 1996 farm law and soon farmers across this country will be planting their spring crops for the third year of this seven-year farm law. It is time to take a serious look at how this new farm law, often called the Freedom to Farm law, is working. Is it achieving the goals and promises that were made? What is happening to our nation's system of family farm agriculture under this law? Is it creating new hope and new opportunities for a new generation of family farms on the land? Or is it pushing more and more family farm operators off the land and further depopulating rural America? 
Launched during a period of high grain prices with a flurry of optimism and hope, the Freedom to Farm law is taking family farmers down a very rocky path and even more uncertain future. The initially generous farm payments that fueled its passage are now giving way to the harsher realities of not having a working safety net. 
When poor crops, low prices, escalating production costs, and abnormal weather all arrive at the same time, the current farm law, with its capped commodity loan rates and declining transition payments, is poorly suited to respond to the disastrous conditions facing many of our farm families. During the debate of the 1996 farm bill, I said that the time would come when farm commodity prices would fall well below the costs of production and we would need a working safety net for our nation's family farmers. In fact, the failure to have a working safety net was the primary reason that many of us could not support the 1996 farm bill. 
The proponents of the Freedom to Farm law promised that a second look would be taken if rural America ran into trouble under their farm bill. As we begin the third crop year under this farm law, there is no question that large portions of rural America are in serious trouble. The economic crisis in the countryside is being demonstrated every week by the hundreds of farm auction notices that appear in rural America's newspapers, particularly our agricultural weeklies. The sheer volume of these farm auctions demands that the farm bill debate be reopened, so that we can make the needed mid-course corrections to this farm law. 
Behind the escalating exodus of farmers this spring is the underlying issue of farm commodity prices. The value of North Dakota's spring wheat and barley crops this past year have each dropped by 41 percent from the previous year. This is a combined total of $659 million less than the year before. That's a tremendous drain of money out of farmers pockets and North Dakota's farm economy. It is why our farms are not cash flowing and our bankers are having more and more difficulty in financing their borrowers for another year. 
After talking with North Dakota farmers and the agricultural community, I'm convinced the problem is not just the blizzards and floods that we have experienced in the past few years, nor is it just confined to North Dakota. 
There are a number of underlying problems that must be addressed within our nation's farm policies. We need increased agricultural research to combat specific crop disease problems such as fusarium head blight, which is also known as scab. This disease has had a devastating effect on producers in many parts of North Dakota. We need to recognize that the current Federal Crop Insurance program is not adequately addressing disaster conditions, particularly in regions which have suffered a succession of weather-related disasters. We need to address a multitude of trade issues that are adversely affecting our foreign agricultural markets, and unfairly interfering in our domestic markets.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in reading this letter, I am reminded of the reasons why it is so important that our nation provide a national agricultural policy framework that not only fosters a family farm system of agriculture, but purposefully sets out to undergird that system and provide the tools that are necessary for our family farmers and ranchers to have the opportunity to be successful. 
It is for this reason that I am introducing the Cost of Production Safety Net Act. I am pleased to include Senators Daschle, Wellstone, Johnson, Conrad, Harkin and Baucus as cosponsors to my bill. I encourage others to join in this effort and look forward to having a meaningful debate on our nation's agricultural future in the remaining months of this session.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the budget resolution contains a sense of the Senate that the Tax Code shall be sunsetted at the end of the year 2001. It doesn't provide what might be replacing that. It doesn't suggest whether after the current Tax Code is sunsetted there will be a flat tax, a VAT tax, a national sales tax; it just says sunset the Tax Code. 
The chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, says the following: 
I believe that a comprehensive overhaul of the Tax Code should be in place before any action is taken to sunset the existing Tax Code. 
The Tax Executives Institute, which represents thousands of corporations around the country, has said the same thing. It would be irresponsible to say let's get rid of the Tax Code without telling people what they are going to put in its place. What do you say to somebody who is going to buy a home tomorrow and they expect their mortgage interest deduction is going to be----

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last evening, the Senator from New Mexico characterized the amendment as an amendment which supports the current Tax Code. It is a clever way to debate, I guess, what this amendment is about. I support reforming the current Tax Code, making it better, more simple, more fair, but I don't believe we ought to say, `Let's abolish the current Tax Code and tell the American people there is nothing that we are going to put in its place this moment, you guess about that; you guess about that.' 
It may be a national sales tax of 30 or 35 percent. That is what the recent study from the Brookings Institute says it would have to be. Maybe it is a flat tax where a billionaire pays the same rate as a person who works for $20,000 a year. 
Let me conclude. The Senator from Maryland makes the point that I made last night. How would anybody tomorrow plan their expansion, plan their next action if they didn't know what the Tax Code was going to be in the year 2002? 
How will anybody decide to buy a house wondering whether they are going to have a mortgage interest deduction? 
How will anybody decide about their charitable contributions if they don't know that the tax system is going to allow that as a deduction? That is the point. 
This is not the thing to do. The chairman of the Finance Committee said so and many, many others around the country, including the President, said so. 
Let us strike this provision and replace it with the language I have suggested that supports the mortgage interest deduction, the charitable deduction, and others in the current code. We can improve the current code, and we should, but we ought not allow this provision to stay in the Budget Act.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is, with all due respect, a sloppy way to legislate. I do not--I guess I heard part of this being read a moment ago. The reason it is offered, I assume, is some do not want to vote on the amendment that I offered. 
I wrote the amendment, noticed it to the Senate. Everyone had an opportunity to read it, look at it yesterday, make a judgment about it. Now we have an amendment that is sent to the desk as a second-degree. Certainly you have a right to do that, but we are going to vote on my amendment. However, your amendment is disposed of, I might say to the Senator, my amendment is going to be offered as a second-degree. We are going to vote on my amendment. So we can do it sooner; we can do it later. One way or the other, we are going to vote on my amendment. It just seems to me that in a day in which we are going to be dealing with 30, 50, 60 amendments, 
if we start doing second degrees because somebody doesn't want to vote on an amendment, we will be here until next Tuesday. 
As I said, the Senator has every right to offer a second degree. I don't contest that. I'm saying we are not going to get out of here if this is the way the Senate is going to do its business. We will not get out of here. 
I wrote an amendment. I made it available to everybody in the Senate to see, review, look at it, to make a judgment. I expected when I came here this morning we would have a vote. That is what I thought the unanimous consent was about last evening. Now I discover we have a second-degree and we go through a reading. We will be here forever if this is the way we will do business. 
Again I say if you think you will avoid a vote on this, you will not. When we dispose of this, if I'm recognized, I will offer a second degree. If I'm not, I will be here because I'm going to get recognized and I will offer a second degree, and when I do, we will vote on my amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me explain to my colleagues that the findings are the same as the underlying amendment that I offered with the exception that at the end, under `Sense of Congress'--I will simply read very briefly what I have added. 
It is the sense of Congress that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and charitable contributions-- 
That was my previous amendment-- 
and that a sunset of the Tax Code that does not provide a replacement tax system that preserves this deductibility could damage the American dream of home ownership and could threaten the viability of nonprofit institutions. 
This is a second degree that I am offering. 
I don't know that I need to say much more about it except that it essentially is a vote on what I had offered in the first instance. 
My intent here is very simple. It is not to denigrate those who have different ideas than I have about this issue. It is, however, to say that I think suggesting that we throw away the current Tax Code, as imperfect as it is and as much in need of reform as it is, without suggesting what will come in its place is to say to all Americans who are homeowners that we are not sure that we are going to have a tax system in the future that allows you to deduct your home mortgage interest, we are not sure we are going to have a tax system in the future that allows charitable contributions to be deducted. 
So I think the responsible thing to do is to say to the American people that when there is a sunset, if there is, that there is a replacement that will be included in these provisions.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to speak for 30 seconds simply to say the intent of the second-degree amendment was to say to the American people that whatever the merits of reforming our Tax Code--and most of us, myself included, think it does need reform--that when we decide to change the Tax Code, if we decide to do that, its replacement shall give some assurance to the American people that we are not going to scrap their ability to deduct their home mortgage interest, to scrap the ability to deduct charitable contributions. That is the purpose of that second-degree amendment. I appreciate very much support on that amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. I will be brief. 
The Senator from Iowa raise a concern of some urgency for the United States Senate. What he is describing is a bipartisan agreement on legislation that is critical to our part of the country. It deals not only with research, but also with crop insurance. It deals with critically needed investment for research in crop diseases such as fusarium head blight or scab which 
produces vomitoxin in wheat and barley. 
We have an awful problem out in our part of the country with these crop diseases and crop losses. We need a viable crop insurance program. We were delighted when the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Indiana and others reached this bipartisan agreement and moved it through the conference with the House of Representatives. I know how hard that was. That was a tough thing to do because the sides were quite far apart. When they reached this agreement, we were delighted with that. It is an important agreement. 
Now, as usual, in the case of politics, timing is everything. It is very important for this bipartisan conference agreement to be considered by the Senate and moved along. Time is of the essence here. 
I commend the Senator from Iowa.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate Senator Lautenberg yielding me the time. I am going to visit a bit some of the items that were just discussed about Indian schools and schools generally. I wanted to come and talk about the Moseley-Braun amendment. 
We talk a lot about family values in this Chamber. It seems to me that every family that sits around in the evening and talks about their lives must certainly talk about the schools their kids are going to. We have 14 million students who attend schools in this country now, schools that are in need of extensive repair--extensive repair. 
This afternoon, we sit in a nice Chamber. We have people here who enjoy their lives, and they are well dressed. We talk about education and theory in the abstract. In Cannonball, ND, today there is some little kid sitting in school, and I bet you that child is smelling sewer gas backed up from the pipes, because that is the way the school is down in Cannonball. That school is 70 years old. There are 150 kids attending that school with two bathrooms and one water fountain, and that school is in serious disrepair. 
I just mention that one, but I could mention thousands of schools across this country that are in desperate need of repair. Senator Moseley-Braun has proposed an amendment that says in this Budget Act let us make room for school construction, for the Federal Government to provide some incentive, some small incentive to State and local governments to help repair and rebuild our schools. 
I have two children in public school this afternoon. Last year in public school, one of those children was in a classroom with 30 students. That is too big. This year, one of them is in a temporary classroom or an expanded mobile home. That is too bad. It is a good school, and both of them are getting a 
good education. The fact is, we can do better in all of these areas, especially with respect to school construction. We know what the problem is and we know how to fix it. The issue of the budget on the floor of the Senate is a matter of priorities. What do each of us think is important for this country. 
I watched last week during consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill someone come into this Chamber and offered an amendment that went just like that, just that quick, for $170 million for missile defense. It wasn't debated, it wasn't discussed, it was just added. And there it was, $170 million. 
Let me talk about these schools for a moment, and let me talk specifically about the Indian schools, because while we are talking about the 14 million students who are in school today in schools that need extensive repair, let me talk just for a moment about the students in the Indian schools run by the BIA. These are schools owned by the Federal Government. They are owned by us. We have no one else to blame if we don't fix those schools, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to fix it. You can look at the school, find out what is wrong and spend the money to invest in that school to help those children. 
Let me tell you about the Ojibwa school. That is up on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. Those children walk between portable classrooms in the middle of the winter up to six times a day in bone-chilling weather. A health and safety inspection of that school and temporary classrooms in 1995 found 156 violations--fire hazards, broken windows, roof leaking, wooden stairs and landings for portable classrooms had deteriorated so much to the point they were no longer safe, wires hanging exposed from some classrooms. 
The Cannonball School is a public school. It is not a BIA school. It is on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation for grades K through five. The school is 70 years old. It has been condemned as a fire hazard, but the local tax base cannot support building a new school. The second level of the school isn't used because the stairs are unsafe. The water and sewer systems are old and regularly back up. 
Last week, when we talked to the Cannonball School superintendent, she said two classes had to be moved in with other classes because the smell of sewage got so bad in the classrooms of these young children. One wing of the school doesn't have running water. Mr. President, 145 students and 40 staff share two bathrooms and one water fountain. The electric wiring is so old that it cannot support computers in the classrooms, but it doesn't matter, because there can't be computers in these classrooms. The classrooms are 8 foot by 12 foot. The music classes take place in what used to be the janitor's closet, 8 foot by 10 foot. 
Standing Rock Reservation: Standing Rock School has PCBs leaking from the light fixtures. PCB, as we know, is a carcinogen. It is very dangerous. Federal law says that PCB levels over 50 parts per million are unsafe. In the Fort Yates school, the PCBs leaking from the light fixtures measured not 50 parts per million, which is unsafe, but 143,000 parts per million. That is in our school. That is with kids attending school. 
What happened? They shut the school. The took the kids out of the school and placed them around town in portable classrooms, some in a home. Six classes have been meeting in 
the school gymnasium. The others have been meeting in portable trailers and a private home. The extra classes, like physical education, music and art, of course, have been suspended, and the school officials don't yet know when the students will return to their classrooms. 
PCBs leaking from light fixtures in a school that is in disrepair--this happens to be on an Indian reservation where, incidentally, in 9 months, 48 teenagers attempted suicide. In the last 9 months, 48 attempted suicides, 6 of which were successful. 
If I sound a little angry about this, I am. Every single year I have come to the floor of the Senate to talk about this problem, and these kids go to school in conditions for which we ought to be ashamed. This Congress can do something about it, and the budget process is a process in which we make decisions. If someone stands up here and says, `No, school construction doesn't count because we have other priorities,' I ask them, `What is your priority if it is not your children?' By `your children,' I mean this country's children. 
All across this country, when our kids go to school, I hope every parent wants their child to walk into a school that is safe, secure, and in good repair. I defy anybody in this Chamber to stand up and say to me that kids who go to school where sewer gas leaks into the classrooms and they have to move kids out of those classrooms because of the stench of sewer gas, I defy anybody to say it is a good thing for kids. If it is not a good thing for kids, and we know it is going on around this country--and anecdotically we see it in a GAO report and other investigations--then let's decide we want to do something about it. The question isn't whether, the question is what. 
Senator Moseley-Braun has made a proposal. Her proposal is modest. I suspect it will be voted down. It will be voted down because we have people who construct the budget and say, `Here are our priorities; this is what we want to spend money on, and it doesn't include this.' 
The amount of school repairs necessary in this country last year--3 percent of the funds available to meet the needs of school repairs was allocated to the State and local governments last year. If this Congress doesn't have the nerve and the will to say on behalf of our kids that you matter, this is a problem we know we can fix and we are going to put in our budget the provisions that allow us to say to kids, `We're going to invest in your young lives,' if this Congress doesn't have the capability to do that, then there is something, in my judgment, fundamentally wrong with the priorities we have established for public spending. 
I said yesterday that everybody in this Chamber will be dead in 100 years. Everybody. Nobody will be around here feeling good, working. They will all be dead. We will all be dead. Only historians will evaluate through our budget, by looking back at the budget process in this Congress, the 105th Congress, what were our values; what did we think was important; what did we decide to invest in; what did we think would improve this country. 
I hope historians will not look back at us and say, `Well, oh, they had discussions about a terrible deplorable condition in some schools in their country, but they decided not to invest in schools, because, somehow, schools took a backseat, schools were in second place to a range of other priorities, some of them very strange priorities.' 
I hope historians will say that this Congress, yes, in tight fiscal times decided that one of the most important investments they could make in America was to make a good investment in the education of our kids. 
No kid in this country can go to school and learn the way we expect children to be able to learn unless those schools are in decent repair. They must be safe, in decent repair, good places of learning. You have to have a teacher who knows how to teach, a student who is willing to learn, and a parent involved in that education. When you have that at work and have invested in good school facilities that are necessary to make that take place, then we will have done our job as a country. 
I wanted to come and say Senator Moseley-Braun has offered an amendment that is very, very important. I can think of a thousand reasons why people will stand up and say they are against it. None of them are good. Mark Twain was once asked to debate--I have told my colleagues this before. He said, `Of course.' 
`We've not told you the subject.' 
He said, `Doesn't matter, as long as I can take the negative side; that takes no preparation.' 
It takes very little preparation to oppose. The Senator from Illinois has proposed something that ought to rank right at the top of the list of what is important for this country. When we vote today, I hope the American people who listen to this debate will call the offices and say, `We agree that this represents the first priority for the Congress, the first priority for this country, to invest in the lives and education of the American children.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<DOCNO>105-dorgan-nd-2-19980401</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when I have used 5 minutes. I will then yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas and yield back the remainder of the time. 
My amendment is very simple. There is in the budget resolution brought to the floor of the Senate a sense-of-the-Senate provision that will sunset the Internal Revenue Code on December 31, 2001. 
My amendment strikes that provision and in its place it inserts language saying it is the sense of the Congress that we support the continued tax deductibility of the home mortgage interest deduction, charitable contributions, and so on. 
My point is this: It is irresponsible, in my judgment, to talk about sunsetting the Tax Code and a progressive income tax without providing any means of telling the American people what you would put in its place. 
I want to read something from the Tax Executives Institute. They represent some 5,000 corporations around the country. 
They write that it is folly to make tax policy by sound bite, and proposals to sunset the Tax Code without making provisions for its replacement or telling the American people what you propose for replacement ought to be rejected. 
This is what they say:  
For example, a company that otherwise would invest millions of dollars in a multi-year expansion of its manufacturing facilities might well demur if the pending legislation were enacted because of uncertainty over whether or how, after December 31, 2001, it would recover its costs. 
They wouldn't know: 
To repeal the Internal Revenue Code without specifying a replacement system--to exalt the exhilaration of `doing it now' over the necessity of `doing it right'--is to threaten major disruptions of the economy and the lives of the American people. 
The question I have is this: For those who say let's sunset the entire Tax Code, I say, when you say sunset the Tax Code in 2001, what are you going to replace it with, a national sales tax? A Brookings Institution study on that says if you want to replace the current progressive income tax with a national sales tax, you are probably talking about at least a 35 percent tax rate. I know that the proponents of a national sales tax say a 15 percent rate will work. But study after study shows that you are probably talking a 35 percent tax rate, and that is the 35 percent sales tax, for example, when you buy a home. Think of adding 35 percent to the cost of buying a home. 
How about a flat tax or a VAT tax? A Treasury Department analysis in 1996 took a look at one of the major flat tax proposals in the Congress. It says the flat tax will reduce taxes for families with incomes of $200,000 or more, and increase taxes for families with incomes under $200,000. Is that what the American people want? To sunset the entire Tax Code and replace it with--tax breaks for the highest income folks and higher taxes for the rest? 
I ask the question, Is the current Tax Code perfect? No. Are there significant troubles with it? Yes. I have a proposal on what we ought to do about that. I think my plan would greatly simplify the tax system for most Americans. But it does not include flat tax, VAT tax, sales tax, all of which would tax work and exempt investment, cut only upper-income folks' taxes and increase taxes on working folks. That is exactly what all the proposals are about ricocheting around this Chamber. 
Don't take it from me, take it from the Treasury analysis, take it from the Congressional Budget Office analysis, take it from any study you like. But those who want to abolish the current Tax Code rather than fix what is wrong with the current Tax Code want to replace it, in most cases, with something that says, `Let's tax work and let's exempt investments. Let's propose a new system that lowers the tax burden on upper-income folks and raises the tax burden on the rest.' 
I will tell those who offer this proposal that everyone out 
there in this country who owns a home and understands their home mortgage interest is deductible from their income tax, if this sort of thing ever passes, they will be told by this Congress, `Don't count on deductibility of your home mortgage interest, because we may not have a tax system that allows that. Don't count on the deductibility of your home mortgage interest, because we may abolish the tax system. In fact, we want to sunset it, abolish it, replace it with something else, but we don't want to tell you what that something else is.' 
It is highly irresponsible, in my judgment, to say let us just abolish the Tax Code as of December 31, 2001 before agreeing on a replacement.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand this proposal to terminate the tax code has been ricocheting around for some long while. The Tax Executives Institute says it best. This is a good sound bite, but it is a poor excuse for good policy. Don't take it from me, take it from American corporations and taxpayers who need certainty. 
Those who want to terminate the entire Internal Revenue Code in this manner risk creating financial trouble for millions of homeowners. Nearly thirty million homeowners who would ask you: If you want to get rid of the current Tax Code, what are your intentions with respect to the tax deductibility of my home mortgage interest? Do you intend to keep that? If not, why not? What do you say to folks who have invested in a home and whose home values will now drop because this proposal would abolish the deductibility of home mortgage interest? 
If this extreme measure is enacted, future home buyers would likely find it more difficult to purchase a new home and realize the American Dream of home ownership. This is because, in addition to losing the tax deduction, such a move would surely result in great uncertainty for our financial markets, lead to higher interest rates, and otherwise increase the costs of purchasing a new home--already the largest single financial investment for most families. 
Another one of the many important casualties caused by these efforts to terminate the Tax Code would be the tax incentives that encourage millions of taxpayers to make gifts to charities that provide services to needy families and others. Charities perform an important public service by providing help to others when the government is unwilling or unable to do so. At a time when the government is downsizing and we are asking charities and other groups to do more, we ought not take away their key tax tools for attracting the funds they need to meet future challenges. But that's exactly what would happen should this sunsetting proposal become law. 
These are just two examples of the serious problems caused by this wrong-headed proposal. For all of the uncertainties this proposal would create, one thing seems certain to me: this sunset provision will leave most Americans in the dark. 
My amendment is simple, it strikes the sunset provision and inserts something in place of it that I think makes sense: support for the continued tax deduction for home mortgage interest, charitable giving and more. I hope my colleagues will support that motion to strike. 
I yield as much time as he may consume to the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I guess I have 3 minutes remaining. The other side has 2. I will take my 3 minutes. They are welcome to finish. 
There is a wonderful legislative strategy, I guess, that if you cannot change the facts, change the subject. The subject here isn't about the current Tax Code; the subject is about what do you want to put in place of a Tax Code you want to abolish? Something new, we are told. Well, it is interesting. There is nothing new around here that I see about the proposals to change the Tax Code. All the proposals I have seen are the same tired, old proposals--exempt the rich, tax the rest, and call it reform. 
You think that is not the case? The plans out here are: Tax work and exempt investment; tax people to go to work; tax the income from work; say to those that clip coupons, you are exempt. Nothing new about that. People have been trying to do that for a century. 
The question I would ask the opponents of this amendment is, do you think the American people will be better off with a national sales tax plan? Is that what you are going to replace it with? 
Bill Gale at Brookings, who did this piece, says your national sales tax rate, by the way, despite all the numbers they tell you, will be 35 percent. Want to pay a 35 percent sales tax on a home you buy? Do you think you are better off with that kind of tax program? Do you think you are better off with a program that has also been introduced here in the Congress that the Treasury Department analyzes that everybody over $200,000 gets a big tax cut? Everybody under $200,000 a year in income gets a big tax increase? Do you think you will be better off with that kind of Tax Code? I don't think so. Is a business going to be better off when they find they can't get their existing depreciation deductions ? Or tens of millions of homeowners will be better off when they discover they can't deduct their home mortgage interest? 
No, this isn't about change. And with respect to Mr. Greenspan, who we are told about here--Mr. Greenspan, of course, is the fellow who said if we ever go below 6 percent unemployment we have calamity in this country. It has been about 45 months that we have been below 6 percent unemployment and the economy is doing well and inflation is in check. He was wrong about that. He said we will have a new wave of inflation, every month. He has been wrong about that for 4 years. Inflation is way down. I was about ready to think maybe the Senator had merit until he started talking about Greenspan supporting his case. 
Sunset the Tax Code--what will you replace it with? Will the American people be better off with a flat tax? A VAT tax? A national sales tax? 
This is the only town in America where people think it is a bold new stroke, having a billionaire proposing a tax plan that would cut his taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars. That is not bold or new. It is the same tired old argument the American people have heard for years and years and years.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will take just a moment. I did want to respond ever so briefly to the remarks of Senator Coverdell. 
I did not object to the unanimous consent request by which we will consider the Coverdell proposal. Amendments have now been made in order and the proposal will be considered on the floor of the Senate in a way that limits the amendments and limits the time for each amendment. 
I say the Senator from Georgia puts his own construct on exactly what has happened. There is another construct, and that is that this was not a filibuster but a lockout--circumstances where we were told that a bill was to come to the floor of the Senate, a bill dealing with tax credits for education, and the only circumstance under which it could come to the floor of the Senate is if those on the minority side would be willing to restrict their amendments both as to type of amendments and as to time. 
It is a very unusual Senate procedure. It is not a procedure that has been followed by the majority side, I might say. As one Member of the Senate who will not want to see this habit-forming, I simply say to the Senator from Georgia that I am happy he will get his day on this piece of legislation. The amendments have indeed been limited. I think he would not want to be in a similar circumstance on the next issue on which someone on this side would, if in the majority, say we would like to bring our bill to the floor, and by the way, we will only do that in ways that restrict your opportunity to offer amendments, and only do that in ways that restrict the time of the amendments that you do offer. 
For example, among the ideas that exist here are not just an idea to provide tax credits for people who send their children to nonpublic schools--all schools, but especially nonpublic schools; among the ideas that exist here are, for example, a proposal to provide some assistance to repair some of the crumbling schools in this country, not so that the Federal Government will be involved in rebuilding local schools--that is the job of local school districts, State and local governments --but an incentive in a way that says we can at least pay some of the interest on the bonds that provide the right incentive to invest in our schools because so many of them are now 30, 50, 70 years old and more, and some of them are in desperate condition and need help. 
On that amendment, for example, under this agreement there 
will be, I believe, 1 hour of debate. A significant amendment of significant importance, but the Senate will only devote 1 hour to that subject because to devote more would somehow abridge the interests of those who want to contain the debate on education here in the Senate. 
I use that as an example. There are others. I say to the Senator from Georgia, I did not, since the first day of this discussion, feel the problem was a filibuster. I felt and still do feel very strongly the problem is that the majority leader said this is our bill, this is our agenda, it is what we feel is important, and we will bring it to the floor, but you must comply with what we expect of you. Don't you be offering amendments we don't want. Don't you be demanding time for your amendment to talk for 3 hours on school construction, for example--and that was what was happening to us over all of these weeks and what resulted in a number of cloture votes. 
So I see it differently than does the Senator from Georgia. But as I indicated, he will have his day on his amendment, and I have indicated previously I have great respect for him, but this ought not be habit-forming. This is not the way the Senate works with respect to the current rules of the Senate. It is not the way your side of the aisle dealt with issues when you were in the minority, and I don't think you would expect us to deal with these issues in that manner on a routine basis. 
As I said, I did not object to the unanimous consent request after this had been worked out by the majority leader and the minority leader. Education is critically important. In my judgment, there aren't many more important issues than education here in the U.S. Senate. This ought to be job one for the Senate to deal with the critical education issues. We have now a list of them, albeit limited in time and scope with respect to the amendments, but when we get to this issue we will have, I think, a good and thoughtful and constructive debate. 
I stand today to say do not make it habit-forming to say it is our agenda and we will demand every other Senator in this place who is not part of the majority conform to our description of how we want to debate these amendments, because that is not the way the Senate should work. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the provision in the budget prohibits the use of any of the funds from the tobacco settlement for the range of programs, such as the program for smoking cessation, for education, to try to prevent teens from beginning smoking; is it the case that this budget provision prevents the use of any of the tobacco settlement money for any of those programs?

Mr. DORGAN. I understand that those who put this prohibition in the budget agreement said, `But there are areas in the budget and other areas that expend money for these programs, so these programs are not being shorted.' 
Can the Senator describe whether in fact the money is available in other programs sufficient to address these issues?

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have one additional question. The Senator indicated that the Budget Committee does not determine the level of expenditures--the actual expenditures. That is the Appropriations Committee's job. I agree with that. But it is true that the Budget Committee, with this provision, will determine what you cannot expend money for. They, apparently, by this provision, determined that any money coming from the tobacco settlement cannot and will not be used for these specific areas--smoking cessation, curbing teen smoking, a National Institutes of Health investment, and so on. 
So is it not the case that, while they don't determine what the money is going to be spent for, they are with this provision trying to determine what you cannot spend the money for? I guess it would require at least a 60-vote provision on the floor to overturn what they are trying to prevent. Can the Senator tell me why on earth the Budget Committee--because the Senator serves on that committee--can bring a bill to the floor that says we are going to have a tobacco settlement, but, by the way, you can't use any money from the settlement to deal with teen smoking, or addiction, or smoking cessation? What on earth could have persuaded them to provide a provision like this in the budget bill?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I may not take the entire 20 minutes. But I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, we are talking about the budget. This is a ritual that occurs here every year in the U.S. Senate. And the budget reflects our priorities. What do we think is important? What do we hold dear? What do we think are the most important issues in this country? 
I have said before that 100 years from now we will all be dead. None of us will be here. Historians will look at what this Congress felt was important, and find that out by evaluating what kind of a budget this Congress enacted. That will tell historians what Congress felt was important about the lives of the people who live in this country and what matters. What is the priority? That is what this budget debate is all about. 
The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, spoke a bit ago about where we have been. I recall a few years ago, during a particularly aggressive debate about the economy and fiscal policy, a colleague of mine standing on the floor of the Senate talking about how awful things are in America and how we really ought to be ashamed about what has happened in the last 35 years in this country. I sat over here. I listened to that. I thought, gosh, we must be living in different places. 
I think this is a remarkable country. Yes; we have significant challenges. But I look at the last 50 years as 50 years of significant advancement in this country in a dozen different ways. Yet some see it differently. 
We find ourselves in this country today living in a country with an economy that is growing, more people working and fewer people unemployed. The inflation rate is down; the unemployment rate is down; economic growth is up; the crime rate is down; and the welfare rolls are down. Things are moving in the right direction in this country. It doesn't mean we don't have some challenges. But the fact is things are moving in the right direction. 
I suppose some have their own ideas about why this has happened, why is it that we have reached this intersection and why this country is doing quite well. 
Senator Conrad indicated that in 1993--at a time when our budget deficits were growing year after year and a swollen budget deficit that was getting worse, not better--that Congress was called upon by a new President to do something serious about fiscal policy and to send a message to the people of this country that times in the future will be different, that Congress and a President would no longer sit around and accept increasing budget deficits. He proposed a plan that was enormously controversial. It passed by one vote here in the Senate and one vote in the House of Representatives. 
For anybody who asks if one vote matters, it does. In 1993, a plan that was very controversial passed by one vote in both bodies. The result was the American people finally understood that we were going to put this country on the right track on reducing the Federal budget deficit and getting this country's fiscal policy under some kind of control. Yes, that bill made the right investments in the future, but it cut a good deal of spending, and 
yes, it did increase certain taxes, in most cases only for the wealthiest Americans. But it did. And that is what made it so controversial. It was hard to vote for. Some of my colleagues who voted for it are not here any longer. But it was the right thing to do, and it put this country on the right track. We find ourselves in a country where things are better. 
Now the question is, What should this budget provide? What is important now for the future--education, health care, safe food, a clean environment, safe workplaces, jobs? What represents the priority of those of us serving now today? Are we trying to move forward, or are we holding back? 
Let me just again remind people that we have always had in the Congress folks who have their dander up, saying, `Don't go there. Don't do that. It won't work.' We had that with Social Security. We had it with Medicare. We had it with virtually everything that was intended to be done to make this a better country. When we decided to stop employing children in this country--let us stop having 12-years-olds work 12 hours a day in the mines--we will have child labor laws, we had people who said, `Don't do that. It will ruin the economy.' When we decided we were going to have a minimum wage law, we had people saying, `Don't do that. It will ruin the American economy.' When we decided to have Social Security, we had people who said, `Don't do that. It is socialism.' When we said let us have a Medicare program because half the senior citizens in the country can't afford health care, people said, `Don't do that. It will ruin this country.' 
This country has been strengthened by a lot of good ideas that have made this a better place. Yes. Social Security. Yes. Medicare. Yes. Food safety standards, clean air requirements, child labor law, minimum wages--a whole series of things that have made a better country. This country has a wonderful, wonderful history, and I think a better future. 
We survived a civil war. We survived a depression. We won two world wars. We defeated Hitler. We cured polio. We put people on the Moon. We invented the television, the computer, and the jet airplane. This is quite a remarkable country. There is nothing quite like it on Earth. 
If you look at other developed nations around the world, their economies have slowed down and are not doing well. Yet this country--the biggest, most successful democracy in the world, truly a country with significant economic might--is on the move again, on the march again, and doing much, much better. 
So what do we have to do now, in order to keep our country moving forward? We need to face several big challenges: Medicare and Social Security. Before I talk about the priorities in the budget, let me talk about Medicare and Social Security. Those are the two big entitlements that we have to deal with. Even though we have dealt with most of the fiscal policy problems, we have a demographic problem in the future with Medicare and Social Security. I want to make one point about that. 
The problems in Medicare and Social Security are born of success. We could solve Medicare and Social Security instantly if we simply go back to the same life expectancy that we had 30 or 60 years ago. Those who created the Social Security program created a program that said, by the way, you are expected to live, on average, to be 63 years of age and we will pay a retirement benefit after 65. I went to a small school. But I understand that adds up pretty well. If you are paying benefits at 65 years and people are living on average 63 years, that works out pretty well. 
But from the turn of the century, when we were expected to live to age 48 in this country, to now, when you are expected to live to age 77, nearly 78 years of age, we have increased life expectancy in this country by nearly three decades. Does that put some strain on Social Security and Medicare? Yes; it does. But, again, it is born of success. Just ratchet back life expectancy 30 years and you will solve the financing problem for Social Security and Medicare. 
So we ought not shirk from these challenges. These are not 
difficult challenges. We can solve the demographic problems confronting Social Security and Medicare. But let us remember that the reason these problems exist is because we have had significant success in this country. People are living longer, better, and healthier lives. That is what is causing the problems in these areas. 
Let me just for a moment talk about the priorities in the budget. Senator Conrad talked about several of them. I want to focus on a couple. 
Tobacco: Senator Conrad has done a lot of work on the tobacco issue as the chairman of the task force here in our caucus. This budget resolution indicates that all of the revenue that will come from a tobacco settlement must be used exclusively to adjust the balances of the Medicare trust fund. In other words, it explicitly says no money from any tobacco settlement can be used for the central goal of the tobacco legislation, and that is, preventing people from starting to smoke in the first place, protecting young people in this country from the dangers of smoking. 
Almost no one reaches 25 or 30 years of age and wonders what they can do to further enrich their lives and come up with the idea they ought to start smoking. Nobody does that because at that age they understand smoking can kill you. Cancer, heart diseases, and other illnesses persuade people who know the facts not to start smoking. The only future customers who exist for tobacco are kids. The targeted capability to try to addict our kids is something we are trying to attack in tobacco legislation. 
The use of the funds from the tobacco settlement must be, it seems to me, used for anti-smoking education initiatives all across this country, for smoking cessation programs, for those who are addicted, for FDA tobacco-control activities, to counter tobacco advertising, and a range of other ways. But none of them are capable of being funded in this budget. None of them. 
It doesn't make any sense at all to write handcuffs into this budget resolution that stop us from using the proceeds of the tobacco settlement to do the very things that we are having the tobacco settlement for in the first place, and that is to try to address the issue of teen smoking and to stop cigarette companies from addicting teens. Yet none of it is possible in this budget agreement. That cannot stand. We must have amendments and will have amendments on that issue. 
Second, education: We have had a number of people here in the U.S. Congress who forever have said, `Let's just say no on education' when it comes to the U.S. Congress. I understand and respect the fact that most of elementary and secondary education funding comes from State and local governments. It is that way and ever should be that way. Yet we in the Congress have developed some niche financing and some assistance in certain areas that help invest in education and make our schools better. 
President Clinton has made some proposals dealing with education that are very, very important proposals that will not be funded in this budget. The proposal dealing with repairing America's schools is a very important proposal. 
We have thousands of schools in this country that are 50 years old, or 60 years old, or 80 years old. They are coming apart at the seams. We send our children there. In the morning we tell our children good-bye. We kiss them good-bye and send them to school. We in this country don't want our kids to go to unsafe schools or go to schools that are in disrepair. None of us want, as parents, to do that. 
I have two young children in public school. The taxes I pay to support their education are something that I am enormously proud of. I want those children, and all American children, to be the best educated children that they can possibly be. I want them to be able to say, `I went to the best schools in the world.' That is what I want our public education system to be in this country. Yet, this budget says no to those education initiatives. It says we can't do anything about trying to stimulate the repair of crumbling schools by providing just a basic incentive from the 
Federal level to State and local school districts and others who would be able to put up the money at reduced interest charges to repair crumbling schools. This budget says we can't do that. It just says no to fixing crumbling schools. 
Or, the question of class size. My daughter last year was in public school in a class of 30 students. Does anybody believe that it doesn't matter if your kid is in a class with 35 students or 30 students versus 15 students or 18 students? We know better than that. All of us know better than that. We all know that smaller class sizes mean better education, particularly more teacher time for each student. President Clinton talks about funding 100,000 new teachers, to try to reduce class sizes in this country. He is proposing after-school programs for school-age children who don't have any place to go after school because both parents are working. For all of these initiatives, the response is the response that we have had for 50 years from some of the same voices. `Just say no to these issues. It is not the Federal Government's job.' Gosh, if we had relied on that advice we wouldn't have done much of anything that has made this a better country. A fair amount of what we have done in terms of public investment has made this country a much, much better place in which to work and to live. 
When President Clinton proposes smaller class sizes with qualified teachers, he is talking about an initiative of over 7 years to help local schools provide small classes by hiring more teachers in the early grades. When he talks about modern school buildings, he is talking about Federal tax credits to pay interest on $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate public schools in this country. 
But this budget that came out of the Budget Committee falls far short on these issues. The suggestion is, Well, this isn't a priority. This doesn't rank with other priorities. 
I disagree with that. And we have room, obviously, to disagree on these issues. 
But if one doesn't believe that education is the first priority in this country--that our future is our children and the education of our children will determine what kind of country we have in the future, how we compete in the global economy, whether this country grows--if we don't believe that, we are not going to do well in the future. We must do as those who came before us have done and say that education is a priority. It represents the first priority for this country. 
There is another little part of this budget we are considering that I find highly troubling, and I know at first blush it will be very, very interesting to some people. It is a piece that says let us sunset the Tax Code. In other words, it is saying that the Congress should sunset and get rid of the existing income tax system we have in this country. It includes a sense of the Senate provision providing for repealing the entire Internal Revenue Code at the end of 2001. Notice that it doesn't say what they would replace it with. It just says repeal the Tax Code. 
Well, what that says to somebody who just bought a home yesterday or is considering buying a home tomorrow or next month or did 6 months ago, it says, `By the way, don't count on your interest deduction on your mortgage being deductible, because there may not be a tax system that allows you to deduct interest on your mortgage.' Can you imagine that coming from this Congress?--this Congress saying, `Don't count on that?' 
By the way, are you contributing to an IRA? This budget says, `Don't count on that being treated as it is now for tax purposes.' Are you making a charitable contribution? `Don't count on that being deductible.' Are you a business person about to make an investment, or a business about to make an acquisition of another company, and it hinges on the question of, How will this be handled from the Tax Code standpoint?' What this says is, `Don't count on it. Don't count on this Tax Code, because we have other ideas.' 
We have billionaires walking around saying, `We want a flat tax.' Only in Washington, DC, would it be a new idea to hear a billionaire talking about a flat tax plan that cuts his own taxes. Only here could someone call that a stroke of genius. Flat tax, VAT tax, sales tax--these are the alternatives that are being proposed to the current system. What is behind this proposal to abolish the current Tax Code at 2001 without providing for an alternative? The stimulus behind this is that some people want to create a national sales tax, a national VAT tax, or some sort of national flat tax, all of which will cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans and increase taxes for working Americans. 
Let me say that again, because it is important. This budget bill does not tell us what people have in mind as a replacement for the current system, because the majority can't agree on that. But all the plans that are being discussed to replace the current IRS Code--all of them would essentially say we are going to tax work and we are going to exempt investment. 
I ask people this: Why is the income from work any less worthy than the income from investment? Why this romance with a plan that says, if you are a worker, we tax you; if you are an investor, we don't? If you get your money by working all day and you are bone tired at night after 10 hours going out working for a wage, trying to provide for your family, you pay a tax. But if you sit in a chair and clip your coupons and make your $10 million a year from interest and dividends, this Congress likes you so much that you don't have to pay any tax. It is just the work that is taxed, the investment is not. We will have an amendment to strike this provision. 
Get rid of the Tax Code? I don't particularly like the Tax Code. I think we could substantially improve it, dramatically simplify it. But get rid of it and replace it with a plan that says the upper-income people pay less taxes and lower- and middle-income people pay more taxes? I don't know who came up with this approach, but I hope they are prepared to defend it on the 
floor in discussing this amendment that I will offer at some point during the debate. 
Mr. President, those are some of the difference I have with this budget. But I don't want people to believe that there is nothing in common among Senators. There are things in the budget resolution to which we will all agree. 
I just stood and asked the Senator who was introducing the child care amendment to add my name as a cosponsor. He is a Republican; I am a Democrat. I happen to think what he has said on the floor and what he has written on that amendment make good sense. It is right to say to those who need to find good child care, when both parents have to go off to work because they must make ends meet, and they have child care problems--can we and should we help them? Yes, I think we could and we should. Does it also imply that those who make sacrifices to have one spouse stay at home to take care of those children, should they have some opportunity to see us reach out to try to provide some help to them? Absolutely. 
There are a number of things--this being just one example--where we agree on public policy issues. I have mentioned a few where we don't agree. Where we don't agree, from time to time we have significant debate about that, and then we vote, and when the vote is over, we count the votes. The winner is the one with the most votes. We understand that. My party here in this Chamber has fewer votes than the other party. Hopefully, a number of these amendments will not be party line votes. The child care issue, which I just mentioned, is a good example of that. 
I hope the first issue I mentioned will be another example. On tobacco, there is a big difference, I mean a huge difference. There are billions of dollars coming from a tobacco settlement that the majority says cannot be used under any circumstance to deal with teenage addiction. But the whole purpose of this settlement is to say to tobacco companies, `We won't allow you to addict our kids anymore. It is wrong.' And we want to use some of the money from a tobacco settlement to fund smoking prevention, smoking cessation, addiction treatment and other public health work to deal with smoking. But the majority's budget says `No, you can't do it.' Well, this budget has to be changed, and we are going to have a big debate about that. 
The last item I mentioned, the Tax Code, do we want a budget to go through the Congress that says: `By the way, American people, we are going to sunset the Tax Code; we are going to get rid of the Tax Code at the end of 2001. So now, if you have your house, and you sit out there and wonder whether you are going to be able to deduct the interest on your mortgage? Just go ahead and wonder, because we are going to get rid of the Tax Code that allows to you do that and we are not going to tell you what we are going to put in its place. We may put a national sales tax in its place,' they would say. `We will not tell you that yet, because we know that is controversial and we know how you will react when you find out what a national sales tax would do.' 
Well, we know what a national sales tax does because all the studies show it. There is no dispute about it. We know it will cut taxes for upper-income folks and raise taxes on working people. But the majority says, `We are not going tell you what we are going to replace it with, but all we are going to do is serve notice on you today that your home mortgage interest may not be deductible tomorrow or in 2001.' So we are going to have an amendment on that. We need to change that provision in this budget resolution. 
Mr. President, I have used my time. There are several other items that I will talk about later in this debate. I have mentioned a couple of amendments I intend to offer. I thank Senator Conrad for giving me the time on this side.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am pleased that the committee included my amendment, numbered 2154, to provide $365,000 for replacement of electrical fixtures and testing for and remediation of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at schools and Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities located at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. These funds will remain available until expended. 
The amendment provides direct funding to the Bureau of Indian Affairs so that the agency may replenish funds depleted by past activities related to the PCB emergency and provides for future remediation and testing activities and replacement of electric fixtures. 
Students at two Standing Rock Sioux schools and employees at a Bureau of Indian Affairs administrative building in my State have been exposed to leaking fixtures containing dangerous PCBs. In an effort to protect students and Federal employees from contamination, parts of three buildings have been evacuated, disrupting classes and vital agency functions. While testing, remediation activities and fixture replacement are already underway, further work by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and its contractors remains unfinished. I commend the committee for providing the funds to insure the safety of those who work and study on the Standing Rock Reservation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning I heard a brief statement by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, about the tragedy that occurred in his State in the last 48 hours. This tragedy happened apparently when a couple of young children, 11- and 13-year-old children, allegedly stole some weapons and then, on a schoolyard in that small town in Arkansas, murdered five other children and a teacher. 
I watched the reports on television and listened on the radio. My children asked me about what they were hearing on those television news reports this morning. It is hard for a parent to explain to a child a news story about children allegedly murdering other children, at a schoolyard. It is hard for me to understand what all of that means or what causes that kind of behavior. I don't think any of us know. We do know that in this country there always needs to be an understanding by everyone--parents, children, and all Americans--that guns and schools don't mix, and that there never ought to be a circumstance in which a child brings a gun to school. 
The reason I mention this on the floor today is I want to put this in the context of a piece of legislation that is now law and another piece of legislation that I want to make law. The piece that is now law is a bill I offered a couple of years ago here in the Senate saying that there ought to be a uniform zero tolerance policy in every school district in this country. If a child brings a gun to school, that child will be expelled for a year. No questions, no excuses. 
People need to understand that you cannot bring a gun to school. But if you do, you are going to be expelled for a year. I am pleased to say that the Gun Free Schools Act is now law, and every school district in the country is required to have that policy in place in exchange for access to Federal funds. 
To those who opposed it--and there were some--I asked the question: `Why would you oppose that? Do you believe that in any school district in this country it is appropriate for a child to bring a gun to school?' They didn't think so. `Do you disagree with the penalty? Should we as a country say to every child and to every adult that they cannot bring a gun to a school?' That led me to the second question. And that is the piece of legislation that I would like to get passed here in this Congress. 
A few years ago, a 16-year-old young man walked down the corridors of a school in New York. He had on a leather jacket, and there was a bulge on the side of his leather jacket. The security guard at the school stopped this young boy because he was suspicious of the bulge, and, in the waistband of that boy's pants underneath that leather jacket, he found a loaded pistol. The kid was kicked out of school for a year, and he was also charged with criminal weapons violations.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the time. 
I am a little bit surprised, because I think this is the most modest of proposals. This clearly is a baby step in the right direction. In fact, it does not conflict at all with the Freedom to Farm bill. It complements it. Those who say that the farmers should get their price from the marketplace need to give the farmers the tools to hold that grain and access the marketplace when it is beneficial to farmers. That is what eventually will allow this farm law to succeed if ever it succeeds. So I think this complements the Freedom to Farm bill. 
I think this is the smallest, most modest of steps, but it is in the right direction. I wish that it would be accepted. It has no cost to the Treasury. It would be of some help to some producers at a very critical time. 
Let me say, we have heard some about trade here. You have heard me speak about this many times. Regrettably, this country is a 98-pound weakling when it comes to trade. We have sand kicked in our face every day on trade. I would like to fix all that. 
The Senator from Montana mentioned Canada. If durum wheat were blood, Canada would long ago have bled to death. With all of that grain coming here, we have an avalanche of Canadian grain glutting our markets. That situation, together with problems with Japan, China and Mexico and a range of other trade problems have undercut the market for our agricultural products. The Senator from Montana has proposed the most modest of steps. Let us extend these commodity loans. In my judgment, these loan rates are far too low in any event. Despite that, let us at least extend the term of these commodity loans to give individual farmers a better opportunity to market when it is in their interest to do so. That way they have some say as to when they go into this marketplace. 
As you know, this marketplace is full of big shots and little interests. And guess who wins in the marketplace? If the farmer is forced to market at the wrong time, just after harvest, they get the lowest price. 
Freedom to Farm can only work if we give farmers the capability of holding that grain with a decent loan for a long enough period so that when farmers go to the marketplace, it is on their time, it is when they find the market has some strength, when they find they can go to the market and get some reward for themselves, not just on the miller's time, not just on the grocery manufacturers' time, not just on the traders' time. 
If the Senator insists on a vote on this, I hope we win. I support fully what he is trying to do. If he does not, I hope we come back and try this again, because I think there needs to be a way for all of us, including the chairman of the committee, for whom I have great respect, to work together on this issue. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding for an inquiry. The regular order here in the Senate would be to bring a piece of legislation to the floor, amendments can be offered and debated, and then votes occur on the amendments. 
It seems to me to be a bad habit to bring to the floor a proposition and then file cloture motions immediately. In this case, the most recent opportunity to bring this bill to the floor occasioned two cloture motions before anybody had an opportunity to offer one amendment. That does not suggest a search for an agreement. Isn't it the case that the procedure that is suggested by the other side is extraordinary? The ordinary procedure would be to bring the bill to the floor and allow those who have amendments to offer the amendments, and then have votes on the amendments. Isn't that the regular order of the Senate?

Mr. DORGAN. If I might just inquire further about this notion of individuals being held hostage. What have been held hostage in this process are the amendments that some of us would like to offer to legislation that comes before the Senate. If there is a hostage-taking here it is a hostage-taking of those of us who have ideas that we want to have debated in the Senate. 
This, after all, is a process of debating ideas. Some have ideas on the other side. Some of them may be very good. And some of us have ideas. If those who control this Chamber say, `By the way, the way we are going to run this Chamber will be to allow our ideas to be debated, and then our strategy will be to limit your ideas,' then I want to say that it doesn't work that way. Whoever stands at these desks is elected to the Senate and can operate in this Senate under the rules of the Senate. The rules allow a bill to be brought to the floor of the Senate and then allow every other Member, even that Member who sits in the farthest chair, with the least seniority, to stand up and offer his or her idea and to debate his or her idea here in the U.S. Senate. That is the way the rules are in the U.S. Senate. What is being asked of us is to create extraordinary rules here. That is where the hostage-taking comes in, taking hostage those who want to offer ideas, those who have other ideas about education in this debate. 
We have not had that opportunity, not even one opportunity to offer one amendment, and that is why I object to this notion about hostage day 10. The only hostage that exists here is the hostage 
of ideas that ought to be able to be offered under the regular order of the Senate.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment we are considering deals with a subject I have spoken about on the floor many, many times called the Federal trade deficit, the national trade deficit. I know some will roll their eyes when I talk about the trade deficit, because I have come to the floor very often to talk about this issue. But it is critically important, and I want to explain why I care about this issue and why the Senator from West Virginia and I have offered the amendment that we have. 
The amendment itself is an emergency commission to end the trade deficit. It establishes a commission to study the current trade deficit that we have and to make recommendations to Congress on strategies and approaches that we may use to deal with the trade deficit. 
I would like to proceed by describing just a bit my concern about the trade deficit. There are a lot of things in this country that are going right. Many Americans take a look at this economy and they say, gee, the country is in pretty good shape. The Federal budget deficit is down, down, way down. Inflation is down, down, down 5 years in a row, 6 years in a row. 
Unemployment is down. The crime rate is down. The welfare rolls are down. Most people would think this country is doing quite well. 
That is the case. It certainly is true. There are, however, some small-craft warnings out there dealing with the trade deficit. The trade deficit is the one economic indicator that is not going down; it is going up. Our trade deficit is increasing. The last 4 years in a row we have had the largest trade deficit, merchandise trade deficit, in the history of this country. And this year it will increase once again. 
In order to talk about trade just for a moment, I want to begin by talking about the parochial issues that affect North Dakota, among others--the Canadian grain imports to the United States. 
It seems to me every time we have a trade agreement, we end up with the short end of the stick. We had a trade agreement with Canada, and look what happens to grain coming into the United States from Canada. Here is what was going on before we had a trade agreement, and here are the massive quantities of imports into this country since the trade agreement, undercutting our farmers, markets, lowering our grain prices, costing, according to North Dakota State University, $220 million a year out of the pockets of North Dakota farmers. 
So am I concerned about that? Sure I am. Because you cannot get the similar kind of grain into Canada. I have told my colleagues before that one day I drove to the Canadian border with a man named Earl Jensen in a 12-year-old orange truck. We pulled up to the Canadian border with 200 bushels of durum wheat. 
All the way to the border we saw semitruckload after semitruckload, perhaps two dozen of them, coming into this country hauling Canadian durum. When Earl and I got to the Canadian border with his 12-year-old orange truck with 200 bushels of durum, we were told, `We're sorry, but you can't take United States durum into Canada.' My question was, `Why? Did I not just see a dozen semitruckloads or two dozen semitruckloads of Canadian durum coming into the United States?' `Yes.' `Don't we have a trade agreement with you?' `Yes.' `Then why can't we take American durum, U.S. durum, into Canada?' `Because that's the way the trade agreement works,' we were told. 
It is not the way a thoughtful trade agreement would work and not the way that a trade agreement that was thoughtfully negotiated would work, but it may be the way this one works. This is precisely my point about the trade problem we have in this country. Every time our negotiators go out and negotiate another trade agreement, they seem to lose in the first 2 weeks. 
Will Rogers, 60 years ago, said, `The United States of America has never lost a war and never won a conference.' He surely must have been thinking about trade negotiators. 
Now, let me describe to you this merchandise trade deficit. You see this red ink? The merchandise trade deficit is 22 years old--22 straight years of trade deficits, 35 of 36 years of trade deficits. And you see, this is not getting better; it is getting worse. It is not just getting worse; it is getting much worse. Some would say, `Well, let's ignore that. Let's just ignore it. It doesn't matter.' It does matter. The trade deficit ultimately is going to be repaid with a lower standard of living in this country. We had better worry about it and better do something to deal with it. 
The merchandise trade deficit was a record in 1997. Here are the projections by the U.S. Department of Commerce and Standard and Poors of what will happen to the trade deficit in the next 4 years. Is this good news? I don't think so. It is successive and alarming--continued trade deficits year after year after year. 
Now, Mr. President, there are a number of reasons for the trade deficits. I will describe one of them, for example, currency valuations. If you take a look at this chart, you will see what happens when we compare foreign currencies versus U.S. dollars. The Japanese yen, fallen; the Mexican peso fell through the 
basement; the Canadian dollar, way down; the Taiwan dollar, apparently subbasement here; the Thai dollar and Indonesian dollar, down--you see what has happened in every one of these? What does this mean? 
It means that when you have a trade agreement and you reduce tariffs, and a currency fluctuation like this exists, foreign goods are less expensive in the United States and U.S. goods are more expensive in foreign countries. Therefore, we see fewer exports and more imports and, therefore, a huge trade deficit--33 consecutive years of merchandise trade deficits with Japan. 
Let me talk just for a moment about Japan, China, Canada, Mexico. 
Japan. Here is our trade relationship with Japan. The Japanese are sharp. The Japanese have said to us, `Here is the way we're going to trade with you. By the way, our relationship with you is going to be that we're going to flood your market with Japanese goods, and when you want to get American goods into the Japanese market, good luck.' 
Oh, we get some goods into the Japanese market, but we do not get nearly enough of the things we need to get in to reduce this trade deficit. You know all of the standard brands that come in. People say this is good for our consumers. Well, in some ways it could be good for our consumers, but wouldn't it be good for our producers, wouldn't it be good for our wage earners, the people who have jobs in this country, if we could take this amount of red and say that is what we are going to put into Japan in products made by Americans who are earning a wage and earning benefits and have a good job? 
The Japanese, for example, fill our country with their goods, and then they say to us, `By the way, when you send beef to Japan, there is a 47 percent tariff on every pound of beef going into Japan.' So, a T-bone steak in Tokyo is $30, $35 a pound. Why? Because we do not get enough beef into Japan. In fact, the 47 percent tariff is our success rate, that is after we negotiated a beef agreement with Japan. 
How many other countries would say it is a success if they were to have a 47 percent tariff on something imported into the United States? They would say that is a colossal failure. They would say the United States is failing to meet its responsibilities towards opening expanded fair and free trade. But the Japanese have a 47 percent tariff on beef. Nobody whispers a thing about it. All the while we have a literal tide of red ink year after year after year that now reaches $50 billion and $60 billion every year. 
Now, I ask the question on behalf of those who want to export to Japan and want the jobs that come with those exports, the jobs that pay well, that have decent benefits, I ask the question: When are we going to do something about this? When are we going to do something about this trade deficit? And who is going to stand up and say, let us do it? 
Now, this exists, at least in part, because the Japanese will not allow our goods in, but also in part because of corporations who want to do business on both sides and think this is just fine. As long as they are selling goods both ways, they don't care who ends up swallowing the red ink. In fact, with respect to other countries like China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and dozens of other countries, the largest corporations think it is a wonderful thing to be able to produce where you can produce dirt cheap and then sell the goods in the United States. That is part of this trade deficit as well. 
China now has a nearly $50 billion trade deficit with this country--nearly $50 billion. And it has ratcheted up, as you can see, very quickly. China sees the American marketplace as a market in which they can move a substantial amount of their produce from trousers to shirts to shoes to electronics. You name it, the Chinese send it. And, yes, trinkets and toys. The Chinese send all these products to our country. 
Now, China, of course, does not buy nearly enough wheat from 
us, something we produce in great quantity. Oh, they are worried about all kinds of things, and they are price shopping elsewhere while they are ratcheting up this huge trade surplus with us; for us a deficit with them. 
China, for example, desperately needs airplanes. They have a lot of people. They are going to need apparently about 2,000 airplanes in the coming couple of decades. China is saying, `By the way, yeah, we'll buy a few airplanes from you, but what we want to do is move your airplane manufacturing capability to China.' They say to Boeing, `Yeah, we'll buy Boeing airplanes, but produce them in China.' That is not the way the trade works. If we are buying what China produces, they have a responsibility, when we produce something, to buy it from our country. That is the way in which we reduce this trade deficit. 
There are some in this country, and some enterprises, who make a lot of money because of this trade deficit. They say, `Well, gee, we're making a lot of profit for our stockholders. We hire a kid 14 years old, and we can work that kid 14 hours a day. We can pay that kid 14 cents an hour, and we can make a lot of money by shipping the product that child makes to the U.S. marketplace.' 
Yes, there are children today who are earning 14 cents an hour. They produce, for example, a pair of shoes that has 20 cents of direct labor in the pair of shoes, and it is sent to a store shelf in Pittsburgh or Fargo or Edina or Los Angeles and sold for $80 a pair--with 20 cents of labor. Is that a good deal for the producer? Sure. That means higher profits for the corporations. It means fewer jobs here in this country and it means a swollen trade deficit for America. 
In the long term, we need to construct a trade strategy that says to producers that there is an admission price to our economy. We are a leader in world trade. We are a leader in open trade. But we demand as a country fair trade. Our country needs to say to this administration and to future administrations, as we have said to past ones, that when we negotiate a trade agreement, we expect the agreement to be in this country's best economic interest. 
You cannot tell me that having negotiated, as our Government has, a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that turns sour immediately and costs us several hundred thousand lost jobs in this country and has increased our deficit with Canada, an agreement which took a surplus in Mexico and immediately turned that into a huge deficit, you cannot tell me that is success. It is a failure. We ought to expect more from our trade negotiators, and we ought to expect a better trade policy in this country. 
American trade deficits have grown under the trade agreements. This chart shows what has happened with both Canada and Mexico. It shows that we had a surplus with Mexico, and we turned it immediately into a deficit. With Canada, the deficit has increased. It seems to me that is not progress. 
Now, the commission that we have recommended--Senator Byrd and myself--we have suggested that the commission should develop trade policy recommendations by examining the impacts on investments, the impacts on domestic wages and prices, the causes and consequence of trade deficits I have just discussed, the barriers to trade, the relationship of tariff and nontariff trade barriers to bilateral deficits, the comparative and competitive trade advantages that exist, the effects of labor, environmental health and safety standards on trade. 
The series of things that we want to occur with this trade deficit commission are simple. We want all the spotlights to shine on the same spot on the question of trade. We believe the trade deficit injures this country. And we believe the trade deficit that is growing is counterproductive to our future economic progress. 
Mr. President, all of us have read about the Asian financial crisis. I have described a swollen trade deficit prior to the Asian crisis. The Asian currency crisis, as shown by last week's announcement of that the trade deficit continues to grow, is exacerbating the problem. In fact, last month's trade deficit was 
the highest in history. What we now understand is that Asian crisis, that Asian financial crisis, will inevitably continue to put upward pressure on these trade deficits. 
That is why we think it is time to turn to this subject in earnest as a country and decide what is wrong and what is right. How do we fix what is wrong? And how do we strengthen what is right? 
As I conclude, I want to again point out that I have come to the floor very often and talked about trade. And instantly people, when you talk about trade, decide that there are only two sides to the trade issue--protectionists and the free traders. They could not be more wrong. 
I believe very much in expanded trade. I come from a State in which nearly one-half of our production is in agriculture that must find a foreign home. But we also understand in our State that there are certain requirements when we negotiate agreements and treaties, especially in trade, that demand this country be treated fairly. It was all right just after the Second World War to have a trade policy that was essentially stimulated by foreign policy considerations, but it is not all right any more. We now face tough, shrewd economic competitors. And it is not satisfactory to me, and I believe not satisfactory to this country, to allow other countries to ratchet up huge, huge trade surpluses with us or force us into having huge trade deficits with them and see that circumstance weaken our manufacturing sector in this country, and weaken the capability of having long-term good jobs that pay well, with benefits. 
Anyone who believes that it does not matter when you weaken your manufacturing sector does not understand what makes a good, strong country viable in the long term. You cannot survive as a world economic power unless you have a viable, strong, growing, vibrant manufacturing sector. And that is what all of this is about. 
This country and its producers and its workers can, should, and will compete anywhere in the world, any time. But we should not be expected to compete against the conditions of production that we see existing in some parts of the world, nor should we be expected to compete when the rules are not fair. We ought not expect our trading partners to flood our market with goods and then close their market to American producers and American workers. 
That is not fair trade. It is not right for the future of this country. 
I thank the Senator from Alaska for his courtesy. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from Connecticut, are we now talking about the Coverdell education proposal? Is it not the case that the Coverdell legislation is not now before the Senate --it was before the Senate but then was withdrawn--because a number of Senators, including myself, the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Massachusetts, and others, wanted to offer amendments to it dealing with the kinds of questions you are now asking? Isn't that the case?

Mr. DORGAN. I would like to ask the Senator an additional question relating to an issue I discussed last week when the Coverdell bill was first withdrawn from the floor. It is not acceptable to me to have someone bring a bill to the floor that is amendable and then tell us, `By the way, we have established a gate here, and the only people who can go through the gate are the ones we decide can go through the gate.' 
The Coverdell IRA proposal, in my judgment, ought to be amended by a range of other proposals. One, for example, deals with reducing class size. I have a daughter in the third grade. Last year, that daughter was in a public school class with 30 students--30 in a class. Do I have a self-interest here as a parent? Of course I do. Do we think kids do better when they are in a smaller class? Of course they do. We know that. The studies demonstrate that. 
The question before us is not just about Coverdell IRAs, but about what our priorities are going to be. One hundred years from now, all of us in the Chamber are going to be gone.

Mr. DORGAN. Except Senator Thurmond. But historians will be able to look back at what we did here and evaluate, by looking at how we decided to spend money, what our priorities were. What did we place first? What did we think was important? Kids? Education? What kind of legislation did we pass to advance these issues that are important to public education in this country? 
Finally, to those who say the public education system in this country is somehow unworthy of keeping, I ask them, how did this country get to where it is? How did we get here? Is anybody going out to the airport this afternoon to get on a plane and leave? Have they found a better place to live? I don't think so. 
We have had in this country a wonderful system of public education. We also have some outstanding private schools. Our obligation in this Chamber is to provide the support that we can, especially with niche financing. We don't provide the bulk of financing for elementary and secondary education, but we provide important funds to support a number of priorities in public education. That is our job. That is what we need to do. 
But we were told last week that because a bill is brought to the floor dealing with education--a bill that essentially provides tax breaks for those who want to send their kids to private school--somehow we are being selfish for saying let's amend this so we invest in and strengthen public schools. It seems to me that the message from all of this is that kids are not first, education is not a priority. Isn't that how you would view it?

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the months since the devastating blizzards and floods struck North Dakota last year, I have been pleased to draw the Senate's attention to some truly remarkable people who stepped up when their communities most needed them. 
Today, I am pleased to report that one such individual was here in Washington recently to receive an honor he richly deserves. Mike Jacobs, the editor of the Grand Forks Herald, was named `Editor of the Year' by the National Press Foundation for his and the Herald's truly remarkable achievements during last year's flood and fires in Grand Forks. I want to add my voice to the chorus of thanks to Mike and to the entire staff of the Herald for their outstanding work under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. 
I saw firsthand how much it meant to the people of Grand Forks that their hometown newspaper never missed a day of printing throughout the city's crisis. 
When the Herald arrived at shelters and emergency centers, it flew off the racks. Clusters of people would gather around and jointly read it. They were starved for news of what was happening in their city during their trying time and they devoured the paper. 
Yet even more than a conduit of information, the Grand Forks Herald stood as a powerful symbol of people determined to survive and endure, and as a daily reminder that even in the face of this calamity, Grand Forks would continue to remain a community, something the flood waters would never be able to wash away. 
That the Herald was there at all was wondrous. Its building was completely flooded and then soon burned to the ground. The homes of nearly every employee of the Herald were inundated by flood waters. 
Yet the Herald, led by Editor Mike Jacobs, never faltered, never missed an edition. It found a temporary office in the grade school of a nearby small town. It located alternative presses, and devised creative methods of distributing the paper to its readers. In the most harrowing of times, it flourished. In doing so, it gave hope, inspiration and purpose to its community. 
Mike and the Grand Forks Herald staff are part of the story of last year's flood that doesn't get told nearly enough. As this city overcame the worst disaster in North Dakota history, its citizens have marched back with resilience, fortitude and inspirational spirit. Mike Jacobs, the entire Grand Forks Herald staff and the people of Grand Forks have triumphed, and I am proud to salute them. 
I can't express my admiration enough.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I enjoyed hearing the comments of my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. He, as always, is interesting and thoughtful, and he comes to this debate with a substantial amount of knowledge about the foreign policy issues. I appreciate his position. 
I must confess, however, that I come to the Senate with a different position on this issue. I want to explain why I have reached that position. 
I must confess, also, that I am not someone who considers himself an expert in foreign policy. There are some--only a handful of Members here in the Senate--who spend a great deal of their time thinking about and working on foreign policy issues. I have great respect for them. But I don't consider myself a part of that group of Senate foreign policy experts. 
But all of us in the Senate have some acquaintance with the questions that are presented to us on issues of international policy. And NATO expansion is one such issue. Indeed, as I indicated yesterday, it is a `legislative main course.' NATO expansion is a very significant matter for this country and for many other countries in the world that are affected. One of those countries is Russia. 
Russia is an important part of our future, and our relationship with Russia will have a significant impact on the future of everyone in this country. I want to speak about that just a bit, because Senator Durbin also alluded to that issue. 
I want to remind my colleagues that some while ago I stood on the floor of the Senate and held up a piece of metal that came from a missile silo near Pervomaysk, Ukraine, a silo that had held a Soviet missile aimed at the United States. But the piece of metal I held up here on the floor of the Senate was no longer a missile. It was scrap metal. The missile is gone from the silo and destroyed. The weapon does not any longer exist. Where there was a missile with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States, planted in that ground in the Ukraine now are sunflowers--planted on exactly that same ground. The missile is gone. The warhead is gone. Sunflowers are planted. 
How did that happen? Was it by magic? No. It was as a result of arms control agreements between this country and the then Soviet Union, now Russia, that required the reduction of nuclear devices and systems to deliver them. It was also the result of U.S. funding initiated here in the Senate--funding that comes from the Nunn-Lugar program--that actually helps to pay for the destruction of Russian nuclear weapons that had previously been aimed at this country. We have had very substantial success in reducing Russia's nuclear stockpile. 
We have had that success not just because the Soviet Union no longer exists. We have had that success because Russia and the United States abide by a series of arms control agreements that call for the reduction of nuclear weapons, the reduction of missiles, and the reduction of bombers. And that reduction has taken place. It means that this is a safer world. 
So, the Soviet Union has disappeared. Eastern Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe has dramatically changed. There is no Soviet Union. There is no Warsaw Pact. There is Russia. There are Baltic States. There exists in Eastern Europe a series of countries that are now free and democratic. The world has changed dramatically. 
All of this relates to the discussion we are having today. I want to describe how and why. 
But I wonder, in the context of this issue of the reduction of the nuclear threat, how many of my colleagues--for that matter, the American people--are aware of an incident that occurred on December 3, 1997, in the dark hours of the morning. North of Norway in the Barents Sea, several Russian ballistic missile submarines prepared to fire SS-20 missiles. Each of these missiles 
could carry 10 nuclear warheads and travel 5,000 miles--far enough to have reached the United States from the Barents Sea. 
That morning, on December 3, 1997, the submarines launched 20 of those SS-20 missiles. Twenty of them roared skyward. Swiftly they rose to an altitude of tens of thousands of feet. U.S. satellites quickly detected these missiles and tracked them as they rose. Our early warning phased array radars in Thule, Greenland, and Flylingdales, England, tracked the missiles. 
The radars and satellites alerted the U.S. Space Command Missile Warning Center at the NORAD complex in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado. Space Command plotted the trajectories to determine where the missiles were going. 
However, within a few moments, every single one of those SS-20 missiles blew up at about 30,000 feet. Why? Because this wasn't a Russian missile attack. In fact, seven American weapons inspectors were watching from a ship a few miles away as the missiles were launched from the Russian submarines. These were self-destruct launches. It was a quicker and cheaper way for Russia to destroy submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which it was required to do under the START I arms reduction treaty. These were self-destruct launches to destroy missiles under the START treaty. 
These missile launches should remind all of us about what the ultimate security threat to the United States has been. Only Russia, if it desired today, can renew the hair-trigger nuclear tensions of the cold war. Only Russia could do that. And only Russia can destroy its nuclear weapons and its delivery mechanisms, missiles and bombers, by which it delivers those weapons. Whether we like it or not, we must take this into account when we evaluate international security issues. Yes, even in the debate about the expansion of NATO, we must evaluate those issues in the context of our relationship with Russia and with others, but especially with Russia. 
I don't come to the floor of the Senate saying that Russia should have some kind of special veto power over American foreign policy. Russia should really play no role in our decision about what is best for this country. But the opportunity to reduce the nuclear threat, the real opportunity that has allowed us to reduce in real terms the nuclear threat, is something that we should take into account. 
When we talk about expanding NATO with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, I think of the story I heard one day in the dark days of the fight for a free Czechoslovakia when very courageous, brave men and women were storming the streets of Czechoslovakia demanding their freedom. I remember the story about Mr. Havel, who was a playwright and an intellectual who then became President of that new democracy. I remember how at midnight the knock on his door from the Communist secret police was a knock that he knew too well because it had come before. He knew it was the secret police. He knew he would be arrested again. He knew they would throw him in jail again, because he had been in jail before. I remember the story about this courageous man and what he did for his country. I remember the stories about in the middle of the crowd in downtown Prague someone standing on the upper strut of a streetlight hanging with one arm and reciting the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America. Think of that--a crowd in Prague inspiring itself by a recitation of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America. 
We understand what we mean to much of that part of the world. We know that this democracy has given great inspiration to those who want freedom and who have had the courage to fight for freedom in their countries. We understand all of that. And I think it is critically important that in every way possible we support these emerging democracies. Our relationships with them are important to this country. 
However, expanding NATO is a much larger question than that as well. It involves a number of broader issues. Again, I say that there are other Senators who have had longer relationships with the 
question of NATO than I have had. 
But it seems to me, first, that NATO has largely been a security alliance over many years and a very successful alliance at that. It also seems to me that the decision that has been made to expand NATO is largely a decision that moves in the direction of forming an economic alliance, or one that meets the economic needs of the new members. 
Second, to the extent that it remains a security alliance, it, of course, will require countries in Europe, many of whom can least afford it, to spend a substantial amount of additional money on new arms to bring them to the standards that NATO requires. The requirement that the new entrants to NATO rearm, modernize their military equipment, to bring themselves up to NATO standards, also means that some of us are very concerned that in the end, while some of that burden will fall on these countries, much of that burden will fall on us. 
This leads me to the third issue. The question of what this expansion will cost the United States produces answers that wildly roam all over the board. I have not found a good answer except that most do not know the answer to the question. It is an important question. What will NATO expansion cost the taxpayers of the United States? 
And the fourth issue is the one I have spoken about at length. What does NATO expansion mean to the long-term security interests of the United States? Will expansion of NATO lessen the danger of nuclear war? Will it lessen the danger of nuclear threat? Will the expansion of NATO forge a continued, new, or expanded relationship with Russia that will allow us to reduce even further the nuclear threat? Will NATO expansion allow us to continue to reduce the number of warheads and delivery vehicles, to lessen the nuclear threat for us and all the people of the world? I fear the answer to that is no. 
I think the expansion of NATO will likely create divisiveness in our critical relationships with Russia and with some other nations as well. We have made great progress in our relationship with Russia. I hope that progress will include a decision by the Russian Duma to ratify START II and immediate movement by Russia to begin START III talks. But I fear that NATO expansion will retard that kind of movement, which I think is very important to us. We must continue the progress we have made in reducing the nuclear threat. 
It is interesting to me how many people would have predicted in this Chamber--the best foreign policy thinkers or anywhere in this country--how many would have predicted that, if you backed up 10 years ago, that in 5 years or 10 years the following will exist in our world: There will be no Berlin Wall, there will be no Warsaw Pact, Eastern Europe will be free, there will be no Soviet Union, the Ukraine will be nuclear-free, and spots in the Ukraine that used to hold missiles and nuclear warheads will now hold sunflowers. How many would have predicted that? I bet almost no one. 
We have made enormous progress. To the extent that we feel that the cold war and the tensions between us and the Soviet Union, produced a nuclear threat, and to the extent that we have moved away from that with Russia, that is wonderful progress for the entire world. 
The question today is not just a narrow question of, Shall we admit three additional countries to NATO? The question is much, much more than that. It deals with other relationships. It deals with the issue of nuclear proliferation of weapons and delivery mechanisms and so on, and the desire by many of us to move along quickly, not slowly, on the question of further arms reduction talks and treaties and agreements that will further reduce the nuclear threat. That is what is embodied in this question. 
I have spent a lot of time reading about this issue, studying this issue, and trying to understand this issue. As I said when I started, I confess I am not a foreign policy expert. But I believe very strongly that a security alliance as successful as NATO has been should not become an economic alliance; should not become an alliance that imposes new burdens on countries that can least afford to ramp up military spending in order to comply with NATO requirements; should not, in any event, add substantial new burdens to the American taxpayers; and should not, especially and most importantly, do anything that interrupts the stream of progress we have made in reducing the nuclear threat through arms reduction talks, treaties, and agreements. 
I am fairly well convinced that this step to expand, which to some seems so modest, is just a step in the wrong direction. 
Can we, should we, will we be involved with the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, with or without NATO expansion? Of course. They are wonderful people. They are countries that are very important. Our relationship with them is very important. I have just come to the conclusion, however, that this proposal to expand NATO is not a step in a constructive direction. 
The columnist David Broder yesterday wrote a column that I think was important in this discussion. He indicated that this debate about NATO seemed to be forming here in the Congress with almost no fanfare, and the implication of his column was that that is not the way it should happen. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Broder's column be inserted into the Record.

Mr. DORGAN. I placed David Broder's column in the Record because I agree with what he says. NATO expansion is a big issue. It is an important issue. We all come to this issue with our points of view, and no one knows exactly what the future will hold. But this country deserves a long, full, thoughtful Senate debate on the question of NATO expansion and then a vote. This President deserves a vote on expansion as well. 
But when the vote comes, I have concluded I think the best course for this country, the best course for the world for that matter, and the best course to stimulate further reductions in the nuclear threat for this world, is to vote `no' on this particular plan for NATO expansion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that I agree with much of the comments just offered by the Senator from Minnesota. While I am not a supporter of the Coverdell bill, I think it is an interesting proposal to bring to the floor of the Senate only because we will be debating the subject that ought to be one of the priorities of this country, and that is the subject of education. While I was not prepared to support the underlying bill, there are a number of amendments I was prepared to support that I think address the central questions that confront us in the area of education. 
I noticed that the New York Times this morning describes where we are in the Senate and why we are where we are. I guess that now should be amended by the last hour or so of action on the floor of the Senate. But here is the Times description yesterday: 
A dispute over Federal judgeships and the threat of a Democratic filibuster had halted floor action on a Republican-sponsored education bill, leaving Mr. Lott casting about for something to fill the time until the tangle could be sorted out. The NATO resolution was available. 
That was as of this morning. Since that time, of course, the education bill has been brought to the floor of the Senate, and, as I understand, with no debate, two cloture motions were filed, which is rather unusual before debate even begins. The proposition of cloture is that we are deciding to cut off debate? And as a result, because our side did not agree to limit amendments, the bill is pulled, and now we go to NATO expansion? 
Let me just offer a couple of comments about our priorities. Those who are in charge have the opportunity to decide what is on the floor of the Senate. The power of scheduling goes to those who control the Senate. I understand that, and I do not quarrel with that. I do think, however, that education was the right subject, and I regret very much that we are not now on the Coverdell bill, which is the bill we expected to be debated this afternoon and the bill that many of us wanted to offer amendments to in order to have a debate about the central elements of education policy that we want to address. 
Almost everyone in this country is concerned about some central issues in their lives. When they sit around the dinner table, they talk about things like: Do we have an opportunity for a decent job with good benefits? Does our job pay well? Do we have job security? Do our kids have the opportunity to go to good schools? Do our grandparents have the opportunity to get decent health care? Are our children able to access decent health care? Are our neighborhoods safe? Those are the range of questions that affect people's everyday lives. At least the center part of those concerns, among which is education, is what we ought to, in my judgment, be debating on the floor of the Senate. And I had expected that would be the case this afternoon. 
One of the amendments that we intended to offer, that apparently some do not want us to offer, is an amendment addressing the issue of the modernizing of the infrastructure in our schools and whether we can try through Federal policy to provide some help and some incentive for local governments to deal with the infrastructure problems in their schools.

Mr. DORGAN. I was happy to yield because the Senator from Georgia is a thoughtful Member of this body and offers an interesting proposal. It is one that I do not support, but certainly I respect his views on this issue. I had hoped we would be discussing the central portion of the Coverdell bill and amendments to it. 
But I say to the Senator from Georgia that the majority leader has run for the Senate in only one State, and other Members of the Senate who are elected to this body from their States have a right to offer amendments on legislation brought to the floor of the Senate. 
My understanding is that the reason we are now on NATO expansion is because, when the Coverdell bill was brought to the floor of the Senate, the majority leader wanted people on this side of the aisle to agree not to offer a certain number of amendments, to package them only the way the majority leader wants them packaged, and to offer them for a vote, up or down. If that is the way he wants to run the Senate, I say fine, but we have the right to offer amendments and intend to offer amendments, not just on the issue of school modernization, or the size of classrooms or the addition of 100,000 new teachers to limit class size, but also on a range of other issues that we think are important in the area of education. 
It is a fact that today we were told that, unless we agree to dramatically reduce our proposals on education, we were not going to be debating education on the floor of the Senate. The clear message is: we either do it the way the majority leader wants to do this bill or we do not do it at all. 
Well, that is not the way the Senate works. Fortunately, the Senate rules allow us, when someone brings a bill to the floor of the Senate to say, you have an idea, and we have some ideas as well. And here are our ideas. Let us vote on them. There might be two, four, six or eight ideas, but we want to have the opportunity for Members of the Senate to offer them, to debate them, and to have a vote on them. That is the way the Senate works. 
It is interesting to me that, for several months now, every piece of legislation that has come to the Senate floor that would be amendable somehow comes has been manacled in some way so that no 
one else can offer amendments because we are afraid of having a debate on other amendments. In this case it was not so much a case of tying it up as it was deciding, if these people are going to offer amendments, then we are going to pull the bill off the floor. My point is very simple: I think education is the subject we ought to discuss. I believe the Senator from Georgia feels the same. I do not believe that, with scarce federal resources, we ought to embrace the recommendations of the Senator from Georgia. I believe that with scarce resources, you start at the critical level of need and work up. 
Let me describe just for a moment that critical level of need. This afternoon, as I speak, down at the elementary school in Cannon Ball, ND, there are Indian children being educated in old, dilapidated classrooms. One of these rooms is a choir room next to an area where the smell and the gases from the backlogged sewer system are so strong that the kids need to be removed from class. You would keep your children in that room for 1 hour before pulling them out. Children go to that school. 
Or if not the Cannon Ball school, how about the Ojibwa school on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation, where kids go to school in trailers and have to walk outside in the bitter cold to get to class. All those kids have names. All those kids have hopes. They want a future. They want to get educated. They have dreams. But they do not have the opportunity to go to the kind of schools that we went to. This country has an obligation to decide those kids matter. So, in terms of my notion about education, let us start at the critical end of the scale of need and say to those kids, your lives matter. We are going to do something to try to help you. 
So when we debate education, I demand an opportunity--and, in fact, the rules of this Senate guarantee me the opportunity--to offer an amendment when a bill is brought up. And I can offer an amendment that says to that child, sitting in a classroom with sewer gases seeping in, that we can do something for you. 
This is not a problem that requires rocket science to solve. This is a problem we can solve if we just have the will. 
We can talk about more Indian schools. On, the Standing Rock Reservation, where the Cannon Ball school is located, 48 teenage kids over the last 9 months have attempted suicides--47 kids. Six of them have been successful. I was on the phone yesterday with the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta trying to get suicide prevention teams sent to the Reservation. 
Yesterday, when we wrote the supplemental appropriations bill, I also included some resources there to help address this tragic problem. We need to get to that reservation, to those children and say to them: your life matters to us, you make a difference, and suicide is the wrong answer. Suicide is never the right answer. 
My point is that we have such desperate needs that exist in this country. I just mention that one because I have been working on it in recent days. We have such critical problems affecting these young lives, especially with respect to education, because school is where these young kids spend most of their days. 
And on the Standing Rock Reservation, guess what? We have PCB, a known carcinogen, leaking out of light fixtures. They have had to evacuate kids from their school for over a month now and move them around to half a dozen other locations. Six classes are meeting in the gymnasium. 
So, yes, let us talk about education right now, right here in the Senate. Let us bring the bill of the Senator from Georgia to the floor right now and let us not be afraid of any amendment. Maybe the idea of the Senator from Georgia is the best idea, and perhaps at the end of the day he has sufficient votes to advance it. That is the way the system works. I take my hat off to him if he does. 
But maybe there are others of us who have some very good ideas as well that address the bull's-eye, the central education needs, of this country, that address the needs of schools and kids that are not functioning very well, and that says to those who are hopeless and helpless, there is hope and help. Those of us in the Senate who worry about the education system and have some ideas to help want to be able to advance those ideas. That is all we are asking. 
It is just not acceptable to me to not be able to offer education amendments to a bill we have on education. And, incidentally, the Senator from Georgia did say, and he is correct, that this is more than an education bill. It is also a revenue bill. 
I am not going to offer revenue amendments to the Senator's bill, but I am tempted. As he indicated in his statement, this is very tempting because you get so few revenue bills through here that when a revenue bill comes up, you ought to offer a revenue amendment in order to get it done. 
I will give you an example. Nearly 70 percent of all the foreign corporations doing business in America pay zero in Federal income taxes--not 1 percent, not 5 percent, but zero in Federal income taxes. And the names of these corporations are ones you will recognize. 
Look at the brand names on your appliances at home and ask yourself, might these be the names of companies from abroad that are doing business in the United States? And what do they pay in Federal taxes? Do they pay what our businesses pay? Do they pay what our constituents pay? No; I am sorry. Most of them pay zero. We should fix that. I have been trying to. I would love to offer that amendment again. We had a vote on it once in the Senate, and I lost. I would love to offer that amendment again because there is no excuse in this country to have a Tax Code that says, if you want to do $5 billion worth of business in the United States from abroad, then you can go do that. You can earn lots of money, and by the way, you can pay zero in Federal income taxes. 
Nobody in this country gets to do that. 
So, I am sorely tempted to say, yes, this is a revenue bill. I would love to offer an amendment. What we are asking for is the ability to offer amendments directly related to the subject --there are a couple of others, but not many--directly related to education. There is no reason--none--why anyone in the majority or minority can come to the floor of the Senate and say, `By the way, we are going to change the way the Senate works. We will allow our proposal to get a vote, and you package up all of the ideas you have into one amendment with one vote, and that is the way we will dispatch your interest.' This is not something we will accept. It is not something we should accept. It is not something you would accept in a million years if you were standing here. 
So, we now are debating NATO. I suppose at some point, after lengthy and wonderful statements by the majority and minority leaders on this issue, I will come to the Senate floor also and speak about NATO. All of us have views about NATO expansion. But I regret we are here, because we should be on the Coverdell bill, and we should be debating amendments that focus on the education agenda in this country. 
Our amendments are very simple. We believe we can improve education by investing in 100,000 new teachers and reducing class size. We believe we can invest in school infrastructure by helping State and local governments on the interest costs of modernizing our schools. Too many schools in this country are 50, 70, and 80 years old and crumbling and in need of repair. 
We believe we can address those issues and a half a dozen other issues that represent the right initiatives for this country. But we can't do that if we are told, `You add up those amendments, stick them in one package, and we will give you one vote on the package. If you can't carry the entire package, you lose everything, and that is the way we will run the Senate.' That is not the way we will allow the Senate to be run on measures brought to the floor that can be amendable. We will continue to insist on the right to offer amendments, and I will be here again and again to do that. 
Let me say again to the Senator from Nebraska, who I believe will manage this bill, I regret I have taken the time to speak on this issue on your time, but I think it is necessary to describe where we are and how we got here. I also apologize to the Senator from Delaware for the same purpose.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Delaware is correct. I did not address the question of NATO expansion and the way this bill got to the Senate. I didn't read the rest of the New York Times article that I found so interesting: `It is always difficult to predict the schedule in the Senate which can turn on the dime or on the whim of the majority leader and it is not uncommon for the opening debate on major bills to be slow. But even longtime Senators express bewilderment how the NATO resolution appeared to have shoehorned into the Senate schedule,' and, in fact, shoehorned in yesterday and again today. 
I agree with the Senator from Delaware. NATO expansion, however one might feel about the issue, is a legislative main course. It is a significant foreign policy issue that one would hope--having read the history of the Senate written by Senator 
Byrd--that the chapter of Senate history on our debate today on NATO expansion would be described as a thoughtful debate. I hope that our debate will be viewed as one in which most of the Senators were here and listened to wonderful presentations about the impact of NATO expansion, the pros and the cons, the impact on this country's foreign policy and its relationships with Europe and Russia, and on a whole range of other issues that are very, very important. In many instances, the effect of these kinds of policies won't be understood or fully known for a decade or perhaps for a quarter of a century or more. 
When the Senator from Delaware--and I know the Senator from Nebraska also feels this way--describes the importance of this NATO expansion debate, it is hard to describe its importance in terms that are too strong. It is enormously important. I hope it will not be just legislative filler here. There must be a significant debate. I will come at some point and engage in that discussion and share some of my feelings about it. 
The point I was making earlier is that I hoped very much that, as we were told last week, we were going to be on the subject of education. I know the Senator from Delaware and I disagree on the underlying bill of the Senator from Georgia, but I expect we will not disagree on a range of other amendments that will be offered. These amendments represent the only opportunity for those of us who have ideas about how to address some of the central problems in education to bring those to the floor. 
If you are not in a position where you are the one who determines how this Senate schedules its business, the only opportunity you have if you have an idea--and everyone here has ideas, and some of them are wonderful and some not so wonderful --depends upon a set of Senate rules that say the last Senator has the opportunity to seek the floor and offer an amendment. Every other Senator can vote against it if they think it is not a very good amendment, but you have the right to take these ideas and turn them into proposals and ask your colleagues to weigh in on them after a debate. 
That is why I worry a little bit. We have gotten to the point where, over several months, anything that is amendable somehow becomes a nuisance. Gee, if somebody is going to be down here and actually wants to offer ideas, what kind of nut is that? What a nuisance that is for the legislative process. I say, that is not a nuisance, that is the way the system works. Is it efficient? No, not very efficient. Is it effective? Name one other chamber or one other country that equals this. There aren't any and never have been. 
My complaint today was that we are not on the subject that we expected to be on, that I want us to be on, that represents the central issues concerning our country. Is NATO important? Sure. I hope it is scheduled at some point when there is a significant block of time, with the best thinkers in this Chamber standing up and telling us what they know and what they have seen and what they understand about the foreign policy relationships and the impact of those relationships. That is what I hope we will do. 
I don't run this place and probably never will. But I hope that the relationship that we have--and I think a lot of the majority leader; I think he is an awfully good majority leader, although I hope some day soon he will be the minority leader--will allow everyone to understand that we all have rights. We all have our issues that compel us to run for public office, and one of those for a lot of us on this side of the aisle is education. I regret very much that the bill of the Senator from Georgia was pulled, and we hope it is back soon.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Herald's editor, Mike Jacobs, was in Washington recently to receive an award he richly deserves. He was named `Editor of the Year' by the National Press Foundation for his and the Herald's remarkable achievements during last year's flood and fires in Grand Forks. I want to add my words of thanks to Mike and to the entire staff of the Herald for their outstanding work during extraordinarily difficult circumstances. 
I saw firsthand how much it meant to the people of Grand Forks that their hometown newspaper never missed a day of printing throughout the city's crisis. 
When the Herald arrived at shelters and emergency centers it flew off the racks. Clusters of people would gather around and jointly read it. They were starved for news of their city and devoured the paper. 
Yet even more than a conduit of information, the Grand Forks Herald was a symbol of a community determined to survive and endure. 
That the Herald was there at all was wondrous. Its building was completely flooded and then soon burned to the ground. The homes of nearly every employee of the Herald were inundated by flood waters. 
Yet, the Herald, led by Editor Mike Jacobs, never faltered, never missed an edition. It found a temporary office in the grade school of a nearby small town, located alternative presses and devised creative methods of distributing the paper to its readers and flourished. In doing so, it gave hope, inspiration and purpose to its community. 
As the city has overcome the worst disaster in North Dakota history, its citizens have marched back with resilience, fortitude and inspirational spirit. Mike Jacobs, the Grand Forks Herald and the city of Grand Forks have triumphed and I salute them.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, I compliment Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, since he is the original author of this resolution on an international criminal tribunal for Iraq. I very much appreciate his leadership, and I know the Senate appreciates that leadership as well. 
This is the right subject. It is something the Senate needs to be discussing. I hope very much that tomorrow, when we vote on this resolution, the Senate will overwhelmingly approve it. 
Recently, in the country of Iraq, a state-controlled newspaper proposed that Saddam Hussein be given the Nobel Peace Prize. I doubt whether many Americans would believe that Saddam Hussein would qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize. The only ceremony I believe Saddam Hussein ought to attend in the near future is a war crimes trial. And I expect, in the future, if there were a war crimes trial to be held--and I hope this legislation will be the catalyst to make that happen--I expect in the future no one will again suggest a Nobel Peace Prize for a convicted war criminal. 
Why do we say there should be an international tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and other leaders of Iraq for war crimes? 
First of all, there is precedent for it, as Senator Specter indicated. In Nuremberg, at the end of World War II, over 200 Nazi leaders were tried between 1945 and 1949. Thirty-seven of them were sentenced to death, 23 to life in prison, and 101 to shorter prison terms. 
There is an international tribunal for Rwanda at work right now. Three trials are underway. Thirty-one suspects have been indicted, and nearly all of them are in custody. 
The international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has indicted 79 suspects, of whom 24 are now in custody. 
I believe that an international tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi leaders for war crimes should follow on these models. A tribunal for Iraq should be constituted by the United Nations, and war crimes trials should begin. 
Iraq's crimes against peace include two wars of aggression: the Iran-Iraq war in which Iraq invaded Iran, and the Persian Gulf war, in which Iraq invaded its southern neighbor, Kuwait. 
War crimes committed by Iraqi forces against civilians in 
Kuwait include extrajudicial and political killings, acts of torture, rapes of civilian women, pillage and looting--all crimes under the Fourth Geneva Convention, which requires wartime protections for civilians. 
Iraqi troops committed crimes against third country nationals. They prevented Western and Arab refugees from leaving Iraq and Kuwait. They carried out arbitrary arrests and detentions. Iraq even resorted to hostage taking and use of hostages as human shields. 
The Iraqi government committed crimes against prisoners of war. It used physical and mental torture to coerce POWs to reveal information. It used prisoners of war as human shields, and it displayed injured prisoners of war on Iraqi TV. 
Iraq committed crimes against diplomats and embassies: it abducted people with diplomatic immunity, and it seized and blockaded embassies in Kuwait. 
So Mr. President, the list of war crimes during the Persian Gulf War is a lengthy one. However, Iraq's criminal record goes back further than that. 
Human Rights Watch has written extensively about the Anfal campaign against the Kurds living in northern Iraq. This campaign was a policy of systematic and deliberate murder. Human Rights Watch concluded that the Iraqi government killed at least 50,000 and perhaps as many as 100,000 Kurds. 
The Anfal campaign involved the destruction of thousands of Kurdish villages and the murder, disappearance, and extermination by chemical weapons or the forcible resettlement of hundreds of thousands of Kurds. This was ethnic cleansing before the term was invented. 
Even worse, the Anfal campaign included chemical weapons. A U.S. Government white paper says there were `numerous Iraqi chemical attacks against civilian villages in 1987 and 1988.' The white paper lists 10 instances of Iraqi chemical attacks and says that Iraq `delivered. . .Mustard 5 agent and the nerve gases Sarin and Tabun in aerial bombs, spray dispensers, 120-mm rockets and several types of artillery.' 
Iraq possesses a chemical weapons program and a biological weapons program. Its chemical stockpile contained 40,000 chemical weapons munitions; 480,000 liters of chemical weapons agents; and 8 delivery systems. 
Iraq's biological weapons arsenal included 8,500 liters of anthrax; 19,000 liters of botulinum toxin; and 2,200 liters of alfatoxin. This program was in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention, to which Iraq is a party.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let us look at the behavior and the actions of Saddam Hussein and the regime in Iraq through the horror of what happened to a young boy, now dead, named Dejwar, 5 years of age. In reading Dejwar's story, I am relying on the wonderful reporting work done by Middle East Watch and the Physicians for Human Rights. Human Rights Watch has published this work in a book called, `The Anfal Campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan.' 
This book tells a terrible story about happened to Dejwar. 
On August 25, 1988, at dawn, this 5-year-old boy, with his father, a farmer, was awake inside their house in Birjinni. Hassan, the boy's father, lived there with his father and mother, his four brothers, his wife and four children, of whom Dejwar was one. 
Hassan, Dejwar's father, was preparing to go to the orchards that morning. Then the bombs began to drop. The father said that the explosions that morning were not as strong as other bombs that had been dropped on their village by the Government of Iraq. 
The surviving villagers described the smoke that morning rising from the bombs as `white, black and then yellow' smoke. Those columns of smoke from the bombs rose 50 to 60 meters in the air. 
The smell of gas was `pleasant, at first' that morning. `It smelled of apples,' they said, smelled of `something sweet.' Several men said it smelled like `pesticides in the fields.' Shortly after that, they said `it became bitter. It affected our eyes, and our mouths, and our skin. All of a sudden,' they said, `it was hard to breathe. Your breath wouldn't come. You couldn't breathe' at all. 
The people of that village--and this is one study of one village, one attack on one morning by the Iraqi Government--did not know what to do when those bombs fell. They began to understand these were not usual bombs, these were chemical bombs. 
As the smoke from the chemical bombs settled into the lower land, they said `it drifted down the valley toward the fields and the orchards.' The father said, `I took my family, three of my children and my wife, and we ran to higher ground. We went the other direction from the smoke.' There was complete panic; people ran in all directions. Families were separated, children lost from their parents. Everyone `was trying to save themselves, each one himself, even the mothers of children, because they couldn't breathe.' 
But Hassan's father and other family members at first stayed in the house because `they didn't know what the smoke could do.' When they realized they were under gas attack, many of them ran down from the village to an orchard in a ravine. The smoke followed them into the ravine. 
Hassan and his wife realized that one of their four children was also separated from them, and that was the 5-year-old boy I mentioned, Dejwar. He was missing. He had gone with his grandfather to the orchard in the ravine and stayed there. 
When some of the smoke lifted, after about a half an hour, Hassan and other survivors thought it was safe to come to the village. He found his mother and sister `lying on the ground, overcome by the gas.' Symptoms: Hands, legs paralyzed, trembling, shaking. They tried to swallow water and couldn't. Their throats were burning. They were vomiting. Hassan later said, `My mother whispered, 'I think there's a hole in my head.' Within several hours after exposure to the smoke, both mother and sister went blind, according to family members. 
Hassan went down from the village and found his father and his son Dejwar lying dead outside the orchard. There were no marks on them. `It was like they were sleeping,' he said, `except their faces were blue.' Then he found his two brothers dead in a small cave where they had taken refuge. 
Mr. President, these are just a few paragraphs in a book describing the experience of one village under attack with chemical weapons by the country of Iraq. 
Name another leader on the face of this Earth who has decided, not once but on numerous occasions, to use weapons of mass destruction against his own people and his neighbors. Name one other country. Only Iraq, only Saddam Hussein. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania and I and others say it is time, long past the time, when there should be constituted an international tribunal to try these people, who have committed such atrocities, for war crimes. That tribunal will give a much longer presentation of evidence than the Senator from Pennsylvania or I will give today. Maybe then, maybe all of the world will see the systematic presentation of evidence, and hear of the unspeakable horrors that have been visited upon innocent men, women and children. Not just tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands of people, who have disappeared and been killed and murdered. Some of them were killed by poison gas. 
Maybe then the rest of the people in the world will understand this is not just a foreign leader, this is not just the leader of Iraq, this is a convicted war criminal. 
A war crimes trial should have happened after the Gulf War. Whether Saddam Hussein is tried in absentia or not is irrelevant to me. The fact that he is tried is very important. We must, as a world, come together and judge actions of this type. 
The unspeakable horrors that have been visited upon so many innocent people by this government must not go unnoticed and must not remain unprosecuted. We can, we should, and we will convene an international tribunal. We have done that in the past, and there are two such tribunals ongoing right now. 
With the leadership of the Senator from Pennsylvania, we can and will and should convene that international tribunal for Iraq and do the right thing. 
This resolution may be controversial for some, who say that the foggy world of diplomacy does not accommodate this kind of decisive and important action. I think the foggy world of diplomacy demands this kind of action. 
When diplomatic initiatives occur in the Persian Gulf in the future, it ought not occur between respectable diplomats on one side and Saddam Hussein as a national leader on the other side. It ought to be Saddam Hussein, a convicted war criminal, on the other side, a war criminal convicted by evidence all the world will have seen. 
That is the purpose of this resolution. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Chairman's interest in the Red River Trade Corridor. As you know, I have long supported efforts to add value to the agricultural products produced by the farmers in my state and within the entire region. However, adding value is only one part of the picture. We must also ensure that the products can get to market, especially in light of the current era of international trade and consumer demand for fresher and higher-quality products. Giving our region the ability to develop a transportation infrastructure to improve the movement of products to market in a timely fashion, and to link infrastructure investment to international trade, is essential in order for our region to bring new opportunities to our farmers and rural communities. 
If North Dakota and the region are to continue to benefit from new export opportunities, such as those offered by NAFTA, we must have the transportation infrastructure to deliver perishable, high-quality products. 
Simply put, our goal is to make truck transportation across the United States faster, easier, and more cost-effective. But federal support for states and communities along the Red River Trade Corridor is essential to improve the infrastructure of the corridor and to streamline traffic across the United States and from the Canadian and Mexican borders.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take just a minute to discuss an item that has shown up in a number of newspapers and columns in the last week or two. I will read a couple of headlines. `Congress and the Clock.' `They Seem at Times to be Running on an Empty Tank.' `A Do-Nothing Congress Could Turn Into a Do-Little Congress.' `AWOL Congress.' 
The point that is made by some editorial writers and some others is that there is not much of an agenda. Well, we have the highway bill on the floor of the Senate now. This is very important. I want very much to get this done and get it done promptly. This is last year's business being done this year. Let's get it done and provide some certainty with respect to our plans and our desires to invest in our country's infrastructure, highways and roads. 
When we complete this piece of legislation, it is not the case that there is not an agenda here for the Congress to consider. Many of us have developed an agenda that is very aggressive. We have an agenda to save Social Security first. We would like very much for the Senate to vote on that proposition, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says it is our intention to save Social Security first. The question here is, if there is, in fact, a brighter picture ahead with respect to Federal deficits, what is to be done. Some want to spend it, some want to provide tax breaks. The President says let us save Social Security first. I hope very much we can have a vote here in the Senate that says we agree, let us save Social Security first. That is the first and the best priority for this Congress. 
Second, we want to consider legislation to protect health care consumers. There are 160 million people now enrolled in managed health care plans in this country. Yes, some managed care plans can and do save money. They can, in fact, improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by health care practitioners, not insurance company accountants. Many in this country are very concerned about their treatment by their managed care plan. 
The President has proposed a patient's bill of rights to provide some basic protections for patients. You have the right to know all of your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. And you have the right to emergency room care you need whenever and wherever you need it. You also have the right to keep your medical records confidential. 
We believe very strongly that one of the first items of business in this session of Congress should be to address the question of managed care. 
Here is an essay written by Dr. Ronald Glasser titled, `The Doctor Is Not In,' and subtitled `On the managed failure of managed health care.' 
Let me read a couple of paragraphs of this article by Dr. Glasser, a Minneapolis pediatrician and the author of several books. He writes in this essay: 
We are born, we live, and then we die, but these days we do so with less and less help from a medical profession paid to discount our suffering and ignore our pain. Proofs of the bitter joke implicit in the phrase `managed care' show up in every morning's newspaper, in casual conversations with relatives or friends recently returned from a hospital or from what was once thought of as a doctor's office instead of an insurance company's waiting room, and in a country generously supplied with competent and compassionate doctors, 160.3 million of us now find ourselves held captive to corporate health-care systems that earn $952 billion a year but can't afford the luxury of a conscience or a heart. 
Dr. Glasser, in his essay, talks about the denial of certain health care. He says, 
Such forced denial of care occurs at a time when new medical and surgical technologies allow physicians to treat and often cure any number of conditions that only a few years ago could barely be diagnosed; organs now can be digitally reconstructed in three dimensions to locate previously inoperable tumors; heart attacks can be stopped with injections of a compound known as tPA; blind people may wake up and see with implanted plastic lenses, one-and-a-half-pound premature babies, once given up for lost, routinely are nursed to health; a new generation of medical research brings us genetically engineered tests and one nearly miraculous drug after the next. At the same moment, presumably well-insured women diagnosed with disseminated breast cancer must hire lawyers to have their health plans pay for life-saving bone-marrow transplants and managed-care companies can deny powered wheelchairs to handicapped children who pass a `utilization review' showing them able to stagger twenty-five feet with the help of a walker. 
This is a long and fascinating essay about managed care. My colleagues have heard the stories that have persuaded many of us that this Congress at least ought to address the question of what patients' rights are in managed care. 
A 27-year-old man from central California received a heart transplant and was discharged from the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not pay for additional hospitalization. Nor would the HMO pay for the bandages needed to cover the man's infected surgical wounds. The patient died. 
An otherwise healthy 2-year-old boy who had suffered a fall was taken to a local hospital with a stick lodged between his upper lip and his gums. Once there, health care providers repeatedly misdiagnosed the boy's condition and refused to authorize an $800 CT scan that would have confirmed the boy was developing a brain abscess. The result? The boy was left blind and brain damaged. 
A 54-year-old man who just had prostate surgery was told by his HMO he must leave the hospital within 24 hours of his surgery because the HMO wouldn't pay. He had to go home where there was no one to care for him even though he was still bleeding, had to wear a catheter to drain his bladder, and couldn't walk. 
The stories go on and on. Most of us have heard the stories in our hometowns, our States. One managed care organization recently stated it would not pay for more than 5 hours of epidural pain relief for labor pains. Doctors objected, saying that some labor pains go on for more than 20 hours. One wonders whether the insurance company employee who said we will limit the coverage for epidural relief to 5 hours has ever been in a hospital experiencing the pain of childbirth. My guess is no. 
We now have a circumstance where, all too often, the operation of the emergency room is a matter of profit or loss. There was an article about a woman in the New York Times recently. She was in an ambulance with her brain swelling from an injury just received, and she told the ambulance driver, `Do not take me to the closest hospital.' And she named the hospital farther away where she wanted to be taken that did not have a reputation for making cost its bottom line. She said later that she didn't want to be taken to the other emergency room and have somebody make a decision about her life that related to their bottom line, to their profit and loss. A lot of Americans share her concern. 
So we have an agenda. We have an agenda on managed care that says there ought to be a patient's bill of rights. People ought to know what their medical options are. No accountant 500 miles away from a hospital room or a doctor's office ought to be giving guidance on whether a doctor's judgment is appropriate with respect to treatment. And yet that is what is happening in this country. 
We have an agenda on managed care. We think it ought to be one of the first items of business here on the Senate floor when we finish the highway bill. Let's talk about managed care. Let's talk about the health care. Let's talk about the 160 million people who are in managed care plans and ask the question, what does this plan mean to my health care? to my family's health care? to my children's and my parents' health care? What does it mean 
to our pocketbook? What kind of coverage exists for us today, tomorrow and next month? This Congress needs to be debating and answering some of those questions. These are life-or-death issues, not matters of inconvenience. 
So when someone says the Senate doesn't have an agenda, they aren't talking about us. We have an agenda, but regrettably, we didn't win the Senate. The majority party that controls the Senate won the election. We understand that when votes are counted, whatever party wins wins, and they control the House and the Senate. But I want everybody to understand, when they see an editorial titled `Congress Gone AWOL,' `Congress and the Clock,' `70 days left,' or `A do little Congress,' that for some of us there is an agenda. 
Many of us have very strong feelings about what issues the Senate should be considering--managed care, education, tobacco legislation, a whole series of issues that we want brought to the floor of this Congress and debated. The fact is we have some who, without question, want to have the engine running but have the transmission in idle. They don't want to go anywhere. They just want to claim the car started. We would like to put this car in drive and drive towards an objective that we think represents the best interests of this country. 
On education, we understand that State and local governments should make the main decisions in elementary and secondary education. But many of us also believe that we have a national interest in trying to reach goals and achievements as a country in elementary and secondary education. The President and those of us on this side of the aisle are very concerned about trying to find some way to address the issue of class size. Are there things we can do with respect to class size and modernizing schools? For example, we understand that reducing class sizes can have a substantial impact on the teaching of children. Smaller class size means more attention is paid to each of the children, and we understand that is important. 
The issue of modernizing schools--many of our schools all across this country are 30, 40, and 50 years old and in disrepair. I have been in schools, unfortunately, like the Ojibwa School on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. These are schools children shouldn't be in. Reports from the General Accounting Office about the schools say they are unsafe. I have seen light fixtures dangling from the ceilings and frigid winter air coming through the trailers that masquerade as schoolrooms. We can do something as a Congress to modernize schools and remedy their state of disrepair. We want to talk additionally about the issue of minimum wage, about those at the bottom of the economic ladder. We made a couple of adjustments in the minimum wage on a bipartisan basis, but we need to further consider how to restore its purchasing power, not to a level above where it used to be, but to a level comparable to where it historically has been. 
It is interesting in this country that we have a market system that is very generous to some and not to others. That is the way the market system works, and I accept that. In the market system we have in this country we have a right to make choices. I certainly don't want to discontinue those choices. But by our choices we've created a system where a man who is 7 feet 2 inches tall and can dunk a basketball gets $120 million. Where does that come from? It comes from folks who watch television or go to a basketball game, if they can afford to do so. But that's $120 million for somebody who can dunk a basketball and $30,000 for an elementary schoolteacher. 
Which one would you pick? We make choices in the public and private sectors. Actually, when I refer to the private sector, there are not exactly unimpeded economic circumstances in professional basketball, where somebody makes $120 million, because it is not exactly an open and free market system. There are different circumstances in professional basketball because they limit the number of teams and so on. 
My point is that the question of what we invest in both publicly and privately in this country determines a lot about what kind of a country we are going to have in the future. Our agenda, which we think would improve this country, deals with health care and education and jobs and income opportunity--a whole range of issues that we think represent good and strong positions for this Congress to consider. So the reason I came to the floor this afternoon is to say that the next time I see one of these editorials that says `do nothing, do little, march in place, you know, the car is in idle,' we have plenty to do. If we finish the highway bill this week--and I hope we will and I will support all the efforts to get this done quickly--then I hope next week we can grab a hold of a significant part of this agenda that we feel is important. If we do this, I think the next editorial will say, gee, they tackled education and health care and a lot of things that are very important to the people in this country. 
I yield back the balance of the time I haven't used. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the debate over the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program and the McConnell amendment. First, I want to say that I have some concerns about the DBE program, at least in its previous structure. I do not doubt the presence of racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination in this country and I would be the first to say that we ought to have strong national policies that are designed to rectify discrimination and provide assistance to businesses that are disadvantaged because of discrimination. However, a strict mandate on states to establish quotas and set asides is not the appropriate means to end discrimination. 
Unfortunately, much of the debate over the McConnell amendment has inaccurately characterized the question in polemic terms. The advocates of the McConnell amendment would suggest that a vote against his amendment is a vote for quotas and set asides. That is simply not true. 
While I have some concerns about the DBE program, I do not intend to vote for the McConnell amendment. The Department of Transportation has made significant changes in the DBE program under the directive of the President's review of all affirmative action programs. The new regulations no longer require states to adopt a 10% goal of DBE contracts for highway projects. The old regulations had that requirement. I would not support that approach. However, under the new regulations, the DOT provides states with several specific formula options with which they can utilize to establish the appropriate goal for DBE contracts for each particular state. Section 26.41 of the regulations--which specifies how each state sets their overall DBE goals--does not contain any specific percentage requirement. 
The 10% goal specified in the underlying legislation is a nation-wide goal. Under the Department's regulations, each state will utilize one of several formula options specified in the regulations to determine the appropriate goal for that state. There is no quota mandate. The only requirement is that states make a good faith effort to determine how to set an appropriate goal for DBE contracts. 
I am not persuaded by the agreements that the DBE program is unconstitutional. The Adarand decision did not declare the program unconstitutional. Rather, it required that the program be narrowly tailored. It appears to me that the Department's new regulations have been developed in a manner to comply with that requirement. I am confident that when these new regulations are implemented that the Department will be flexible and work cooperatively with states to establish appropriate goals. If the Department had not taken steps to revise this program, I would be advocating changes with respect to the ISTEA legislation. However, anyone who has reviewed the proposed new regulations (49 CFR Parts 23 and 26, May 30, 1997) would conclude that significant changes have been made and I believe that it is reasonable to allow the Department to implement those changes, which provide a great deal more flexibility to the states and will not impose a specific percentage requirement for DBE contracts. 
Notwithstanding the questions about the constitutionality of the DBE program and whether or not it is a quota program, I am very concerned about the McConnell amendment because of the new requirements it imposes on states. The McConnell amendment expands the definition of what constitutes a `disadvantaged business,' duplicating many small business development programs which are currently administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA). In addition, the McConnell amendment imposes a significant financial burden on states to develop new outreach programs without providing any federal assistance to pay for these new requirements. Even if one were to conclude that the DBE program ought to either be changed or eliminated, the McConnell amendment is certainly not the correct response. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I am opposing the McConnell amendment. However, I urge the Department to implement new regulations that give the states the flexibility to establish their own goal--as has been promised.

Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island is--it is Rhode Island, isn't it? The Senator from Rhode Island is a very generous friend, and a lot of folks get that `North' and `South' mixed up. But North Dakota is very distinct from South Dakota. I do not have the time to describe all of the reasons today, but even Lewis and Clark, nearly 200 years ago, understood that difference because they decided, when they had to spend the winter someplace, they would go a little farther north and spend it in North Dakota. 
In any event, I have an amendment that I offer today, an amendment that I think is very important. I want to describe it very briefly, and I think others will come to the floor to support this amendment. 
Three years ago I offered an amendment nearly identical to this, and I lost by two votes in a vote on the floor of the Senate. I regret that that happened. It is the way the legislative process is--sometimes you win, sometimes you don't; sometimes the vote is close, sometimes it isn't. 
I feel very strongly about this amendment for a lot of personal reasons and also very strongly because of policy reasons. The amendment deals with the ability of people in this country to drive down a road in America and drink while they are driving, or if not having the driver drink, having passengers in the vehicle drinking while the driver is driving on. 
Most people are surprised to learn that there are five States in America where it is perfectly legal to put one hand around the neck of a whiskey bottle and the other on a steering wheel, start the engine and drive off, and you are violating no laws. 
It is very surprising for people to hear that in some parts of the country, when you take your family on a vacation, you may cross a border where in that next State you have someone driving down the road drinking whiskey, drinking beer, and they are perfectly legal. 
With all due respect to the States in which that occurs, that ought not be legal anywhere in America. It ought not be legal anywhere, any time or under any conditions in this country. We ought to expect in this country when we drive on our road system--and it is a national road system--no matter where we drive, no matter what city, what county, what township, what State we are driving in, we ought to be able to expect that at the next intersection we are not going to meet a vehicle that has a driver that is drinking legally while he is driving or while she is driving. 
We ought not expect that in the 22 other States, where it is not legal for the driver to drink but it is perfectly legal for the rest of the passengers in the car to be having a drinking party, we ought not expect to meet a car in that circumstance either. 
My amendment is very simple. It would, as many States have done, provide that all States shall have a prohibition on open containers. Very simple--a prohibition on open containers. This will not apply to vehicles for hire and commercial vehicles and so on. But you would expect then, if this legislation passes, that no matter where you drive in this country, at the next road or intersection or city or county you are not going to meet a vehicle that is full of people drinking, including the driver. 
Very simple. It says the States must enact laws that prohibit open containers. Many States do. Most States do. Some States do not. You all must. There is a sanction here. The sanction is designed not to penalize the State. It is designed to say to States, you must pass a prohibition on open containers. 
I have described on the floor--and I shall not this morning--the telephone call I received the night my mother was killed by a drunk driver. Every family in this Chamber knows of someone, a close friend, perhaps a relative, an acquaintance who received that telephone call. My colleague from Ohio, regrettably, received that telephone call about his daughter. My colleague from Arkansas received that telephone call. But it is not just us; 17,000 families receive those telephone calls. And 17,000 families received that telephone call last year. 
This is not some mysterious illness for which we do not know a cure. We know what causes this and we know how to stop it. We have to decide in this country that drunk driving is serious business and there are several important steps to take to stop it. This legislation, this amendment, is one. 
Mr. President, I am proud today that others will join me. The Mothers Against Drunk Driving strongly supports this amendment. The Advocates for Highway Auto Safety has sent to all my colleagues a letter strongly supporting this amendment. Senators Lautenberg, Bumpers, Conrad, Wellstone, Glenn, Bingaman, Inouye, Torricelli, and Reid are some of the cosponsors of this amendment. I know the chairman of the subcommittee has voted for it in the past. 
I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for a statement on this. I very much appreciate his willingness to come to the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his support on the amendment. He has been a strong supporter of this kind of legislation. As he indicates, this is not intruding on someone's basic right to do certain things. 
I do not believe that most people in this country would say, `We think it's an inherent right on a national road system for any American citizen to drink and drive at the same time.' 
I hope very much that those who I know are concerned about this issue of drunk driving and concerned about the some-17,000 people who are killed, 17,000 fatalities each year as a result of alcohol-related accidents, I hope they will join us. 
I know that there are some in this Congress who are sympathetic to this issue but believe very strongly that it is something that belongs to the States. I certainly respect that feeling, except that I believe there are some basic standards that we must assert ourselves on. 
We have done that, for example, on some safety issues such as standards on roads. 
How do you build a road to make sure it is standard? We decide there is a certain standard, so we don't run from one State to another finding roads built without any safety characteristics. We have standards for that. 
The same is true with respect to safety relative to drunk driving. All we are saying is that we don't think there ought to be anywhere in this country where people in a vehicle are drinking while they are driving down the road. Or the rest of the folks, four other people in the vehicle, are not passing around a bottle of peppermint schnapps or a bottle of Jack Daniels and a six-pack of beer, having a fine party, while the automobile is being driven down the street. That is not what we should expect on our roads and streets in this country. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned, I offered this amendment 3 years ago. I lost by two votes. I then switched my vote so I could have it reconsidered later. I was unable to do so. The record will show it was a four-vote loss, but, in fact, I lost this amendment by two votes. I don't know what the vote will be this morning. I expect it will be very close. I hope those who decided to join yesterday in the .08 national standard will also decide today this modest step, as it is described by Senator DeWine, and others, this modest step, is one that is a step in the right direction. 
I will use just a couple of minutes to describe some statistics about drunk driving. I know others have used some data to describe the amount of drunk driving and the amount of casualties on America's roads because of it. In 1996, the last year for which we have complete data, there were 17,272 alcohol-related fatalities. That is an average of one every half hour. In February of 1995, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation convened a conference in Washington, DC. He did so to discuss future goals for reducing deaths and serious injuries on America's highways due to alcohol-related deaths. That conference was called Partners in Progress. It established a goal of reducing drunk driving deaths to no more than 11,000 per year by 2005. That is a lot of highway deaths but substantially below the current level of some 17,000-plus deaths as a result of alcohol-related accidents. Mr. President, 11,000 is a far cry from where we are. 
We must--and I think we have in this Senate--begin to take steps to address the issue and see if we can't meet this goal. One step was yesterday with the .08 standard. The second step, I hope, will be today with a proposition that I offer that says we should not allow, anywhere in this country, people who are driving automobiles to be drinking, and we should not allow open containers of alcohol in vehicles in this country. 
The Senator from Ohio said something very important. The drunk driving legislation that we are offering in the Congress is not offered in a design to try to catch people, arrest people and throw people in jail. It is offered as a design to try to encourage people that it is wrong to drink and drive. Don't think about it; don't try it; the penalties are severe. We are not looking to go out and arrest people and throw people in jail. We are looking to change people's behavior and habits. 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, an organization I mentioned earlier, is a remarkable organization. It has done a substantial amount of work in recent years to deal with this issue. Frankly, a substantial amount of progress has been made. State legislatures, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, and others, have led the way to make some substantial changes. I, today, want to congratulate that organization and commend them for the work they have done. As they indicate in their letter to all Members of Congress, the job is not nearly complete and there are more steps to take, one of which we took yesterday, and one of which I hope we will take this morning. The one I am asking the Congress to take is the simplest of all of these steps and it is to say that when you look at what is happening around this country, State by State, you understand that the job is not done. In too many regions of this country there are people driving their vehicles, drinking while driving, and they are perfectly legal; in too many other States, others are drinking in those vehicles and that, too, is legal. 
Mr. President, I notice the Senator from New Mexico has risen. I will reserve the balance of my time if he wishes to assume the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will certainly yield back if Senator Chafee has somebody who wishes to speak in opposition. He has been very generous and courteous. I appreciate that. 
Madam President, let me read to the Senate a letter that I just received this morning from the Secretary of Transportation, Rodney Slater. It is dated today. 
He writes: 
Dear Senator Dorgan: Earlier this week, President Clinton spoke strongly about the need to reduce the risk of drinking and driving by calling on Congress to lower the legal limit for blood alcohol content to .08 percent. Yesterday, the Senate overwhelmingly agreed by passing the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment. I applaud the Senate for supporting this measure. Today, the Senate has the opportunity to approve another amendment which will help fight drunk driving by voting to prohibit open containers of alcohol in motor vehicles. 
In 1996, there were more than 17,000 alcohol-related fatalities in this country. The amendment to be offered by Senators Dorgan, Lautenberg, Bumpers, et al., will further efforts to reduce the terrible loss of life on our highways due to drinking and driving. 
I urge the Senate to support adoption of this important highway safety provision. 
Rodney Slater, Secretary of Transportation. 
Madam President, I indicated a bit ago that this amendment was offered by myself 3 years ago and I lost by two votes. I don't know what the vote is going to be today, but I hope that we will prevail with this amendment. 
The Senator from New Jersey noted that no one is speaking in opposition to this amendment, and the reason is quite simple: To oppose this amendment requires someone to come to the floor of the Senate and say they support someone's right to drink and drive. 
To the extent that I support the States' rights to determine that they want laws allowing people to drink and drive, it requires someone to stand up and say: This amendment is wrong because I support the right of people to drink while they are driving. 
No one will come to the floor to say they support the right of people to drink while they drive in this country--for good reason. Almost all of us know that it's fundamentally wrong. Alcohol and automobiles don't go together. Alcohol and automobiles together represent, in too many instances, drunk driving and, therefore, murder and mayhem on our highways. There is one more dead every 30 minutes, and two dead during this very short debate. The carnage on our roads must stop and can if we decide as a Senate that there are things we can do in public policy to tell the American people not to even think about drinking and driving. 
Yesterday, we passed a measure that provides a uniform .08 standard for blood alcohol content. A 170-pound man would have to drink 4 drinks in 1 hour on an empty stomach to get to .08. This question was asked, and I think it is an important question: Would you like to put your children in an automobile driven by someone who has just had four drinks on an empty stomach in the last hour? Or do you think deep in the pit of your belly that would not be a safe thing to do with your children? I think I know the answer. Every American would answer that question saying, no, that is not where I want to put my children. 
I would ask the same question with respect to this amendment. Would anyone like to put their children in the automobile where, on the cup holder next to the driver for ready access as the driver drives, there is a can of beer or a bottle of bourbon, because it is legal to do it in some States? Would anyone want to put their children in the front seat or back seat of that car and think, gee, I feel pretty good about sending my kid on that drive? I don't think so. Would anyone want to put their child in the back seat of a car where, if the driver isn't drinking, all the other three passengers are drinking? I don't think so. I think most of us know the answer to that question. There is no vocal opposition to this amendment on the floor of the Senate, because you can't stand up here in the Senate and say that it makes sense to allow people in America to drink and drive. 
There was a little boy named Jesse--actually not so little, but kind of short. He was a wonderful boy with an infectious grin, one of the most well-mannered young people you would ever find in life. He was the son of my cousin in Mandan, ND. Jesse is dead now. Jesse went to a party the night before his high school graduation. Jesse was a good boy, but, unfortunately, he accepted a ride with the wrong person. At the end of that matter, he got into the passenger side of an automobile driven by a young man who was drunk, and about 2 minutes later they were hit by a train. Jesse died. 
Jesse was just one of those 17,700 people who become a statistic, but his life was important, he was important, and his death was a tragedy. Everyone here has those stories. 
I was in an automobile on the main street of Fargo, ND, one night with my daughter. She was driving, and a drunk hit our car. Fortunately, neither of us was injured. The car was totaled--total damage. And I remember my daughter weeping, sobbing uncontrollably, because we had been involved in this crash, and it was traumatic. But by God's grace, we weren't injured. The fellow who hit us was so incredibly drunk that he could not walk when he got out of the car. 
All he could do was fall. He was too drunk to walk. Every day, every night, every hour, all across this country, you will hear stories like that. People cause property damage, people are injured, people are killed, and it used to be that drunk driving meant someone would give someone a slap on the arm and a wink and a grin, and say, `Well, I saw you in your pickup truck driving,' sort of knowing well, `Ah, shucks.' 
Fortunately, we have moved from that point to a point of better understanding that drunk driving in this country kills people. It is not funny. It is not acceptable. We have done a lot of things to reduce deaths by drunk driving in this country. But we have not yet done enough. 
The step we propose today to complement the step the Senate took yesterday is very simple. This amendment is not rocket science; this amendment is painfully simple. It says the following: In our country, as we wage the fight against the carnage on our road from drunk drivers, the simple step that must be taken is to say that no vehicle in this country should be driven by someone who is drinking, and no vehicle in this country should be traveling down America's roads with either the driver or the passengers having open containers of alcohol. 
That is so simple and so fundamental, and, yet, I expect will be the product of a rather close vote. And I regret that. Again, I respect everyone's interests, motives and reasons for voting, and, as I said, there are some who believe that the Federal Government has no business intruding into this area. It is the States' business. I say in many areas I agree with that. There are many things that are not the business of the U.S. Senate. They are not the business of the Federal Government. But there are some things that are. 
When we designed a national road system, we said the transportation and the free movement across this country on good roads and reliable roads and safe roads is part of that national system. How safe is that movement on roads for someone to load up a car with their children and their spouses and go on a family vacation, and then cross that next line and drive into that next State without much warning and without much thought in the back of your mind that at the next intersection in the next county you might meet someone who is drinking and driving--and it is legal--and that someone who might be drinking alcohol as he or she drives down the road might just miss that green light, turned yellow, then turn red, and come to that intersection and meet your family or meet your neighbor's family? That is what happens in this country. It happened in the last half hour and the half hour before that. 
I can't go to a meeting and ask the question of any group of representative people in this country, `How many of you have been affected by drunk driving? How many of you have a relative, a friend, an acquaintance, how many of you know someone who has been killed by a drunk driver?' You can't do that without having most of the hands in the room raised. That is the impact drunk driving has on our country. 
My amendment, as I indicated, is painfully simple. It does not attempt to say to the States, `Those of you who do not have open container prohibitions, you are bad States.' That is not what it says. It just says there is a national purpose and a national interest on this issue, and the national purpose and the national interest is that anyone driving anywhere, anytime in this country should be able to expect that the next vehicle they meet on the road is driven by and is occupied by people who are not drinking alcohol. 
Those of us who have visited with law enforcement people, who spend their days and nights on America's roads, have heard the stories of tragedy and horror by the folks we pay to keep the peace and to enforce our laws. I encourage anyone who has doubts about whether this issue is important to take some time and just sit down for a few minutes with the men and women of the police forces of our country and let them tell you what happens on our roads with those who are impaired from drinking. Let them tell you the tragedy that occurs virtually every day in every way on America's roads. Only then, I think, will those whose lives have not been touched by this tragedy understand that this is a national problem. It is not someone else's problem; it is our problem. This is a problem we can do something about, something real, something tangible, and something important. 
Madam President, the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, has come to the floor. I remember 3 years ago, when I offered this amendment, as I indicated the other day, I heard one of the most touching speeches I have ever heard on the floor of the Senate. His family has been visited with the awful tragedy of drunk driving as well. I am pleased he has come. I hope he will not mind if I call on him immediately and ask him to consume as much time as he needs.  
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, recently I cosponsored legislation authored by my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, which addresses a serious threat to public health: youth smoking. Every day 3,000 kids take up smoking, and tragically, 1,000 of them will eventually die of tobacco-related illnesses. Since research has shown that 90 percent of all smokers begin smoking in their teens or younger, we must do more to prevent our children from becoming hooked on tobacco. 
The Healthy Kids Act, S. 1638, takes the tobacco settlement negotiated by several states' attorneys general last summer and strengthens it. The bill provides the Food and Drug Administration with full authority to regulate tobacco. This would protect FDA's ability to, among other things, require health warnings on tobacco products, prohibit advertising aimed at children and insure the safety of tobacco ingredients. The bill imposes penalties on tobacco companies if they fail to reduce youth smoking rates by 67 percent over the next 10 years and funds research, prevention and smoking cessation programs. The bill also requires tobacco companies to make public their documents related to the health effects of smoking, manipulation of nicotine levels in tobacco and their efforts to market tobacco products to minors. 
Finally, the legislation would impose a health fee on tobacco products of 50 cents per pack in 1999, increasing to $1.50 per pack in 2001. While I have some concern about the level of this new fee, it has two important goals. The first, and most important, is to discourage children from taking up smoking. Most experts agree that a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes is the most effective way to reduce teen smoking. Secondly, this new fee rightly asks smokers to pay for some of the costs to states and the federal government of treating smoking-related health problems. 
I don't agree with every provision in S. 1638, but I cosponsored it because I believe it is important that Congress pass comprehensive legislation to combat youth smoking this year. Tobacco should continue to be a legal product for adults, but we need to do more to keep it out of the hands of children and we must hold the tobacco industry accountable for their efforts to hook our kids.

Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. 
The Senator from Oklahoma was discussing the 21-year-old drinking age. That was established in legislation by Congress some long while ago. In fact, I believe the provisions in that bill, with respect to penalties for those States that would not comply, are identical to the provisions of the penalties in this bill. 
We have decided, as a country, there are certain things that are national in scope. Our road program is a national program, a program of priorities. And I think this amendment simply says, let us determine what represents drunk driving so that you are not driving in one State versus another, and come up to an intersection, when you cross the State line, and find someone driving down the road that is drunk but in fact is not legally drunk because that State has a different set of rules. 
In fact, you can now--and I hope to change this--you can now drive and drink in five States. In five States you can put a whiskey bottle in one hand and a driver's wheel in the other and drive down the road and you are legal. In over 20 States someone else in the car can have a party while the driver drives as long as the driver does not drink. 
I also will propose, following this amendment at some point, that in every State in this country we have a prohibition on open containers of alcohol in vehicles. So the point I wanted to make with respect to the comments by the previous speaker was, we have tried incentive programs. 
For example, a number of years ago we had an incentive program. Incentive grants were established, since the early 1990s, with respect to trying to persuade the States to pass legislation prohibiting open containers in vehicles. We have said, we want incentives to be available to prevent open containers in vehicles and pass legislation to prevent open containers in vehicles. Despite that, in 1998, 22 States still prohibit open containers in vehicles. Incentives do not work. I do not think we ought to talk about incentives on this issue. And alcohol and vehicles do not mix. 
No one in America should be able to drive and drink at the same time. Yet in five States you can. Nowhere in America should a car be driven down the road to meet anyone here, their families or anyone in America, and then at the next intersection have, if not the driver drinking, the rest of the people in the car with open containers of alcohol. If we don't decide to have the will to at least require that in this country, then we will not stop the carnage on American roads. 
I appreciate the Senator offering the amendment. I intend to support it and I hope my colleagues will support it, as well.

Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
Mr. President, I rise today to support the Lautenberg amendment. I intend to vote for it, and I am pleased to support a piece of legislation I think will be important in saving lives in our country. 
Before I do, I want to talk about three quick items. One is the amendment that has just been adopted, the McCain amendment. I would then like to talk about the Lautenberg amendment and then, finally, an amendment I am going to offer following the disposition of the Lautenberg amendment. 
The McCain amendment which has been adopted now contains a provision I want to call attention to dealing with high-speed police pursuit. It is an issue I have been involved with for some 
long while. I care a great deal about it, and I have introduced legislation for a number of years, part of which has now been included in the McCain amendment dealing with safety. 
There are in this country many instances in which high-speed police pursuits are not only necessary but virtually mandatory, and I understand that. There are other circumstances in this country, where high-speed police pursuits are inappropriate and result in the death of innocent people. Nearly 400 people a year are killed and many others are injured in high-speed police pursuits. 
One ought to be able to expect all across this country, no matter where one is driving, that law enforcement jurisdictions are given good training and have good policies dealing with high-speed police pursuits. That is my intention with the legislation. 
I also feel that I would like to do more. I would like to make sure that in the future, with respect to high-speed police pursuits, that we have a provision that anyone who believes they should be able to flee from law enforcement when law enforcement attempts to apprehend them will lose their vehicle and will have certain jail time. We ought to send the message to all people in this country that you are the villain in high-speed police pursuits. If you don't stop when a law enforcement officer attempts to stop you, there are going to be consequences, and significant consequences. We can save lives by that. And the McCain amendment just adopted includes my provision dealing with high-speed police pursuits and incentives for more training and uniform policies. I think that is a step forward. 
Second, the Lautenberg amendment, which I am pleased to support, and I hope will have the support of a majority of Members in the U.S. Senate. I understand that some can quibble here or there about .08 or .10 or .12--this, that, or the other thing. I do not think anyone will quibble with the statement made earlier today by one of my colleagues in which he asked the question: Would you like to put your son or daughter in a car with someone who had four drinks in the last hour and has a .08 blood alcohol content? 
Under current law, that person is not drunk. But is that the car you would like your son or daughter in? I think not. Mr. President, .08, I am told, relates to the blood alcohol content of a man roughly 170 pounds who has had four drinks in an hour. 
In this country, we license people to drive. No one in this country should be empowered to drive and drink at the same time. It can turn an automobile into an instrument of murder and does every 30 minutes, causing someone else to die on America's roads and streets because someone decided to drink alcohol and drive. 
We have had incentive programs previously dealing with drunk driving. Some have worked, some have worked a bit, some have worked well, and some have not worked at all. The Senator's amendment is very simple. The proposition of this amendment is to say that our road programs in this country are national programs. We know they are national because we come here and talk about roads being a national priority. Even the smallest, the most remote, and the least populated areas of our country have roads because those roads allow people to get from one place to another. 
Yes, my State is a smaller State, and less populated, but as they move frozen shrimp and fresh fish from coast to coast, guess what? They truck that through North Dakota, and we need roads in all parts of our country to have a first-class economy. A country with a first-class economy needs good infrastructure, and that means good roads. 
Because roads represent a national priority and are a national program, it seems to me perfectly logical to understand that anyone driving in this country ought to have some assurance that they are not going to run into someone coming down the other lane who is driving in a jurisdiction or a State where they are told it's OK to have .10 or .12. No one in this country should expect to meet someone at the next intersection, in the next State, or the next county where the driver is drinking. So I am going to support this amendment that calls for a national standard of .08. 
Let me tell you about the other amendment I am going to offer following this amendment, which I hope my colleagues will support as well. 
Mr. President, did you know there are five States in this country where you can put a fist around a bottle of whiskey and the other around the steering wheel, and you are perfectly legal? There is not one jurisdiction in America where that ought to be legal--not one city, one county, one township where it ought to be legal for anyone to get behind the wheel of a car and drink. Five States now allow that. 
Over 20 States allow, if not the driver to drink, the rest of the people in the car to have a party. They can get plenty of whiskey and plenty of beer, and they can go down the road and have a great old party. Over 20 States say that is fine, as long as the driver doesn't drink, and in five of them the driver can drink as well. There is not one jurisdiction that ought to allow that. 
My amendment has the same sanction as the amendment proposed by the Senator from New Jersey. It simply says that every State in this country, because we have a national roads program, that as drivers, we can expect some uniformity in treatment across this country when we are driving up to the next intersection. We should expect that no one we will meet in this country is going to be legally empowered to drive the vehicle and drink in the same set of actions. 
I will offer that on the floor. I offered it previously several years ago, about 3 years ago, and I missed having that amendment adopted by three votes--only three. I don't know how many people have died because we didn't do that, but some. I don't know their names. But some families have gotten the call, families like the wonderful family of the Senator from Ohio and others in this Chamber, the Bumpers family--Senator Bumpers, who several years ago gave one of the most eloquent speeches on the floor of the Senate about the tragedy in his family. 
Families have gotten that call because we didn't do what we should do. We should, as a country, decide that there are certain and significant sanctions for those who drink and drive and that we can expect on a national basis that everywhere you go in America, everywhere you drive a car, you will not only have a .08 standard, but you will have some assurance that you are not going to meet at the next intersection or on the next county, State, or even township road someone who is drinking and driving. 
Someone said earlier today that you have a right to drive in this country, but you ought not to have a right to drive and drink. I attended a ceremony today that the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Ohio attended and heard the statement by a young woman who had just lost her 9-year-old daughter in the not-too-distant past. She spoke again of the tragedy that her family experienced because someone else decided they were going to drink and drive. 
To close this discussion, I want to say this. It is one thing for us to come to the floor of the Senate and talk about devoting resources, energy, and effort to try to do something about something we are not certain how to cure. This is not some mysterious illness for which we do not know the cure. We understand what causes these deaths, and we understand how to stop them. 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, God bless that organization and the people who every day in every way fight to make things better on this subject. And we have made some progress. We have made some improvement. But we can do much, much better. We are not near the standard that many of our European allies and our European neighbors have adopted on these issues, saying to people: `Understand this about drinking and driving. If you are going to be out and you have a vehicle, you better not be drinking, because the sanctions are tough. If you get picked up for drunk driving, you are in trouble.' 
That is what this country ought to say as well. Have a designated driver, take a taxi, do any range of things, but understand as a country that we take this seriously and we intend to do some things on the floor of this Senate in this piece of legislation to say to the American people: We care about this issue, and we can save lives in a thoughtful manner without abridging anyone else's right. 
I do not know who said it today--perhaps it was the Senator from Ohio--that you have a right to get drunk, I guess, in this country, but you do not have a right to get drunk and drive. That ought to be a message from the .08 amendment, and I hope from my amendment that follows, that this country says that to everyone living here and everyone intending to drive in the future. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am relieved, as are many of my colleagues, that the highway reauthorization bill is now on the floor of the Senate. I compliment the Senate majority leader, Senator Lott, for bringing this piece of legislation, which is so important to this country, to the floor for debate. Not only do I compliment and thank the Senate majority leader, I thank publicly the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, Senator Baucus from Montana, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, Senator Gramm from Texas, and so many others who have come to the floor of the Senate and who, prior to that time, have worked in the committees and subcommittees to produce a piece of legislation that I think is a very good and very important for this country. 
Again, I express my appreciation to all of those folks who I think have crafted a bill that continues to understand that roads and highways represent a national priority and represent a national need. 
There are some things in this country that we don't describe as a national need or a national priority. We decide that these are things that State and local governments make decisions on individually around the country. But there are some things that are national in scope. We decided some long while ago that if we were to be a world-class economy, we must have a first-class infrastructure, and we must have a nationwide network of roads over which we can move commerce and trade back and forth across the country. Roads that we can be proud of, roads that we keep maintained through the investment that we make in legislation like this. 
The difficulty that we have had over the years in constructing a highway program has been a disagreement among the various States about who should get what, and how much money should go to one State versus another for the investment in the infrastructure of roads and bridges. 
In the Senate, we have now constructed a piece of legislation that I think has an awfully good formula. It is a compromise, a compromise that has been worked out by not only Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, but Senator Chafee and so many others. This compromise, in my judgment, is fair and makes a great deal of sense for this country. 
It is my hope that the Senate, now having this piece of legislation on the floor, will move expeditiously to offer amendments, to consider amendments and get final passage. And then, hopefully, persuade the other body to do the same so that we can get to a conference and finally adopt a conference report on this important legislation. 
I am going to be offering an amendment, perhaps two amendments. I will not offer them at this moment, but I want to describe one of the amendments that I will offer to this piece of legislation. 
Not only is it important that we have good highways and good roads in this country, it is important that the roads be safe. This legislation deals with safety standards; it deals with highway safety programs and the investment necessary to educate the American people and to provide assistance to the States in that education process. 
One of the issues of safety in our country is the issue of drinking and driving. It is interesting that if you ask the question, `Have you been touched or affected, do you have a relative or an acquaintance that you know who has been killed by a drunk driver?' almost every American will raise their hand and say, `Yes, I know someone who has been killed by a drunk driver.' 
Every 30 minutes in this country someone else dies on this Nation's roads because of a drunk driver. Someone who took a drink, and then took a car out on a public highway and caused a death. Every 30 minutes another American dies on our roads because of drunk driving. 
My family has experienced that tragedy twice. The call that I received, like the calls that so many other Americans have received, to tell me that my mother had been killed by a drunk driver is a moment that I will never forget. 
My mother was driving home from a hospital at 9 o'clock in the evening in Bismarck, ND, traveling at about 25 miles an hour, about 4 blocks from home, and a drunk driver in a pickup truck, being pursued by the police, according to eyewitnesses, at about 80 to 100 miles per hour, on a city street, hit my mother's car. She was killed instantly. 
It took a long, long time for me to overcome the anger that I felt about that. I still today think of not only what a tragedy it was for our family to lose such a wonderful woman, but every time I pick up a newspaper and read a story or watch the television or listen to the radio news about another death on our highways caused by drunk drivers, stop when I hear it and understand again what a tragic, tragic thing it is. This not some mysterious disease for which we do not have a cure. We understand what causes these deaths. And we understand how to stop it. 
This country does not, regrettably, view drunk driving as do some other countries in the world. In Europe, if you drink and drive and are picked up under the influence of alcohol, the penalties are so severe that you don't want to think about them. So almost inevitably in Europe, whenever several people are out drinking, one person is not drinking because that is the person who drives. You cannot afford to drink and drive in some European countries. 
In this country, regrettably, for a long while, when someone was picked up for drunk driving, someone else would give them a knowing grin and a slap on the back, and say, `That's OK, Charlie.' Well, it is not OK. Organizations have developed in this country--Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and others--who began to raise an awareness, State by State, on these issues, that the carnage on American roads does not have to continue. 
But do you know that, despite all of the work that has been done and despite all of the efforts in the States, in the cities, and here in the U.S. Congress; do you know that there are States in this country where you can put one hand on the neck of a whiskey bottle and you can put your other hand on a set of car keys? You can slip behind the wheel of that car, put the key in, start the engine and drive off and drink from that whiskey bottle, and you are still perfectly legal? 
There are still States in this country, nearly a half a dozen of them, that do not prohibit drinking and driving. It is unforgivable, in my judgment, that anywhere in this country someone can legally drink alcohol while they drive down the roads. I do not want it to be legal for someone to be driving a vehicle and drinking. 
There are a couple of ways to stop that. One simple way is to describe, as a matter of Federal policy, with the incentives to make it stick, that there shall not be open containers of alcohol in vehicles anywhere in this country. 
I come from a State that already prohibits open containers of alcohol in vehicles. Most States do that. But many States do not. In fact, nearly half a dozen States not only allow open containers; they allow the driver to drink. I intend to offer an amendment to this piece of legislation that complements an amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia and others. That amendment would establish a .08 national uniform standard for determining who is under the influence of alcohol. 
I intend to offer a complementary amendment that says: In addition to that, in no State in this country shall we allow drivers to drink and drive at the same time and be perfectly legal. That ought not to exist on any road or at any intersection in this country's road system. 
Now, having said that, Mr. President, that is one issue that I obviously feel very strongly about. I feel strongly about that, not only because----

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the kind words of the Senator from Virginia. I know that my experience is not any different than the experience of so many other families in this country who have suffered the tragedy of death as a result of drunk drivers. 
I have worked for some long while, not only supporting the efforts of Mothers Against Drunk Driving all across this country, but worked to see if we cannot, in some way, effect public policy to say to the American people: `When you drink and drive, you can turn a vehicle into an instrument of murder. And we cannot allow that to continue to happen.' 
I just read the other day of someone in my State, regrettably, who was picked up for drunk driving for, I believe, the 13th or 14th time--14th time. The fact is, we must decide as a country that we will not tolerate drunk driving. It is not an insignificant event. It is not an infraction and is something to be considered seriously. It is in all too many instances something that causes the loss of life for someone else in this country. And we can do something about it. 
The important thing is to understand this is not some mysterious ailment for which there is no cure. We understand what happens on our highways, and during the period that I am standing on the floor, if averages hold up, another American will have been killed because some other American was drinking and got in a vehicle. 
Not only has the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, spoken a great deal about this, but Senator Bumpers, who lost his parents to a drunk driver, and others who have come to the floor when we have discussed this in the past understand the human toll and the tragedy of drunk driving. 
The legislation that comes to the floor now is a wonderful piece of legislation that not only contains much needed investments in our country's infrastructure and jobs and economic growth, but it also includes very 
important highway safety issues, which I know the Senator from Virginia and others have worked very hard on. Those safety issues are a critically important component of this piece of legislation. 
I will be happy to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from West Virginia for his generous statement. 
The Senator from Rhode Island was not in the Chamber when I complimented him for his work on the piece of legislation that is before the Senate, and I appreciate very much the work he has done. 
Let me finish the discussion for a moment on the drunk driving issue and the legislation that I will intend to offer. There are a couple of statistics that I think are important about this. The Senator from West Virginia described the circumstances with young people in this country. Drunk driving is killing a disproportionate number of young adults and youth in this country. In 1995, over 25,000 children under the age of 21 were injured because of drinking and driving. In 1995, while 30 percent of the driving population was between the age of 21 and 34, 50 percent of the fatalities and 50 percent of the drunk driving injuries were in that same group. That amounts to 6,760 deaths and 95,800 injuries. A couple of other statistics. Hard-core drunk drivers cost us thousands of lives and billions of dollars. Fifty-five percent of the drunk driving offenders, an estimated 790,000 each year, are repeat offenders. An estimated $33 billion in economic costs can be attributed to hard-core drunk drivers involved in alcohol-related traffic fatalities in 1995. 
I mentioned earlier, there are five States in which it is still legal to drink and drive at the same time. There are 22 States in which there are no open container restrictions. So there are nearly half of the States in this country that say it is just fine to have booze in your car, just go ahead and have some whiskey or beer and drive down the road, and it is just fine. That ought not to exist anywhere in this country. You ought to be able to drive on any road, any place in this country, at any time of the day, and not worry about whether the car you are meeting is going to cross the intersection has a passenger or a driver that is involved in drinking alcohol. You ought not to have to worry about that on any road in this country. We ought to be able to have some sort of uniform standard on this kind of issue. 
In 1996, the last year for which I have data from DOT, there were 17,272 alcohol-related traffic fatalities. One every half-hour. Now, we have made some progress. I mentioned Mothers Against Drunk Driving, an organization for which I have great respect. There has been much greater awareness of the drunk driving problem all across the country, and organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and others have pressed for tougher laws. The fact is fatalities have come down, but they are far too high all over this country. 
I mentioned a moment ago a North Dakota driver that the Bismarck Tribune, on the 13th of February of this year had an article, `Driver Tops North Dakota's Worst.' It lists North Dakota's 10 worst drunk drivers according to the Department of Transportation information. 
It says, Bismarck man fails to appear on the 11th drunk driving charge because he is in a South Dakota jail awaiting trial on the 12th drunk driving charge. A Bismarck man labeled the worst driver in North Dakota by driver's license officials missed trial Thursday on his 10th and 11th drunk driving charges. Why? He is in South Dakota, in jail, on another DUI arrest. 
Some might smile at that. This man, if he hasn't already, will kill someone. He will get drunk, get in a car, meet a family on the road and there will be dead people in his wake. Then no one will smile and everyone will understand the tragedy of it and ask 
why wasn't he prevented from being on the road. Why didn't someone lock this person up?

Mr. DORGAN. That is all too often the case. 
Let me read to you a letter that I received a while back from a woman named Brenda Olmsted from North Dakota. I mentioned my family's circumstances, the experience that we have had, the tragedy of death from a drunk driver. It has happened in family after family across this country. 
This young woman wrote to me, and I just want to read a portion of her letter. 
My name is Brenda Olmsted, and my life as well as many others was dramatically changed. My father and mother had just picked up my brother and myself from college and we were returning home to Watford City, ND. Our happiness of being reunited was shattered in an instant when we were struck by a drunk driver. My father was killed and my mother left in critical condition. . . . my brother and I were injured. This event took place just over a year ago but its memories are still very vivid and the effects are continuing. My mother is slowly recovering from a broken back that we have been told will never fully heal and bulging disks in her neck and various other serious injuries. She is slowly learning to cope with the permanent brain damage that has slowed down her thinking process. My brother is slowly struggling to overcome some traumas to the head as well as the terrors of the vivid memories of that night. My father was a pastor, which meant his job provided us with a house. With his death we not only lost a father (which hurts more than words can tell) but we also lost our home. 
I write this by no means to ask for a hand out but instead to ask that you do all you can to make the penalties against drunk driving as strict as possible. 
Most of us have seen the public service advertisements on television about drunk driving, and most of the advertisements we see these days from nonprofit organizations are of some wonderful people--in many instances children--on a video camera. Then we learn after 15 or 20 seconds of the video that this is a young child who was killed in a drunk driving accident. 
Let me again reiterate that we can prevent many of these accidents if we as a country decide to treat drunk driving differently, if we get serious about dealing with this issue. One amendment which is going to be offered to this legislation deals with a national standard of .08 blood alcohol content. The other, I hope, will be a prohibition of open containers of alcohol in vehicles across this country. 
Mr. President, I have spoken longer than I intended. I appreciate the contribution of the Senator from West Virginia, as well as the contribution of the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner. I look forward to coming back to the floor and offering my amendment. Again, I hope very much that we will move quickly with this piece of legislation. 
Let me finish, as I started, by complimenting Senator Lott, the majority leader, for bringing this legislation to the floor now. I commit, and I hope my colleagues will, as well, to work in a very serious way to move this legislation along as quickly as possible and get it to conference so we can finally pass a highway bill and provide some certainty about highway investment and safety programs in this country's future. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation I am introducing to address a significant air pollution problem we have in this country. 
No, I'm not talking about smog, or acid rain, or the ozone layer, I'm talking about broadcast air pollution. And by that I mean the 30-second, slash-and-burn, hit-and-run political ad that does nothing but cut down an opponent. 
Can you think of any other business in this country that sells its wares only by tearing down the opposition? Do airlines ask you to consider their services because their competitors' mechanics are unreliable, and try to conjure up images of plane crashes to get you to switch carriers? Do car manufacturers sell their products by raising dark, misleading doubts about the safety of their competitors' autos? Does McDonald's run ads raising the threat of E-coli bacteria in Burger King's hamburgers? 
Of course not, but that's precisely the way we compete in politics against each other. 
It is a pretty sad state of affairs when the American people get a more informative and dignified discussion about the soda they drink or the fast food restaurant they prefer than they do in the debate about what choices to make for our country's future. It is time to do something about it. 
We cannot and should not attempt to limit speech. But there is something we can do to provide the right incentives. Under current law, television stations are required to offer the lowest unit rate to political candidates for television advertising within 45 days of a primary election, and within 60 days of a general election. 
The legislation I am proposing today would change that law to provide that the low rate must be made available only to candidates who run ads that are at least one minute in length, in which the candidate appears at least 75 percent of the time. 
Now I want to be clear on one point. Candidates can still run any ad they desire. They can continue to scorch the earth with their `hit-and-run' ads to their heart's content. But they will not get the lowest rate unless the two conditions are met. If federal law can require broadcasters to offer the lowest unit rate for all political advertising, there's no reason we cannot place some content-neutral restrictions on the discount, in order to improve the quality of political discourse in this country. 
How would my proposal improve the debate? It is my hope that by offering incentives for longer ads, candidates will discuss their positions on issues in greater detail. Certainly the 30-second political attack ad does little, if anything, to inform the public about the issues and advance the debate. And by appearing in the commercials, candidates will be more accountable to the voters for what their ads say, and will likely be more responsible about their content. 
When selecting their leaders, the American people deserve better than a `hit and run' debate. Let us do something about it. 
I would like to conclude by saying that it is still very much my hope that Congress will succeed in passing meaningful, comprehensive campaign finance reform this year. I am a co-sponsor of McCain-Feingold, and it is very much my hope that this legislation is passed by Congress and signed by the President. Although it is not perfect, it will address many of the abuses of the current system, most notably the problem of unregulated `soft money' pouring into our political process through ever-widening cracks in the law. Passing McCain-Feingold would help to restore the American people's eroding confidence in the way we run campaigns in this country. 
But whether Congress succeeds in passing comprehensive reform or not, I believe this legislation would be a modest but worthwhile step towards making the political debate in this country more civil, more informative and more meaningful to the American people. I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I gather that the previous discussion was about the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, but it was very difficult to connect. I gathered from the discussion that at least one Member came out in favor of free speech and the first amendment of the Constitution. Perhaps two Members did. I expect we could sign up the other 98. But that has as much relationship to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment as discussing how to make an apple pie. It doesn't have any relationship at all. 
This is not about free speech. This is not about free speech at all. This is about disclosure, and the question propounded by the Senator from Maine with her amendment is, why are we afraid of disclosure? Why not ask people who want to interfere with and invest in Federal elections that they disclose who they are and how 
much money they are investing in Federal elections? That is what the question is. 
So then I ask those of you who are opposed to this, what are you afraid of? Why not disclose it? What is wrong with disclosure? This amendment doesn't say you can't contribute, you can't raise soft money, you can't do issue advocacy. It doesn't say that at all. It says you must disclose who you are and what you are spending. What is wrong with that? 
Yesterday I mentioned that Mark Twain was once asked to join in a debate. He said, `Fine, as long as I can take the opposing side.' They said, `We didn't tell you what the subject was.' He said, `It doesn't matter. The negative side doesn't require any preparation.' 
We are on the floor of the Senate, proposing to reform the campaign finance system in this country because it is broken and needs fixing. Those who think it is not broken, look at the record. Look at the statistics. Look at the data. 
Let me show a chart that describes an interesting comparison, the number of voters versus the number of dollars in American politics. The number of dollars goes up and the voting participation goes down in this country. You think there is not something wrong with this system? I mentioned yesterday that soft money, a problem that is dealt with in the McCain-Feingold bill and also in the amendment that is before us today--soft money is the political equivalent of a Swiss bank. Soft money is the mechanism by which you create secrecy for contributions, unlimited quantity, that come into campaigns to interfere with Federal elections. It has become the legal form of cheating in American politics. 
The amendment before us says let us require disclosure, let us require disclosure in certain circumstances. The underlying bill says let us ban soft money in other circumstances, but it has nothing to do with free speech. Nothing. 
Let me read a couple of things, if I might. Here is a so-called issue ad from a group that was formed very close to an election. This ad ran 2 weeks before a general election. It was paid for from a $1.7 million pot of money, almost all of it raised 3 weeks before the election. It came from eight deposits. Eight deposits created a $1.7 million pot of money spent in the last couple of weeks before the election. Here is what they said: `Can we trust candidate X?' They used the name. Let me say Thompson, just hypothetically. `Can we trust candidate Thompson? The ad says Thompson `has been criticized as inefficient and disorganized by the county auditor,' and that he was `accused of Medicare fraud by a home health care worker from his family business. Call Thompson and tell him to support ethics in government.' 
That is an issue ad? It's not an issue ad. This is an ad designed specifically to defeat candidate Thompson, paid for by a $1.7 million pot of money collected in eight deposits from secret donors. I ask those who stand up and say things are just fine on campaign finance reform, do you support this? Is this a legal form of cheating you think is fine in campaign finance reform? Does anybody here stand up and support this? Anybody? I guess not. 
So, another one: $700,000 from a wealthy individual who calls up a 501(c)(4) organization and says, `I want to spend $700,000.' But he doesn't want any fingerprints on it, so he calls up the political equivalent of the Swiss bank and says, `I want secrecy.' And $700,000 magically disappears into in a political Swiss bank and then the ads go out. The ads run just weeks before an election, targeted to defeat candidates, called `issue ads.' Not issue ads, cheating; $700,000 from one person designed to try to defeat candidates and get around Federal election rules. 
Mr. President, $1.8 million was formed by a group that was formed on paper in October 1996. One wealthy donor gave $100,000 to buy negative ads attacking one specific Congressman in the closing weeks of the campaign; 12 deposits put together $1.8 million to be used for these so-called issue ads that represent the form of political cheating that is going on in this country. 
Again, it is the political equivalent of the Swiss bank: Put 
together soft money in large quantities, go out and target and try to defeat people, call them issue ads, and essentially get around the Federal election laws. 
Do you think this is the way the system ought to work? Do you think this is just fine? If you think this is fine, then I guess you ought to try to defeat campaign finance reform. And some are trying to do that. I don't question their motives or honesty. They, I think, honestly believe the system is fine, that this is about money being speech. If you have more money, you have freer speech, apparently. And some people have more money than others, so, I guess they apparently are better able to speak in this country. 
But that is not what the Constitution is about. At least in this system we have said that there ought to be reasonable restrictions and regulations on the financing of Federal elections. And if you believe that these examples are examples that just fit well within the frame of what we think a reasonable campaign finance system is, then you are about a century behind where we ought to be. 
We have already made a decision in this country. We don't want people with $2 million to hide behind a veil of secrecy and say, `By the way, with my $2 million I want to go out and find these two candidates and I want to undercut them with $2 million worth of advertisements and I don't want my fingerprints on it. I don't want anybody ever to know that I did it, but I want to defeat these two candidates.' Until these smart campaign lawyers came up with these loopholes, Federal law said you can't do that. But the soft money loophole says there is a new way around these laws, and that is what is creating, I think, the disrespect for the current campaign finance system that requires us to take action here in the Congress. No, not to abridge free speech, but to require, as this amendment does, full disclosure. 
Let one Member of the Senate stand up and tell me an answer to this question. Why are we afraid of full disclosure? Do we want to protect the person who took $700,000 and wrote a check and says, `I want to defeat this person and that person and I don't want my fingerprints on it'? Is that why we oppose full disclosure? 
What on Earth would be wrong with requiring full disclosure in the circumstances described by Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords? Who can stand up on the floor of the Senate and say that is a step in the wrong direction? 
It seems to me it is a giant step in the right direction. For this Congress to do nothing, as some on this Senate floor want us to do, I think would be a travesty. Anyone who looks at this system understands the system is broken. Soft money is growing by leaps and bounds. The first 6 months of this year tripled the first 6 months of 2 cycles ago. 
Soft money is growing by leaps and bounds, and everyone knows that it is the way around the current campaign finance system. Some say, incidentally, there is not enough money in politics. They have a right to say that. I understand that. They are so dead wrong. There is too much money in politics, and what this amendment and what the underlying bill does is to say, let us decide that there needs to be some rational approach to putting back together again a set of rules on financing Federal elections that give people some confidence that these are elections and not auctions. 
Again, the political equivalent of the Swiss bank in American politics is exactly what Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords are attempting to deal with in this amendment. 
Would I have written this amendment differently? Yes, I would have. I think they left out a couple of things, and I would have written it differently. I support this amendment, because I want this Congress to pass campaign finance reform, and this is a step to allow us to get to a vote to do that. 
I come here today happy to support the effort that Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords have made on the floor of the Senate. I have listened to their debate. They have been forceful and persuasive. 
Frankly, I am surprised to come and listen to a discussion about the first amendment, free speech. It has nothing to do with free speech. Come and trade recipes, come and ruminate about baseball. It has as much to do about this amendment as the discussion of free speech a moment ago. Nothing Senator Snowe is proposing and nothing in the underlying bill, in my judgment, impinges free speech. 
I think those who have proposed the McCain-Feingold bill and those who propose this amendment do this country a service by saying the current system is broken and we can do a better job in creating rules of campaign finance that will give people in this country more confidence in this system. 
I thank very much the Senator from Maine for providing me this time. I hope very much the Senate will not only support her amendment, but we will go on from that point and pass the underlying bill. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation that will exempt licensed pharmacists from the Medicare surety bond requirement imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for suppliers of durable medical equipment (DME). I am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by Senators Johnson, Conrad, and Daschle. 
Let me say right off that I understand and generally support the rationale behind the surety bond requirement. This will be an important new tool for the Health Care Financing Administration to prevent Medicare fraud and abuse by raising the threshold for participating in Medicare and thereby helping to ensure that only legitimate medical suppliers participate. I am sure we have all heard the horror stories about some of the scams uncovered by the HHS Office of Inspector General, in which businesses with no employees and no actual physical location were billing Medicare for unneeded services and supplies. It was these kinds of `fly-by-night' operations that the surety bond is intended to weed out, and I certainly support this goal. 
I do not, however, think it makes sense to apply this requirement to pharmacists, who are already licensed and heavily regulated by the states, and I do not believe that was Congress' intention. Pharmacists are highly skilled health care providers who are licensed by the states, and the pharmacies they operate are also licensed and regularly inspected by state boards of pharmacy. Clearly, pharmacists are not the kind of fly-by-night business owners the surety bond was aimed at. 
Congress already exempted physicians and other health care practitioners from the surety bond requirement, but HCFA has determined that this exemption does not extend to pharmacists since they do not typically bill Medicare for the services they provide. My legislation would simply ensure that pharmacists receive the same treatment as other licensed health care practitioners for purposes of the DME surety bond requirement. 
Without this legislation, older Americans stand to lose access to needed durable medical equipment and prescription drugs. Pharmacies are reputable and convenient providers of medical equipment, and in many rural areas, they are the only local medical suppliers. In addition, since HCFA now requires that prescription drugs covered by Medicare be purchased from a pharmacy, driving pharmacies out of Medicare will reduce patient access not only to medical equipment but also to prescription drugs. 
Pharmacies dropping out of the Medicare program is not an unjustifiable fear; it may be an economic reality. For the vast majority of pharmacies, providing durable medical equipment constitutes less than 10 percent of their total business. Yet, they provide this service for the convenience of their Medicare customers. If required to purchase even the minimum surety bond of $50,000, pharmacists have told me they will be forced to drop out of the Medicare program because it would actually cost them money to participate. For instance, in an informal survey of North Dakota pharmacists, 75 percent did less than $5,000 in business annually as a Medicare supplier, and not coincidentally, 70 percent said they would have to drop out of Medicare if they must purchase a surety bond.

Mr. DORGAN. I thank the minority leader for yielding for a question. So that those who watch these proceedings and listen to these proceedings understand, is it not the case that a procedure, a rarely used procedure until recently, has been used today that is designed to block legislation, that creates shackles and handcuffs designed in a way to lock the legislation up so it can't move? 
We were, as I recall, promised some long while ago that we would be able to consider campaign finance reform legislation on the floor of the Senate. So, a date was set, a time for a vote was set, and the legislation came to the floor of the Senate, at which time we discover that, although we have a first vote on a tabling motion, following that vote, this procedure, throughout its history always used to block legislation, is immediately employed. 
The implication of that, I guess, is that there is not a 
desire to proceed to consider, fully consider campaign finance reform. Many in this Chamber have other amendments they wish to offer, have considered and have votes on. It appears to me that the procedure now employed by the majority leader is to say, `Yes, I brought it to the floor; yes, you had one tabling vote, and from now on we will do it the way I want to do it.' As the Senator from South Dakota said, the majority leader expressed, `I filled up the tree and we will allow only amendments that I will allow in the future.' It seems to me that is not an approach that is designed to allow consideration of campaign finance reform. 
I ask the Senator from South Dakota, was it your understanding when we had an agreement on this issue that campaign finance reform would be brought to the floor of the Senate for a debate and for the opportunity to offer amendments and to consider fully and have votes on issues related to that subject?

Mr. DORGAN. For one additional question. I mentioned in my initial question to the Senator from South Dakota, this is a rarely used approach. It is true that this approach has been used by the majority leader a couple of times last year, but in history, it has been rarely used in the Senate. And the reason is, it is almost exclusively used to block legislation, but it is never successful, because you can block someone by tying legislation up in chains and shackles now and preventing anybody from offering an amendment, but you can't prevent that forever. You have to bring legislation to the floor of the Senate at some point which, according to the rules of the Senate, will allow another Senator to stand up and offer an amendment to such legislation. 
In my judgment, this is very counterproductive. Some in this Chamber want to dig their heels in and say, `Notwithstanding what the majority wants to do in this Chamber, we intend to block campaign finance reform.' You can block the right of Members to offer amendments now if you use this rarely used procedure, but you can't block people here forever from doing what we want to do, and that is have a full and good debate on campaign finance reform, offer amendments and have votes on those amendments. 
I don't think the American people are going to be denied on this issue. The American people know this system is broken, it needs fixing, and they want this Congress and this Senate to do something about it. We can temporarily tie it up in these legislative chains, but that is not going to last forever, and I think that simply delays the final consideration of this issue.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Kentucky, let me say the point still stands. I ask the Senator from Kentucky to do a little research and tell me whether in all of those instances, where he described the so-called filling of the 
tree, whether someone came to the floor of the Senate and tried to fill the legislative tree or create a set of chains beyond which the Senate could not work before filing a cloture motion and allowing the votes on amendments on an issue. I do not think he will find that circumstance existed. 
He pointed out a number of occasions when the legislative approach was used. I said it is rarely used. I stand by that. But it is almost never used in a circumstance where prior to a cloture vote and prior to allowing amendments to be offered and voted, someone comes out here and ties the legislative system up with these chains and shackles. That has not been the case. And so we ought not to suggest this is some normal procedure that has been used on occasion over the years by both sides. 
The point I make is this. This is not a partisan issue. There are Republicans that support campaign finance reform and Democrats who support campaign finance reform. In fact, there is a majority of the Members of this body that support campaign finance reform and if we can have a vote up or down on final passage in some reasonable form on campaign finance reform, it is going to pass. It is what the American people want and it is what this Congress ought to do. 
The Senator from Kentucky appropriately said that there is a 60-vote issue in the Senate. And I understand that. That is what the rules provide. But it is extraordinary and it is unusual before a vote on cloture or vote on amendments with the exception of one for somebody to come out and say we are going to tie this whole system up and we are going to use a procedure that is always used to block legislation. 
I say, we ought to let the American people have their day on the floor of the Senate. And their day is a day in which the Senate recognizes that this system needs reforming, this system needs changing. And if we debate between Republicans and Democrats and find a set of proposals, starting with McCain-Feingold, which I support, concluding perhaps with Snowe-Jeffords, which I also will support, and perhaps with some additional amendments, we will, I think, find an approach for campaign finance reform that, while not perfect, certainly does improve campaign finance in this country. 
You cannot, in my judgment, stand here today and say, `Gee, the current system works really well. This is really a good system.' The genesis of this system starts in 1974, with the campaign finance reform legislation in 1974. The system has been changed somewhat over the years by virtue of court decisions and rule changes, and also by some of the smartest legal minds in our country trying to figure out how you get campaign money under the door and over the transom and into the campaign finance system. The rules have now been mangled and distorted so badly that the system just does not work. 
And if you have a system that is not working, it seems to me our responsibility is to say: Let's fix it. And, by the way, despite many attempts to muddy the waters on this, we are not saying: Let's fix it in a way that denies anyone a voice in this system or attempts to shut anyone down or any group down. 
The McCain-Feingold bill, in my judgment, is a very reasonable approach to addressing the abuses and the problems in the current campaign finance system. 
The Snowe-Jeffords proposal, which I will support, is one that falls short of what I would like--I would like to expand its reach, and prefer the issue advocacy approach in the original McCain-Feingold. 
Senator Snowe is on the floor and prepared to speak to that amendment. Will her proposal advance us towards a better system? Yes, it will. So let us decide that we can be more than just roadblocks. I mean, the easiest thing in the world is to be a roadblock to something. I think it was Mark Twain who once said, when he was asked if he would be willing to debate an issue, `Of course, providing I'm on the negative side.' 
They said, `You don't even know the subject.' 
He said, `It doesn't matter. It doesn't take any time to prepare for the negative side.' 
It is always easy to be against something. 
So I hope, as we go along, the majority leader and others will think better of a strategy that says we allowed you to bring it to the floor, but we are not going to allow a full and free debate and votes on amendments. I hope he will think better of that, because there isn't a way, in the long run, to shut off our opportunity to thoughtfully consider this legislation, and to prevent our ability to offer amendments. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois said much of what I would like to say. I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, on this issue. 
We had a lot of hearings last year about campaign finance reform: 31 days of hearings, 240 depositions, about 50 public witnesses, $3.5 million, 87 staff people. We learned about all kinds of abuses with soft money and attack ads thinly disguised as issue advertising. 
Well, here we have on the floor of the Senate today a piece of legislation that says, `Let us reform the system we have for financing campaigns.' 
One of the important pieces of this reform, the centerpole for the tent, in my judgment, is the ban on soft money. Now, what is soft money? People who are not involved in political campaigns may not know what this term soft money means. It is the political equivalent of a Swiss bank account. Soft money is like a Swiss bank account. It is where somebody takes money that is often secret, from an undisclosed source, with nobody knowing where it comes from, how much is there, how it got there, and it is used over here in some other device, ostensibly to help the political system and not to be involved in Federal elections. But what we now know from the range of campaigns that have gone on in recent years is soft money is a legalized form of cheating that has been used to affect Federal campaigns all across this country. 
The total amount of soft money raised is on the rise. In the first 6 months of the 1993-1994 political cycle, $13 million; the first 6 months of the 1997-1998 cycle, $35 million. It is going up, up, way up. 
Some say there is not a problem of campaign finance and we don't need a reform. Take a look at this political inflation index. At a time when wages have risen 13 percent in 4 years, education spending rose 17 percent, the spending on politics in this country rose 73 percent. There is too much money in politics. 
Some say money is speech and we like free speech. That is the political golden rule. I guess those who have the gold make the rules. 
I suppose if I was part of a group that had a lot more money than anybody else I suppose there would be an instinct deep inside to try to persuade you to say this situation is great. We not only have more money but we have access to more money than anyone else in the history of civilization. Why would we want to change the rules? We ought to change the rules because this system is broken and everybody in this country knows it and understands it. 
Let me go through some examples to describe what is happening in this system. And both political parties have had problems in these areas, both parties. Let me give one example. In 1996, $4.6 million of soft money went from the Republican National Committee to an organization called Americans for Tax Reform, $4.6 million. This soft money, then, comes from contributors whose identities are often unknown--they often do not need to be disclosed--contributing money in amounts that would be prohibited under our federal election laws, to influence a Federal election. $4.6 million from a major political party to this organization, Americans for Tax Reform. That was four times the total budget of this organization in the previous year. 
How was the money spent, this soft money raised in large undisclosed chunks from sources in many cases prohibited from trying to spend money to influence Federal elections? How was it used? To influence Federal elections, 150 of them, to be precise--17 million pieces of mail to 150 congressional districts. 
You say the system isn't broken? Mr. President, $4.6 million? This is the equivalent of a political Swiss bank account. Large chunks of money, blowing into the system to a group that never has to disclose what it does with it. 
And what about the issue ads which Senator Durbin mentioned as well? These issue ads--are they ads that contribute to this political process? Eighty-one percent of them are negative. They represent the slash, burn and tear faction of the political system. Get money, get it in large chunks from secret sources and put some issue ads on someplace and try to tear somebody down. 
Let's discuss one group, and one ad in particular. Look at this scenario. 
The Citizens for Republic Education Fund is a tax-exempt organization incorporated June 20, 1996, that raised more than $2 million between June and the end of the year in this election year--$1.8 million of which was raised between October 1 and November 15. They spent $1.7 million after October 11 and before the election in a matter of a couple of weeks. Remember, these funds are not intended to influence Federal elections, but here's all 
this money being spent in just three weeks before the election. 
You be the judge. Consider the following, and then you tell me whether these were intended to influence a Federal election. The vast majority of the money was spent after October 11 in an election year. The group didn't come into existence until June of the election year. The group never had any committees or programs, had no offices, no staff, no chairs, no desks and no telephones. All it had was millions of dollars to pump into attack ads. 
The ads did not advocate on behalf of any one set of issues. Instead, the ads were almost universally tailored to a particular unfavored candidate's perceived flaws, just like any campaign attack ad would be. In fact, you could ask whether they advocate any issues at all. 
Let me turn to a so-called issue ad. 
Senate [Candidate X] budget as Attorney General increased 71 percent. [Candidate X] has taken taxpayer funded junkets to the Virgin Islands, Alaska and Arizona, and spent about $100,000 on new furniture. Unfortunately, as the State's top law enforcement official, he's never opposed the parole of a convicted criminal, even rapists and murders. And almost 4,000 prisoners have been sent back to prison for crimes committed while they were out on parole. [Candidate X]: Government waste, political junkets, soft on crime. Call [Candidate X] and tell him to give the money back. 
A political ad, paid for with soft money from a political Swiss bank account. It's like a Swiss bank account because it is from a secret source, designed to be used to create attack ads, to be used at election time to influence Federal elections, something that, frankly, is supposed to be prohibited by law. But this has now become the legalized form of cheating. In fact, we are not even sure it is legal, but it is being done all across this country and it is being done with big chunks of secret money. 
In fact, one secret donor put up, I'm told, $700,000 to spend on so-called issue ads to influence federal campaigns. We don't even know for certain the identity of that person. And that soft money, that big chunk of money prohibited from ever affecting Federal races was used in this kind of advertising to directly try and influence Federal campaigns. 
Now, I just ask the question, is there anyone here who will stand in the Senate with a straight face and say that this isn't cheating? Anyone here who will stand with a straight face and say this isn't designed to affect a Federal election? Anybody think this is fine? Go to a friend someplace that has $40 million and say, will you lend us $1 million, we have these two folks we don't like--one in one State up north and one in a State down south. We want to put half a million into each State and defeat them because they happen to be of a political persuasion we don't like, and we don't want them serving in the U.S. Senate. If you give us $1 million we will package it in two parts, half a million into each State. Your name will never be used. No one will know you did it. We will package up these kind of 30-second slash, tear and burn political ads and claim they are issue ads and they can be paid for with soft money. 
Does anybody in this body believe this is a process that the American people ought to respect? That this is a process the American people think makes sense? Do we really believe that money is equal to speech and that anything that we would do to change the amount and kind of money spent in the pursuit of any campaign is somehow inhibiting the political process? 
I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

Mr. DORGAN. I do want to make a couple of final points here. We can decide to do one of two things in this Senate on this day or 
this week. We can decide that campaign finance system in this country is just fine, that nothing is wrong with it, that we like the way it works. We can say that we think it has the respect of the American people, that we think this sort of nonsense that goes on is just fine and perfectly within the rules, that we think that the growth of soft money, the growth of spending in campaigns in this country is wonderful. We can say we think this explosion in political money reflects the American people's determination to acquire more and more speech, and that we think the American people believe, as some would say, that this system works just fine. 
Or we can decide that something smells in campaign finance, that something is wrong with campaign financing in this country, that we see the costs of political campaigns are skyrocketing up, up, way up because we have people who believe they can take secret money and now use it to buy elections. We can decide something is horribly wrong with that, and we can decide that we know the American people know there is something horribly wrong with that. We can decide that it is in our province to do something about it, now, today, this week, this month. We in Congress can do something about this. We can do something about it without hurting free expression anywhere in this country, and anywhere in our political system. No one who supports reform wants to restrict free speech in this country, nor should we do that. But we can decide that this system is out of control, that this system disserves our democratic process, and that we must pursue a better way. 
Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have proposed a piece of legislation. Is it perfect? No, it is not. But it is a good piece of legislation. I am a cosponsor. I want this Congress to pass that piece of legislation this week, have the House pass it, get to conference and pass a piece of campaign finance reform that will make the American people proud.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the presentation by Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, on the subject of the highway bill and his desire, and the desire of so many others in this Chamber, to see that the piece of legislation that authorizes spending on highways and roads, the building and repairing of our country's infrastructure, be brought to the floor of the Senate, be debated and go to conference so that we can get this bill done and tell the Governors and the other people in this country who are waiting for this Congress to do its work that we have finally finished the job. This is not some idle piece of legislation that either may or may not be enacted into law. The Congress has a responsibility to deal with the issues of this country's infrastructure, especially bridges and roads and safety on our highways, and all of those issues are in the body of this legislation. 
This legislation was supposed to have been enacted by this Congress last year. Now we are told by some that last year's business must wait until we have considered next year's budget. That is preposterous. We should bring that bill to the floor now. We were told it would be the first item of business on the Senate calendar when we reconvened in January. It was not. Today we will take up campaign finance reform. I am pleased that we are going to do that. But we should take up, expeditiously, the highway bill, debate it and pass it and get it to conference. 
The highway bill, investing in our country's infrastructure, is about jobs, economic expansion, retaining and creating a first-class transportation system. For a first-class economy to exist, it must have a first-class transportation system, and that is what this issue is about. Every day, people pull up to the gas pumps and put some gasoline in their automobiles. When they do so, they pay money, through a tax on every gallon of that gasoline, that goes into a trust fund that is to be used in the highway bill that we are required to authorize. The taxes are already paid. The question is, will we use that money to invest in this country's bridges and roads? Those who are driving around this country know there is plenty yet to do. There is a big job ahead of us, and the quicker we get this legislation out of the Congress the better for this country. 
So, I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Montana, the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, and others who have repeatedly come to the floor of the Senate saying this is not a partisan issue, this is not about parties; this is about 
investment in our country and that we finish the work we didn't get done last year and bring this important piece of legislation to the floor and pass it as soon as possible.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to turn just for a moment to the issue of campaign finance reform which we will take up this afternoon at 3 p.m. This is an issue, also, that was discussed some last year and, by agreement, is to be brought to the floor of the Senate this afternoon. Since our last discussion on this issue, I want to call my colleagues' attention to two pieces of information in the newspaper dealing with the two special elections to the Congress that have been held in the interim period. One was in New York, a special election to fill a vacancy in New York. It says: 
RNC [Republicans National Committee] Invests Heavily in `Issue' Attack Ads; $800,000 spent in New York House race. 
It's not hard to figure out who won this race. Mr. President, $800,000 of outside money called `issue ads,' unregulated by the current rules on campaign finance--corporate money, unlimited quantities of money from any given source stuck into a big pot and then sent into a district by a political party. And it is declared, under current circumstances and with current court decisions, that this is not a part of the investment in those races. This nearly $1 million, with other funds included, was brought into the system in the form of issue ads--sham ads that were clearly direct 30-second advertisements expressly waged for one purpose, and that was to attack and destroy a candidate of the other party. 
This was done, by the way, with a legal form of cheating made possible by today's campaign finance law and current court decisions permitting issue ads, not so thinly disguised, to be waged in unlimited quantity using unlimited corporate money, unlimited individual money and undisclosed so that no one, no one in this country, will discover where the money came from. That is what is wrong with this current system. 
We just had more recently a race in California. Same result; different amounts. Two different groups, large amounts of money coming into so-called issue advertising. Do they have a right to do this? Yes, they do. But do they have a right to wage advertisements in political campaigns with money that can come in huge blocks donated by corporations or very wealthy people to the tune of $50,000, $100,000 or $500,000 and then go into a State and use it in a political race in a Federal election and never have to disclose where the money came from? I don't think that's fair. 
If anybody on the floor of the Senate, given what we have seen in the recent races in this country, can stand and say, `Gee, campaign finance reform, there's nothing wrong here, things are just fine,' if anybody can honestly stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say things are just fine, we have no problems with campaign finance reform, I submit that they have not watched what is happening around the country. 
We passed a piece of campaign finance reform legislation in 1974, and the rules since 1974 have been bent and twisted and people have gone under them and over them, and the result now, not only because of what has happened with those rules but also because of some court decisions, is that we have a campaign finance system in total chaos. 
I come to the floor today to support the McCain-Feingold bill which will be voted on this week by the U.S. Senate. We have some Members of the Senate who have stood and said, `We intend to filibuster; we don't think that anything should be passed by the Congress; we believe anything that Congress does limits someone else's speech.' And, in effect, I guess they are saying there ought not be any rules. 
We are told somehow that money is speech in politics: The more money you have, the more speech you have, the more you are able to speak. Some of us believe that there ought to be in politics campaign finance reform that begins to set some reasonable limits on what kind of money is spent in political campaigns. We think that the current regime of campaign finance is just completely spiraling out of control, and we think the McCain-Feingold bill, while not perfect, is a good piece of legislation for this Congress to enact. 
Mr. President, I also intend to offer, if I am allowed in the context of these debates, one additional piece of legislation I would like to mention just for a moment. Federal law currently provides that all television stations must offer candidates for Federal office the lowest rate on their advertising rate card for commercials for a certain amount of time preceding the election. To repeat, under current law, we say candidates are entitled to the lowest rate on the rate card for political advertising for a certain period prior to the election. 
Everyone has a right to put on the air what they wish to put on the air about their opponent. In politics, unlike most other forms of competition, the normal discourse is to say, `There's my opponent. Look at what an awful person that opponent is. Let me tell you 18 awful things about my opponent.' Is that the way you see airlines advertise? `Look at my competing airline over here. Let me tell you about how awful they are, how awful their maintenance record is.' I don't think so. Is that the way automobile companies advertise? No. It is the way people in politics advertise because it has worked. 
My point is this. I am going to offer an amendment that says we will change the Federal law that requires the lowest rate on the rate card for the 60 days prior to elections. We will say that the television stations are required to offer that lowest rate only to 
television commercials that are 1 minute in length and only in circumstances where the candidate appears on the commercial 75 percent of the time. 
Why do I do that? Because I would like candidates to start taking some ownership of their commercials instead of the 30-second slash-and-burn commercial that the candidate never appears on. Oh, everybody has a right to continue to run those. However, we are not required, in my judgment, to tell television studios they must offer the lowest rate for these kinds of ads. 
Air pollution in this country is a problem. We have been concerned about air pollution for some long while. One form of air pollution in this country is the kind of political commercial that has been very successful. I don't deign to suggest now we can ban it. We can't. Free speech in this country and free political speech allows anybody to do anything they want in their campaigns in a 30- or 60-second ad. 
But I believe we ought to give an incentive for those who put commercials on the air during political campaigns that say to the American people, `Here's what I stand for, here's what I believe, here's what I want to fight for as we debate the future of this country,' in which the candidate himself or herself asserts positions that they think ought to be a part of public discourse and public debate. It seems to me we ought to try to provide incentives for that by saying the lowest rate card in campaigns, the lowest rate on the bottom of the card, will go to commercials that are at least 1 minute in length and on which the candidate appears 75 percent of the time. 
I don't know if we are going to get to that. I intend to offer it as an amendment. 
First and foremost, I rise to say I support the McCain-Feingold bill. I think Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have done a good job. Is it perfect? No. It is an awfully good start to try to bring some order and establish some thoughtful rules to a campaign finance system that is now a mess. 
I want to be involved in the debate in the coming hours, when I hear people stand on the floor of the Senate and say, `Gee, we think the campaign finance system is wonderful,' because I want to ask them what they have been reading, what they have been watching. Not the campaigns that I have seen, not the reports that I have seen about campaign finance awash in soft money, awash in issue ads financed by soft money flying all over the country to pollute the air waves, that never allow the American people to understand who was the donor, who put in half a million dollars to go after this or that candidate. That has become a perversion of fair rules and fair standards in campaign finance reform, and I hope when we pass McCain-Feingold we will finally begin to make some order and some thoughtful response to campaign finance reform. 
I thank the President, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to again join Senator Domenici as an original cosponsor of S. Res. 186, a resolution designating the week of October 18-24, 1998, as `National Character Counts Week.' As he does every year, Senator Domenici again introduced this resolution on behalf of the bipartisan membership of the Senate Character Counts Group, and I want to thank him for his continuing leadership on this important effort. 
For those of you who are not familiar with Character Counts, the national Character Counts Coalition is an alliance of hundreds of groups, communities, and individuals who share a concern about the moral compass of our country. I know a lot of us here in the Senate share this concern about the wrong direction that many of our young people seem to be headed. 
Character Counts was born out of a meeting of some of our country's best thinkers and doers about five years ago. Character Counts is an effort that says to all of us, parents, educators, church and youth leaders, community and business leaders, let us constantly by action and example reinforce six basic values, or pillars of character. These pillars of character are so important and so basic that I do not think anyone could question them. They are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
I have two young children, so I know firsthand how difficult it is for kids to make the right choices when they are constantly being bombarded by messages from our popular culture about how cool it is to drink alcohol, or smoke, or use vulgar language. By the time they finish elementary school, most kids have seen 8,000 murders on television. 
To counteract these messages, it is more important than ever that we instill in our young people the integrity and good character to stand up for what is right. Children are not born with good character. They learn by example, and if they have good role models all around them, I am confident they will make the correct choices for themselves. Perhaps Teddy Roosevelt said it best: `To educate a person in mind and not morals is to educate a menace to society.' 
We often tell our kids to do what is right, but unfortunately, kids witness adult actions that do not reinforce that message. For example, I have spoken on this floor several times about the case of Juan C., a 15-year-old New York high school student who brought a gun to school in 1992. 
The facts of this case stand common sense on its head and send a terrible message to students. In 1992, Juan C. was stopped by a school security guard who saw a bulge resembling the handle of a gun inside Juan's leather jacket. The guard grabbed for the bulge, which was indeed a loaded .45 semiautomatic handgun. 
Juan was charged with criminal weapon possession violations. He was also expelled from school for one year, as is consistent with the `zero tolerance' law written by Senator Feinstein and me to prevent guns in our schools. 
The family court that heard Juan's criminal case ruled that the security guard did not have reasonable suspicion to search this student. As a result, the court refused to admit the gun as evidence of Juan's court. The New York appellate court then took this decision to ridiculous lengths by applying the same reasoning to the internal school disciplinary action against the student to expel him for a year. 
This was a ludicrous decision from a court. It sent a message to students that there will be no consequences for bringing a loaded gun to school, even though that is clearly against school rules and the law. In some cases, like this one, it tells school officials that they ought to look the other way when they know a student is carrying a loaded weapon. 
With these kinds of messages, it is no wonder that our children are confused about what is right and wrong. Fortunately, this case was ultimately overturned, and I have also taken the step of introducing the Safer Schools Act, along with Senators Feinstein, Cleland, Coverdell, Johnson, and Landrieu, to send a clear message to school officials, parents, and students that guns seized from students on school premises can and will be used as evidence in a school disciplinary hearing. I hope the Congress will act on my bill soon so that the confusing messages the courts have been sending on this issue are cleared up. 
We all have a role in ensuring that our children are given the ethical tools they need to make difficult choices in today's world. Quite simply, that is what the Character Counts effort is all about. 
Before closing, I want to take a few minutes to highlight the Character Counts efforts that have been occurring in North Dakota. Less than two years ago, Character Counts in North Dakota was borne out of a meeting I hosted to bring together parents, educators, young people, and other concerned citizens to introduce them to what the Character Counts program is all about. In the last year, under the vigorous and capable leadership of 4-H youth leader Geri Bosch, Character Counts has blossomed. More than 800 people in North Dakota have participated in Character Counts training so that they could take this program, or a variation of it, back to their communities. Several communities in North Dakota are considering adopting a comprehensive Character Counts program. Service clubs are adopting Character Counts among their projects, and Character Counts was even used as the platform for one of our state's Miss North Dakota candidates last year. Most importantly, the lives of thousands of young people in North Dakota have been influenced for the better directly and indirectly. 
I have been proud to play some small role in supporting Character Counts in North Dakota and our nation. It is through these kinds of efforts that we can build a better future for our kids, and I pledge my continued help and support for teaching the pillars of good character.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I stand in observance of American Heart Month. This is an annual event since 1964 resulting from passage of a joint Congressional resolution asking the President to proclaim each February as American Heart Month. In declaring February as American Heart Month for the last 34 years, both the Congress and the President recognize the seriousness of heart disease and the need to continue the battle against this our country's number 1 killer and a leading cause of disability. 
American Heart Month takes on an added significance in 1998 because both the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association are celebrating their 50th anniversaries--50 proud years for both national organizations. 
The NHLBI is the federal government's leading supporter of heart research and educational programs. The American Heart Association is the nation's largest voluntary health organization dedicated to the reduction of death and disability from heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases--the leading cause of death in the United States. 
There have been wonderful discoveries made through research and wonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in the area of cardiology. Yet there is so much we still do not know. It seems to me more and more research can unlock these mysteries and give us the opportunity to save more and more lives in this country. 
Virtually all of us have a friend or a loved one who has been affected by heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular diseases. As many of my colleagues know, I have a very personal interest in trying to provide additional resources for NHLBI to be used to provide funding vitally needed for heart and stroke-related research. 
I have become increasingly concerned, however, with what has been happening to the amount of money spent on heart research by the federal government. Even with the significant increases that Congress has been giving to the NIH over the past decade, funding for heart research has simply not kept pace. In fact, funding for heart research at the NHLBI appears to be losing more and more ground. 
In constant dollars from FY 1985 to FY 1995, funding for the NHLBI heart program decreased 4.8 percent. 
In constant dollars from FY 1986 to FY 1996 funding for the NHLBI heart program declined 5.5 percent. 
And, in figures just released by the NHLBI, funding for the heart program decreased by 7.6 percent in constant dollars from FY 1987 to FY 1997. 
We can do better, and we must do better. Our nation must do a better job than this in the battle against America's No. 1 killer. 
During the commemoration of this 50th anniversary of the 1948 Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, I call on the on the President and every one of my colleagues to take three pivotal steps to make more progress against this insidious disease: 
Commit to providing a significant increase in funding for research against heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases; 
Establish a Presidential Commission on Heart Disease and Stroke, similar to the one convened by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Today, 34 years after the first Presidential Commission, these diseases remain the first and third largest killers in America; and 
Convene a National Conference on Cardiovascular Diseases sponsored by the NHLBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first one was sponsored by the National Heart Institute and the American Heart Association in 1950 to `summarize current knowledge and to make recommendations concerning further progress against heart and blood vessel diseases.' I think it is time we take another systematic look at the status of our heart disease research efforts to date and the areas that need further research. 
These steps are vital to the health and well being of the more than 57 million Americans with one or more types of cardiovascular disease.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the proposal in Congress to rename the Washington National Airport for former President Ronald Reagan has caused some to claim that anyone who opposes the change is expressing a partisan view. 
I greatly respect and admire former President Reagan. I have supported naming Washington, D.C.'s largest federal office structure the Ronald Reagan Building. The ceremony to do that will be held in the next few months. I also have supported naming the aircraft carrier that is currently under construction the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan. 
But I did not think it was appropriate for Congress to dictate a name change to the local airport authority. The bill turning over the authority for the airport to a metropolitan airport authority was signed by President Reagan nine years ago. I don't think the spirit of that transfer of control is served by a proposal directing the airport authority to rename the airport. 
That airport is now named after America's first President. In fact, the porticos in the architecture of the Washington National Airport were designed to resemble Mount Vernon. 
Again, while I admire and respect President Reagan, I believe that it's most appropriate that the principal airport serving our nation's capital retains the name of our first President. However, I did vote for an amendment that would permit renaming it, provided the local airport authority chose to do so. I think that is the appropriate course.

Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Democratic leader. He has provided extraordinary leadership to this caucus and this Congress. The document that we developed over time and announced today with the President, the Vice President, Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt, and the joint Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate is one that I am enormously proud of and one that, if enacted, would substantially improve this country. 
We come here, almost all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, because we have a passion for public policy and feel very strongly about a range of issues and how those issues might affect our country's future. While we might have substantial differences in how we go about achieving certain goals, I think all of us understand that we sit in this Chamber as American citizens in a democracy wanting the best for our country. The question is, how do we achieve that? How do we achieve the goals that we establish for our country's future? 
Senator Daschle mentioned the things that we have accomplished, the things that we have yet to do, the fiscal policy. I can recall, going back 5 years to 1993, when we had a very, very significant debate on the floor of the Senate about fiscal policy, what kind of policies would put this country back on track, heading in the right direction; what kind of policies would continue us in the direction that we had been moving in with higher debt, higher deficits, higher unemployment, higher inflation. So we had a significant debate about it. Those of us who felt very strongly that there was a better way and a better direction won by one vote--one vote here and one vote in the other body. A margin of one vote determined the new fiscal policy for this country. It was a tougher fiscal policy. It wasn't words; it was action. So it was controversial. For some, it was difficult. Some of my colleagues who voted for it are not here any longer; they lost their seats in Congress because of it. But it was medicine to cure what was wrong in this country's fiscal policy and to put this country on the right course. And it worked. 
It substantially reduced the Federal budget deficit. It told all the American people that there was a new group of Members of Congress, a new President who said there is a better way and a different way, and we are going to tackle this fiscal policy and tackle the Federal budget deficit and change things. It's very interesting that, because this economy rides on a cushion of confidence, when we made that decision, the American people were confident about the future once again, and when they are confident, they make decisions like buying a home, buying a car, taking a vacation, buying a new refrigerator. When they are not confident about the future, they don't make those purchases and they don't make those decisions. When they feel like that, the economy contracts. When they feel confident about the future, the economy expands. Because the economy has expanded and because people have had more confidence, this budget deficit has shrunk. It is down, down, down, way down. We will balance the budget. 
Crime is down, unemployment is down, inflation is down, welfare is down. All of the things that are important in our lives about how we are doing in this country show signs of substantial improvement and show signs that this country is moving in the right direction. 
I want to make one other point about fiscal policy and some of the other problems we face. In our agenda, we talk about Social Security--`save Social Security first,' the President proposes. And `save Social Security first,' we propose as a caucus. Some wring their hands every day of the week about Social Security. Some never liked it in the first place. Some think it doesn't work and they wring their hands and say, `Woe, what are we to do with Social Security?' 
I want them to understand, as many Americans do, that the Social Security problem that exists is born of enormous success. We would not have a problem financing Social Security for 150 years if we went back to the old mortality rates. In the 1930s, you were expected to live to age 63 in this country. Now you are expected to live, on average, to about 77 years in America. Why? Because we have done a lot of good things in this country. We have invested in health care, technology, and breathtaking medical research. Now people, when they reach a certain age and their knees wear out, they get new knees, or they get new hips, or have cataract surgery, or their heart muscle is unplugged on an operating table. Some people may be worth a million dollars after all that medical help. But the point is that people are living longer and better lives, and all of these problems are born of the success of greater longevity. Does that cause some pinching in Social Security and Medicare in the long term? Yes, but it is not catastrophic. Adjustments can be made that are not significant, which will provide solid, assured financing for Social Security and Medicare for the long term. 
That is what this President says. As we tame the fiscal policy deficits, and as we begin to accumulate surpluses, let us use those surpluses to save Social Security first. Those who believe that is not a wise course, those who believe that is not appropriate fiscal policy, come to the floor of the Senate, because we are going to have a healthy and aggressive debate about that. Many of us feel very strongly that it is precisely what this country ought to do. We have tamed the Federal deficit. Now let's make the right investment. And the first commitment ought to be to save Social Security first. 
Now, within the context of other spending we do in the budgets and other investments, there are other things we can do. I know we will have Members who don't want to do anything. They have never wanted to do anything. I mean, there are people who have said there is no role for Government. There are people who put seatbelts on when they drive through a car wash. They're so conservative they don't want to do anything ever. Much of what we have accomplished in this country has been because we have made the right kind of investments. 
This proposal that we have developed jointly says that one of those investments that is very important is in the area of health care research down at the National Institutes of Health, where breathtaking, new medical research occurs. We are saying we can invest substantially more money and you can, as a result of that, save an enormous amount of money and save lives and improve the lives of the American people. I am very excited about that. What better investment is there in this country than to invest in the kind of medical and health care research at the National Institutes of Health which has provided breakthroughs in medicine that have allowed people to live much longer and more productive lives? 
Another investment that the President and we call for in our joint policy message is an investment in education. Education is our future. Our children are our future. Investment in our children represents our tomorrow. We talk about investing in schools, investing in good teachers, and deciding that we can do this country a significant amount of good by understanding that the priority is educating our children. Thomas Jefferson once said, `Anyone who believes a country can be both ignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can be.' He was right about that 200 years ago. The reason this country has done so well is because we have always established that education is a 
priority. It must remain a priority, and that is what our caucus and our policy choices are committed to doing. 
A couple of other items--and I don't want to cover them all because some of my colleagues will cover some. Teen smoking is part of our agenda. We need to end that, to combat teen smoking. You have all heard the message that you don't find people deciding at age 25, as they sit around in a recliner thinking about life, or wondering what on Earth can I do to further enrich my life, or what is missing from my life, and they come up with the answer: Smoking; I would like to start smoking. Nobody does that at age 25 or 30. If you are not smoking by the time you are a kid, you are not going to be a future user of tobacco. 
The tobacco companies have always known that, and that is why they have always targeted their future customers, who are the children. Does anybody know anybody who is 25 or 30 years of age who says, how can I enrich my life further? and then comes up with the answer that I would like to start smoking? Nobody does that. We also understand that we can save lives by combating teen smoking, and there are plenty of ways to do that. A thousand kids a day will die--3,000 kids a day will start smoking, and a thousand will die of that cause. We can save lives with a national campaign to combat teen smoking. 
Drunk driving. This agenda of ours also deals with the question of drunk driving. That is not some mysterious illness or disease. We know what causes fatalities on the roads--drunk driving. Everyone in this Chamber and every family represented here knows that--friend, neighbor, relative, acquaintance. I am not even very logical about this question. The night that I got the call that my mother had been killed by a drunk driver, I'll never forget the moment, and I'll never forget how I have felt from that day forward. People who drink and drive turn automobiles into instruments of murder. The fact is, it's not just the .08 we are going to debate, the question of when are you drunk. There are six States in this country where you can get behind the wheel of a car and take a fifth of whiskey in one hand and the steering wheel in the other and drive off, and you are perfectly legal. That ought not happen anywhere in America. We can change that. There are some 20 States in which, if the driver can't drink, everybody else in the car can be drinking. Vehicles on roads in this country ought not to have open containers of alcohol in them, period. That is something we can address in this Congress. 
Finally, campaign finance reform is also part of what our caucus is committed to doing. There are a lot of discussions about what pieces will work and what pieces will not work with respect to campaign finance reform. I want to describe one little piece that I think is important. The most significant kind of air pollution in America today is the 30-second political ad that does nothing but tear down someone's opponent. It is a 30-second slash and burn, cut and run ad that contributes nothing to our country. The first amendment gives everybody the right to do that. We won't change that. But there is a little thing we can change. We can, by Federal law, say that every television station is required to offer the lowest rates on the rate card during political advertising during a certain period. I propose that we change that law to say that low rate is only available to candidates who run advertisements that are at least 1 minute in length. Let's require people to say something significant in one in which the candidate himself or herself is in the advertisement 75 percent of that 1 minute. 
Some people may not like that. I do. Can you think of any other business, other than American politics, where the competitor says--for example, can you conceive of a car company who does all of its advertising saying: By the way, if you buy a Chevrolet, you are going to kill yourself because they are not safe; or fly American, or United, or Northwest and, by the way, their mechanics are a bunch of drunks. Do we see that in any other part of our lives? No. That is not the way commercial enterprises compete against each other. But it is the way we compete in politics. 
Shame on us. We can change that. It ought to be a competition of ideas and about what we want for the future of this country. I hope one of these days we can have campaign finance reform that gets to that point. But at least a little proposal I am suggesting, on top of all of the other things that we are talking about in campaign finance reform as a caucus, might finally stop some of this air pollution or at least lessen the pollution that permeates every campaign in this country. 
Then there is food safety, clean air, and clean water. Our caucus stands for things that are positive in the lives of the American people. Some say they want to debate politics with the same old stereotypes. Unfortunately, it won't work anymore. To those who say, `There are the good guys, and there are the tax-and-spend people,' I say that doesn't work. Our caucus, in this Congress, with this President, made a decision that we were going to do some awfully important things to put this country back on course, and we did it--at great cost and expense to our caucus. But the American people, 5 years later, see the results for this country of what we have done. We say that the job isn't finished. There is much to do to make this a better country. That is the purpose of the message and the purpose of the set of public policies that tell the American people: Here is why we are here and what we want to fight for to improve America's future. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain why I voted against cloture on S. 1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act introduced by Senators Bond, Frist, Lott, and Gregg. 
First of all, I want to state unequivocally that I am against the cloning of a human being. Cloning of a human child raises serious moral and ethical questions about society's perception of human life. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, after a thorough review of the ethical and legal issues involved, has recommended that Congress enact legislation to prohibit the use of cloning to create a child, and I agree that Congress needs to act on this issue. 
We should not, however, rush to enact legislation that could do serious harm to other critical medical research. The legislation before the Senate today is only eight days old. The Senate Labor Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee, which have jurisdiction over this bill, have not had the opportunity to hold hearings on this specific legislation or the other bills that have recently been introduced, much less consider amendments to the language. 
In the meantime, the Food and Drug Administration has already determined that it has authority and jurisdiction over human cloning and has stated that it would act to prohibit any attempt to clone a human being. In addition, professional organizations representing more than 64,000 scientists have voluntarily imposed upon themselves a five-year moratorium on human cloning. 
Most importantly, as we take action to ban the cloning of humans, I want to be sure that we do not also ban valuable medical research that could lead to cures or treatments for the millions of Americans suffering from cancer, heart disease, diabetes, organ failure, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, severe skin burns, and many other diseases that perhaps we haven't even identified yet. Scientists do not yet understand exactly how somatic cell nuclear transfer, the technique used in cloning Dolly the sheep in Scotland last spring, worked. 
But medical researchers believe that this technology can be used to generate stem cells to treat disease. For instance, imagine being able in the not-so-distant future to repair the damage to the cardiac muscle caused by a heart attack. Using stem cell technology, we may be able to replace damaged cardiac cells with healthy cells that would then differentiate into cardiac muscle. I do not know whether this will ultimately prove to work, but I believe we should continue to pursue this type of research if it could help to save the lives of millions of Americans each year. 
The Nation's scientific community has expressed deep concern that the legislation before us, as currently drafted, could halt stem cell research and other related research that would not lead to the cloning of human beings. Everyone I have talked to agrees that this is a complicated and difficult issue. We need to proceed, but we need to do so in the careful, considered way that has earned the Senate the reputation of the `world's greatest deliberative body.'

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to visit for just a minute the issue about the highway bill and roads. 
I would say to the Senator from Indiana, the Presiding Officer, that when I was in high school in a small town in North Dakota, I was agitating pretty hard to get a car. The way my dad warded me off from this desire to purchase a car was he said I'll let you buy a car because I have one spotted for you. But he insisted that I would have to restore it. 
Sure enough, my father, who delivered gasoline to rural users, family farmers, with his rural delivery gasoline truck, had been out on a farm and he saw a 1924 Ford Model T in a granary. It had been sitting in that granary for many, many years. He said, you know the fellow who used to own that farm and put that Model T in there, he lives out of State. You should write him a note and see if he would want to sell you that Model T. So I did, and the fellow wrote back and said he would be glad to sell me his 1924 Model T Ford. He sold it to me for $25 and sent me the original key and original owner's manual. 
I went out to look at this car I just bought and the rats had eaten out all the seat cushions and all the wiring and all there was was a metal shell with the engine, and no tires, of course. And so I was the proud owner of a 1924 Model T Ford. That's the car my dad got me for my social life. It wasn't much of a social life for long while, because it takes a long time to restore a Model T Ford. As a matter of fact, I didn't know much about it. I was told, by the way, the reason the owner drove it to the granary and put it in that granary for a long, long time was the Model T's are like the old red wagon you used to pull when you were a kid. If you turn the wheel in front too far, they would tip over. It's called jackknife. A lot of people don't remember that. But the Model T would jackknife if you turned the wheel too sharp. I was told, the fellow who owned it had been in town drinking and driving home from the bar he thought he saw some chickens in the road so he thought he'd take a sharp left turn and he jackknifed the Model T and it pinned him beneath the Model T and hurt him a little bit. He survived, but he parked the Model T in the granary and never drove it again. He was pretty upset, I guess. 
Then I bought it. Then I had a 1924 Model T Ford to restore and drive on modern roads, which was really quite an interesting thing to do. It didn't improve my social life, but nonetheless I had a car, an old car on new roads. 
One of the interesting things about automobiles in our society is that we have not only seen dramatic changes in our automobiles from the first Model T I purchased as a young kid, but the infrastructure that we use and that we need for those automobiles and for transportation has also changed dramatically. 
I am told that a new automobile in this country, manufactured here today, has more computer power in the automobile than existed in the lunar lander that put the first American on the Moon. There were breathtaking changes in manufacturing techniques and the production of consumer products, especially in automobiles. But we also have to understand that, as a society, that no matter how much we change these consumer products in ways that are really wonderful, we also must invest in infrastructure. So we have, over the years, consistently, Republicans and Democrats, everyone, worked together, from county commissioners to U.S. Senators and mayors and Governors, to decide we need a first-class road system. We have, in part, become a world-class economy because we have a first-class infrastructure and a first-class transportation system. 
We have before us in the U.S. Congress the need to pass a new highway bill. It is not a partisan issue. I don't come to the floor to blame anybody for anything. I come to the floor, as have some Republicans and some Democrats, and say it is time now to put the highway bill on the floor and let people who want to offer 
amendments offer the amendments and pass a highway bill so that those people out there who are running the highway programs in the State governments, and those people in the county commission offices and in the townships and the cities, will understand how much money is available to build and to repair roads and bridges. This plan must be passed by the Congress to allow all of those folks to understand what they can and cannot do; how much is available. 
This morning I stopped to put some gas in my car on the way to work. I not only paid for the gasoline, I also paid a tax. That tax is going to go from that station that I stopped at to the Government coffers and will be put in a trust fund, and it is going to be used in one way or another, I expect, to build a road or repair a bridge. That's the purpose of the gas tax that we have imposed, in order to provide for this infrastructure investment. 
We have a responsibility now to do last year's work. Some say, `Gee, we didn't get it done last year. That is somebody else's fault.' Or they point a number of different ways. `But now we must wait for next year's budget in order to bring the highway bill to the floor.' 
We don't need to delay last year's work to deal with next year's budget. It doesn't make any sense to me. Those people who have come to the floor of the Senate on a bipartisan basis and said this Congress is moving at a Model T speed here--this is really glacial speed, at least as we have taken off from the blocks. Let us bring something to the floor that we must do and must do soon. Let all those who have amendments to it offer those amendments, have a debate on the amendments, and vote so we can do our business. 
Some say if we do it the other body will not do it anyway. The other body has signaled that it does not intend to take up a highway bill until the budget is complete this spring. 
I was on a television program with the chairman of the committee in the other body that deals with this issue. He said that the Speaker has indicated he doesn't want this to come up until after the budget process. I respectfully say to the Speaker, `That may be your desire, but I don't think that's what the American people desire.' It's certainly not what I desire. I hope at least those of us in the Senate could pass the bill and send it over to the House and then say to them the American people want this done. Let's put some pressure on them. The best way to apply pressure to get something done is to do our work. Our job at this point is to bring the bill to the floor and begin to deal with this bill. 
I have traveled in various parts of the world at various times. One of the interesting things that distinguishes a Third World country or a developing country from a developed country or an industrialized country is its infrastructure. I have been in hotels, the best hotel in a town, and turned on the tap and have gotten rust and water together because their infrastructure was terrible. And I have driven from that town in a Jeep, going only 25 or 30 miles an hour because the roads, the main roads, the best roads, are full of holes and ruts that will tear up a car's underside if you go faster than that. We all understand that many of those countries have not had the opportunity or the resources to develop their infrastructure. 
In some ways, the inability to develop the infrastructure predicts that they will not become a developed country; that they will remain a country that is a Third World country. We distinguish ourselves and have become an enormously successful country over a couple of hundred years by our desire to build in this country, to build and create. Part of that building and creating is to invest in infrastructure. And part of that is to invest in the best road and highway system anywhere. 
We face some daunting tasks now with respect to bridges and some of our roads in this country. They are in desperate need of repair. We have been putting money in a trust fund with which to do that. Yet, in many cases the trust fund hasn't been used 
because they want to build up that money to use it as an offset to make the deficit look different than it should have looked. Or others have other ideas on what to do with the money. The point is, we have a responsibility, all of us serving now, to deal with the infrastructure needs of our country now. I implore the majority leader and others to consider, as they develop the agenda for this Senate, that, beginning tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or next Monday, decide that high on the agenda, at the top of the list, will be for us to do what we must and should do: Pass a highway program that invests in this country's infrastructure. 
Mr. President, I indicated that this is not an issue of partisanship. It is, interestingly enough, every time you get a highway bill to the floor, it is a debate between a group of States that think the formula by which we divide the highway moneys is a terrible formula and others who think the formula is a wonderful formula. It depends on who gets and who gives. My State, I just would say with respect to the formula, as you might think, gets more back than it sends in for the highway program. So some States would look at my State and say: `Well, your State is a receiving State or a recipient State or a beneficiary' and my State, somebody else's State, they would say, `is a donor State. We are upset about that.' 
Without getting into a debate about the formula, I would just say this. We are a State that is 10 times the size of Massachusetts, in North Dakota. You can put 10 States the size of Massachusetts inside the borders of North Dakota. Yet we have only 640,000 citizens. Those 640,000 citizens cannot by themselves pay sufficient gas taxes locally to maintain the roads and bridges necessary in our State, in order to make it a national road system. We cannot do it. 
In fact, if you measure the burden another way, we in North Dakota rank among the highest in the country in per-person payments of Federal gas tax. Our burden ranks among the highest in the country. But others want to segregate it out and say, `Well, you are a recipient State and that is not right.' 
I say, but we in North Dakota pay for the Coast Guard. 
We don't mind doing that. I am a taxpayer. My constituents are taxpayers. We pay for the Coast Guard. We don't really have any coast to guard. North Dakota is landlocked. We don't mind really doing that. That is the way these things should be done on a national basis. 
When it comes to investing in highway programs, we feel also that there ought to be a national program to make sure that our country is a country that is not divided by those areas that have good roads and those that don't, because some can afford it and some can't. 
Roads and infrastructure represent a national need and a national priority, and the satisfaction of that need and priority makes this a better and a stronger country. I hope that the discussions on the floor of the Senate by Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm and Senator Baucus and so many others who are urging that we be allowed on this agenda to consider very, very soon the highway reauthorization bill, I hope those urgings will be heard and that we will very soon be on that particular business. 
Mr. President, with that, I see a colleague is on the floor. I yield the floor.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a fair amount of discussion in the last few days about the desire that many Members of the Senate have that we be able to debate a highway bill here on the floor of the Senate. I want to add my voice to that of Senator Byrd and Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Baucus and so many others who have come to the floor of the Senate and indicated the importance of the Senate proceeding ahead to deal with the highway bill. 
I know that there are those who say, `Well, the House of Representatives indicates it is not going to proceed on a highway bill until some point much later, perhaps following the decisions made on the budget.' There are those who say in the Senate that we ought not proceed until we deal with the budget. 
The fact is, the highway bill was supposed to have been done last year and was not. It ought to be done now. If we wait, we will move right to that May 1st drop-dead date on the highway short-term extension, and we will leave a good many States out there wondering what on Earth are they going to do with respect to their roads and bridges that need repair and rebuilding? Now, the highway bill does not sound very sexy or very interesting to some. But the investment in highways is very important to this country. It represents an investment in infrastructure, it represents jobs and economic activity and opportunity. It is very, very important. 
We take for granted so many things in this country, almost every day. But go, for example, to Honduras and get on a road going south from Tegucigalpa, and then think to yourself, as you drive along that road, what a different kind of infrastructure there exists in some countries versus what we have done in this country. We take roads for granted until we go elsewhere in the world and discover what we have done in this country to make this a better place. 
I come from a very, very rural area of America, a county the size of the State of Rhode Island that has only 3,000 residents. I know from that background how important roads have been to my hometown--the opportunity to move grain to market, the opportunity to get to a hospital, the opportunity to go back and forth for purposes of commerce. It unlocks economic opportunities in all parts of our country. That is why building and maintaining the network of roads and bridges in our country has been so important. 
One of the wonderful examples of progress in this country was when we decided as a country that we were going to build an interstate highway system and it was going to be an American system, a national system. They did not decide, you know, we should debate whether the interstate highway should go through a State like North Dakota. They did not say, `Well, when it gets to Fargo, ND, on the Minnesota border, we have to stop there because there aren't enough people living between Fargo, ND, and Beach, ND, over by the Montana side to justify building four lanes of highway calling it an interstate.' They don't say that. 
They built an interstate highway all across this country to connect this country even through remote rural areas because we knew it was a good investment for this country. 
Roads, infrastructure--it represents an awfully good investment for this country. What has happened to us--and I am not laying partisan blame at all--what has happened to us is we have gotten embroiled in debates about a lot of other issues here in the U.S. Senate when in fact it is our duty and responsibility to take up the issue of highway reauthorization and get it done. 
We have a very short construction season in some of our northern States. We have to know what kind of money is available, what kind of investment can be made, what kind of resources will be available to us to proceed and develop the plans needed to maintain our roads and bridges. I worry very much that what is going to happen to us is we will come up to the May 1st deadline and not have done the highway bill even this year, when in fact it should have been done last year. So the question before the Senate is not whether we are going to do a highway bill. The question is when. And the question of when is very, very important. 
I know the majority leader told the Senate that it would be the first order of business when we come back after the first of the year. I also know there are others in the Senate who are tugging at his sleeves saying, well, we do not want the highway bill to come up until after the budget. So I know the majority leader wants to bring the highway bill up, but he has other Members suggesting that it be brought up later. 
I urge the majority leader, in the strongest terms possible, to heed the call of Senator Gramm from Texas, Senator Byrd, Senator Baucus, Senator Chafee, so many other Senators who say this is a critically important issue. 
Let's do this. Let's do it together in a bipartisan way, and let's tell the Governors and the mayors and the legislators and the folks out in our country in the countries and the cities that here is our highway bill, here are the resources, here is our investment in infrastructure. We are proud of it. We want to do it because it is good for the country. Let's do it soon. 
So we will continue, in the coming days, to call for action on the highway bill. It is not meant in any way as a partisan call, because there are both Republicans and Democrats who feel very strongly that it ought to be placed right at the top of the agenda right now. Some say that when the highway bill comes to the floor, there will be 100 or 200 amendments. Well, if there are 100 amendments, we could have gotten rid of a lot of them last week and this week. Let's work our way through it and pass this legislation and send a message to the folks out in the country that this Congress values the investment in infrastructure in our country, this Congress understands the importance of a highway program that provides certainty to the American people about our investment in infrastructure. 
The National Council of State Legislatures, today, has written the majority leader saying: 
On behalf of the Nation's State legislators, the National Conference of State Legislatures reiterates its continuing, firm support for immediate action on ISTEA reauthorization. 
That is the highway bill. 
It is crucial that a long-term reauthorization be enacted before March 31. 
It goes on to say: 
The National Council of State Legislatures feels that immediate action is essential. States face imminent shortfalls in various program accounts at the end of March, 1998, shortfalls which can have serious ramifications for State transportation programs. For example, contractual relationships for future highway construction can be compromised, transit agencies can be unable to apportion funds without the passage of authorizing legislation, and highway safety programs can come to a halt in certain States. State legislators remain greatly concerned about the possibility of these disruptions.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there will be an opportunity this morning for Members of the Senate to discuss the President's submission of his budget to the Congress yesterday. 
The way the process works in our country is the President proposes a budget that contains his recommendations for spending priorities. And then the Congress deals with these recommendations in that way that Congress deems appropriate. The budget that the President proposes, and the budget that the Congress finalizes, reflect what we think the priorities are for our country. 
It is certain that 100 years from now none of us will be here; 100 years from now we will be gone from this Earth. But if historians want to learn 100 years from now about who we were, and what we were, and what we felt was important to us, and what our priorities were, they could look at the Federal budget document and evaluate our spending priorities. What did we think was important? What did we invest in, in order to achieve a better future for ourselves or our country? And they could determine by our decisions about investment and spending what we held dear as a country. 
This President has proposed a budget that is vastly changed from the budgets we have seen in recent years. When I came to the Congress in 1981, in the House of Representatives, a new President was assuming office here in town, President Ronald Reagan. He had a completely different vision of fiscal policy. 
He was supported by an economic theory that suggested if you had very large tax cuts, you would still achieve larger amounts of revenue and you could actually balance the budget with large tax cuts. And so he proposed with his Office of Management and Budget guru, Mr. David Stockman, a series of budgets that proposed very significant tax cuts and a doubling of the defense budget. 
And President Reagan's economist and others, particularly an economist named Arthur Laffer, who developed a Laffer curve, said this would all work out OK. They said you can provide significant tax cuts, double defense spending, and it would all come out just fine. 
In fact, that fiscal policy created a mountain of debt that began to choke this country. The President and Congress in combination embarked on a fiscal policy that was reckless. In fact, David Stockman, the chief strategist of it, said so in his book. 
It took a long while to get through all of that, and even through the end of the 1980s and into the early 1990s the Federal budget deficit was climbing and climbing at an alarming rate. 
President Clinton came to office in 1993 and said we are going to change that. And he presented the Congress in 1993 with a proposal to reduce the Federal budget deficit. As fiscal policy his proposal was tough, tough medicine. 
And by one vote in the Senate and one vote in the House it passed. Some of my colleagues who voted for that are not here any longer because it was tough and controversial. But it put this country on the right road. Over a period of 5 years the budget deficit has come down, down, way down. 
And some of my colleagues are unwilling to accept the fact that there is a cause-effect relationship between the actions you take to reduce this budget deficit and the results you get. But it is inevitable, if you look at the facts, to conclude that what this President and what this Congress did in 1993 to set this country on the right track has put us in the position today where we have a budget submitted to the Congress that wrestles that budget deficit to the ground and then says, as far as the eye can see in the years ahead, there is good news. 
And the good news is that this economy is working. It's working better for the American people. I do not want to attribute it all to one person or one party. That is not the case. Last year we had a bipartisan budget agreement between Republicans and Democrats and that helps as well, and both parties ought to be credited for that. 
But my point is I watched yesterday some people react to the President's budget submission, and it was the same cranky old tune you have heard from them every single year. It sounds like they have a permanent toothache. Nothing on Earth can make them satisfied or happy. 
Let me see if I can help them out. Let me try to explain why the American people feel differently. Here is what makes the American people feel good about the direction we are heading. 
The Federal budget deficit, as I said, has been down, down, way down now for 5 years in a row. And the deficit is almost nonexistent--not quite yet, but it will be. 
Inflation is almost nonexistent. Inflation has come down, down, down. It is the lowest it's been since 1986. Housing starts are up substantially. In 1996 they totaled 1.47 million housing starts. That is the largest number of housing starts in this country since 1988. And what we know so far about 1997 tells us that the figures for all of last year will be even higher. 
Mr. President, 14 million people are working now that were not working in 1993. Unemployment is down. I can recall when the Federal Reserve Board, that friend of mine, that institutional friend of mine, said if unemployment ever goes below 6 percent are we in for trouble; we are in for a huge wave of inflation. The Federal Reserve Board has been wrong, it has been consistently wrong about that. Unemployment is now at 4.7 percent, and inflation has not gone up, it has gone down. 
Crime? The crime rate has gone down at the same time. This President said let's put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Let's put new cops on the street, on the beat. Guess what is happening. As our economy strengthens, and as more people are working, we have a lower crime rate. Since 1993, violent crime has dropped 16 percent. Robberies are down, assaults are down, the murder rate is down by over 20 percent, burglary is down. That is good news. 
Welfare? In the last 4 years we have seen the largest decline in the welfare rolls in the history of this country. There are 2 million fewer people on welfare today than there were in August 1996, when we enacted welfare reform. I might say that this was a bipartisan accomplishment: Republicans and Democrats in the Congress joined to pass a welfare reform bill. I supported it as did many of my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle. A good economy plays a major role in this, but the welfare reform bill also set us on the right track. 
Child support collections are up 50 percent after this Congress passed legislation cracking down on deadbeat dads who decide their children are not their responsibility and that the taxpayers should pay for them. The increase in collections is good news. Child support payments are up 50 percent. 
Access to health care for millions of Americans? Because of last year's action, 5 million American children without health care will get health care. 
Medicare? In the work that we have done to provide long-term stability for Medicare much, much more needs to be done, but we have done a great deal already. 
I have more to say and I will in a bit, but I notice the minority leader, Senator Daschle, is on the floor. Let me yield whatever time Senator Daschle might use of the hour.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator comes from a reasonably small town in South Dakota. I come from a much smaller town in North Dakota. 
I have said on several occasions that in my hometown, like most hometowns, we have a couple of people who get up in the morning and go down to the bar and play pinochle all day. They are retired. They sit around and play pinochle and enjoy life. The fact is, they sit around and play pinochle and complain while other people are out doing other things, like figuring out how to pave Main Street. Almost nothing satisfies them. There are people like that in every hometown, and there are people like that in Congress. The fact is, there is no amount of good news that can satisfy the people who are bent on having a bad day. I find it interesting that we went through part of the eighties and some of the nineties going in the wrong direction, and everyone was standing up and saying, `Gee, we were right on course; the deficit was continuing to escalate, the Federal debt was continuing to grow and mushroom.' Everybody said, `Well, we're right on course.' But we weren't on course. 
The Senator from South Dakota, I know, understands well the 1993 vote. In that vote, we on this side of the aisle said, `Wait a second, this train is running right down the wrong track. We are going to stop it, back it up, turn it around and move it in the other direction.' That is what has gotten us to the point we are at today, where instead of seeing escalating budget deficits and mushrooming Federal debt, we are seeing exactly the opposite. We not only see reduced deficits, and a reduced debt burden, but also an opportunity, even as we balance the budget, to invest in critical things that are important to the future health of the country. Is that how the Senator sees it?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me continue for a couple of moments to finish the presentation I was intending to make. 
The reason I come back to the 1993 vote is that it was so controversial and so difficult for so many people. There were people here who said, `If you do this, if you pass this bill that makes a fundamental change in fiscal policy, you are going to cause a train wreck and you are going to run this country into a depression.' We had people say that on the floor of the Senate. I won't read their quotes because that would not be fair. That was the intention of some folks on the floor, to say this is a terribly wrongheaded policy and going in the wrong direction. It turns out it was very important we change the direction of this country; it was the right policy. 
When President Clinton proposed this budget, he talked about saving Social Security first. This is another way of saying we ought to pay down some of this debt. The problem has been that the Social Security trust funds have been used in the operating budget. I have been on the floor repeatedly talking about how inappropriate that is. 
We ought to not step back into the same old hole we have been in for a decade and a half, or even more. We ought not to decide, the minute the budget picture looks better and we are headed in the right direction, that we are going to provide more tax breaks or more spending. What we ought to do is provide some confidence to the American people that we can manage this country's fiscal policy in a way that provides balanced budgets far out into the future. This President has done that in a way that says we are going to establish the right priorities for this country's future. 
I want to mention two of them because others will come and talk about different portions of this budget. I want to talk about two. Some of the things the President has proposed represent additional investment in certain kinds of activities, and he has achieved that by reducing spending in other areas. I want to mention a couple. 
Head Start. Does anyone in this Chamber who has visited a Head Start center believe that that is not the best kind of Federal investment we can make in young lives? Does anybody believe that program doesn't work? All of the evidence suggests that it is a wonderful investment in young lives. You go there and look in the eyes of these young children, 4- and 5-year-old children who are getting an opportunity in Head Start that they wouldn't have had otherwise. It yields tremendous rewards in the lives of each and every one of them. 
When someone says, as we have seen in the past, `Well let's cut the budget and cut 60,000 kids out of Head Start,' I say, `You tell me their names, which kids do you want to cut out of Head Start?' 
This President says, and I hope this Congress will agree, that program works, that program makes sense, that program improves young citizens' lives. That's why his budget proposes to increase Head Start funding by $309 million in the coming fiscal year. 
Let me make one final point. There is a lot in this budget that makes a lot of sense. The National Institutes of Health. This President says let's do what we ought to do. Let's increase spending of the National Institutes of Health, and he does so in a way that gets NIH funding to $20 billion in 2003, up nearly 50 
percent over the coming 5 years, by achieving savings in other parts of the budget. 
But I want to tell you briefly what they are doing down there at NIH. They have 50,000 plants, shrubs and trees from all around the world they collected with USDA, and they are doing research. I encourage all my colleagues to go see what they are doing. 
Contemporary medicine derives many of its drugs from plant sources all around the world. They are doing an investigation of chili peppers--chili peppers. Do you know what they are finding? Chili peppers have a pain-killing extract. People knew that in folk medicine long ago, but now it is being refined and used. 
Sweet wormwood, a plant that has potency against malaria. 
The willow tree, aspirin. The Chinese knew that 2,000 years ago. The java devil pepper, a drug used as hypertensive agents against high blood pressure. Rose periwinkle, used in Hodgkin's disease, anticancer agents. Foxglove, used in congestive heart failure. 
The point is, go down and look at what they are doing and what we are getting for this investment. It is going to improve the lives of people in this country because it will lead to significant medical breakthroughs. And this is just one part of their research, in the area of evaluating plants, trees and shrubs all around the world for what folk medicine used to understand they can contribute. We are understanding in a more significant and sophisticated way that these natural resources can help people live a healthy life. 
Go over to the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and take a look at what they are doing with respect to heart disease and genetic research. It is possible some day in the future that someone whose arteries become clogged will have their body grow a new artery link around that blockage. That comes from genetic research. 
My point is, that is an area of the budget that I am very excited about. Gosh, that makes a lot of sense because that is an investment in the future, that is an investment that is going to help this country and all people of the world. 
I think it is exciting that we can come to the floor of the Senate at a time when the country is headed in the right direction. We have more jobs, more opportunity, more confidence in the future. The things that were troubling us--inflation, welfare, budget deficits, unemployment--are all of them down, down, way down. That ought to give cause for optimism to all Members of the Senate. And it should give the American people the confidence that finally we are moving in the right direction. 
That is why this budget document is important. It sets out some priorities. Are some of them maybe adjustable? Are some of them wrong? Yes. Are a lot of them right? Yes. Let's have a debate about that, and let's describe and select those priorities that we believe will strengthen and improve this country. 
I am happy to yield such time as he consumes to the Senator from Illinois.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wanted to make a couple of comments following those of the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. He knows that I certainly agree with him on the issue of the Social Security trust funds and the unified budget. There are some definitional issues about the budget. 
I was at the White House this morning, at the invitation of President Clinton, when he made a presentation on the budget that he released today. Frankly, the budget contains a lot of good news. The Senator from South Carolina is correct about the unified budget. But it is also correct to say that this President, beginning in 1993, said that we are going to change courses here and we are going to set this country on a different direction. Between then and now, we have wrestled the Federal budget deficit to the ground. 
Is our job over? No. There is more to be done because of the Social Security trust funds and some other issues. But this President deserves substantial credit for deciding that we are going to change courses, change directions, and wrestle this budget deficit to the ground. I must say that, in 1993, when he proposed to do that, it was very controversial because, up until then, we had seen budget after budget with deficits that continued to increase, year after year. It was 535 bad habits around here, wanting to give tax cuts and spending increases. And the deficit continued to grow, and the Federal debt continued to escalate. 
In 1993, when President Clinton said let's change direction here, he proposed a couple of things that were very controversial. He said, let's really cut some Federal spending, let's really increase some taxes on a selected basis. And it became very controversial because all those folks who had stood up and talked the loudest about controlling the Federal deficit, when it came time to take the vote, where were they? They weren't here. We didn't get one vote from the other side of the aisle--even by accident. We won by one vote in the U.S. Senate and one vote in the U.S. House, and that set this country on a different course. 
Five years later, we now see daylight with the Federal deficits, and the deficits in future years are well under control. In fact, in the long-term, even with Social Security funds out of the calculation, we will reach a balanced budget.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is certainly correct. The last thing we want to do is step back into the hole we were in before. Just the hint of a budget surplus in the future has persuaded a legion of people here to talk about new tax breaks on the one hand or new spending on the other hand. We ought rather to decide to have 
discipline. Let's accept the good news that we have wrestled the Federal budget deficit to the ground. Let's work to keep it there, instead of getting right back into the same fiscal mess we were in before. 
I know some will dispute my recitation of the facts. But there is no dispute that, in 1993, we had a huge vote in the Senate. And we passed that deficit reduction bill by one vote, which sent this country on a different course. That vote indicated that we cared about bringing down Federal budget deficits. We knew they hurt this country and we did something about it. 
Everybody else wants to talk about it and shout about it and chant about it. But when it comes time to vote, the question is, who is going to stand up and, on behalf of the country's future, say, count me in, I want to cast a vote that is tough; I am willing to cast a vote that is hard, politically. In fact, some colleagues who voted the same way I did are not here in the Senate anymore because they cast that vote. 
I just think it is important for all of us to understand that this President and enough Members of Congress, in the Senate and the House, 5 years ago, said that we are going to change direction and put this country on a course of fiscal policy that will wrestle the Federal budget deficit to the ground, and we have done that. 
Now, the fact is, there are some people around here who handle good news like a chronic toothache. You could not get them to smile for any reason. But things are better. The budget is better, the economy is up, unemployment is down, inflation is down, the deficit is down, crime is down, welfare is down. Does that cause a smile? No. It is as if they are in a dental chair getting a root canal. They have to be crabby about something. I just saw a press conference by colleagues who are continuing to be crabby about what is going on in this country. 
The fact is, this country is on a better course, moving in a better direction, and the news is better. Most of the American people understand that. 
The President's budget, incidentally, is not perfect. I have some disagreement with portions of it. But, on the whole, I think it is an awfully good blueprint for this country. The President proposes some things that I think make a lot of sense. 
The President proposes that we increase some spending in certain areas, and he pays for it with cuts in other areas. Let me describe one area where he proposes an increase in spending. 
President Clinton proposes a 50 percent increase in funding over the next 5 years for the National Institutes of Health. There is not a family in this Chamber, or listening to these proceedings, that hasn't been touched by heart disease, stroke, cancer, AIDS, those scourges that kill Americans and ruin families. 
Guess what is happening down at the National Institutes of Health? I have been down there. I have gone through the Lung and Blood Institute and National Cancer Institute. It is remarkable what is going on. It is breathtaking. If you take a look at the money we are investing in research on heart disease, the money that we are investing in research on cancer, to find a cure for AIDS, arthritis, diabetes, and so many other things, it is breathtaking. 
One of the wonderful things I saw at the National Institutes of Health--without digressing too far--when I went into the building was, they had something called a `healing garden,' a little healing garden. They described the plants and vegetation they have collected from all over the world--50,000 to 60,000 plants and shrubs they have collected. They described the research they are doing to find the healing properties of plants. 
Two thousand years ago, in China, if somebody got a headache, like some of my colleagues have about the fiscal policy of this country, what did they do? They would chew on a little willow bark. We do the same thing today, except we get the willow bark in pill form and call it `aspirin.' 
The most exciting thing is not the combination of chemicals and compounds, but the research on the healing properties of shrubs and bushes and plants. It is remarkable. It is wonderful what is 
going on. 
The fact is, when we invest a dollar, a million dollars, or a billion dollars in health research, we provide enormous hope for the people of this country that we can begin to cure cancer. And we have done that with respect to some forms of cancer. We provide enormous hope to people around the country that we can deal with heart disease and stroke, the biggest killers in this country, in a much different way. 
So in those areas of the budget--for example, the increase in direct investment in the National Institutes of Health--does that funding make sense? I think it does. Would people come here and say that the investment in medical research is worthless? 
What about the woman that stood up at a town meeting and said, `I had new knees put in and a new hip and cataract surgery, and I feel like a million dollars.' Where did all that come from? 
Fifty years ago, she would have been in a wheelchair, unable to walk or see. Now when someone's heart muscle plugs up and they have the breathtaking surgery that opens it up, they feel, when they are recovered, stronger than ever and they can go on for the next 10, 20 years and extend their lives. 
The point is this: There are certain things we do that make a lot of sense. This President says, let's continue the investment in the National Institutes of Health and increase that investment and save lives in this country through the breakthroughs that will come from research and medicine. That makes a lot of sense to me. 
The President says, among other things, let us save Social Security first, a point just discussed by my colleague from South Carolina. I know there are some people who never liked Social Security, and have never thought it was a good program. 
They have a right to feel that way. But that is not the way the American people feel. 
About 60 some years ago, we created a Social Security program, and I must say that the mathematics of it were quite interesting. Life expectancy, then, was 63 years of age. Social Security was created with a retirement of 65 years of age. That all works out pretty well. If you are expected to live until 63 and get retirement at 65, that system is pretty well financed. Now the life expectancy is not 63; it has gone to 77 or 78. So things have changed. 
There are future challenges to the Social Security system because of that. We have to make some changes to put it on a sound basis for the long term. But what the President has said makes a lot of sense as a matter of priority. He has an answer to those who would rush off to provide tax breaks because they are popular, or who want to take the best 10 programs and add funding to them. The President has said that we should, as a priority in fiscal policy, save Social Security first. 
That makes a lot of sense. We are going to have a debate on that in the Congress. Is that the priority? Or will we hear something different, as we have heard today, from those naysayers on fiscal policy, those who would be unhappy no matter what is happening? Will we hear that no, that is not a priority, saving Social Security is not a first priority, not even second or not even tenth priority? Will we hear people say that their priority is to give more tax breaks to their friends? 
Let us decide that the responsible thing for the future of this country would be to embrace the principle the President has put forward. Let us save Social Security first. 
The President talked in his budget message today about the priority for education. He is absolutely correct about that priority as well. He has talked about decreasing class size, and hiring 100,000 more teachers. He has talked about creating tax credits to help modernize crumbling schools. All of those things make sense to me. 
President Clinton has paid for these proposals by cutting other funding and rearranging priorities. Instead of in the aggregate saying we are going to add substantial funding, he has done it within the confines of what we can and should spend 
relative to the budget agreement, the bipartisan agreement of last year. 
The budget is not perfect. There are things in it that I don't like and there are some things not in it that should have been in it. 
But this President has submitted a budget plan that is a responsible set of priorities for this country's future. This President should get some credit. And those in this Congress who have supported deficit reduction, both the 1993 bill and the bipartisan agreement last year, deserve some credit too for a budget outlook that is much, much different now than anyone would have expected 2 or 3 years ago.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleagues and I intend to come here to the floor today to discuss the agenda and what we see ahead of us in this congressional session, the second session of this Congress. 
My expectation is that we will find ourselves this year, just as we have in previous years, debating a range of controversial, interesting, and in some cases very provocative issues. We will agree on some of these issues on a bipartisan basis. There may well be aggressive debates about other issues. That is the way the democratic system works. That is the way it should work. 
Where we can reach across the aisle and achieve agreement and do the right thing for this country in a harmonious way, good for us. That's what the American people expect us to do. However, when there are policy issues that are very, very controversial, the people expect us to have a vigorous debate, and we will do that. 
Most of us head home on weekends or during time when the Senate is not in session. I expect other Senators had the same experience I did during this most recent recess. Constituents say to you, `Well, what are you doing down there in Washington? What's going on in Washington? What's happening in the Senate?' It's a question that everyone asks, no matter where you meet them. 
What is happening in the U.S. Senate, and what is happening down here in Washington with respect to legislative duties, is whatever we decide to have happen here on the floor. By virtue of what we schedule for the business of the Senate, we decide what parts of the people's business we will address this year. 
I want to talk just for a moment about what I think the business of the Senate ought to be in the coming months. 
First and foremost, we ought to take up the legislation that reauthorizes the highway program. That bill was supposed to have been passed last year. It wasn't passed; it was extended for 6 months. And the majority leader, quite appropriately, told us that it will be near the first order of business when Congress returns. 
We must take that legislation up and pass it so that the folks around this country who have to plan to maintain our roads and bridges can make those plans. It is our responsibility to pass that bill--not later, but sooner, and I urge that the majority leader bring that legislation to the floor and do it soon. 
Some in the Chamber counsel, `Well, let's wait until the budget is passed.' No, this is the legislation that was supposed to be passed last year. Let's not wait any longer. Let's bring it to the floor as the first order of business and pass a highway bill. It is also a bill that deals with jobs and opportunity and economic growth in every State in this country. We have a responsibility, in my judgment, to bring it to the floor and to move it. 
Second, I hope in the next days we will pass a piece of legislation that the House of Representatives approved last year by an overwhelming vote. This bill deals with the Internal Revenue Service. It would change how the IRS does its business. It would make significant, important changes in the relationship between the Internal Revenue Service and the American taxpayer. The Senate should pass that bill quickly. It ought to be this week or next week. That ought to be at the front end of the business of this Senate. 
Last night President Clinton came to Capitol Hill and in his 
State of the Union Address talked about the agenda that he thinks Congress ought to consider. At least one of the items of that agenda, which I expect will be controversial but really should not be, is the issue of managed care. I want to describe why this is so important. 
President Clinton last night talked about the number of Americans who are now in managed care plans. Well over 100 million Americans are now in these plans. All of us have heard the stories about what managed care means to our families. 
Peter Van Etten of Stanford Health Services, in Time magazine, said this on April 14: `In the insanity of economics in health care, the patient always loses.' 
President Clinton last night said there ought to be a patient's bill of rights. Let me give some real-life examples that will demonstrate the importance of this issue. 
In California, an employee who suffered from hemophilia was unable to find out whether the new insurance plan offered by his employer would cover his blood-clotting concentrates unless he first joined the plan. In other words, they said you either decide to join or not to join, and we won't tell you whether this covers you as a hemophiliac. What kind of health care plan is that? 
A large California HMO denied a referral of an 8-year-old girl suffering from a rare cancer called Wilms' tumor. According to the National Cancer Institutes' protocol for this type of cancer, the girl should have been referred to a Wilms' tumor multi-disciplinary team. But the HMO covering this girl demanded the surgery she required be performed by a urologist who did not specialize in pediatrics and who never before performed this surgery. Even though that HMO had a relationship with a local teaching hospital, which, in fact, did have a Wilms' tumor team, the family was told they would have to go out of the plan and that even the girl's hospital stay would not be covered by the HMO. This, by the way, ended up in court. The HMO was fined a half a million dollars by the California Department of Corporations.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we begin a new year in the U.S. Congress, the second session of this Congress, I look forward with anticipation to a number of issues we must address. I hope we can do that in a bipartisan way, and I hope we will not be distracted by a lot of other things that come up during the year and that we will actually accomplish some good things for the country. 
I recognize that outside this Chamber there is now a scandal that exists in this country. We will undoubtedly learn the facts about the allegations that have been made, and the American people will make a judgment based upon those facts. That is the way it should be. To make judgments about allegations and about rumors and about planted stories, and so on, before the facts are known is not a proper way to deal with them. 
But notwithstanding what is happening outside this Chamber, we have responsibilities here. I was interested to learn that in the first hour and a half of this second session, we had people come to the Chamber of the Senate, once again, and tell us about how our country works and what is wrong with our country. It was interesting to me that the Chamber lights had hardly become warm when we had Members come to the floor to, once again, talk about who the big spenders are. `Oh, the big spenders on this side' and `the big spenders on'--it is interesting that nothing ever changes. 
I watched the American music awards show on television last night. I thought to myself as I listened to a bit of this this morning that, had this discussion taken place yesterday, we could have entered some of this dialog for best rap artist or best presentation in rap music. It certainly is a rap. There is no tune there, but they never miss a lyric. It is that this side represents the big spenders. 
I just want to begin for a moment today to talk about where we are and how we got here and what our need is this year to address critical issues for this country. 
First of all, where are we? We are in a country that is blessed with a very strong economy. Things are going well in this country. Unemployment is down. Welfare is down. Crime is down. Inflation is down. Economic growth is up. More people are working. Things are better in this country. 
I heard not too many minutes ago someone say, `But none of that has anything to do with Congress; it has to do with a good economy.' I remind Members of Congress that in 1993, this President and this Congress decided to take a tough vote. Are we going to put this country back on track? Are we going to tell the American people that we are serious about wrestling this crippling budget deficit to the ground? Are we going to cast a hard vote, an unpopular vote, a tough vote? The answer was yes. We did, by one vote in the U.S. Senate and one vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, cut spending. Yes, we increased some taxes, and we said to the American people we are serious about getting this country's fiscal house in order. We are going to wrestle that Federal deficit to the ground. And the fact is, it gave the American people confidence. They said, `These folks are serious; they understand this is a serious problem for this country and they are willing to make tough votes.' 
I went home to my State and said, `I voted yes. I voted yes because I believe it is the best thing for this country to send a signal to the markets, the American citizens and everyone in this world that this country cares about these issues and we intend, this President intends and this Congress intends, to get our fiscal house in order.' And by one vote we passed a plan in 1993 that set this economy off into a universe of economic growth and economic opportunity--by one vote. 
This economy rests on people's confidence. If people are confident about the future, they do things that reflect that confidence: They buy cars; they buy houses; they invest; they do things that reflect their confidence about the future. If they are not confident, they make different decisions. Based on people's confidence or lack of it, this economy moves forward or lurches backward. 
My point is, for someone to say this is all accidental is to ignore history. This is not accidental. This President deserves some credit for a fiscal policy that was tough and no nonsense and said we care about wrestling this Federal budget deficit to the ground. And this Congress, those of us in it who voted yes on that, participated in it. 
I might add, while people are pointing across aisles, as I heard earlier, about big spending in the Congress, we did not even get one vote by accident from the other side of the aisle for a fiscal policy that says we are going to solve this deficit 
 problem. 
We come to today with a good economy and, I think, some good news ahead of us. I hope all of us, reaching across the aisle, can decide we have a common agenda. When people sit around their homes in the evening and have supper together and talk about their lives, what do they talk about? They talk about these things: Are our kids going to a good school, getting a good education? Do we have a good job or opportunity for a decent job that pays well with decent benefits? Do our children or grandparents have an opportunity for health care that is good? Can they afford it? Are our streets safe, our neighborhoods safe? Is the air clean, the water we drink safe, the food we eat safe? What about our roads? In what condition are our roads and bridges? And what about family farms and those who produce our food? Those are the issues that people care about and want us to do something about. 
Let me tick off about four areas that we have to grapple with quickly. We just heard two discussions a moment ago about surplus. One said we are not spending enough money; we need to spend more on defense. The second one said it is the other folks over here on this side of the aisle who are the big spenders, and so forth, and talked about the surplus. There is no surplus. 
The only basis on which anyone can claim they balanced the budget is to take nearly $100 billion out of Social Security trust funds and use it over in the budget to claim there is a surplus. There is no surplus, and no one in this room ought to be persuaded to spend the surplus that doesn't exist. To the extent we will have a surplus after we have made whole the Social Security funds and used those trust funds for the purpose for which they were intended, when we get to that point, and only when we get to that point, will we have a surplus. And when we do, I think at least a part of that surplus ought to be used to pay down just a part of the Federal debt. In good times, you ought to be able to reduce indebtedness. But no one ought to rush around talking about a surplus that doesn't exist. 
I believe that President Clinton will call tonight to use the accumulated revenues that come from a better economy to make good on those trust fund bonds, and that is exactly what we ought to do. No one ought to claim a surplus as long as those who are using those trust funds are using them as operating revenues. 
Let me tell the Presiding Officer that, if you look at the Congressional Budget Office, which puts out byzantine reports, their most recent report shows that if a budget which they claim is in balance at some point--next year, I guess--they claim that the debt won't continue to grow. Why will they claim that? Because they don't include all the debt. I have just written them a letter saying you can't give us half-answers and half-truths. The answer is, when they claim the budget is in balance, the Federal debt will continue to increase, which is prima facie evidence that this notion of a budget being in balance when you are misusing Social Security trust funds is a fraud. 
Campaign finance reform. We must address it and do it quickly. We had a little house race in New York State. In the middle of that race for one house seat in New York State, $800,000 of out-of-State money came in under the notion of express issue advocacy, brought in against a candidate--I understand that was not money accountable to anybody; it could be soft money, corporate money--brought in precisely to defeat a congressional candidate, but essentially laundered through a system that now permits that kind of laundering so that no one in that district will ever know whose money it was. Is it unlimited corporate money that goes into this system and then is washed up through some congressional district someplace to defeat a specific candidate and, therefore, it is not accountable? It is polluting the political system. It is wrong, and anyone in this Chamber who stands up and defends that, in my judgment, doesn't understand what the Founding Fathers decided about this political system of ours. 
That ought not be the case, and we ought to take steps to change it. We are going to push and push in this Chamber to get a vote on these issues and get campaign finance reform done. Some will continue to filibuster. They have a right to filibuster, but the American people have a right to expect us to clean up this mess, and the sooner the better. 
Health care. We ought to deal with health care. We ought to do that soon. I read in the New York Times about a woman who had fallen in an accident. Her brain was swelling. She was in an ambulance being rushed to the hospital. She had the presence of mind to say to the ambulance drivers, `I don't want to go to the nearest hospital,' and she named it by name. `I want to be taken to a hospital farther away.' This is a woman with a brain injury, in the back of an ambulance, speeding down the street. She said that because she knew by reputation that when you are wheeled into that nearest hospital, your health is a matter of their bottom line--dollars and cents. She said, `I want to go to a hospital where I am wheeled into an emergency room where they are not going to look at me with respect to dollars and cents.' 
Managed care. What does it mean to quality of care all across this country? We ought to address that. Do patients have rights? If so, what are the rights? Do they have a right to find out from their doctors in this country what the treatment options are? If not, why not? Who is withholding that information from patients and why? Which patient doesn't get it? Is it some function of a bottom line in some company that is making money off health care? Is it some 24-year-old accountant in some office 200 miles away that is telling a doctor what kind of health care that doctor can perform on that patient and what the doctor can tell that patient about the patient's options? This Congress has a right and a responsibility to deal with those health care issues, and we ought to do it soon in this session. 
Mr. President, the issue of education is also critically important. There isn't a country that shortchanges education and remains a strong world-class power. Thomas Jefferson, at the start of this system, said anyone who believes this country can be ignorant and free believes in something that never was and never will be. 
We can do things to improve education in the country, but I am not one who believes it is bankrupt. How did we get to where we are? Does anyone want to leave this country to find better health care somewhere else? Do you know anybody who wants to go to a world-class university who looks overseas? Most of them are here in this country. 
I am not one who says it is a bankrupt system, but we can improve it. We ought to get reports on our schools. We get reports about our kids. As parents and taxpayers, we deserve a report card about how our schools are doing in educating our kids. 
Finally, Mr. President, we need to deal with the highway bill, and we need to do that quickly. On our agenda, we ought to decide tomorrow the highway bill ought to be brought to the floor of the Senate. We were supposed to have done it last year and didn't. 
And we were told now it will be the first item on the agenda this year. 
I am told it may wait until the budget bill. I appeared on a television program this morning with the chairman of the relevant committee in the House of Representatives. He says, well, he is ready to bring up the bill in the House, but he has an agreement with the Speaker not to bring it up until the budget bill. That means 2, 3, or 4 months from now. That cannot happen. 
We cannot wait 3 or 4 months for a highway bill that was supposed to have been passed last year. You do that and you have contractors in States that cannot do bid lettings, you have people being laid off of projects where the project should go forward to build and repair roads and bridges. So we cannot do that. 
We need to expect, in the next day or two, that the majority leader will do what he told us he would do; that is, bring the highway bill to the floor of the Senate. Let us debate it and let us move it out. 
Oh, they are worried about an amendment that is going to be offered to it. I understand that. But, you know, you can worry about amendments forever. Bring the bill to the floor, let us have a vote on the amendments and send the bill to conference --and let us put some pressure on the Speaker to do the same on the House side--and get a highway bill out so the American people can have some certainty about what kind of investment we are going to make in bridges and roads and repairs and the building of that infrastructure. 
People pay taxes. It goes into a trust fund to do it. And I think they should be able to expect that we are going to do what is necessary. 
Finally, Mr. President--and I know the Senator from Minnesota is waiting to speak so I will finish--I want to say, in the midst of all that is happening in this country now, there are some who perhaps get discouraged about this process of ours. And I understand why that can be the case. It is an unusual process. 
A free and open democratic society is in some cases a society that does not look good from time to time. And yet, if you look at our system through a couple hundred years of very successful democracy, you see as democracies pass through angst and anxiety and pain and suffering and all the other things, it tends to make an open and democratic society make tough, thoughtful decisions about its future. 
We have abolished slavery. We have survived depressions. We have defeated Hitler. We have cured polio. We have sent people to the Moon. I mean, we can talk a lot about what this country has endured and what this country has done. 
My only point is, I do not think any of us ought to at this point in time be discouraged about democracy and about Congress and about our Government and about the press and about all the institutions in our lives. It is a good place to be. I do not know of anybody who wants to go elsewhere. I do not know of anybody who wants to exchange it for some other location in the world. 
We should not be discouraged. Our job, it seems to me, is to do our work for the American people. And there is plenty of work to do. I have mentioned some--education, health care, finish the job on fiscal policy, deal with highways, deal with campaign finance reform, and more. And that is just a start. 
I am here and I am ready, and I hope my colleagues feel the same. We ought to join hands and say there are things that Democrats and Republicans believe in and can do together. And we will be persuaded to do that if we can just turn off the rap music, turn off the rap that one side is all wrong and the other side is all right, one side is big spenders and the other side is not. 
I finally say this. I do not think there is a plugged nickel's worth of difference between the two aisles in the U.S. Senate--Republicans and Democrats--in terms of how much they want to spend. Is there a difference on what they want to spend money for? Absolutely. But I will guarantee you, for everybody who stands up on one side of the aisle wanting to spend money on one program, there is somebody on the other side standing there saying, `No. I want it spent on my priorities.' What we need to do is join together and, through this process, find the right priorities for this country's future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues who share my belief that it is fundamentally unfair for Indian children placed by tribal courts to be ineligible for IV-E assistance even though these children otherwise meet the eligibility requirements. In my judgment, we have a responsibility, both because of the Federal Government's trust relationship with Indian tribes and because of the desperate need that exists in Indian country for this funding, to correct this oversight as quickly as possible.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, because the proposal for fast-track trade authority was not adopted, there have been a good many columns and commentators evaluating why fast track failed. I wanted to comment about that just a bit today. It is interesting. Even though the political pathologists for this legislation--the journalists, and the beltway insiders--have picked the fast track carcass clean, they still missed the cause of death. 
The eulogies I read have no relationship to the deceased. Fast track didn't die because of unions and union opposition to fast track. Fast track didn't die because the President didn't have the strength to get it through the Congress. Fast track didn't die because our country doesn't want to engage in international trade. Fast track died because this country is deeply divided on trade issues. There is not a consensus in this country at this point on the issue of international trade. Instead of a national dialogue on trade we have at least a half dozen or more monologues on trade. 
What people miss when they evaluate what happened to fast track is the deep concern that this country has not done well in international trade, especially in our trade agreements. This did not matter very much during the first 25 years after the Second World War. We could make virtually any agreement with anybody and provide significant concessions under the guise of foreign policy and we could still win the trade competition with one hand tied behind our backs. We could do that because we were bigger, better, stronger, better prepared, and better able. Thus, trade policy was largely foreign policy. 
During the first 25 years after the Second World War, our incomes continued to rise in this country despite the fact that our trade policy was largely foreign policy. However, the second 25 years have told a different story, and we now face tougher and 
shrewder competition from countries that are very able to compete with us. And our trade policy must be more realistic and must be a trade policy that recognizes more the needs of this country. 
Will Rogers said something, probably 70 years ago, that speaks to our trade policy concerns. I gave an approximate quote of that here on the floor the other day. He describes the concern people have about trade, yes, even today. Let me tell you what he said. Speaking of the United States, he said,  
We have never lost a war and we have never won a conference. I believe that we could, without any degree of egotism, single-handedly lick any nation in the world. But we can't even confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on. 
A lot of people still feel this way about our country. We could lick any nation in the world but we can't confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on. `We have never lost a war and never won a conference,' Will Rogers said. 
What are the various interests here that cause all of this angst and anxiety? There is the interest of the corporations, particularly the very large corporations. They have an interest of profit. Their interest is to go somewhere else in the world and produce a product as cheaply as they can produce it and send it back to sell in America. That provides a profit. That is in their interest. It is a legitimate interest on behalf of their stockholders, but it is their interest. Is it parallel to the national interest? 
Economists: their interest is seeing this in theory in terms of the doctrine of comparative advantage. Now this was first preached at a time when there weren't corporations, only nations. This is the notion that each nation should do what it is best prepared and equipped to do and then trade with others for that which it is least able to do. 
Consumers: consumers have an interest, in some cases, of trying to buy the cheapest or least expensive product available. 
Workers: workers want to keep their jobs and want to have good jobs and want to have a future and an opportunity for a job that pays well, with decent benefits. 
Then there are the big thinkers. Those are the people who think they know more than all the rest of us. They understand that trade policy is simply called trade policy. Actually, they still want it to be foreign policy. Incidentally, some of those big thinkers were around last week. When the real debate about fast track got going, who rushed to Capitol Hill? The Secretary of State, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, came here because we still have some of those big thinkers who believe trade policy must inevitably be foreign policy in our country. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, `The question is not where you stand but in what direction are you moving?' You must always move, you must not drift or lie at anchor. 
The question is, now that fast track has failed, what direction are we moving? What is our interest in trade? What can spark a national consensus on trade issues? What are the new goals? 
First of all, I think most Americans would understand that we want our country to be a leader in trade. Our country should lead in the area of expanding world trade. Yet the real question is, how do we lead and where do we lead? 
I think the starting point is this. We have the largest trade deficits in this country's history. Most Americans viscerally understand that. We have the largest trade deficits in our country's history, and they are getting worse, not better. We must do something about it. 
We have specific and vexing trade problems that go unresolved. I have mentioned many times on the floor of the Senate the trade problem with Canada, which is not the largest problem we have. Yet, it is a huge problem for the people that it affects. I am talking about the flood of unfairly traded Canadian grain that is undercutting our farmers' interests. 
I just got off the phone with a farmer an hour ago. He was calling from North Dakota. He said the price of grain is down, way down. He's trying to compete with terribly unfair imports coming in through his back door from a state trading enterprise which would be illegal in this country and are sold at secret prices. 
Trade problems which go unresolved fester and infect, and that is what causes many in this country to have a sour feeling about this country's trade policy. Because of a range of these problems, this country does not have a consensus on trade policy, at least not a consensus that Congress should pass fast track. 
Last weekend and early this week when fast track failed to get the needed votes to pass the Congress, there were people who almost had apoplectic seizures here in Washington, DC. They were falling over themselves, saying, `Woe is America. What on Earth is going happen?' 
Then we had countries in South America get into the act. I read in the paper that one of the countries in South America said, `You know, if the United States can't have fast-track trade authority then we are going to have to negotiate with somebody else.' 
Oh, really? Who are you going to negotiate with? Have you found a substitute for the American marketplace anywhere on the globe? Is there anywhere on Earth that a substitute for the American marketplace exists? Maybe you want to negotiate with Nigeria? How about Zambia? Zambia has a lower gross national product than the partners of Goldman Sachs have income. So go negotiate with Zambia. 
Would our trading partners do us a favor, and not think the world is coming apart because we have not passed fast track? They need to understand that we want expanded trade. In the debate about trade we want to have embedded some notion about responsibilities. These are the responsibilities that we have as a country to decide that our trade policy must also reflect our values. These values are about the environment, about safe workplaces, about children working, about food safety and, yes, about human rights. 
Does that mean we want to impose our values, imprint them, stamp them in every circumstance around the globe for a condition of trade? No. It does mean there is a bar at some point that we establish that says this minimum represents the set of values that we care about with respect to our trade relations. 
Do we care if another country allows firms to hire 12-year-old kids, work them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour and then ships these products to Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Fargo? Yes, the consumer gets a cheaper product, but do we want 12-year-old kids working somewhere to produce it? Do we care that they compete with a company in this country that is unable to hire kids because this country is unwilling to let companies hire kids? We also say to these companies that they cannot dump chemicals into the air and into the water. We require a safe workplace. We require that a living wage be paid. At least we have minimum wage conditions. 
We need to answer those questions. What really is fair trade? In whose interests do we fight for the set of values that we want for our future in our trade policies? 
As we seek a new consensus on trade in this country, I hope that consensus will include the following goals: 
First, it would be in this country's interest to end its chronic trade deficits. For 21 years in a row we have had chronic, nagging, growing trade deficits. I hope that as a goal we will decide that it is in this country's interest to end these trade deficits. Hopefully we would do it by increasing net exports from this country. 
Second, we want more and better jobs in this country. That means our trade agreements ought to be designed to foster and improve job conditions in this country and living standards. As a part of that we need to require that our values are reflected in our trade policies, including our concerns about others who do not respect the rights of children and the environment. 
Third, we need mandatory enforcement of trade agreements. Let us finally enforce the trade agreements we have made in the past. There are too many agreements that our trading partners are not abiding by. Let us not consign American producers and American workers to some wilderness out there facing vexing trade problems that cannot and will not be solved. Let's decide as a country, if an agreement is worth making, it is worth enforcing. Let us stand up to Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan and others and say, `If you are going to have trade agreements with us, this country insists on its behalf and on behalf of its farmers, workers and employers that we are going to enforce trade agreements.' 
Fourth, let us end the currency trap doors in trade agreements. When we make a trade agreement with some country and they devalue their currency, all the benefits of that trade agreement, and much, much more, are swept away in an instant. 
Fifth, all trade agreements should relate to the question of whether they contribute to this country's national security. 
These are the values that I think make sense for this country to discuss and consider as it tries to seek a new consensus on 
trade policy. 
Once again, those who do the autopsies on failed public policies, including fast track during this last week, should not miss the cause of death. The reason fast track failed was because, as President Wilson once said, the murmur of public policy in this country comes not from this Chamber and not from the seats of learning in this town, but it comes from the factories and the farms and from the hills and the valleys of this country and from the homes of people who care about what happens to the economy of this country, and the economy of their State and their community. 
They are the ones who evaluate whether public policy is in their interest or in this country's interest. They are the ones, after all, who decide what happens in this Chamber, because they are the ones who sent us here and the ones who asked us to provide the kind of leadership toward a system of trade and economic policy that will result in a better country. 
Finally, Mr. President, I hope that as we discuss trade in the days ahead, it will be in a thoughtful, and not thoughtless, way. We do not need a discussion by those who say, `Well, fast track is dead, the protectionists win.' That is not what the vote was about. It is not what the issue was about, and it is not the way I think we will confront trade policies in the future.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an op-ed piece by Thomas Friedman. I commend it to my colleagues. He talks about the new American politics and especially about fast-track trade authority. He said we have a trade debate among people divided into four categories: 
The Integrationists: `These are people who believe freer trade and integration are either inevitable or good, and they want to promote more trade agreements and Internet connections from one end of the world to the other, 24 hours a day.' 
There are the Social Safety-Netters. `These are people who believe that we need to package global integration with programs that will assist the `know-nots' and `have-nots.' 
Then there are the Let-Them-Eat-Cakers. `These are people who believe that globalization is winner-take-all, loser-take-care-of-yourself. 
He provides an interesting statement of where he thinks all of the current key players in the debate find themselves. 
Now everyone in the fast-track debate is in my matrix: Bill Clinton is an Integrationist-Social-Safety-Netter. Newt Gingrich is an Integrationist-Let-Them-Eat-Caker. Dick Gephardt is a Separatist-Social-Safety-Netter and Ross Perot is a Separatist-Let-Them-Eat-Caker. 
If that piques your interest, I encourage you to look at this particular piece by Thomas Friedman in which he describes his interesting matrix of trade policy and the need to build a new consensus. 
Finally, I want to say that what this country needs most at this point is to understand there is not now a consensus on trade policy. I say to the President and I say to the corporations and labor unions and the people in this country that it is time to develop a new consensus. I am interested, for one, in finding a way to bridge the gaps among all of the competing interests in trade to see if we might be able to weave a quilt of public policy that represents this country's best interest in advancing our economy and our American values. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] raised a question about the highway issue. I just wanted to follow up briefly. 
The Senator from Mississippi will recall that the chairman of the transportation committee of the other side some many weeks ago indicated he would not even go to conference on a 6-year bill, and so we got tangled up for a lot of reasons, including I think the desire of some on the other side only to consider a 6-month bill. That pole vaults this into next year at some point when the Senator talks about May 1. I understand and share with him the need to be some end date that applies the pressure to say now we need to get the 6-year bill and get it done, because we cannot continue this approach of incremental funding without some understanding by the States of what they have to work with in the long run. 
I have not had an opportunity to make contact or have discussions with folks in the other body, but when they indicated an unwillingness even to go to conference if we come up with a 6-year bill, it suggests an approach radically different than most of us in the Senate would have wanted.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the comments of the Senator from Mississippi. I really share his desire to move on this early next year. I think the committee has done an exceptional job. I like the highway bill they brought to the floor, the 6-year bill. If we can move something like that early next year, I think we will have provided some significant leadership. So I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Mississippi.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the North American Free-Trade Agreement is an example of trade agreements established under fast-track procedures, then it should be no surprise that the vast majority of American citizens oppose renewing fast-track authority to the President. 
An editorial published earlier this year in the Bismarck, ND Tribune stated that before Congress grants fast-track authority to the President, `The American people deserve a much better accounting than we have received so far of the impact of the first three years of the NAFTA.' 
The question of accountability and the performance of our Nation's current trade policies is the underlying issue in the debate whether this Congress should provide renewed fast-track authority. 
In a few weeks we will mark the fourth anniversary of the passage of NAFTA by Congress. It is not surprising that the proponents of fast track do not want to associate fast track with NAFTA. The simple fact is that NAFTA has been an unmitigated failure. 
At a time when we have been hearing new promises being made to advance the cause of fast track, we need to remember the promises that were made to gain the passage of NAFTA. 
We were promised increased exports, a greater number of jobs, and that these jobs would be higher paying jobs. We were promised improved living standards, reduced trade distortions, and improved competitiveness for the United States in North America and global markets. At the same time, the American public was promised that the environment would be protected, that drugs would be interdicted, that public welfare would be safeguarded, and basic human rights would be enhanced. 
Yet, the facts show that NAFTA just doesn't measure up to its promises. The very first measure of failure is demonstrated in our trade balances with our NAFTA trading partners. The United States has gone from having a $2 billion trade surplus prior to NAFTA with Mexico to a $16 billion deficit this past year. At the same time, our trade deficit with Canada has more than doubled, escalating from $11 billion to $23 billion. 
In its editorial review of NAFTA, the Bismarck Tribune concluded, `There has been enough pain associated with NAFTA and other trade agreements for Americans to insist on a scorecard we can read and understand before we go further.' 
I agree that we need a scorecard. It is for this reason that I am introducing the NAFTA Accountability Act today, together with Senators Byrd, Campbell, Hollings, Inouye, Wellstone, and Snowe. 
We need accountability. Promises that are made should be fulfilled. If they aren't, we need to go back to the drawing board and make the changes that are necessary to achieve the goals and promises that were originally set forth in NAFTA's preamble and statement of objectives. 
This bill would establish benchmarks by which we could score NAFTA, including expanded markets, currency stability, jobs wages and living standards, U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, health and environment, illegal drugs, protection of rights, fair agricultural trade, and highway safety. 
If NAFTA does not meet these benchmarks as promised, then the United States would provide notice and withdraw from NAFTA. In addition, the bill authorizes and directs the President to renegotiate provisions of NAFTA to correct trade deficits and currency distortions, to correct job loss, to protect public health and the environment, to interdict drug traffic, to correct agricultural provisions, and to ensure compliance with U.S. transportation standards. 
We have watched our trade deficits with our NAFTA partners grow by 433 percent since this trade agreement took effect. The growth in these trade deficits mean that this Nation has suffered job losses. A recent analysis by the Economic Policy Institute concludes that there has been a net loss of 395,000 U.S. jobs as a result of NAFTA. In fact, the study demonstrates that every State has suffered net job losses as a result of the increased trade deficits under NAFTA. 
These job losses range from 633 job losses in my home State of North Dakota to 38,406 job losses in California. Now 633 jobs may not sound like much, but that is twice the size of my hometown of Regent. ND. If a new employer provided that many jobs in an economic development program, it would be considered a major accomplishment in my State. 
States which had significant production in automobiles, computers, electrical appliances, textiles, and apparel had jobs losses disproportionate to their share of overall U.S. job losses. 
It should be noted that 228,000 of these job losses were attributed to the trade deficits with Mexico, while 167,000 of these job losses resulted from deficits with Canada. If we 
remember the promises of NAFTA, the promises were that this trade agreement would result in at least 220,000 high-paying jobs. 
I am always intrigued by those that only look at one side of the trade ledger, and never account for the net trade balance. Unfortunately, we cannot get a good picture of this because the Commerce Department only makes estimates of exports on a State-by-State basis. There is no data compiled on a State-by-State basis of foreign imports. As a result, there is not even a statistical basis on which to look at the full ledger on trade balances on a State-by-State basis. 
However, we can make some general comparisons that can be helpful. For example, one widely distributed study indicates that North Dakota ranked third among the States in increased exports to Mexico. While that sounds pretty fantastic, it also needs to be put into context. The 320-percent increase in annual exports from North Dakota to Mexico is from the base of $3.0 million which has now grown to $9.7 million in exports. While the increases are substantial as a percentage, they are not very significant in dollars terms in the State's overall economy. In fact, another economic analysis indicates that North Dakota had a trade deficit with Mexico in the neighborhood of $3.4 million. 
Similarly, the export study reports that North Dakota had an increase of 35 percent in exports to Canada from $298 million to $402 million. Before we conclude that North Dakota is doing well as a result of NAFTA, we need to look at other pieces of my State's economy. 
While North Dakota experienced an annual increase of $114 million in export sales to our NAFTA partners, at the same time North Dakota is losing $222 million annually in income from the unfair export of Canadian durum wheat and barley into the United States. In other words, the loss of annual agricultural income in a couple of farm commodities alone has cost North Dakota almost twice as it has gained in increased export sales. 
I want to note that one of the provisions of the NAFTA Accountability Act would require the President to renegotiate the terms of NAFTA to prevent Canadian grain exports from unfairly displacing United States production. This is just one of many provisions within this legislation that would require that the promises made to secure the passage of NAFTA be kept. 
Unfortunately, the American public did not get a warranty on the promises when NAFTA was passed. That is why they are rightfully skeptical of further fast-track trade procedures and the expansion of NAFTA. As indicated in the Bismarck Tribune editorial, Americans need a scorecard before we continue to go down on our current trade policy track. I would urge my colleagues to join me as sponsors of the NAFTA Accountability Act so that Americans would have that scorecard, as well as the means by which to make necessary corrections to NAFTA.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the presentation by my colleague, Senator Conrad. He is presenting today, and I join him in presenting, a picture of water issues in North Dakota that are critically important to the future of our State. I would like to describe for my colleagues why this is the case and what we propose to do to respond to the water needs of our region. 
We live in a semiarid State, Mr. President. North Dakota gets 15 to 17 inches of rainfall a year. About 100 years ago, John Wesley Powell told the North Dakota Constitutional Convention in the year 1888 that North Dakota would have a series of years when they would have abundant crops, and then for 2 or 3 years, they would have less rainfall. There will be failure of crops, and disaster will come on thousands of people who will become discouraged and leave. 
That is the history of those who live on the border between humid and arid lands. 
This is a picture showing some of the crusted dirt of parched soil that has not had enough moisture. What has happened in our State is exactly what was predicted a century ago. We are a wonderful, bountiful agricultural State, but we do suffer being a semiarid State with the lack of rainfall, lack of water. We wanted to try to do something about that, to provide some stability. 
The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, held up a picture that showed water in jars. It is interesting, I come from southwestern North Dakota and know a lot about the water-quality issue Senator Conrad was talking about. A fellow brought a jar of water to one of our hearings, and he sat the jar on the table. You would have sworn it was tobacco juice; if not tobacco juice, at least strong coffee; and if not strong coffee, very strong tea. But, no, that jar of brown water was his drinking water. It was from his well. 
We suffer water-quality problems in addition to the lack of water in North Dakota, which is a semiarid State. We have known 
now for a century the consequences of that. The consequences of that are imposed upon our economic well-being in a State that is a wonderful State, but suffers from having 42 of its 53 counties declining in population. Only 11 counties have a growing population. 
Mr. President, I come from a county in southwestern North Dakota. It had a population of 5,000 when I left. It now has a population of 3,000. The neighboring county, about the same size as my home county, is called Slope County. It is the size of the State of Rhode Island in landmass. Nine hundred citizens live in Slope County, and last year there were only seven babies born in Slope County. I say that just to give people an understanding of the size of our State and what is happening in some of the rural counties where the population is shrinking and we are seeing outmigration. Yet we are a State that is recognized as one of the most bountiful agricultural States in America. 
Something happened in the 1940's that portended for us a change. What happened in the 1940's was the discussion of the Pick-Sloan plan that would create flood control down the reaches of the Missouri River with a series of dams. In 1943, there was a great flood on the Missouri River, and it crippled the delivery of supplies for American troops fighting in World War II to the gulf ports. It brought home, more than anything, the need for reliable transportation and navigation on the river, for reliable flood control on the river. 
From it was born the Pick-Sloan plan to try to harness the Missouri River and create a series of dams that would provide flood control and a range of other benefits. 
As part of that plan, we were told in North Dakota, because the Federal Government wishes to harness the Missouri River and create six dams in order to do so, we would like you in North Dakota to do us a favor. We would like you to host a flood that comes and stays. We would like to create a 500,000-acre flood in North Dakota, about the size of the State of Rhode Island. We want to take a Rhode Island-size flood, put it in your State by backing up the river with a dam and you keep it there. A flood that comes and stays forever. 
North Dakotans thought about that a little bit and said, `Gee, so you want to give us a Rhode Island-size flood, what does that mean for us?' 
The Federal Government said, `Well, you need to understand the second half of this. We would like you to host a flood that comes and stays, but we propose to give you a very significant benefit. You are a semiarid State. We would like you to be able to take water from behind that dam and from that flood and move it all around your State in order to deal with water quality and water accessibility and irrigation all across your State.' 
The people of North Dakota thought, `Gosh, that sounds like a really good deal, something needed in our State.' 
From that was born the Garrison Diversion Project. Behind the Garrison Dam, the ability to divert water all around our State to irrigate, provide good quality drinking water, to provide assured supplies of water for municipal and industrial use in cities and, yes, even in the eastern part of our State who are served by the Red River, which has run dry in the past. All of that sounded good to North Dakota, so we got the flood. 
Elbow Woods--where my dad lived as a young boy and used to herd horses up on the Indian reservation--Elbow Woods doesn't exist anymore. It is a community that is gone because now where Elbow Woods stood is a lake, a flood. Elbow Woods and other communities were flooded, and the Indian population moved to the upland, so the flood came and stayed. 
But when President Eisenhower went out to dedicate the dam that held back the water and created the flood and the people were moved and we had the Rhode Island-size flood, it took a while for the benefits to come to North Dakota. We had the cost now. The cost was this flood, but the benefits were something else. The benefits kept shrinking and shrinking because controversy 
developed, and finally we passed a piece of legislation in 1965 and another one in 1986 to try to make sure that we got the benefits we were promised. 
At least part of the benefits were to, for example, move water throughout North Dakota. From the 1986 act, we finally have water coming to southwestern North Dakota. We have a plan to move water to northwestern North Dakota. These areas are areas from where we see this picture about the drinking water that looks like tobacco juice. This now represents an area that is getting water from the Missouri River, good quality water moved to all these communities, which helps them enormously. But more needs to be done. We cannot finish the project and complete the promise given to our State until we enact changes once more in the Garrison diversion legislation. 
It has been enormously controversial. Canada has objected; environmental groups have objected. So we put together a group of elected officials who are the elected leaders of North Dakota--the Governor, the congressional delegation, the Republicans and Democrats who are leaders in the State legislature--House and Senate--and we created a negotiating team. All of us, which is pretty unusual, sat around a table for many, many months at various periods and negotiated a bipartisan solution that will finish this plan for North Dakota. When finished, we hope it will provide this kind of sight all across our State in small towns and big towns, on farms, in cities--clean drinking water enjoyed by North Dakota, opportunities from water delivery to all parts of our State. That is what we hope the benefits of this plan will be. 
I have taken some time to give a much broader history of how we have gotten to this point, simply because I want people to understand, this does not have as its origin in our State coming to Washington saying, `Give us something, please; we'd like you to give us a plan, please.' That was not the origin. The origin was the Federal Government going to North Dakota saying, `Please play host to a flood the size of the State of Rhode Island that will be forever in your State, and we will promise you that you will get from that an opportunity to move good quality water throughout the State for municipal, rural, and industrial purposes, and for irrigation.' 
What has happened to us is we bore the cost of the flood, but we never received the full flower of the benefits that were promised us under the act. 
Senator Conrad and I and our colleague, Congressman Pomeroy, in the House, today offer a bipartisan piece of legislation that will, if completed, finally allow us to realize the full benefits of this project. 
I am not going to go into all the details of it except to say that the compromise that we offer finally allows us to connect the waterworks, to get water to eastern North Dakota, and an assured supply of water for some of the largest communities in North Dakota that live along the Red River. 
It addresses in a very significant way the concerns that were expressed by environmental organizations. It addresses the issues that were raised by a number of others who have had concerns about the project. In short, it says, let us finish this project in a way that satisfies the interests and needs of North Dakota, but also do it in a way that addresses the concerns others have raised about this project. 
This project is fiscally responsible. It would in fact, if completed the way we envision, cut nearly $200 million from the current authorization. So we are talking about completing a project in a different way but cutting up to $200 million from the current authorized level for this project. The Act provides substantial environmental benefits, incentives for water conservation, the creation of a natural resources trust, and additional incentives for the State to establish and meet other specified conservation goals. So it provides substantial environmental benefits. 
We believe that the cooperative effort with the congressional delegation and the State's political leaders have vastly strengthened this bill. I want to commend especially the North Dakota chapter of the Wildlife Society, which, incidentally, wrote a letter saying: `We support this compromise. This compromise meets the test of being environmentally sound.' 
The third test this bill meets is that it provides more in economic development than natural resource enhancement alone. Water is necessary for all life, but in a semi-arid plain State it is critical. 
I began this description by talking about the outmigration from rural counties and the desperate need to try to pump some economic life into those counties. One way to do that is to have an assured supply of good water. The fourth test this bill meets is project completion. This finally would complete the project and allow North Dakota to realize the full promise that the Federal Government gave North Dakota. 
Finally, our bill represents a rare consensus among all the major participants in State water development and conservation. It is a rare thing, I suppose, to hear these days that this is a bipartisan plan. It is the product of Republicans and Democrats sitting around a table, not describing themselves as partisans, not describing themselves by their political party, but describing themselves as leaders serving North Dakota's long-term interests. We did that. And I am very pleased with the result. 
Senator Conrad described the support across North Dakota. And we are going to put in the Congressional Record the letters of support from all of the people who have written us, communities and many, many others, for this project.

Mr. DORGAN. Finally, Mr. President, let me add my compliments to Senator Conrad himself. Senator Conrad has played an instrumental role in getting us to this point. We would not be here without Senator Conrad's leadership. Let me also commend Senator Conrad's staff, and let me echo the words of praise that Senator Conrad gave to Doug Norell, the legislative director of my staff, and Ruth Fleischer and Andrea Nygren, and so many others. 
Congressman Pomeroy has played a critically important role 
here. Governor Schafer, the state legislative leaders, State senator Tim Mathern, State representative Merle Boucher, State representative John Dorso, State senator Gary Nelson all were important in getting us to this point. 
My hope is that we will now begin a process to move this legislation, have some hearings, and I hope at the end of this struggle--I am not sure when that end will occur; it is not clear that this is going to move quickly--but at the end of this struggle we in North Dakota will be able to look back and say, it was a long, hard fight, but we got what was promised for our State. And not only did we get what was promised, but it was important, critically important, for the long-term economy of North Dakota. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. It might be useful to discuss the plans as we proceed. We introduced the legislation today here in the Senate. It will be concurrently introduced in the House of Representatives by our colleague, Congressman Pomeroy. At that point my expectation would be that we will want to hold some hearings. 
This will likely be referred--without doing the Parliamentarian's job, I assume will be referred--to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which I sit. We expect to request some hearings by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. My expectation is we would want to perhaps hold some North Dakota hearings with the joint leadership in North Dakota to have an opportunity to further discuss this project. 
I want to emphasize something Senator Conrad just indicated. There will be opposition. This is a bipartisan approach, but there will be opposition. 
There is this old story about the radio announcer who was interviewing an old guy, some 85-year-old codger. And he said, `You've seen a lot of changes in your life, ain't you?' And the guy said, `Yeah, I sure have.' The old guy added, `I've been against all of them, too.'  
You know, there are people like that. They are against all changes until it is demonstrated that change was good, and then they say, `OK, now let me just oppose the next change.' So it is clear to me that we will have opposition. 
The test for us, however, is to have developed a plan, which I think this plan meets, that is sensitive to all of the issues that are raised in opposition. 
When environmental organizations say to us, `Well, we have some real problems with this,' I think what we are able to say is we worked with major environmental organizations in our State and negotiated with them, made changes relative to the recommendations they made, and they, I am pleased to say, have sent us a letter saying, `We support this approach.' 
We think this approach is a good compromise, meets the environmental tests. So my expectation is that today is getting this piece of reform legislation to the starting line. We have a hill ahead of us. The question is, how steep, how long does it take to get up the hill and down the other side? We will get there. The question is, how difficult is this and what is the timeframe? 
So I thought we might want to talk about that kind of approach today.

Mr. DORGAN. If you might yield for one additional point. 
I think what we say today when we introduce this legislation is, we say to the Federal Government, `Keep your promise. You made our State a promise. We expect the Federal Government to keep their promise.' This legislation, in our judgment, the combined judgment of the Governor, the congressional delegation, the elected leaders of the State legislature, on a bipartisan basis, we believe this legislation allows the Federal Government to keep its promise. 
There might be controversy here about this in this Chamber, but we would say that `You owe North Dakota this project. You promised it. We have the flood. The flood isn't going away. Now you must provide the benefits you promised, Federal Government.' So that is what we say today to the Federal Government: Keep your promise. 
We would say, I think, to those who are naysayers, those who look at this and say, `Well, we don't support this,' we want to hear you. We are willing to listen. We are going to hold hearings. If you have a better approach, if you have a better plan, tell us. If you have problems with this, tell us what those problems are. 
We want to address all the real problems that exist, but we intend at the end of the day to get for our State what was promised to our State. It is not just because we want to get something; it is because our State's economic future depends on our ability in the coming years to complete this project the way it was promised 
to North Dakota. 
So let me, finally, Mr. President--and I thank Senator Conrad for yielding--indicate that Senator Conrad already mentioned that Bob Van Heuvelen and Derik Fettig and Kirk Johnson of his staff played a very important role in this, as did Karen Frederickson and Amy Goffe of Congressman Pomeroy's staff. I don't know if we mentioned Dave Sprynczynatyk working for Governor Schafer, and Murray Sagsveen and Bob Harms, as well as critically important staff members at the State level, to help us formulate this set of amendments that we offered today to the U.S. Senate.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1997. I introduce this bill jointly with my colleague, Senator Kent Conrad, while our colleague in the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Earl Pomeroy, will introduce an identical companion bill. 
This bill is the most important piece of legislation I will introduce for my State. I say this because the key to North Dakota's future is economic development based on water resource management and development. And the key to water development in my State is the Dakota Water Resources Act. 
Over 100 years ago, John Wesley Powell of the U.S. Geological Survey told the North Dakota Constitutional Convention that the State would have: 
. . . a series of years when they will have abundant crops; then for two or three years they will have less rainfall and there will be failure of crops and disaster will come on thousands of people, who will become discouraged and leave. That is the history of those who live on the border between humid and arid lands. 
Well, I want to let my colleagues know that what was true in 1889 is still true in 1997. Thousands of people are leaving North Dakota for economic opportunity Denver, Minneapolis, and dozens of other places. Only 11 counties in North Dakota had population increases in the past decade. The root of the problem is the challenge of making a dependable living on farms in rural areas and of planning for a dependable economic future in major cities that do not now have reliable water supplies. 
Before turning to the main features of the Dakota Water Resources Act, I thought my colleagues would find it useful to know how the stoppage of war supplies in 1943 brought us to introduction of this legislation in 1997.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the final days of this session, the Congress is emersed in a debate over our Nation's trade policy. In my judgement, we have not focused enough attention on our policies that are hindering our ability to compete internationally and policies that are increasing our trade deficits. 
One issue that relates the ability of U.S. companies to compete internationally is the existing policy of the administration with respect to controls on the exportation of encryption technology. Currently, U.S. firms are the world leaders in encryption but other nations are gaining fast. Perhaps the greatest single factor in the erosion of U.S. dominance in encryption technology is the administration's export controls. 
As some of my colleagues know, there are several bills introduced in Congress to address encryption. The Senate Commerce Committee has even reported legislation in this area and I and the Senator from Montana, Senator Burns have been pushing alternative legislation that would require more realistic export controls on encryption. However, the administration does not need Congress to pass a law to change their policy in this area and I would like to encourage the administration to review their current policy and apply more realistic export controls on encryption technology. 
My understanding is that many other nations have multilaterally agreed to decontrol the export of computer software with encryption capabilities. Yet, the United States continues to impose unilateral controls. Thus, we have handicapped ourselves in the global market. 
Commercial products from companies in Germany, Japan, and England are securing more of the international market share because those nation's impose fewer restrictions on their encryption exports than we do. Mr. President, our Olympic team could not win if they had to compete with ankle weights. The same is true for American computer hardware and software companies. They face real competition in the international market place and their ability to provide strong information security features is costing them sales of computer systems and software packages. Lost sales will mean lost jobs. 
In my judgement we need to update American export control policy and catch up with modern realities of technology and the international market place. Unfortunately, rather than make real progress on this issue, the administration has raised all sort of new issues, such as attempting to impose more controls on domestic encryption. I hope that the administration will take a second look at their export controls and start making progress on developing a policy that will allow U.S. companies to compete. Short of that, I hope we will make some progress in the Senate in moving legislation sponsored by Senator Burns, the Pro-CODE bill, which will require a relocation of export controls, but done in a manner that is sensitive to national security and law enforcement concerns.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to combat our Nation's continual problem with drunk driving. This problem, that attacks young and old alike, is multifaceted and must be combating on several fronts. My bill addresses the need to take alcohol out of automobiles by establishing a national policy prohibiting open alcohol containers in automobiles. 
To put this problem in perspective, an average of one person every half hour dies as a result of drunk driving, and that worked out to be 17,272 alcohol-related fatalities in 1996 according to the Department of Transportation. This figure is over 40 percent of the total number of traffic fatalities in the United States. The sad irony in these statistics is that drunk driving is a preventable problem. 
Even more heart wrenching is that drunk driving is killing a disproportionate amount of our youth and young adults. In 1995, while 30 percent of our driving population was between the ages of 21-34, 50 percent of the fatalities and 50 percent of the drunk driving injuries were in this age group. That amounted to 6,760 dead and 95,800 injured young adults. 
One way we must combat drunk driving is to ban the consumption of alcohol in automobiles. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 22 States it is still legal for passengers in a vehicle to be drinking while the vehicle is in operation. And in 10 States, it is perfectly legal for a driver of a car to have one hand on the steering wheel and drinking a bottle of whisky in the other. It seems inexcusable to me that we have a circumstance in this country where citizens cannot be assured that in every State and in every local jurisdiction in the Nation that there are not laws against people drinking and driving at the same time. This legislation will provide that assurance and prohibit open containers in every State. 
I hope that the Senate will have a good debate on drunk driving issues early next year when we return to debate the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. I intend to offer this legislation as amendment to the ISTEA reauthorization and I urge my colleagues to support this effort.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as my colleagues in the Senate are well aware, one of the Nation's worst weather-related disasters of the year was the devastating flooding in Grand Forks, ND and the entire Red River Valley. This historic flood captured the attention of the Nation in late spring as over 95 percent of the residents of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks were evacuated from their homes and much of North Dakota's second largest city's downtown district was ravaged by fire and water. 
Disasters have a way of bringing out the true character of people, and that certainly was the case in North Dakota. History will have a dramatic record of the loss and devastation of the flood. I also hope that it will record the tremendous efforts made by many North Dakotans to survive and to rise to the occasion with heroic feats. 
Now that a few months have passed since the waters have subsided, it is time to reflect back on some of the many heroes--people that stepped up when their community needed them--whose efforts shined despite the rising waters. 
In a disaster the extreme importance of a communication system is pivotal in fighting back and preserving the safety of those in the area. Today, I would like to recognize the efforts of several US West Communications employees who worked tirelessly to maintain critical telephone service to the Grand Forks area throughout the flooding. 
On April 19, 1997 a crew of nine central office technicians barricaded themselves into the US West building in the heart of Grand Forks to keep the communication systems of the area up and running during the disaster. The extensive preventive work that the US West workers completed to get ready for the flooding would now be tested as their building was surrounded by 4 feet of water, and sat just one block away from a raging fire. The work of these men and women sustained phone service to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Federal Aviation Administration, State and local emergency workers, and so many others in the flooded region. 
To give you an idea of the challenges facing these workers, they labored night and day to keep the wires dry as 26 inches of water threatened basement cables. Sustained by the food, clothing, and cots delivered via boat by the National Guard, these folks stayed on as the area was evacuated by all other people. In light of this adversity--and armed with high-volume pumps, drying machines, and sandbags--these courageous people sustained service to 50,000 area customers and hundreds of emergency workers. 
I would like to recognize these heroes by name for their dedicated service is appreciated by me and many others touched by their efforts. The members of the initial emergency team were: Denny Braaten, Linda Potucek, Larry McNamara, Bob Schrader, Dan Kaiser, Dale Andrews, Glenda Wiess, Rick Hokenson, and Lew Ellingson. 
Two days later, US West reinforcements arrived to provide additional support and hard work. I would like to recognize these workers now: Don Jordan, Ray Jacobsen, Tim Kennedy, Roger Jones, Bruce Bengston, Gary Boser, Jim Falconer, Bion McNulty, Jack Olson, and Tim Rogers. 
I am tremendously proud of the courage and dedicated service demonstrated by the US West employees in Grand Forks. They, along with so many others who volunteered and continue the rebuilding efforts today, exemplify the North Dakota spirit.

Mr. DORGAN. Then let me say, reserving the right to object, it is my intention to inquire about when the majority leader intends to allow us to debate and perhaps get some votes on amendments on fast track. We didn't object to going to morning business yesterday. I guess we have a number of people who want to offer amendments on fast track. That has been put off and put off. In fact, the regular order would be an amendment that I have pending on fast track. So if the Senator would simply exclude the morning business request and then proceed with the discussion, I would like to try to have some understanding about when we might entertain amendments on fast track.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment pending on fast-track legislation, is the amendment I offered 2 days ago. It is an amendment called the End the Trade Deficit Act. It is S. 465, a piece of legislation that I previously introduced in the Senate that I now offer as an amendment. 
Let me describe why I bring this amendment to the floor of the Senate, especially when we are dealing with the fast-track legislation. 
Mr. President, this Congress has spent a great deal of time dealing with the fiscal policy budget deficit, and with some success. I might add that actions by the Congress and a healthy growing economy have substantially reduced the budget deficit. But there has been very little discussion about the other deficit. And that is the trade deficit. 
This country's trade deficit is the largest in history, and growing. For those who don't know much about the trade deficit, let me explain. Understandably you do not hear much about it. All we do is crow about our exports. We talk about how much we exported. Nobody talks about how much we have imported. It is like a business talking only about their receipts and refusing to talk about their expenditures. 
Here is the merchandise trade deficit. It is 21 years old. For 36 of the last 38 years we have had an overall trade deficit. For the last 21 years in a row we have had this merchandise trade deficit. This trade deficit represented here in red is getting worse--not better. The last 3 years in a row have seen record merchandise trade deficits. And this year it is expected to reach a record merchandise trade deficit. 
Some say the trade deficits are really quite good for this country. They must be ecstatic because these trade deficits are expected, according to some econometric forecasters, to go from $191 billion in the last fiscal year to $356 billion by the year 2005. Some will make the case, I am sure, that it depends on the kind of trade deficits you have; what the trade circumstances are; what the economic circumstances are of the various regions of the world. I understand all of that. 
But I say this: A trade deficit that is persistent and growing a trade deficit that represents a chronic 21-year uninterrupted set of trade deficits is not good for this country. 
I propose a piece of legislation, now offered as an amendment, to establish a commission the members of which would hold hearings and make recommendations to Congress on how this country can eliminate the trade deficit by the year 2007. 
We are having a discussion about fast track. It is a strategy that describes a procedure here in the Congress with respect to how we handle trade agreements. Most of us understand how trade agreements are negotiated. They are negotiated by trade negotiators sent overseas somewhere, in most cases. They close the door, have sessions, and come up with an agreement. They bring it back to the Congress, and they say, `Here is the agreement. Take it or leave it; up or down; no amendment.' 
But I want to also underscore why I feel so strongly about this issue, even as I discuss this amendment. I want to once again describe for my colleagues the dilemma we face with, for example, one free-trade agreement. This is the one with Canada. It is undoubtedly true that there are benefits to the free-trade agreement with Canada. I am sure that there are sectors in this country that can point to substantial success. 
I would say this with some certainty. Those who negotiated that United States-Canada trade agreement essentially traded away the interests of family farmers in our part of the country. And the result has been that in the post-Canada free trade agreement an avalanche of unfairly subsidized Canadian grain coming into our country sent here by a state-controlled enterprise called the Wheat Board--which would be illegal in this country--sent here with secret prices that they failed to disclose to anyone undercutting the market for our farmers especially in the area of Durum wheat, and we can't do anything about it. 
Oh, we can shout about it, and we can complain about it. We can send people to Canada, and make some noise about it. But the fact is that it does not get solved. It could have been solved. We could have tacked an amendment on the trade negotiation instrument that we negotiated with Canada when it came to the Congress. But fast track prevented any amendments. It predicted that we were going to have this problem, and it predicted that we weren't going to be able to do a thing about it--$220 million a year out of North Dakotans' pockets as a result of this unfair trade every year and it is growing worse--not better. 
Do we think fast track makes sense? Absolutely not. We have seen the result of bad trade agreements, and we have seen the result of trade agreements that do not give us the remedies that deal with patently unfair trade. 
Aside from the issue dealing with United States-Canada, I could spend a lot of time talking about our trade problems with Japan and China. I will not do it at this point. I have done it previously on the floor. 
But I want to say that the chronic, persistent trade deficits that go on year after year every year in this country are a problem. We need to address it. To the extent this continues and gets worse, clearly this trade deficit will be repaid with a lower standard of living in this country. Now, it is time for us and the Congress to address that issue. 
What causes the trade deficit, and what can we do to address the trade deficit? 
That is the reason I propose the establishment of a commission that would seriously and thoughtfully address this issue. 
Mr. President, in the interest of time I will cut short my comments at this point. 
We have two on the other side of the aisle who wish to address it, following which I would like to make a couple of additional comments. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas whetted my appetite once again on economic theory. I studied economics, taught economics in college briefly, and was most interested to hear the Senator from Texas. 
Because I did teach economics very briefly, I have heard all of the stories about economists, as the Senator from Texas has, and all the definitions. 
The one about, you know: An economist is one who can describe with all great details the workings of the world but can't remember his phone number. 
An economist is someone who looks at something that works in practice and wonders whether it can really work in theory. 
Let me, for a moment, respond to a couple of the points made by the Senator from Texas. First of all, I am happy to see if we can reach some agreement on some of these provisions. This does not propose to establish a commission with a bunch of political hacks, to use the words of the Senator from Texas. I have no interest in establishing a commission with political hacks. I am interested in establishing a commission that might address a real problem and make recommendations about how to respond to that problem. 
A couple of points first. The Senator from Texas mentioned Social Security several times. I just want to clear up a point. It really doesn't have very much to do with this. The Senator from Texas was mentioning Social Security in the context of domestic deficits, as something that is out of control. This year, Social Security will take in nearly $70 billion more than it will expend. Social Security is not running a deficit, it is running a surplus, and a very significant surplus at that. Why? Because it is one of the few sober things we have done in the last two decades. We finally required a forced pool of national savings in Social Security to meet the time when the baby boomers retire. 
So this year, the Social Security system will run about a $70 billion surplus, and that annual surplus will continue year after year after year until about the year 2018. So I don't want that reference to pass unnoticed and allow someone to think, gee, there is a huge deficit in the Social Security account. 
I have a couple of other points. We are told from time to time that we have a trade deficit because we have a budget deficit, and if we get rid of the budget deficit, gee, the trade deficit will be no problem at all. The trade deficit will disappear. 
The budget deficit is going down, down, down, way down, and yet the trade deficit is growing. So I ask those who tell us that the trade deficit is simply a function of the budget deficit, why does your theory now seem to be wrong? You said that if the budget deficit decreases, the trade deficit will vanish. Why, when the budget deficit not only decreases but nearly goes away, do our merchandise trade deficits reach the largest level in the history of this country? Is it perhaps that the theories are all wet? 
Then some say, `Well, we know we talked about the budget deficit related to the trade deficit. If that's not the case, then its the strong dollar. The strong dollar is our problem?' That is what causes this sea of red ink of merchandise trade deficits that are getting worse? It is the largest in history and setting new records every day and getting worse. 
When the dollar is strong, we have a trade deficit. When the dollar is weak, we have trade deficits. What do you say about that? Is maybe the theory is all wet there as well? 
Might it be, at least in part, something no one is willing to discuss much. That is that we have a free-trade system in which our markets are wide open and we have expectations of trading partners who open their markets but they don't open their markets. Their markets are not open to American goods. Might it be that our markets are open, but the Japanese markets are not wide open to American goods, the Chinese markets are not wide open to American goods? Might that not be the case? Could that conceivably be the reason for part of this or a significant part of this trade deficit? I think it is. 
The Senator also discussed what happened at the turn of the century and the prior century about trade deficits. Comparing the economic circumstances of the prior century and its trade deficits to today is like comparing a teaspoonful of water to a bathtubful of water. These trade deficits are serious, alarming, and growing. Let me take this from theory to practice. 
At least a part of this red ink is because we are seeing American jobs leave this country and move elsewhere, and those jobs then are used to produce the same products to ship back into this country, and that contributes to this trade deficit. 
Bob Bramer worked for 31 years at Sandvik Hard Metals in Michigan. He saw his plant close down, saw the equipment put on a truck and hauled to Mexico. His and 26 other jobs went south. He didn't lose his job in theory. He lost his job, and his family lost his income. He lost his career. His job was put on a truck and moved to Mexico. 
Nancy Dewent, 47 years old, worked at a plant for 19 years in Queens, NY. They were making Swingline brand staplers; 408 jobs. Now they are moving to Mexico. Nancy was 47 years old making $11.58 an hour. Those staplers will now be produced in Mexico at 50 cents an hour, and that will help, of course, increase this trade deficit. Nancy didn't lose her job in theory, she lost her real job. This isn't economic theory, it is what our current trade strategy is producing. 
Fruit of the Loom was scheduled to close plants in Kentucky, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas last month; 5,100 workers, workers getting up to $10.50 an hour; moving plants and jobs to other countries for 5 years in a row. 
There is Borg-Warner, Muncie, IN, where 800 workers are losing jobs which pay $17.50 an hour; moving to Mexico. This isn't theory, these are families, people who have lost their jobs, and it shows up here in red. 
We can give lectures about economic theory forever. But the central question is, do you think that 21 straight years of trade deficits produced by this trade policy is troublesome for this country, or do you think, conceivably, they are good for this country? Do you think more red ink might be good for this country? Some argue that. They must be ecstatic if that is the case, because this red ink is growing. They must be the ones walking around with the widest smiles in town. 
But there are those of us who think that trade deficits are troublesome. We are concerned that markets are closed to this country when we open our markets to others. We think that we ought to be a country that cares a little about its manufacturing base and keeping good manufacturing jobs in this country by requiring that other markets be open to our products. We should be requiring that others who produce and ship here be required to respond to the same kind of issues we are required to respond to such as that you can't hire kids, you can't hire 12 years old, work them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour. That's not fair. We shouldn't be expected to compete with that. 
Is it reasonable for us to at least require some important provisions dealing with labor and the environment and other issues in these trade agreements? The fact is that we don't. What we say is, `It doesn't matter what you do. It doesn't matter how you produce, and ship it here, we will buy it. By the way, it doesn't matter so much that you won't let your markets be open to us. We will accept that. Anyone that stands up and says that is troublesome for the country, we will tell them they don't know what they are talking about, because it is conceivable these trade deficits are good for our country.' Now that's what they say. 
You talk about economic gibberish. This is not good for our country. This is the other deficit that is the worst it has been in the history of this country and getting worse every year and one we ought to do something about. You can name family after family after family in this country who are already victims as a result of this deficit or whose lost jobs helped cause this deficit. It is because those jobs used to be here and now they are there. They used to be in this country, now they are gone. 
Why? Because in the name of profits, the multinational companies in this country and around the world constructed an economic system defining production to be available to them in the lowest-cost production areas in the world. They circle the globe and find out where can you produce, where at the same time you can hire kids, pay them pennies, and dump the pollution in the water and ship the product to Fargo, Los Angeles and other places. They simply look to where can they produce in those circumstances in order to maximize your profit. It doesn't matter to them what happens to this country's deficit. It doesn't matter so much to them what happens to this country's jobs. 
That is why I am concerned about all this. That is why I asked in this limited circumstance for a commission to consider ways that we can address the trade deficit, ways this country can begin to end this hemorrhaging of red ink.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator to respond to this. 
China, the People's Republic of China, dealing with American movies, allows 10 movies a year in China, no more, just 10. They cut it off at 10. 
China does not allow nearly enough American pork. In fact, we send very little pork into China. The Chinese consume one-half of the world's pork, but we send very little pork into China. We used to be the world's largest wheat supplier to China. Now we are displaced as the largest wheat supplier to China even as they ship increasing quantities of Chinese goods to this country. 
In addition, the Chinese have ratchetted up this huge surplus with us--or we a deficit with them--to very significant levels. What they need are airplanes. They only produce--as I understand it, they produce one airplane that I think holds 50 or 60 passengers. They need airplanes. In fact, they need a couple thousand airplanes that they are going to need in the years ahead. 
Guess what China says? China says, `Well, what we'd like to do is we'd like to consider buying your airplanes, but you must manufacture your airplanes in China.' This is at a time when we are already running a huge trade deficit with China. 
My feeling is: China sends its goods to this country to our marketplace, and American consumers buy them. We make something China needs. China has a responsibility to buy from us wheat, pork, and airplanes. 
But that is not the way the world currently works, because this country does not have the nerve, the will, or the courage to stand up to trading partners--China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, and others--and say, `Here's what's fair for the American economy. Here's what's fair for American workers.' If we don't have the nerve to stand up for this country's economic interests and demand fair trade, then we are going to continue to see this sort of hemorrhaging year after year as far as the eye can see.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might reclaim my time. 
The Senator from Maryland is an extraordinarily effective advocate for that point of view. And it is one that I share. He, along with Senator Byrd from West Virginia, is a cosponsor of this amendment and the legislation that mirrors it that we had introduced earlier in this Congress. 
I must leave the floor, and I don't know whether the Senator from Maryland has other thoughts to continue with, but I know that under the spirit of the unanimous-consent request, upon disposition of my amendment, Senator Reed from Rhode Island would be recognized to offer an amendment. My understanding is that he would not require that it be voted on today, but he does want to offer it and have some discussion about it. 
The disposition of my amendment would be this. What I would like to do is engage the staff of the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Texas, who spoke earlier, to see if there are ways to deal with the questions they raised about the commission. 
As I understand, the Senator from Texas indicated that he would not necessarily object to the establishment of a commission if we could reach some compromises on the conditions of such a commission or the makeup of the commission. 
Would that be the understanding of the Senator from Delaware with respect to Senator Reed?

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's attention to some truly remarkable people, people whose work speaks volumes about what special people North Dakotans are. 
As my colleagues in the Senate are well aware, one of the Nation's worst weather-related disasters this year was the devastating flooding in Grand Forks, ND, and the entire Red River Valley. This historic flood captured the attention of the Nation in late spring as over 95 percent of the residents of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks were evacuated from their homes and much of North Dakota's second largest city's downtown district was ravaged by fire and water. 
History will have a dramatic record of the loss and devastation of the flood. The hardship and heartbreak endured by so many of our friends and neighbors will be forever etched into our memory. 
But this year has also shown that North Dakota is a State blessed with wonderful and resilient people, and with real-life heroes. It's often said that difficult times bring out the best in people, and that certainly was the case in North Dakota. So now that a few months have passed since the waters have subsided, I would like to take a moment to reflect back on some of the many heroes, people that stepped up when their community needed them, whose efforts shined in the midst of the rising waters. 
In a disaster, maintaining a working communication system is critical in fighting back and preserving the safety of those in the area. Today, I would like to recognize the efforts of several US West Communications employees who worked tirelessly to maintain critical telephone service to the Grand Forks area throughout the flooding. 
On April 19, 1997, before the flooding hit Grand Forks, a crew of nine central office technicians barricaded themselves into the US West building in the heart of the city to keep the area's communication systems up and running during the disaster. Their extensive preventive work to prepare for the flooding would soon be tested as the waters rushed into town. As the entire city was evacuated, their building was surrounded by 4 feet of water, and sat just one block away from a raging fire. But these brave men and women hung in and sustained phone service, service which was essential to the rescue and recovery efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, State and local emergency workers, and so many others in the flooded region. 
To give you an idea of the challenges facing each of these brave heroes, they labored alone, night and day to keep the wires dry as 26 inches of water threatened basement cables. Sustained by the food, clothing, and cots delivered via boat by the National Guard, these folks stayed on in a flooded town whose entire population had been ordered to leave. Armed with only high-volume pumps, drying machines, and sandbags, these courageous people kept the communications system working. 
These heroes deserve to be recognized by name for their dedicated service. The members of the initial emergency team were: Denny Braaten, Linda Potucek, Larry McNamara, Bob Schrader, Dan Kaiser, Dale Andrews, Glenda Wiess, Rick Hokenson, and Lew Ellingson. 
Two days later, US West reinforcements arrived to provide additional support and hard work. I would like to recognize these workers now: Don Jordan, Ray Jacobsen, Tim Kennedy, Roger Jones, Bruce Bengston, Gary Boser, Jim Falconer, Bion McNulty, Jack Olson, and Tim Rogers. 
These people, along with the many others who volunteered and continue the rebuilding effort today, are part of the story of this year's flood that doesn't get told nearly enough, of people helping their neighbors in extremely hard circumstances, and of extraordinary acts of heroism performed by everyday people. 
I can't express my admiration enough.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator Rockefeller and others in introducing legislation that is designed to address some chronic problems facing rail shippers, especially small, captive shippers such as the small grain elevators in agricultural States like North Dakota. As this bill is introduced in the Senate today, thousands of bushels of grain are lying on the ground in North Dakota because there are no cars available to small elevators to take wheat and barley to market. The frustration of North Dakota farmers and grain shippers is focused not only on the availability of grain cars to take their products to market this time of year, but also on what they have to pay when they have only one railroad serving them. The rates captive shippers pay to get their products to market reflect the basic principles of economics: where there is competition there are lower rates and where there is not, the captive shipper pays significantly more. 
While the legislation we are introducing today will not create more grain cars this year and it will not solve full the myriad of concerns that many captive shippers have with respect to rail service in this country, this bill will take a step towards addressing some issues that will help improve the situation of captive shippers. 
The inspiration of this bill is the fact that 20 years ago there were more than 40 Class I railroads and today there are eight, of which 5 of these `mega carriers' generate 94 percent of the Class I rail industry's gross income and own over 90 percent of the track miles, and produce nearly 95 percent of the gross ton miles. Today, the western two-thirds of the country is divided up between two mega carriers that own approximately 85 percent of the track, generate over 90 percent of the gross ton miles, and earn about 90 percent of the total net railroad operating income west of the Mississippi River. 
As the railroad industry has consolidated over the past 20 years, more and more shippers have become captive to one carrier, replacing competitive service with monopoly service. At the same time, small captive shippers face insurmountable obstacles to seek relief on unreasonable rates before the Surface Transportation Board [STB]. It seems to me that the Congress needs to begin a serious debate on issues effecting captive shippers. The STB still operates under outdated regulatory structures and too many hurdles and red tape stand between the small shipper and relief on unreasonable rates. This legislation takes a modest step at addressing a few specific issues in these areas. 
This legislation addresses the broader issues of promoting rail competition and protecting captive shippers where competition does not exist by identifying these issues as priorities for the STB. The also makes a couple of changes in specific policies of the STB. First, this bill overturns the STB's decision on the so-called `bottleneck' case where the STB concluded that carriers have no obligation to quote a rate for a segment of line. The essence of the bottleneck case was that some 
shippers believe that in areas where their products were being shipped where rail competition exists, they want to take advantage of the lower rates for that particular segment of line. This legislation would require a carrier to quote a rate for a specific segment at the request of the shipper. If the carrier did not quote a rate, then the STB would have to set a rate. This circumstance will permit captive shippers to take advantage of the little competition that does exist in the rail industry. 
This legislation also repeals the outdated revenue adequacy test. The Vice Chairman of the STB, Gus Owen, has appropriately questioned the appropriateness and the relevance of the STB conducting this outdated exercise of determining the revenue adequacy of railroads. This test is so out of date that the two largest railroads in the Nation failed the last revenue adequacy test by the STB. However, these and other major railroads have no problem leveraging capital and their own financial reports indicate record profits. It is a ridiculous test and it serves no useful purpose for STB procedures. 
In addition, the legislation attempts to streamline the bureaucratic hurdles facing small shippers in seeking rate relief before the STB. One provision streamlines the requirements imposed on the shipper to demonstrate that the rail carrier serving them meets the STB's definition of `market dominance.' Under current law, market dominance is defined as `the absence of effective competition from other rail carriers or modes of transportation' and the STB cannot find market dominance unless the revenue to variable cost percentage exceeds 180 percent. Under the STB's interpretation of this requirement, the STB requires shippers to demonstrate that there is no product nor geographic competition under he what constitutes transportation competition. This legislation makes the market dominance test simple and easier to understand. Under this bill, a shipper need only demonstrate that they are served by only one rail carrier and that their rates exceed 180 percent revenue to variable cost to determine market dominance. 
This legislation would also require the STB to review its regulations and rules with respect to barriers that impede a small shippers' ability to file rate and other complaints against railroads before the STB. The STB would be required to minimize their red tape and barriers for shippers and also to report to Congress on barriers that require legislative action to remedy. 
Mr. President, this legislation is modest, but it will make a difference for small shippers in this country. The premise of the bill is that the STB ought to emphasize competition and where competition does not exist, the STB needs to make it easier for captive shippers to seek relief from unreasonable rates. 
Next year, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation will be debating reauthorization legislation on the STB. That will be a very important debate. Senator Rockefeller, I and others intend to make sure that one element of that debate will focus on the problems facing small, captive shippers and we consider this legislation as a building block for next year's debate. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. The majority leader certainly will have my cooperation. I share his interest in making progress on a number of the items he has just mentioned. 
I am concerned, however, that we not get into a corner of the legislative time period and discover that some say there is not time to offer amendments on the fast-track legislation. A number of us have amendments that would require some debate, and we want very much to be assured by the majority leader that we will not be precluded from offering those amendments. So as we proceed, I want to have some assurance that that will be the case.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I simply wanted to stand and say that the Senator from Oklahoma, and especially the Senator from Missouri, who spoke earlier, have made important recommendations. 
Yesterday, I believe I read in the Congress Daily the recommendations of the Senator from Missouri on the extension of the highway bill. I think the approach he suggests makes a great deal of good sense. And I hope most Members of Congress will understand in this late hour and rally around an approach that gets this done--allows the contracts to be let, and doesn't provide an interruption in the highway activities in our country. This is very important to this country. 
So I commend the Senator from Missouri, the Senator from Montana, and so many others who are working on these issues, and hope all Members of the Senate feel, as we do, that this is something that must get done in the final days of this session.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take just 1 minute to describe the amendment. I offer the amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, and Senator Sarbanes from Maryland. I hope that this amendment will be agreed to at some point. It is an amendment that deals with the trade deficit. It would establish an emergency commission to end the trade deficit, a commission that would be comprised of 21 members to study and analyze and evaluate the trade deficit and, over 16 months, make recommendations to the Congress on how to grapple with this vexing trade deficit. 
Mr. President, we have had 21 years of consecutive trade deficits, each of the last 3 years the highest trade deficits in the history of this country. Our trade strategy isn't working. We need to change it. The question is how do we change it so that we end these crippling trade deficits. We propose a commission to make recommendations to Congress. I hope it will be successful. 
Mr. President, with that I intend to come back to the floor and speak at greater length, but at this point I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to permanently extend the Federal gasohol tax incentives that are currently available to encourage the development and use of ethanol. I am pleased that Senators Daschle, Johnson, and Conrad are joining me as cosponsors of this important bill. 
I've been a long-time supporter of the domestic ethanol program because of its importance to this country's energy and economic interests. And I was deeply troubled when Congress failed to take action earlier this year to keep these ethanol tax incentives from expiring in the year 2000. Ethanol is an important part of our domestic fuels industry, and it merits continued support via the Tax Code. 
The ethanol industry helps us to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It also provides environmental benefits and stimulates our agricultural industry. In fact, one recent study found that the additional demand for grain created by ethanol boosts total employment by nearly 200,000 while saving the Federal budget more than $3 billion. 
Today's ethanol tax incentive program has strong support in the Senate. Currently there is a 54-cent per gallon of ethanol credit available for ethanol blenders. Typically ethanol blenders get the full benefit of the 54-cent income tax credit by claiming a 5.4-cent exemption from the gasoline excise tax. The 5.4-cent exemption is equivalent to 54 cents per gallon of ethanol. Small producers are provided a 10-cent per gallon credit of ethanol produced, used or sold as a transportation fuel. 
Some of my colleagues in the Senate are now proposing to extend the ethanol tax incentives through the year 2007 and thereafter connect its future to any extensions of the Federal gasoline excise tax. Of course I will continue to support any reasonable efforts to extend the tax incentives currently available for ethanol. But I think it's time to make the major ethanol tax incentives a permanent part of our Tax Code, as are many tax incentives for other energy sectors. The legislation that I am introducing today will accomplish this goal. 
The overwhelming vote of 69 to 30 on the Senate floor during the consideration of the tax bill this summer shows that a vast majority of Senators strongly favor continuing the ethanol tax incentives. Unfortunately, the Senate's provision extending the ethanol incentives was dropped in conference. But the ethanol program retains the strong support of many Members in the House of Representatives as well, and by a broad coalition of Governors, farmers, environmentalists and consumers across this country. 
The future of the ethanol program is too important to our Nation's energy, environmental and economic interests to be derailed by a few powerful members in the House of Representatives. Allowing the ethanol tax incentives to expire in 2000 is short-sighted and unfair. The ethanol industry is no less important than the other energy sectors which enjoy permanent tax incentives, and the Internal Revenue Code should reflect this simple fact. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in making the U.S. ethanol tax incentive program permanent.

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, my understanding is the motion to proceed prevailed by the most recent vote, and the result is now the regular order of the Senate would be the fast-track legislation. The Senator asked unanimous consent to go to morning business. I didn't object to that. We also have a unanimous consent for tomorrow's proceedings dealing with DOD authorization. At that point, does the Senator expect to go back to the legislation pending, or can the Senator inform us whether he will be propounding additional unanimous-consent requests with respect to Senate business?

Mr. DORGAN. If I might just inquire further, the reason I ask the question is that because we are on the legislation dealing with fast track, there are a number of Senators who will be wanting to offer amendments. It will not be a pleasant experience to learn that we move to other things and then come back to fast track with some understanding there is no time for amendments. I am just inquiring to try to determine what the expectation of the leadership is with respect to the fast-track legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate, as I understand it, will be voting in about 50 minutes on the confirmation of a judge. Between now and that time, there will be time for debate on the motion to proceed to the fast-track legislation, and I intend to take a few minutes of that time. I believe Senator Wellstone will be here as well to speak. I wanted to begin, again, discussing this question because there seems to be a substantial amount of misinformation and there is a substantial misimpression by many people about what this debate is. 
I started yesterday by saying this debate is not about whether we should have free trade or expanded trade or more trade. It is not about that. I think we should have expanded trade. I think we should lower barriers, lower tariffs--in fact, eliminate barriers, lower tariffs, and have a world in which we have more opportunity to trade. It's not about those who believe in trade and those who don't. It is a debate about whether our current trade strategy is working for this country. Does the current trade strategy work? Or is this country embarking on a trade strategy and are we in the middle of a trade strategy that, in recent years, has failed us, hurt our economy, injured our manufacturing base, has moved American jobs overseas and put us in a weaker position? I happen to think that is the case. 
I want to go through some of this to describe why I am concerned about not just this fast-track proposal, but our trade policy generally. Mr. President, this is a chart that shows our net export balance. All of this red below the line represents deficits. We have had the largest net export deficits in the history of this country for 3 years in a row, and this year will make it the fourth year in a row. These are the largest trade deficits in the history of this country. 
Now, I would ask the question of those trotting out here supporting the current trade strategy and saying, `let's again pass fast-track trade authority.' Is this going in the right direction? Is this the right trade strategy? Is this producing the right results? If so, where do you intend to go with this? Do you want to take the chart out here and go down to $350 billion a year in net trade deficits, as some are predicting will happen? Because if you think this is working, the logical extension of this is larger and larger deficits. 
We are now the largest debtor nation in the world, and a significant part of that debt comes from the contributions of these trade deficits. So if you think the current trade strategy is working real well and you like this chart and you love debt, then you need to be out here saying, gee, let's pass fast track and continue doing what we are doing because it is really good for this country. 
Now, Mr. President, I have said before that I used to teach economics, briefly, in college. But I was able to overcome that experience and go on to do other things in life. I am told that in the old days in ancient China, those who would travel from one region to another giving advice of the type we now get from economists had to be careful about it. That is because if they gave the wrong advice and stuck around the province too long and it was discovered what they had suggested would happen didn't happen, they were boiled, cut in two, or put on the sides of two chariots and pulled apart. We have no such dilemma posed to the economists of today. 
Economists of today tell us what they think, for example, on trade. They say if you pass a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, we will substantially increase American jobs. We passed a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, called NAFTA, and we lost 395,000 American jobs. Where are the economists who predicted these enormous gains for our country? They are off predicting the results of fast-track and new trade agreements. It's just fine for 
them to keep predicting, despite the fact that they are consistently wrong. 
The components of this country's economy are personal consumption--you see where that is. That is personal consumption and expenditures. That is one component. There is gross private domestic investment. Then, we have Government expenditures and investments. The fourth component of this economy is the balance of net exports. Now, if you look at this chart, is this balance of net exports a net positive or a net negative? This shows red. Why? Because it is a net negative. It is a drag on our economy. It pulls our economy down, not lifts it up. 
So when the President or Members of the Senate come to this Chamber and say, gee, we are doing so well, we have more exports and we are doing so well, and it boosts our economy, they are dead flat wrong. They would not pass the beginner's course in economics, preaching that message, because net exports and the current balance of net exports is a drag on our economy. It is not a contribution to our economy. 
In fact, yesterday, somebody said, well, since we have negotiated the agreement with Mexico under NAFTA, we now get more cars into Mexico that are produced in the United States. That is true, we do. It is absolutely true. Conclusion: Was it a good agreement for our country? No, not at all. While we get a few more cars into Mexico, they send far more cars into the United States. So the net balance of auto trade between the United States and Mexico is completely out of kilter. In fact, we now import more cars from Mexico than the United States exports to the entire rest of the world. So the next time somebody stands up and talks about automobiles, and talks about what a great deal it is in terms of automobile trade with Mexico, I say tell the whole story. 
If you are describing a checkbook, don't just stand here and crow about the deposits. Tell us about the withdrawals. Tell the whole story. 
So, Mr. President, the circumstances of trade are this. We are involved in a great deal of international trade. I support that. I insist that trade be fair to our country, to our producers, to our businesses, and to our workers. And, it is not fair. We don't have the nerve and will to require it be fair with China, with Japan, with Mexico--yes, with Canada. That is the problem. The result is huge deficits. 
This chart shows that the imports of manufactured goods now in this country equal 51 percent of our total manufacturing in America. Just 16 or 18 years ago it was down to about 25 percent of our manufacturing base. Now imports equal over 50 percent of our manufacturing base. 
Is that moving in the right direction? I don't think so. 
Here is a chart that shows all of the fast-track authority that we have given Presidents. When the Tokyo round took effect, we had a $28 billion trade deficit at that point. We had fast track for the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. When it took effect we had a $115 billion trade deficit. We gave fast track for NAFTA. At that point we had a $166 billion trade deficit. Then we gave fast track to the Uruguay round. Then, we were up to $173 billion in trade deficits. Now we are at $191 billion in net merchandise trade deficits. 
It is going to go higher. Do people think we are moving in the right direction? I have no idea what town they grew up in. They think this is success. It is not success. It is burdening this country with an obligation this country must repay. This country will repay and must repay nearly $2 trillion of accumulated net trade deficits with a lower standard of living in our future. That is not conjecture. It must be done because other people now have claims in the form of American dollars against our future. 
Let me talk for just a moment about one of the more recent agreements, the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. I talked about the descriptions of the NAFTA agreement. I have told previously of the folks in ancient Rome who used to predict the future. We now call them economists. They used to call them augurs. It was the practice of augury. The practice of augury was to read the flight of birds, and evaluate the entrails of cattle, among other things, in order to portend the future. In our country we have economists. They tell us, on the one hand, and on the other hand. That is why Harry Truman said that he preferred a one-armed economist. Then they could tell us with one hand. What did the economists tell us with respect to NAFTA? They said if we would pass NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, we would have nearly 400,000--I guess 250,000, first, and some said 350,000 --new jobs in America. NAFTA was passed. What we lost was 167,000 jobs to Canada, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and 227,000 jobs to Mexico. 
Is that moving in the right direction? Not where I come from. We were told the trade that would come into our country from Mexico would be the product of low-skilled labor. What are the largest imports into the United States from Mexico? Automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics. That is not the product of low-skilled labor. 
This last chart shows that the United States has become the world's largest debtor nation. It might not matter to people here. I don't see people coming into the Chamber worried about this. Three or four of us talk from time to time about the growing trade deficit. To most people it doesn't seem to matter. They say, `Look at the cars we send to Mexico. Isn't that a wonderful thing?' 
They come here and talk about the deposit slips in their checkbook. They don't talk about the expenditures. The net balance of trade has been negative for our country, and growing worse. It is causing substantial trouble in our country. The question is: Will we solve this? Will someone decide this is not good for our country and decide to solve it? Need it be solved by 
starting a trade war? Should it be solved by putting walls around our country and describing ourselves as protectionists? No, I don't think so. That is not the point. That is not what we are here arguing. 
The point we are debating is that those who come here with this mantra chant of `free trade'--just a mantra chant. You are either for free trade, or you are some xenophobic isolationist stooge who doesn't understand it. You just do not understand what the world has become. You are either for free trade, and you, therefore, understand all of the implications of that, or you just don't get it. You are for free trade, or you are a blatant protectionist, and shame on you. We are going to call you `Smoot and Hawley.' That is the way this debate moves very quickly. Almost, instantaneously, it moves into that kind of a discussion. 
The discussion that ought to be among all of is this. We now have the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country. Is it good for this country? The answer is no. The question is, What will we do about it? Does anyone here have a plan to deal with this growing, mushrooming trade deficit that hurts this country? Anybody? Has anybody heard anybody come to the floor of the Senate who chants this mantra of free trade who says anything about dealing with these mushrooming deficits? Or is it for them just the act of chanting that satisfies their soul? Is it just the act of chanting that satisfies their desire to serve? 
One would hope that those who come to the floor talking about the need for expanded trade--not with some chant--with some thoughtful analysis of this country's needs would also understand the need for balanced trade and the need for fair trade, and the demand that when we say to our trading partners, `You are strong, tough, worthy competitors of ours in the international marketplace, and we demand of you fair free trade.' 
As a nation, we need to say to China, `We demand of you that if you access the American marketplace and we will allow you to continue to do that, but when you do it you have a responsibility to this country. That responsibility is to open your marketplace to our goods.' Don't tell us that you want to flood our marketplace with Chinese goods and then keep China's marketplace largely closed to American goods. Don't tell us that you want us to be your cash cow for hard currency, China, and you want to ship all of your goods to our country. But when it comes time to play by the book and compete, don't displace America as the largest wheat seller to China. That is not what we expect of a mutually beneficial trade relationship. 
We need to say to Japan, `Don't tell us that you want a $60 billion a year trade surplus and deficit with us every year as far as the eye can see. Don't tell us you want to access our marketplace and then tell us we can't get American goods into yours.' 
That is not fair trade in any town in this country. And we ought to expect on behalf of the American economy and the American people and American workers and producers that we demand fair trade treatment from our allies and our trading partners. 
Canada--we had a free trade agreement with Canada. We had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. We passed a free trade agreement. Now, the trade deficit has more than doubled. 
In my part of the country we have a flood of unfairly subsidized Canadian grain coming through the borders. It is a virtual flood. It is sent to this country by a state trading enterprise called the Canadian Wheat Board. That would be illegal here in America. It has secret pricing. No one knows the price. It is sold by a state trading enterprise. That is a monopoly enterprise. The result is an avalanche of Canadian grain coming in undercutting our market and undercutting our farmers. It is patently unfair. And, we can't do a thing about it because it is in the trade agreements that were negotiated with Canada. Those negotiations were done in secret, behind closed doors. These secret negotiations pulled the rug out from under our producers. So now when trade is patently unfair you still cannot stop it. 
I ask someone to come to the Senate floor today or tomorrow and tell us what you propose to do to demand that Canada stop that flood of unfairly subsidized grain. What do you propose to do to demand that? 
What do you propose to do to demand that China open its markets? What do you propose to do to demand China open its markets completely to American imports when it buys airplanes made and manufactured in the United States of America rather than demanding that it wants United States airplanes manufactured in China? 
What do you intend to do to say to Japan that the trade agreement 10 years ago with them on beef represents the lowest expectations of trade behavior that this country has? We negotiated trade on beef. And even our cattlemen jumped for joy because we finally reached an agreement with Japan on beef. Guess what the agreement is? There remains nearly a 50-percent tariff on all American beef getting into Japan. Is that a fair agreement? No. It represents the lowest expectations we have of our abilities to require our trading partners to treat us fairly. We still have a nearly 50-percent tariff on American beef going into Japan. 
What on Earth are we doing? Why is this country lacking the nerve and the will to stand up to our trading partners and say to them, `Here is a mirror; treat us fairly because we are going to treat you like you treat us?' From our trade standpoint, our leadership is ready for us to say our market is open to you. We lead in the spirit of free and fair trade. We lead in the spirit of expanded trade. But, we demand more of our trading partners. We demand that our trading partners provide opportunities to American producers, American businesses, and American workers to access your marketplace just as you access ours. 
Is this all theory? No, it is not all theory. Those who come to the floor and talk about free trade will talk in the abstract all day long. But what this is about is who will have the jobs and the economic growth and the opportunity 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and 50 years from now. 
I have no quarrel with those who come to the floor of the Senate and say that our future is in global trade. We have a global economy. Our future requires expansion of trade opportunities. I have no quarrel with those who have read the economic textbooks that describe the doctrine of comparative advantage, and the teachings of Ricardo, and others, who describe a world in which some can more appropriately produce one product and others can more appropriately raise one commodity. To the extent there are natural advantages to each, they should trade with each other. That becomes the doctrine of comparative advantage. Each does what it is their advantage to do and, therefore, trade with each other. I have no quarrel with that. 
Of course, when Ricardo wrote that, incidentally, there was only nation-to-nation trading. There were no corporations when that doctrine was described. It is not the same now when the doctrine is interpreted to mean that a comparative advantage is a political advantage rather than a natural advantage, a natural resource advantage, or some sort of production advantage. 
What is a political comparative advantage? A political advantage is a government over in some recess of the world when it describes the conditions of its production as a method of production in which you can hire 12-year-olds and pay them 12 cents an hour, and you can dump the pollution into the air and the water, and you can work the kids in unsafe factories. There is a political advantage in which that kind of production is acceptable and tolerated, and produces the commodities that are then traded in the international marketplace. But, that has nothing to do with the doctrine of comparative advantage. Absolutely nothing. 
The question I asked yesterday about trade is one this country needs to continue to ask. Is there a requirement for admission to the American marketplace which, incidentally, has no substitute on the face of this globe. There are more people in other countries. China has far more people than we. But there is no substitute to having access to the American marketplace. 
Is there any admission to the American marketplace? I am not talking about cash, or paying money to access the American marketplace. I ask is there an admission price at all? Will the admission price be, for example, a requirement that you not employ 8-year-olds or 10- or 12-year-olds to produce in a production factory and work them 12 hours a day and pay them little or nothing? 
Could we at least start way back right at the first step and say, `Well, at least we will not accept the production of prison labor from a foreign country to come into our country and have the socks that are produced in a foreign prison hanging on a discount wall for sale to the American public?' 
So we must decide what is right. We should not allow the work of foreign prisoners to come into our country because clearly that is unfair trade. So then let's step up the chain a bit, and ask ourselves: If not from foreign prisons--and I think most of us would agree that is certainly not fair trade--what about foreign factories that hire young kids, young children? I mentioned 12-year-olds. How about 8-year-olds? How about 250 million children producing around the world? Is there something that we find difficult in this country in our trade relationship in saying to another country, `Look, you have to meet certain standards?' 
We are not demanding you pay the same minimum wage they pay in Pittsburgh or Denver. We are not demanding that. But you have to meet some standards in order to access our marketplace because we don't believe American producers who risk their money to build their plant, hire their workers, and then manufacture their goods ought to have to compete against someone who manufactures the same product for one-hundredth of the price or one-twentieth of the price because they don't have the responsibility to deal with air pollution and water pollution, child labor laws, and safe workplaces, minimum wages, and all of those kind of things. 
Is there any standard that represents some standard of behavior that we expect in being able to access the American marketplace? Or is this a circumstance where we have decided that those corporations, the largest in the world who are now international corporations--not national enterprises but international corporations--have decided that the expectation they have of this system is to be able to look at their corporation and evaluate where in this world can they produce most cheaply. Where can they produce least expensively? 
Where can they produce it, and then where can they ship that product to the most affluent marketplace and therefore expect maximum profit? 
Is that the construct of this new system, the new global economy? Buy a Gulfstream; travel around the world; look out the window and find where could you produce with the least possible expense? What corner is it? Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh? What corner of the world is it that would allow you to take that manufacturing plant that you have in Ithaca, NY, shut it down, fire the workers, move it overseas, and produce at the least possible cost, paying the least amount of money, having a factory that has the least compliance with air and water pollution, no bother about worker safety issues, and so on, no OSHA, and then produce the same product and ship it back to Ithaca to be sold on the hardware store shelf? Is that the construct? 
I am afraid that is what most of our institutional discussion has been in this country about, the new global reality. The new global reality is we should not worry about what percent of the manufacturing, in terms of our consumption, is done in the United States. We should not worry about our manufacturing base. We should not worry about whether we have a strong manufacturing base. What we should worry about is consumption. How are we doing as consumers? 
I suppose we are doing fine as consumers. We have ample credit cards available. In fact, just wait at home today and open your mail box. You will get another invitation for 10 more, preapproved, with substantial limit, and if you are lucky, you can go to a discount store somewhere and probably buy something that was produced in a country that used kids to produce it, produced it less expensively, and you might--not always, but you might--be able as a consumer to purchase it less expensively at the expense of a diminished manufacturing base in this country, at the expense of a larger trade deficit, and at the expense of a lower standard of living later when this country will have to reconcile these huge and growing trade deficits. 
Mr. President, let me end where I began. I know Senator Wellstone from Minnesota is waiting to speak. I started today by asking the question, can someone come to this Chamber in the next day or so and look at this ocean of red ink, of net trade deficits that are growing worse year after year after year, not better--can someone come here today, someone who thinks we are on the right path, who wants us to keep doing what we are doing and tell me how they believe this represents success? How do they believe this contributes to this country's well-being? 
If they believe, as I do, that this ocean of red ink has made this country the largest debtor nation on Earth and it is destructive to this country's best interests. Then I say, let's in the coming hours talk about what we can do to fix this and don't tell me more of the same because that's what you are saying: We want more of the same. 
This is what has happened. We have big, big deficits, getting worse. `Let's keep doing more of the same,' they say. I say, let's change. Let's expect more and demand more of our trading partners. Let's have open foreign markets. Let's have the nerve and the will to stand up for this country's economic interests, and let's not move quickly to the thoughtless debate that this is between those who support free trade and those who do not. 
That is not what this is about. It is about those of us who believe this country has an abiding and growing trade problem and is choking on trade deficits and must stand up and do something about it for this country's sake and those who believe things are just fine and we ought to keep doing more of what we have been doing. That is what the debate is about. 
I will have more to say. Let me yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say, the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, as always, makes an interesting and a challenging presentation. He is a very capable Member of the Senate. 
I will say, I listened with great interest. One of the areas I think where we want to discuss some disagreement is whether, as he proposes, the American people do not really understand the issue of trade. I think the American people do, in fact, understand the issue of trade, and that is precisely what is requiring and causing this kind of discussion in the U.S. Senate. 
Having said that--I will expound on that at some later time--let me yield now to my colleague, Senator Conrad.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the time, I understand, is winding down until 5 o'clock when we have a vote this afternoon on the motion to proceed. I wanted to take just a few minutes to comment on some of the things that we have heard in the last couple of hours. I believe Senator Hollings is on his way to the floor. He will be taking some time. We have several other speakers on this side. But I would like to take a moment to respond to a couple of the things that we have heard. 
First of all, I feel this is a good debate. It is about time we had this debate in this Chamber. Many of us have wanted to have a discussion about trade and trade issues for some long while. But the opportunity to do that has been limited. Now that fast track has been brought to the floor of the Senate is a very good and useful opportunity for that debate. 
A speaker a couple of hours ago came to the floor of the Senate and said the problem that he has on this issue is the American people don't understand trade. It occurs to me that the American people understand trade. They well understand the trade issue. It occurs to me that some of the people here in Washington, DC--yes, maybe even in Congress--don't understand trade. 
When the American people see a trade strategy that results in 21 straight years of trade deficits, getting worse year after year, setting new records year after year, I think the American people understand that there is a problem. 
That is just lost, apparently, on some Members of this Chamber, and perhaps some administrations who are engaged in trade policies that are not working. 
So I think it is not accurate to suggest that the American people don't understand trade. Oh, they understand it all right. They understand it when they see factories close and move to Mexico or move to Indonesia or move to Sri Lanka. They understand it when they see their jobs leaving. They understand it when they can't compete with products that are produced at 12-cents-an-hour labor or without the requirement to clean up their emissions or without the requirement to have a safe workplace. The American people understand that. And, that is precisely what drives a lot of this discussion. 
We are told there are 50 chief executive officers of major corporations on Capitol Hill today lobbying and discussing with Members of Congress why fast track is important. The point I would like to make is that there is not necessarily a parallel interest between our country's interest and the interests of the American people and these 50 CEO's who have an interest in maximizing profits for their stockholders. 
It is likely, in fact, it is certain, that in a number of board rooms and executive offices in this country that the chief executive officers must evaluate where can they produce more cheaply. Each of these CEO's is asking, `Where can I move my manufacturing jobs? Where can I and how can I shut my factory here and move the jobs overseas in order to access cheaper labor, in order to escape the requirements of air pollution and water pollution laws, or in order to escape OSHA and the requirements of a safe workplace? Where can I do that, without giving much thought as to whether it benefits the American economy, but in order to maximize my corporate profits?' 
That would be the interest, it seems to me, of most CEO's: the return to the shareholder and the maximization of corporate profits. That is not necessarily parallel with the interests of our country. It might well be that the parochial interests of a corporation to move its production facilities to Indonesia or to move its production facilities to Thailand or Sri Lanka is in the company's best interest, but certainly not in our country's best interest. 
So we will, I assume, hear from CEO's today with many of them on Capitol Hill helping President Clinton push for fast-track trade authority. 
The point I make is that their interest is not necessarily parallel to the interests of this country. I am not saying they are un-American. I am just saying they have an interest in disconnecting from American manufacturing where they can maximize profits by moving their manufacturing elsewhere, and that is not necessarily in this country's interest. 
A statement earlier this morning brought a smile to me. It was a statement by one of the speakers who said, `What we have here are two sides: One believes in free trade.' It is like `We are on that side,' they say, `and we believe in free trade, motherhood and tourism. So we are good guys.' 
You can't wear hats in the Senate or whomever said that would certainly have put on a huge white hat. It undoubtedly would be a very large white hat. Then he would have thrown dark hats somewhere to the other side of the Senate, because this speaker said that you believe in free trade and expanded American economic opportunity, or you believe in going to a kind of North Korea, building a wall around your country and then going to hide under a rock. That was the example. 
That is, obviously, the first argument one hears in a debate about trade by someone who wants to describe the opponents as being unworthy and possessing arguments totally without merit: `We are for free trade; you're a North Korea kind of person, you want to put up a wall and go hide under a rock.' 
The fact is, no one that I have heard speak is talking about putting up walls around our country. I voted against fast track 
previously. I believe in expanded trade. I don't believe in putting up walls. I believe our economic health is tied to our ability to expand economic opportunity through trade. I just happen to believe our current trade strategy doesn't do that nearly as effectively as we could if we as a country had a little bit of nerve and some will to say to our trading partners, `You have a responsibility to us, and that responsibility is to open your market to American producers.' 
The Washington Post editorial is not a surprise, obviously. The Washington Post has been blowing a trumpet for this trade strategy all the way up the trade deficit chart, year after year, as bigger deficits grew. Year after year, the Post has given merits to this failed trade strategy. The Washington Post says the following about the position of those of us who have opposed fast track:  
To a large extent, this is simply putting new clothes on old-fashioned protectionism, but fast-track opponents also make an argument geared to the changing conditions of a globalizing economy in which companies are freer than ever to locate across borders, and so workers find themselves more than ever competing across borders. 
I always find it interesting that there is no journalist I am aware of--certainly no politician--but no journalist who ever lost their job because of a bad trade agreement. But they sure do give us a great deal of advice on trade, and for that we are very thankful. 
There is one song, one note that comes from the Washington Post. It is that you are either for the current trade strategy and, therefore, fast track, or you are a protectionist. The Washington Post, in my judgment, in its editorial, errs by suggesting that those who don't support the current trade strategy are protectionists. 
Is it being a protectionist to decide that a trade strategy that results in the largest trade deficits in history year after year isn't working? Is it protectionist to be concerned about a trade strategy that results in an increasing, a mushrooming trade deficit with China, ratcheting up now we expect it close to $50 billion, or a trade strategy that results in mushrooming trade deficits with Japan this year, expected to reach $60 billion this year? Incidentally, that means that every year as far as the eye can see, backward and forward, we can talk about a trade imbalance with Japan of $45 billion, $55 billion or $65 billion a year. Is it really the case that those of us who believe that this does not serve our country's interest are protectionists? Or could it be possible that those of us who believe that trade deficits hurt our country and trade deficits detract from our economic opportunity are those who are supporting change, positive change that would help this country and assist this country in improving its economic future? 
I don't expect that those in this town who have only one note to sound on trade will ever concede the point. It seems to me that they think the proof is in the economy. We have a decent economy in this country. I don't deny that. Unemployment is down some. Inflation is way down. Deficits are down, way down. There is no question that the American economy has improved. 
But, I would make this point. You can live in a neighborhood and see a neighbor who looks wonderfully prosperous, not understanding that all of those cars in the driveway, the house, the clothes, the jewelry are all on a credit card or some mortgage instrument somewhere and that person, while looking very prosperous, is not far from real trouble. 
The point I have made repeatedly is these ballooning trade deficits, the largest in our country's history, are troublesome. You don't hear one word on the Senate floor about them. 
I heard a presentation today I thought was a good presentation in favor of fast track. I thought it was well-constructed, well-delivered and persuasive. But, there was not one word about the trade deficit, not one word about the imbalance in our trade 
relations with our trading partners, with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Canada. Not one word. Why? Because they only talk about one side of the issue. 
Can you imagine a business that says, `I want you to evaluate me, and here is how I want you to evaluate me. I want you to evaluate me based on my revenues, and I will not tell you about my expenditures because that is irrelevant. Just look at my revenues. Aren't I healthy? Aren't I doing well?' 
You could probably conclude that if you only look at the revenue side. But what if you look at the expenditure side and see they far exceed revenues? Would you then not conclude that the business is running toward trouble? I would think so. That is exactly what happens on this issue of international trade on the floor of the Senate. They talk about exports and ignore imports. 
I heard a description of how many additional automobiles we send to Mexico. What a wonderful opportunity, we are told, to send automobiles to Mexico under the United States-Mexican free-trade agreement. They say, `Did you know that we have gotten more cars into Mexico?' Yet the number of cars coming from Mexico into this country dwarfed that export number by so much you can hardly describe it. We now import more cars from Mexico into the United States of America than this country exports to all the rest of the world. 
Let me say that again because it is important. We now, after NAFTA, import more automobiles manufactured in Mexico than we export to the entire rest of the world. How can anyone brag about NAFTA producing an accelerated opportunity for us to send cars to Mexico when, in fact, that quantity is totally dwarfed by the number of new automobiles now manufactured in Mexico that used to be manufactured in this country, and are shipped from there to here? 
Despite the attempts of some to portray it as such, the question is not whether we are involved in international trade. It is how we are involved in international trade. Will this country continue to countenance a system in which we accept less than fair treatment from our trading partners? 
Another person on the Senate floor within the last hour said the following: `If we are not involved through fast track in trade negotiations, there will be trade agreements going on around the world and we won't be a part of them.' 
I would like one person in the U.S. Senate to describe to me a substitute for the American economy, the American marketplace. Is there another place on Earth? Spin the globe, look at all of them. Look at every country, every city. Is there another place on the globe that has the power and the potential of this marketplace? The answer clearly is no. 
Do you really believe that if we defeat fast track that those countries that desire to access the American marketplace are going to say, `Well, all right, if we can't access the American marketplace, we choose Kenya.' 
`OK, if we can't access the American marketplace, now we're going to set our sights on Nairobi.' 
`We are going to set up an office in Kinshasa; that is our future.' 
Does anybody really believe that? There is no substitute for the American marketplace. Why is it that we are the country that must be dangled on the end of a string? Why is it that those of us who stand up and say it is time for us to demand and require fair trade with respect to China, fair trade with respect to Japan, and, yes, with Mexico and Canada and others--why is it that we are subject to being called protectionists? Is it because the interests of the international economic empires now are to construct a trade regime in which you have no economic nationalism? Is it because if you exert some sort of economic nationalism, you are a protectionist? 
They construct a trade regime in which they proscribe for our country a circumstance where they want to produce elsewhere and sell here. Why? Profits. Is that wrong? No, it is not wrong from their standpoint, but is it always in our country's interest to say what is in the corporate interest is in the American interest? Not necessarily. 
There are circumstances where we should say that it is not fair competition for those businesses that stayed here in America. They didn't move anywhere. They stayed here. And they produce here. It is not fair for them to have to compete in circumstances where they cannot get their product into a foreign country because that market is closed to us, but the foreign country can get its product into our market to compete with that business that stayed here. By the way, that producer in the foreign country can produce that garage door opener, that bicycle, or those shoes, paying 12 cents an hour, and put them on the store shelves of America and drive the American businesses out of business. 
One of the Senators earlier said, `Well, if that is the way it is, that is tough luck. Let them hang on the walls of Wal-Mart. That is what America is all about. Let them hang the cheaper product there, and it's good for the consumer to be able to access a cheaper product.' 
I ask, how is that consumer going to pay for that cheaper product without good jobs? And where are the good jobs in this country going to be unless this country demands on behalf of its business and its employees, its workers, that when we trade, our agreement to trade with other countries and our desire to trade with other countries be constructed on a set of rules that are fair. We need a set of rules that says, no, not that you are to mirror exactly what we do in all of these areas, but a set of rules that would say to those countries, `There's an obligation that you have in your trade relationship with our country. And that obligation is to have fairness and access to marketplaces. If our market is open to you, your market must be open to us.' 
If we don't have the nerve and the will to do that, what on Earth will our future be? 
If I read these articles--one printed recently by one of the major newspapers by a fellow who is describing the trade deficit. He said, `Trade deficit. What does that matter? I have talked to economists. It doesn't matter. Let me explain what a trade deficit is.' He said, `That's like somebody saying to you, `I will trade you $10,000 worth of pears for your $5,000 worth of apples.' 
That uninteresting and irrelevant example in this article, describing why the trade deficit is just fine, I guess, represents a view in this town that as long as you are trading more, it does not matter. Its a view that as long as you are exporting more, it doesn't matter if your imports increase fiftyfold, and that somehow we are better off as result. 
At the end of the day, you are better off when this country has retained a strong manufacturing base and has required, through the exertion of some nerve and some will to say to its trading partners, `You have a responsibility to the United States of America. And that responsibility is to treat us fairly in international trade. And this country will not sit around and will no longer take any closed markets to our products when our markets are open to your products.'

What we need to do is more of what we've been doing.' Did the Senator graduate in the bottom of his high school class? Is he a protectionist? Is that all this means? Or does the Senator from Maryland understand what the rest of these folks don't, that deficits in the long term have to be repaid?

What they have been saying to this country--I know some of the corporate folks won't like me to say this because they are all nervous about this--but the Chinese say, `Yes, we'd like to consider buying some of your airplanes, but you must manufacture them in China.'

Mr. DORGAN. There is this blame America strategy that has been around for years that, if you can't compete, whatever the situations are, tough luck. That means in a free-trade circumstance, jobs might go elsewhere, but consumers benefit by cheaper imports. 
The interesting thing about this is, most of our large trading partners--especially, for example, Japan and China--are engaged in managed trade, not free trade. We, on the other hand, have always been a leader in what is called free trade. 
I described yesterday watching two people dance at a wedding dance when I was a kid. He was dancing a waltz and she was dancing a two-step. It didn't work out well. They were dancing different dances. In international trade, what is happening to us is, we are confronting Japan, for example, with whom we have an abiding yearly massive trade deficit of $40 to $60 billion every year, as far as you can see back and as far as you can see forward. We have that kind of trade deficit. Why? Because Japan has a managed trade strategy, and that is the method by which they trade with us. 
We, apparently, are perfectly content to say, `Well, if that is the way it is, there is nothing we can do about that.' But there is something we can do about that. We can provide a little real leadership, with a little nerve and will, and say to Japan that part of the price for this trade agreement and for their ability to access the American marketplace, a marketplace that has no substitute anywhere on this Earth, is to open their markets completely to American goods and not to do it tomorrow, or next month, or next year, or even the next biennium--do it now. 
But this country doesn't have the nerve or the will to do that. In fact, it was left to some little maritime commission, finally, to raise this issue on a $5 million fine and say, `That is fine. If you want to play that game and you won't pay your fines, then you can't dock your ship in this country.' One little commission--an unelected commission--was the only body I know of that finally had the will and nerve to say that is not the way we do business here. Fair is fair. In trade, we demand and require fair trade and fair access. 
So, the comments that both the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from South Carolina have made are right on point. The thing that baffles me is that those of us who desire to force open foreign markets, to reinforce open markets, and do more than just chant about free trade, but really seek to force open foreign markets and unlock the opportunities in this country for our producers and our workers, we are the ones that are called protectionists. What on Earth are they talking about?

I understand that the unanimous-consent request that was entered into calls for a vote no later than 5 o'clock.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-dorgan-nd-24-19971105</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me quote from this letter. I will not read it all, but, Mr. Kearns, who heads an organization called the United States Business and Industrial Council says: 
I can assure you that the 1,500 members of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council are American-owned and managed companies. They typify the vast majority of American businesses that have been impacted negatively by U.S. trade policy. Since they are run day in and day out by their owners, many are not large enough to, nor are they interested in, moving the bulk of their manufacturing overseas. They are interested, however, in preserving the American manufacturing base and in creating additional wealth for themselves, their employees, and their communities here in the United States. 
Some have been victimized by predatory foreign trade practices such as dumping and subsidization--and by the U.S. Government's neglect of these problems. Still others find themselves under pressure to cut wages and benefits in response to the slave-labor wage rates or adversarial practices of foreign competitors. Many that are engaged in international trade have been pressured by foreign governments to source abroad or to transfer key technologies as the price of doing business in that foreign country. 
And then he goes on in his letter. Let me read the conclusion: 
USBIC's [the Business and Industrial Council] members and their counterparts don't have plush Washington offices. 
He is pointing out the large number of CEOs who have flown into Washington to lobby on behalf of fast track. He said: 
[Our businesses] don't have plush Washington offices. They do not maintain large public relations staffs. They can't hire expensive lobbyists, and they're too busy running their companies to jet in and out of the nation's capital themselves, like the corporate elite. All these owner-operators do is try to turn a profit, support their families, create jobs, and help sustain [their] local communities they have been a part of for generations. In opposing fast track, they are acting first not as business interests but as citizens dismayed at the nationwide cost of 25 years of falling living standards and rapidly growing income inequality. They are well aware that these latter two facts of modern American life cannot promote a stable business environment or a stable country over the longer run. 
Mr. President, this has been a rather interesting discussion. I listened to much of the debate with great interest. As I mentioned, there have been a number of, I think, good presentations today. I do say that there are differences of opinion that are very substantial. 
There are some who think that the current trade strategy is just fine, and that it works very smartly. They think it is a wonderful thing for our country, and we just need to do more of it. That is the group that says, `Let us pass fast track. If we don't, somehow America is headed for trouble. But things are going fine. We like the way things are. Our trade policy works. Let's continue it.' 
Others of us think that swollen and bloated trade deficits, that reach record levels year after year, are heading this country toward trouble. 
General Custer, incidentally, lived for 2 years near Bismarck, ND, before he left for what is now Montana to meet Sitting Bull and Chief Crazy Horse. And because I am from North Dakota, we know a great deal about the history of that campaign. 
We know by reading the book, `Son of Morning Star,' for example, that General Custer sent his scouts ahead to try to figure out what was ahead of him. And the scouts really reported, `Gee, things look pretty good. Things are going pretty well here. Things look pretty good around the next hill or the next bend.' 
Of course, we now know from historical accounts things really did not go very well for General Custer and the 7th Cavalry. I 
find today an interesting group of colleagues who might well qualify for that scouting assignment. `Things are going pretty good. The road up ahead looks pretty bright. If we just keep doing what we're doing, our country is going to be just fine.' 
I have observed, during other discussions, especially in fiscal policy, people came to the floor of the Senate and said, `Let's run things like you would run a business.' I would ask my colleagues this: After hours and hours of debate about trade, is there anyone here who would stand up and tell me, if you ran a business the way this country runs its trade policy that you would be doing fine? Wouldn't everybody in this Chamber understand and agree that if you ran a business the way this country is running its trade policy, you would be broke? 
How many CEO's would go to their boardrooms and say, `Listen, I would like to have a talk with you. I want to talk about our receipts. I want to talk about all the sales we have and all the money that is coming in.' And the board says, `Well, that's fine, Mr. CEO or Mrs. CEO, but could you tell us a little about your expenditures?' 
The CEO knows the expenditures far exceed the receipts, but the CEO says, `No, no, we're not going to talk about expenditures. Are you crazy? We're going to talk about receipts. We're going to talk about how well I'm doing.' 
That is the message we have been hearing out here on the floor of the Senate for hours. `Gee, look how well we're doing. Look at these exports. Look at these exports, sales.' They are ignoring, of course, the massive quantity of imports coming in, displacing American manufacturing capacity in this country, and putting us in a swollen and mushrooming trade deficit situation, that if judged as a business would render us unable to continue. And yet we have people say, `Gee, this is going just fine. This is just the right road for us.' 
It is not the right road for us. The right road isn't protectionism. The right road isn't to put walls around our country. The right road isn't to retreat from the global economy. 
But the right road is to insist in this country that we have some courage to stand up and tell, yes, the Japanese and the Chinese and the Mexicans and the Canadians, and so many others, that we expect and demand more of you. We expect fair trade. 
Is there someone in this Chamber who wants to stand up and tell us they are opposed to fair trade? Does that person exist? Is there someone willing to do that? Who here is opposed to fair trade? Maybe I need to ask it when more Members are present in the Chamber. But is there someone who will say, `No. Me, I'm opposed to fair trade.' I don't think so. I don't think there is one person in this Chamber who will volunteer to say, on behalf of their constituents, they oppose fair trade. 
Why then do they insist that those of us who believe that we ought to expect fair trade in our trade relationships, why do they insist that somehow we don't act in the best interests of this country and in the best interests of this country's future economy? I do not understand that. 
With respect to whether it would be Japan or China, or many other trading partners, who are worthy partners and good trading partners of ours, it would seem to me to be in this country's best interests to say to those countries, which expect a balance in trade that is a fair balance, `You cannot run $50 billion, $60 billion a year, every year, in trade deficits with us.' 
Now, they will continue to do it as long as we allow them. You can only expect that someplace in these other countries those folks are sitting around saying, `We don't understand why they let us keep doing this, but it's a wonderful thing. It strengthens us and weakens them.' They would say that I presume. Because when they have big surpluses with us, we become a cash cow for their hard currency needs and it weakens our country. 
They must surely be puzzled why no one in this country has the nerve and the will to say, `Stop it. We won't allow that. We won't allow these huge trade imbalances. We expect and demand, not 
only reciprocal trading opportunities with you, open markets from you, but we demand some reasonable balance of trade.' 
Now, we were told just a few minutes ago that the reason we had a trade deficit is because we had a budget deficit. Simple, except that does not work. Our budget deficit is going way down, and our trade deficit is going way up. I know that is what they used to teach in economics. I used to teach economics. As I said this morning, I overcame that experience. 
But as the budget deficit has been going way down; the trade deficit is going way up. So how does it work then with those who have been claiming now for years that we simply have a trade deficit as a matter of calculation because we have had a fiscal policy deficit? 
Stephen Goldfeld once said that, `An economist is someone who sees something working in practice and then asks whether it can work in theory.' 
Can we fail to observe here that the budget deficits are going down, way down. They are down 5 years in a row, but the trade deficit is going up? Can we fail to notice that or fail to explain it? Or do we simply cling to the same tired economic doctrine about trade that has been proven wrong? 
When I was a young boy, I had a neighbor who was a retired person. His name was Herman. And Herman used to order everything through the mail that he could get that promised him one thing or another. Now Herman had rheumatism. And I went over to Herman's one day, and he was sitting there with a box that was plugged into the wall with a cord. It was a wooden box with some wires leading to two metal handles. And he explained that he had purchased this from a catalog because it was supposed to cure his rheumatism. He was sitting in his chair there holding on to these handles. He held on to them for 6 or 8 months, I guess. It did nothing to help him with his rheumatism, but that was a box he bought because that he thought it would deal with his rheumatism. 
We have a lot of folks around here sitting with those metal handles because someone claimed that this trade strategy we have works. All the evidence suggests it does not. 
One of these days, one way or another, we ought to take a look at the evidence and decide when something doesn't work you ought to change it. 
The first law of holes is that when you are in a hole, you might want to stop the digging. When you see trade deficit after trade deficit, year after year, that reaches record levels--and this year the merchandise trade deficit will be very close to $200 billion--it is fair for us to ask on the floor of the Senate, does this trade policy work? Is this trade policy in the best interests of this country? Or can we, with more nerve, will, and courage, stand up for the economic interests of this country and demand and expect more of our trading partners, more in the manner of policies that will benefit and strengthen this country? 
Mr. President, I have consumed my time. The Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York have both been courteous during this discussion. And we have had the opportunity to have a lengthy and, I think, good debate. And more will follow. We will have a vote on the motion to proceed, at which point, if that prevails, we will be on the bill itself. And those of us who care a great deal about this will be, at that point, allowed to continue. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the two presentations. They are thoughtful Senators, but Senators with whom I disagree. I would like to spend some time describing my view of where we are. Let me start by saying what this debate is not about. 
This debate is not about whether we should be involved in global trade. Nor is it about whether expanded global opportunities are going to be part of this country's future. That is not what this debate is about. There are some who will always say, the minute you start talking about trade, that there are those of us who believe in free trade and then there are the rest of you who don't understand. They say that there are those of us who believe in the global economy and the benefits and fruits that come from being involved in expanded trade in a global economy, and then there are the rest of you who are xenophobic isolationists who want to build a wall around America. That is the way it is frequently described when we discuss trade. 
But that is not what this discussion is about; not at all. It is about our trade strategy and whether it works. When I think of our trade strategy I think of watching a wedding dance when I was a little boy. A man and woman were trying to dance. One was dancing the waltz and the other was dancing the two-step. Needless to say, it didn't work out. 
We have a trade strategy that is a unilateral free trade strategy that says we are going to confront others, who have managed trade strategies, with our trade strategy. Somehow this strategy is going to work out. We are going to open our markets but we are not going to pressure other countries to do the same. We are going to pass free trade agreements and we are going to move on to the next agreement without enforcing the agreement we had. 
I would like to just take inventory, if I might. Let's take some inventory about what we have experienced in trade. For those who are color conscious, the red in this chart would not be considered good. Red represents deficits. This chart represents this country's merchandise trade deficit. We have had 21 straight years of trade deficits. The last 3 years have been the worst three in the history of this country, and we will set a new record again this year. In 36 out of the past 38 years we had current account deficits. We had 21 merchandise trade deficits in a row. This year will mean 4 years of higher record trade deficits. 
I want to ask a question. When you suffer these sort of merchandise trade deficits every year--and they are getting worse, not better--is this a country moving in the right direction? Is this a trade strategy we want more of? Or should we, perhaps, decide that something is wrong and we ought to stop and evaluate what doesn't work and how do we fix it? 
We are choking on red ink in international trade. This trade 
strategy doesn't work. So the debate is going to be between those of us who want change and those who want to cling to the same old thing. There are those of us who believe this policy isn't working and we want to change that policy. We want to reduce and eliminate these trade deficits and expand this country's trade opportunities. We want to do it in a way that is fair to this country and improves this country's economy. Then there are those who say no, and who are against change. They are for the same old thing. They support the same, tired, shopworn strategy that I say doesn't work. That is what this debate is about. 
The last debate we had about trade was a few years ago. It was on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. And you had fast track for that. It is a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Before we adopted that trade agreement we had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada and we adopted that agreement and the trade deficit has doubled. Before we adopted this trade agreement we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico and that has collapsed to a $16 billion trade deficit. 
According to an Economic Policy Institute recent study, 167,000 jobs were lost to Canada, 227,000 jobs lost to Mexico, 395,000 jobs lost as a result of NAFTA. The combined accumulated deficit as a result of NAFTA cannot possibly be anything that anyone around here wants to stand up on the floor and raise their hand about and say, `Yes, that's what I envisioned. I voted for that. That's what I was hoping would happen.' 
Surely we must have someone who will come to the floor and say I voted for this but boy, this turns out to be a pretty sour deal. We didn't expect the deficits to expand and mushroom. Is there someone who will suggest that somehow this hasn't worked out the way we expected? Or is this, in fact, the kind of thing that we embrace? Do we have a trade strategy that no matter how bankrupt, we continue to say, `Yes, we are the parents. This is ours. This is our conception.' I am wondering when enough is enough? 
Let's look at the trade treaty tally. We are told that if you don't have fast-track procedures given to this President, he can't do anything about trade. They ask who on Earth would negotiate with him? Well, there have been countries apparently that will negotiate, because there have been 220 some separate trade agreements negotiated by the USTR since 1993. That is the President's own statement. He has negotiated 220 agreements . Only two of them have used fast track. He didn't need fast track on the rest of them. So why would they have negotiated with him if he didn't have fast track? 
Fast track has been used five times in this country's history: The Tokyo round in 1975; United States-Canada, 1988; United States-Israel, 1989; NAFTA, 1993 and the Uruguay round and WTO--GATT, in 1994. 
Let me show you what has happened with respect to each of these areas. When the Tokyo round took effect, we had a $28 billion annual merchandise trade deficit. Then we had a United States-Canada free trade agreement. By that time the trade deficit was $115 billion. Go to NAFTA, $166 billion. Then the Uruguay round it was $173 billion. We now are up to a $191 billion merchandise trade deficit and it is getting worse, not better. Does anybody here think we are moving in the right direction? If you do, tell us we need more of this. I guess that is what we are hearing. This is working so well. Let's have more of this red ink. Let's accumulate more of these deficits. 
Let me describe this here. I mentioned the trade agreements, NAFTA, and others. We have bilateral trade arrangements with Japan and China that also yield huge deficits for this country. One of our problems in this trade strategy that doesn't work is that we negotiate bad agreements, No. 1; and then, No. 2, we don't enforce the agreements we negotiated. 
The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan said the following:  
Indeed, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan was astonished to learn that no U.S. Government agency has a readily accessible list of US-Japan agreements or their complete texts. This may indicate it has often been more important for the two Governments to reach agreement and declare victory than to undertake the difficult task of monitoring the agreements to ensure their implementation produces results. 
My point is this. We go out and negotiate trade agreements and don't even keep track of them let alone enforce them. We can't even get a list of them. No Federal agency had a list of the trade agreements we had with Japan. Does that tell you they are probably not being enforced, aside from the fact they were not negotiated well? I can give chapter and verse on negotiations with Japan on which we are able to lose almost in a nanosecond. 
Senator Helms reminded me the other day of something I read previously by Will Rogers. He said many years ago, `The United States has never lost a war and never won a treaty.' That is certainly true with respect to trade. Take a look at these records and tell me whether you think this country is moving in the right direction in trade. 
So, what is this about? One of the columnists for whom I have very high regard in this town is David Broder. I think he is one of the best journalists in Washington, DC, and he writes a column today that could have been written by virtually anybody in this town because they all say the same thing: If Clinton fails to win fast-track negotiating authority, `it would threaten a central part of his overall economic policy, it would signal a retreat by the United States from its leadership role for a more open international marketplace.' 
I have great respect for him. I think he is one of the best journalists in town. Yet my point is that he says what they all say. There becomes a `speak' in this town, about these issues. Then because everybody says it, they think it is true. 
It is not the case that if this Congress doesn't give fast-track trade authority to this President, that we will not be able to have future trade agreements and will not be able to expand our international trade. It is the case that some of us believe we ought to stand up for the economic interests of this country. 
Let me go through a few points because we are going to deal with this issue in macroeconomic terms. We are going to be hearing the debate about theory, and all of the trade concepts that people have. Then we negotiate trade agreements and then the jobs leave and people lose their jobs and it doesn't matter, I guess, to some because these are just the details. 
Jay Garment Corporation had two plants with 245 jobs in Portland, IN and Clarksville, TN. They produced blue jeans. They moved the plants to Mexico where they could get people to work for 40 cents an hour. 
For the past 75 years in Queens, NY, workers have been making something called Swingline brand staplers. They had 408 workers. They are now moving the plant to Mexico. Nancy Dewent is 47 years old. She has been working at that plant for 19 years and was making $11.58 an hour. Manufacturing jobs are often the better jobs, paying better wages and better benefits. That assembly job, now, making staplers, will be in Mexico at 50 cents a hour. That plant owner expects to save $12 million a year by moving that plant to Mexico and selling the products back into the United States. 
Borg Warner is closing a transmission plant in Muncie, IN. That means 800 people will lose their jobs, jobs that were paying an average of $17.50 an hour. Production is moving to Mexico. 
Atlas Crankshaft, owned by Cummins Engine, literally put its plant on trucks and moved the plant from Fostoria, OH, to San Luis Potosi in Mexico; 200 jobs gone south. 
In North Baltimore, OH, the Abbott Corporation produces wiring harness for Whirlpool appliances, closed its plant; 117 jobs moved to Mexico. 
Bob Bramer, who worked 31 years at Sandvik Hard Metals in Warren, MI, watched his plant closed down. The equipment was put on trucks and moved to Mexico. Another 26 American jobs gone south. 
People say you don't understand. That is the natural order of things. If we can't compete, tough luck for us. If we can't compete we lose our jobs. 
The question we ought to ask ourselves in this discussion is not whether this is a global economy. It is. Not whether we are going to have expanded trade, we should. We are a recipient for massive quantities of goods produced in China, massive quantities of goods produced in Japan and in Mexico and elsewhere. The question is not whether our economy is going to assimilate and purchase much of those goods. The question is what is fair trade between us and these countries? I hope, in this discussion, we might get to this question. Is there anything--is there anything that would concern Members of Congress about what is called the free market system and accessing the American marketplace with foreign production? 
For example, is it all right to hire 12-year-old kids and pay them 12 cents an hour and work them 12 hours a day and have them produce garage door openers? Is that all right? Is that fair trade? And then ship those garage door openers to Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Fargo, and Denver and then compete with someone in this country who produces the same garage door openers, hires American workers, has to abide by safety laws, by child labor standards, by workplace safety laws, and pay minimum wages? Is that fair trade? Is it fair competition? 
The answer clearly is no. If we allow producers to decide that in the world marketplace you can pole vault over all the discussions we have had for 50 years and you can produce where there is a lot less hassle, you can move your plant and move your jobs to a foreign land, and you can dump the chemicals in the water, you can pollute the air, hire kids and pay a dime an hour and you can bloat your profits and ship that product to Delaware, to North Dakota, to Colorado, and to New York, is that fair trade? 
It is not fair trade where I come from. That is not fair trade. This country ought to be concerned about the conditions of trade and about the circumstances of trade that we are involved with. That is why we have these swollen trade deficits year after year after year. I know those who push fast track and push the current system, the same old thing, say, `We are the ones for expanded trade.' I don't think so at all. 
The reason we have not gotten our products into foreign markets, at least not with the success we should have, is this country doesn't have the nerve and the will to require it, and the other countries know it. They know there are going to be enough in the Senate and enough in the House to stand up and make these claims that if you don't support the current trade strategy and you don't support expanded trade, that you are a protectionist. Other countries know that. This country doesn't have the nerve and the will to say to Japan and China, Mexico, and others that if our market is open to you, you had better understand that your market is required to be open to us. Our country simply has not required that of our trading partners. Until it does, we will continue to run these huge swollen trade deficits. 
The question that we will get to soon will be a narrower question of fast-track trade authority. Very simply, for those who don't know what that means, it means that the President will go off and negotiate a trade treaty through his trade negotiators, bring it back to the Congress, and then fast-track authority means no one in Congress may offer any amendments. 
I have been through this with the United States-Canada trade agreement. I want to describe for my colleagues why I feel so passionate about this. 
The United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement passed the Congress. I was in the House of Representatives at the time and on the Ways and Means Committee, where it passed by a vote of 34 to 1. I was told just before the vote, `We have to have a unanimous vote here in the House Ways and Means Committee. We need to get everybody voting for this. You can't be the only holdout. How would you feel about 34 to 1? What does that say, 34 to 1?' 
I said, `No, that is not a source of trouble to me, that is a source of enormous pride, because you are engaging in a trade agreement with Canada that fundamentally sells out the interests of the American farmers.' 
`We don't do that,' they said. `In fact, we'll provide you paper,' and they shoved all this paper at me saying that we guarantee, we promise and they made all the promises in the world, and I still voted against it. 
Guess what is happening? The United States-Canada trade agreement went into effect and our farmers, especially in North Dakota and the northern part of this country, have seen a virtual deluge of Canadian grain coming into our country undercutting our markets, taking $220 million a year out of the pockets of North Dakota farmers--durum wheat, barley. So we complain about it and say this is unfair trade. It is clearly and demonstrably unfair trade. 
It comes in from a state trading enterprise in Canada called the Canadian Wheat Board, which would be illegal in our country. It is clearly unfair trade. Just as clearly to me, it violates our antidumping laws because every bushel that comes in comes in with secret prices. In our country, when you sell grain, prices are fully disclosed. With the Canadian Wheat Board those are secret prices by a state trading enterprise that would be illegal in this country. 
For 8 years this has gone on, and we can't correct it. Why? Because this trade agreement was so incompetently negotiated that we traded away our ability to solve the trade problems resulting from it. 
I come here to say this. I have great respect for this President. This President has taken some of the few enforcement actions that have ever been taken with respect to some of our trading partners. But, until this President and until these trade negotiators and others involved in our current trade strategy in our country demonstrate the nerve, the will and the interest to stand up for the interests of American producers and, yes, farmers and manufacturers and workers; until they demonstrate a willingness and ability to stand up for the interests of this country, I do not intend to vote for fast-track trade authority. 
Once we decide as a country we are willing to stand up for our economic interests and say to China, `You cannot continue to run up a $50 billion trade surplus with us; we cannot continue to stand a $50 billion trade deficit with you,' or say to Japan, `We will not allow you year after year after year every year to have a $50 to $60 billion trade surplus with this country'--we have a deficit with them; they have a surplus with us. 
What does that mean. The past 21 years of merchandise trade deficits contribute a combined nearly $2 trillion to our current accounts deficit? It means somebody has to pay the bill some day. When we pay the bill, we will pay it with a lower standard of living in this country, all because we had a trade strategy that did not stand up for the economic interests of this country's producers. 
I know there are people here who say, `Gosh, look how well things are going in this country; things are going so well.' In fact, we have a proclivity in this country to measure how well we are doing every month by what we consume. If we have good consumption numbers, boy, we are doing well. 
It is not what we consume that measures the economic health of a nation, it is what we produce. No country will long remain a strong economically healthy country, a country with a strong economy, unless it retains a strong, vibrant and growing manufacturing base. That is not the case in this country, because we have decided with trade agreements that it is fine for American producers to get in a small plane, circle the globe, find out where they can relocate their plant and pay pennies an hour and not be bothered by child labor laws or by environmental restrictions or by minimum wages or all the other things we fought about for 50 to 75 years in this country, move the production there, produce the same product and ship it back here. The net result is a trade loss for this country, a loss of good-paying, important manufacturing jobs for this country, and a continued erosion of this country's manufacturing base. That, I think, is moving in the wrong direction. 
Mr. President, I am not going to take the full hour allotted to me at this point. I intend to, at another point in this process, speak more about the issue, but I want to finish by saying, once again, that we will have, I assume, a discussion that represents the same old discussion, and that is an attempt to portray those who don't support this fast-track proposal as those who don't support expanded international trade. 
Let me portray it the way I think it really is. We have some people clinging to a failed trade strategy that has produced the largest trade deficits in the history of this country, clinging to it with their life because they resist change at every turn. There 
are those of us who understand that this trade strategy does not strengthen this country. It weakens this country. Increasing deficits don't strengthen this country. They undermine this country. Those of us who believe that it is time to change our trade policies. 
Do we want to change by keeping imports out? No. Do we want to change by retreating from the international economy? No. We want to change by insisting and demanding that it should be fashionable for a while to stand up for the economic interests of this country and that those who do so should not be called protectionists. Those of us who stand up, do so in a way that is designed to strengthen and to expand our country's economic opportunity in the years ahead. 
So, Mr. President, we will have many hours this week to talk about trade. I come from a State that needs to find a foreign home for much of what it produces. I am not someone who wants to retard trade. I want to expand trade. But I am someone who believes our Nation's trade strategy has not worked. Instead, we need a new trade strategy to expand exports, to expand opportunity and to diminish and eliminate these bloated trade deficits that threaten, in my judgment, this country's economic future. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Abraham, chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, as a cosponsor of legislation to clarify the intent of Congress under section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. He has taken up this matter to clarify the intent of Congress and I appreciate his efforts and those of Senator Kennedy to deal with this expeditiously. 
The interest of North Dakota in this bill specifically relates to the impact of imposing section 110 entry-exit requirements on the land border between Canada and North Dakota. In September, I introduced legislation, S. 1212, to exempt Canadian nationals from the requirements of section 110. Senators Conrad, Moynihan, and Levin have joined me in cosponsoring the bill. 
I have subsequently heard from small businesses not only in North Dakota, but from New York State, Michigan, and other States. They are very concerned that if Congress fails to take action to exempt Canadian nationals from the section 110 requirements it could have a devastating impact on their businesses. 
In 1995, Canadian visitors spent nearly $200 million in North Dakota. That is one in every four total tourism dollars coming into the State of North Dakota. Grand Forks, ND, devastated by floods last spring, is seeing a return of Canadian weekend visitors. The Convention and Visitors Bureau there tells me that without the Canadian visitors--who shop there, and who stay in area motels--without the Canadian visitors Grand Forks may never see a full economic recovery. These visitors are terribly important to this city trying to make a comeback. 
Ask any small business owner in northern North Dakota--or for that matter any northern border State. We should be talking about policies to encourage more Canadians to visit the United States. It is incumbent on the Senate and the House to act to exempt Canadian nationals from the requirements of section 110 and to send a signal that we welcome their business. 
Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham for taking up this important issue at this time. I endorse the exemption of Canadian nationals from section 110 requirements, and I wholeheartedly support his efforts to authorize additional personnel for the northern border. The northern borders in particular have seen no growth in resources for some time now. 
I encourage the committee to move expeditiously to bring this bill to the floor. To do so will reassure small business owners and small communities across the northern United States that we are looking out for their economic interests.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a few moments ago the majority leader came to the floor and filed a cloture motion on what is called the motion to proceed to the fast-track trade authority legislation that we will consider beginning next week in the U.S. Senate. I want to make comment about that, on the issue of fast-track authority. 
It seems to me it does not serve well the interests of this country to try to fit into a small crevice, at the end of the first session of this Congress with only days left, a debate about international trade. 
What is our situation in trade in this country? Well, it is not a very pretty picture. We have the largest trade deficit in the history of this country right now. We have huge and growing trade deficits with Japan. This year, it is expected to total between $60 billion to $65 billion. We have a mushrooming trade deficit with China, this year expected to reach close to $50 billion. We have an ongoing trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. We have a flood of subsidized goods coming into our country that I am convinced violates the antidumping laws of this country, undercutting our producers and undercutting our farmers. Yet, nothing is done about it. 
We are not winning in world trade. First of all, I think we are losing because our trade agreements have been negotiated largely as foreign policy instruments. Secondly, the trade agreements that do exist, which could be beneficial to this country, are not enforced. You can point to trade agreement after trade agreement with Japan, for example, and discover that no matter what the agreement is, it is not complied with by the Japanese and not enforced by the United States. 
The reason I take the time to mention this today is that we face very significant trade problems in this country. We have a daunting, growing trade deficit which has contributed now in the aggregate to about $2 trillion in our current accounts deficit. This deficit will be and must be repaid at some point in the future with a lower standard of living in this country. 
This is the other deficit. We have spent many months and many years talking about the budget deficit, and have wrestled that budget deficit to the ground. But this other deficit, the trade deficit, is growing. Nobody seems to care about that. 
The request comes now to Congress for fast track from the President saying: Let us go out and negotiate new trade agreements. I say let's solve the trade problems that exist from the old trade agreements before we rush off to make new trade agreements. 
In recent years, we made a free trade agreement with Canada. What happened? A flood of Canadian grain has come down our back door, undercutting our farmers. This is costing North Dakota alone, according to a recent North Dakota State University study, $220 million a year in lost revenue. This grain is coming from a state trading enterprise in Canada that would be illegal in this country. 
We had a trade agreement with Mexico. Prior to that, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Now it is apparently a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico. We now import more automobiles from Mexico to the United States than we export to all of the rest of the world. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute says that we have lost 395,000 jobs in America as a result of the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada called NAFTA. This trade of ours is not moving in the right direction. It is moving in the wrong direction. 
We should have a debate about trade policy, but it ought not be a debate that is tried to be fit into a narrow crevasse at the end of this session. I will bet as I stand here today that we will see the majority leader come to the floor in the days ahead trying to restrict amendments, limit amendments and debate, and shortchange the American people on the opportunity to have a full, thorough, and thoughtful debate about this country's trade policy. Just as sure as I am standing here, I know in a matter of 1, 2, 3, or 4 days, we will hear them on the floor saying, `We don't want amendments. We can't have you taking up that much time.' 
In fact, when the fast-track trade authority bill was passed out of the Senate Finance Committee, I am told it was done in 2 minutes. No amendments. Just minutes, no amendments, no debate. That is not the way this body ought to deal with the important subject of international trade. This is a critically important question to the economic health of this country. It is a question of who will have the jobs in the future, which economies will grow 
in the future, and who will have opportunity in the years ahead? 
I hope that, as we head toward next week and begin discussing this, we can prevail upon the majority leader and others to understand that this must be a full debate. I have plenty of amendments I want to offer. I know other colleagues have some, and I expect and hope we will have that opportunity in the coming week.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. This administration says they have negotiated nearly 200 trade agreements in the last 5 years--200 of them. Well, why didn't they need fast track to do that? Because those agreements were mostly bilateral trade agreements in which they weren't trying to change underlying U.S. law. Fast track gives them the opportunity to go out someplace with some negotiators and close the door, have a negotiation outside the purview of the public and propose changing underlying U.S. law. Then fast track says when you come back here to the U.S. Senate, nobody, no Member of this body, has an opportunity to have a voice in changing that agreement that was made behind closed doors.

Mr. DORGAN. That's correct. The administration talks about an agreement with Chile. Go negotiate an agreement with Chile. Get an airplane ticket for 1 o'clock. You can do that. Nothing prevents a negotiation on trade with Chile--not this fast-track authority or lack of it. You can negotiate a trade agreement with Chile if you want to. 
But, if you want to change underlying law, you have to bring it back to the Congress and get the permission of Congress to do that. The Senator makes an important point. There is nothing that prevents trade negotiations from occurring without fast-track authority. In fact, the administration says it has now completed over 200 trade agreements in the last 5 years.

Mr. DORGAN. Yes, the Senator is exactly right.

That is what the Congress is doing.

Mr. DORGAN. To give you an example of that, they negotiated a trade agreement with Canada under fast track. I was then serving 
in the other body on the House Ways and Means Committee, which has 35 votes. They brought that trade agreement to the Ways and Means Committee. The vote was 34-1 to approve it. I was the only one to vote to disapprove it. We weren't able to offer any amendments. It went to the floor of the House, and I led the opposition to it. I lost by 20 or 30 votes. No amendments. 
Now, what happened in the last 4 or 5 years with Canada? The deficit has doubled. We have a flood of this unfairly subsidized grain coming in, undercutting our producers. Everybody understands it is unfair trade, and you can't do a thing about it. We have folks that crow about it from time to time, but they don't lift a finger to do anything about it. 
That is what is wrong with these kinds of procedures. We should have been able to amend that treaty to make sure that if a trade agreement with Canada is contemplated, we have the ability to solve a problem if a problem exists. But they have pulled all the teeth now, so there are no teeth in this ability to reconcile and deal with problems. Now we have these trade agreements where the deficits keep ratcheting up. We have unfair competition for our producers, and jobs are leaving our country. As I said 395,000 jobs left our country to Mexico and Canada. It doesn't make any sense for us to tie our hands in this way.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has long been concerned and interested in international trade. I very much value and appreciate his support. It is not the case that the Senator from West Virginia, myself, and others, who believe that fast track is inappropriate and our trade strategy has not worked believe we should put walls around our country or restrict international trade. I think we ought to expand it. 
I say this to those folks who talk about fast track: If you want to be fast about something, do something fast, put on your Speedo trunks and do something quickly, and start to quickly solve the trade problems we have. I can cite a dozen of them that undercut American jobs and American producers, workers, and farmers. If you want to be fast about something, let's be fast about starting to solve a few of these problems. 
Just demonstrate that you can solve one; it doesn't have to be all of them. Demonstrate that this country has the nerve and will to stand up and say to other countries: If our market is open to you, then your market has to be open to us. We pledge to you that we will be involved in fair trade with you. We demand and insist that you be involved with fair trade practices with us. If not, this country has the will and the nerve to take action. 
That is all I ask. If you want to be fast, don't come around here with fast track, come around with fast action to solve trade problems. Show me that you can solve one of them just once. Then 
let's talk about trade once again.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, section 344 of the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 required the Department of Transportation to implement a motor carrier regulatory relief and safety demonstration project. The purpose of this project was to determine whether certain motor carriers with exemplary safety records could operate safely with fewer regulatory burdens. 
Specifically, the Department was required to establish a pilot program for operators of vehicles between 10,001 and 26,000 pounds, under which eligible drivers, vehicles, and carriers would be exempt from some of the Federal motor carrier safety regulations. 
The safety data generated from this project was to serve as the basis for assessing the appropriate level of future safety regulation for the motor carrier industry. 
The statute was clear. Section 344 required the Department of Transportation to ensure that participants in the project would be `subject to a minimum of paperwork and regulatory burdens necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of the program' and to `represent a broad cross section of fleet size and drivers of eligible vehicles'. 
Mr. President, I would inquire of the Majority Leader, what is the status of the motor carrier regulatory relief and safety demonstration project which we mandated in 1995?

Mr. DORGAN. I am, to be honest, somewhat taken aback by the Department of Transportation's obvious delay in implementing a congressionally mandated program. And I understand that delay is not the only problem afflicting this program. 
The Final Guidelines, only published this year, appear to fall far short of what was intended in section 334, both in terms of reducing paperwork and regulatory burdens and attracting a broad cross section of participating businesses. Potential business participants invested many months of effort attempting to work with the Department of Transportation to create a functional program. However, the Department's Final Guidelines still create unreasonable barriers to motor carrier participation, produce uncertainty in implementation and enforcement, and fail to reduce business paperwork.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it seems to me that if there has not been a single participant in this program--which was intended as a way to relieve the regulatory burden on those companies that have demonstrated a good safety record--then something is amiss with this program. 
I would hope that the Department would take a second look at this program and give serious consideration to making some changes that will permit the program to work in the manner in which Congress intended. It is clear that Congress desired to establish a means to achieve some regulatory relief and, thus far, we have not seen that result.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to introduce legislation today dealing with violent offenders. I want to preface it by saying that all of us in this country understand that crime rates are coming down some, and we are appreciative of that. But violent crime is still far too prevalent. 
In North Dakota a couple of weeks ago, we had a young woman named Julienne Schultz who stopped at a rest area on a quiet rural road and a quiet part of our State. She ran into a man in the rest area who abducted her, slashed her throat, and left her for dead. Well, I am pleased to tell you today that Julienne did not die, and she is recovering. 
The horror of that attack is a horror that is repeated all over this country, committed by violent criminals who never should have been out of jail early. That attack was perpetrated by a fellow who came from Washington State. He was, I guess, driving through North Dakota. He is alleged to have committed a couple of murders in Washington State before he left Washington a couple of months before. He ran into Julienne Schultz, this wonderful woman from North Dakota, who was coming back from a meeting with the League of Cities and stopped at a rest area only to have her throat slashed by this violent criminal. 
He then took his own life when stopped at a police blockade later that night. This fellow had been in prison in the State of Washington for prior violent crimes and was let out of prison early. 
It goes on all across this country. I think this country ought to decide that, if you commit a violent act, you are going to go to prison and the prison cell is going to be your address until the end of your sentence--no early out, no nothing. If you are convicted of a violent offense, you go to prison and stay there. Your prison cell is your address. 
I will just give you a couple more examples. 
Charles Miller is from West Virginia, 28 years old. A couple of years ago he was convicted of the violent rape of a young child and was sentenced to serve 5 years in prison. He was up for parole three times while he was in prison. His third time --May of this year--after serving half of the sentence, he was released on gain time, and 43 days later he was charged with sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. The prosecutor said, `Unfortunately, in the State the way it is now, everybody gets out early. We have people guilty of murder getting out on gain time do it again. We ought to abolish gain time.' 
I agree with that prosecutor. 
Miami, FL, a fellow named Gainer, age 23, shot a fellow named Robert Mays, 20 years old--got into a dispute about drugs. Sentenced to 5 years in State prison for manslaughter, served 1 year and 1 month, released because he had accumulated 600 days of what is called gain time for working in a prison camp. Six months after he was released he was charged with first-degree murder once again. 
Mr. Ball, 42, sentenced to 30 years of hard labor in Louisiana, cited for 102 disciplinary infractions in prison, the last infraction being 3 months before he was released 16 years before the end of his sentence for good behavior. He was rearrested on first-degree murder and armed robbery charges. 
Budweiser delivery man Bernard Scorconi was 45 years old, murdered by Mr. Ball when he tried to stop him from robbing a local bar. Ball was released 16 years earlier than the end of his sentence. 
It happens all across this country, every day in every way. Violent people are put back on the streets before the end of their sentence. 
My mother was killed by someone who committed a manslaughter act, and he was let out early. Everybody is let out early. Commit a violent act, you get let out early. All you have to do is go to prison, accumulate good time. In some States you get 30 days off for every 30 days served. 
I am proposing today a very simple piece of legislation. Let us tell those States who let violent people out of prison early, that you are going to be responsible for the actions of that offender up until what should have been the completion date of that offender's sentence. If a State or local government decides it is appropriate to allow violent offenders to be let out before the end of their term because they have accumulated good time, gain time, or parole. If violent offenders serve less than their entire sentence, then during that period of time when they should have been in jail, if they commit another violent crime, I want the states to be held responsible--no more immunity. 
I say to local governments, be responsible. You want to let violent people out on the street early, be responsible for it. Waive your immunity. Let people sue you to bring you to account for what you have done. 
I am proposing that the grants we have in the 1994 crime bill dealing with truth-in-sentencing and violent-offender incarceration be available to those States that decide they will waive immunity and be responsible for the acts these offenders on early release commit. 
I wonder how many people in this Chamber know that there are 
more than 4,000 people now in prison for committing a murder that they committed while they were out early for a previous violent crime. How would you like to be one of the families of the 4,000 or more people who are murdered who understand their loved one was murdered because someone else was let out early from prison. You know it doesn't take Dick Tracy to figure out who is going to commit the next violent act. It is somebody who has committed a previous violent act. 
I just suggest that there are those who say prisons are overcrowded and so the prison overcrowding forces them to release people early. Senator John Glenn and I have talked for years about military housing and its possible use for incarcerating non-violent offenders. Why couldn't corrections officials utilize this kind of low-cost housing for nonviolent offenders and freeup maximum security space for violent offenders. 
You can probably incarcerate nonviolent offenders for a fraction of the cost of what it takes to build a prison. Fifty percent of the 1.5 million people now in prison in this country are nonviolent. We can incarcerate them for a fraction of the cost of what we now spend to put them in prisons. 
We could open 100,000, 200,000, or 300,000 prison cells and say to violent offenders, that is your address until the end of your sentence. Understand that. Your address is your prison cell, if you commit a violent crime, until the end of your sentence. We ought to provide a creative way for states to facilitate that. 
Even with the best of intentions, in this Chamber about 4 years ago we decided that the most violent offenders have to serve 85 percent of their time. Let's let them out only 15 percent early, stated another way. In fact, in most States those who commit the most violent offenses and therefore get the longest sentences get the most generous amount of good time. 
I know people will disagree with me about this. I respect that disagreement. I say this. If you are the family of a young boy, 13 years old, named Hall who was murdered just miles from here, or of a young attorney in her early 20's named Bettina Pruckmayer, who was murdered just miles from here. Both of these young people murdered by individuals who had been in prison for previous murders but let out early because of the sentence system. Is it fine for us to let them back on the street? If they do not have good time, if they are hard to manage in prison, think about the violence done to others who are murdered and others who are going to die while they are on street. 
I am going to introduce this piece of legislation today. I hope in the next year or so before the Congress completes its work that we might be able to decide what we need to do about violent offenders. We can keep violent offenders off the streets to the end of their sentence, and we can protect people like Julienne Schultz, who, fortunately, is going to be all right. 
But this innocent young woman who was driving back from a meeting stopped at a rest stop in a quiet rural area, had her throat slashed and was close to being killed by a fellow who should never have been driving through North Dakota, by a fellow who was let out by authorities in another State which said, `We can't afford to keep you in prison,' apparently, and, `We don't have the time to keep you in prison anymore.' Well, we had better make time. We had better find the resources to keep these kind of folks in prison to the end of their term in order to help prevent further carnage and the kind of things that are happening to innocent people all across this country. 
Mr. President, I ask that the bill be pointed in the Record. 
Mr. President, you have been very generous in the time today. 
I yield the time. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will allow a discussion here briefly, I appreciate the Senator taking the floor to talk about the Federal Reserve Board and these nominees. I come not so much to talk about these two nominees but to discuss just a bit about where we are and where we are headed with the Federal Reserve Board policies. 
If you go back a century or a century and a half ago in this country, you could go from barber shops to barrooms and hear debates about interest rates. All over this country we debated interest rates. In fact, just go 30 or 40 years back, and you will find that Lyndon Johnson called the head of the Federal Reserve Board down to a barbecue at his ranch in Texas and squeezed him, almost broke his bones, I am told, in his shoulder area because the guy was trying to increase interest rates by one-quarter of 1 percent. That was in the 1960s. 
Now the Federal Reserve Board has a big concrete edifice downtown with these money-center bankers who sit inside of it and they decide where the interest rates are going to go, and it doesn't matter what the country thinks. 
Whose interests do they serve? Well, when they shut the doors down at the Federal Reserve Board and make decisions about interest rates, they call in on a rotating basis the presidents of the regional Fed banks, and they vote on what interest rates ought to be. 
Now, who are the regional Fed bank presidents? And who are they responsible to? Were they ever confirmed by the Senate? No. They were hired by a board of directors in their region. Who are the board of directors? Money center bankers. Whose interest do they represent in setting interest rate policy at the Fed? Bankers. It is bankers getting together, meeting with other bankers, to establish the interest rates. 
Is that in the interest of the American people? I think not. 
I have from time to time come to the floor of the Senate and suggested that my Uncle Joe should be appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. My Uncle Joe is a good guy. He is kind of semiretired now but a good guy, smart guy. He used to fix generators. He knew how to fix things. 
There is nobody at the Federal Reserve Board who knows how to fix anything. They all come from the same area. They all look the same. They all wear the same suits. They all have the same educational background. If you put them in a barrel and shake it up, the same person winds up on top--gray suit, Ivy League background. Normally he would have worked for the Federal Reserve Board in the past. They are an economist, which is psychology pumped up with helium, as I said in the past. And they are like the old Roman augurs who used to read the entrails of cattle or the flights of birds in order to portend the economic future. They sit down there now behind this concrete edifice telling us about interest rates and then vote, and they make them stick. 
Here, when we talk about taking money out of people's pockets in the form of taxes, we have these extended debates, but when they take money out of people's pockets in the form of higher than are justified interest rates, it is done behind closed doors in secret at the Federal Reserve Board and there is no debate at all and no accountability for it. 
The reason I want to pipe up a bit here on this is the Senator from Iowa makes the point interest rates are higher than they should be, and he is absolutely right. There is no historic justification given where inflation is today for interest rates that exist at the Federal Reserve Board. There is no justification for it at all. It means, in terms of where they set short-term interest rates, that the prime rate is too high and every other interest rate paid by every other American business and consumer is too high. It is a tax that is unjustified and enforced against every family. 
Now, no one has ever taken me up on the suggestion my Uncle Joe go to the Fed. The reason I suggested Uncle Joe is that my uncle would sit in there, I assume, and say, `Well what's this mean to the person out there on Main Street? What's this mean to the person who has a little business or who's borrowed some money to start a business? What's it mean to that person?' 
That is not discussed. It is just a closed group of people who kind of come from the same background, and they just keep talking and they decide what they are going to do in a closed session. 
I know the Senator from Iowa remembers I have brought to the floor of the Senate, just as a public service, a chart from time to time with all the pictures of the Fed Board of Governors, where they came from, what their education background is, how much money they make, along with the regional Fed bank presidents so the American people can see who's voting on interest rates. They need to see that. 
Now, I might make one other point. I appreciate so much the indulgence of the Senator from Iowa.

Mr. DORGAN. This is the last living dinosaur. It truly is. There has been a revolution of sorts in virtually every public institution. We have reformed welfare. We have tackled the budget deficit. We have done a lot of things in town in public policy. But guess what has not changed at all. The Federal Reserve Board. Nothing. No change. 
We had the GAO do an investigative analysis of the Federal Reserve Board. What we discovered--and I can put some of this in the Record at some point--was that while they were telling everybody that we need more austerity, telling Congress you need to tighten your belts, they were down there overeating, spending more and more each year. 
The report, a one-of-a-kind study that took 2 years to assemble, called into question a whole series of practices with respect to the Fed's building accounts, contracts they are involved with. But the interesting part of the report was--it was a large report. The little nub of it, which is the hood ornament on the excesses at the Federal Reserve Board, is that the Federal Reserve Board has squirreled away $4.3 billion, and I will bet most Members of the Senate don't know it's there. When we actually had the 
report done, it was about $3.7 billion, roughly. But now it has grown to $4.3 billion as of the 15th of this month--$4.3 billion.

Mr. DORGAN. For 80 consecutive years the Fed hasn't had a loss and it will and never will have a loss. You can't have a loss if you are the Federal Reserve Board. Your job is to create and make money, and you do it routinely on a guaranteed basis. So the question is this. Why would an institution that will never have a loss in the future, squirrel away $4.3 billion of the taxpayers' money in a rainy day fund? 
The GAO, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, asked that question. In fact, they are the ones who discovered it. I did not know it existed.

The GAO said simply that money ought to be given back to the American taxpayer; $4.3 billion. I wonder how many Members of the Senate know that sits down there in an account for an agency that will never have a loss. They have squirreled away $4.3 billion. 
The GAO says this ought to go back to the taxpayer. What is the Fed's response? No response. It doesn't have to respond to anybody. It is not accountable. It doesn't respond to you, to me, to the Congress, to the GAO. It is its own institution. 
It was not supposed to be that way. It was not supposed to be a strong central bank, unaccountable to anyone. It has become the last living American dinosaur: up on a hill, the big fence, locks on the doors. They make decisions behind closed doors. They call in their local bankers and make their decision on interest rates. They serve their constituents, not ours, and that is the public policy.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me suggest the Senator try that. In fact, I might be willing to go with him, and we will find, I assume, a reasonably comfortable chair--since I am told they buy great furniture down there. They will provide us a chair outside the room. Do you think the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and his colleagues on the Open Market Committee, the Board of Governors plus five rotating regional Fed bank chairmen who convene to make interest rate policy--do you think they are going to invite you in and say, `Do you want a glass of water or cup of coffee? And, by the way, while you are here, we would like you to sit in this chair because we would really like your advice.' 
Do you think that is going to happen? The answer is of course it is not going to happen because this is the last American dinosaur. It operates in secret, makes decisions without public debate because there isn't debate inside the Fed except inside a closed room among bankers. 
I know there are some of us who very strongly believe we should have some Fed reforms. I won't go on much longer because I know the Senator has other things to do.

Mr. DORGAN. That's why I want my Uncle Joe there. You are right. I pointed out the Federal Reserve Board--I know they won't like to hear me say this--but the Federal Reserve Board has largely been comprised of people you can just cut out with a cookie cutter. 
Incidentally, you and I come from the same part of the country. We have had the sum total of three, three people from our 
part of the country as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors since the beginning of the Federal Reserve Board, over 80 years ago--three.

Mr. DORGAN. There are some people out in the middle of the country, between the two coasts, who think we are more than just time and space, that we are part of the country and we are producers and we have a significant interest in what the interest rates are, how much economic growth this country enjoys and so on. That is why I really feel, when we talk about who should join the Federal Reserve Board, who we should confirm, I hope in the future we can finally get to some people who are outside the mold, who can say in those meetings, as they sit in those meetings, `Gee, what impact does this have? What are we justified in doing here in monetary policy, not just for the interest of banks but for the interest of businesses on Main Street, for the interest of manufacturing plants, and for the interests of mom and pop who are at home, borrowing money trying to send kids to school, maybe trying to start a business?' Those are the questions that I think are not asked because you have a single objective at the Fed at this point and that is they have decided to pursue, as you correctly pointed out, a zero inflation rate.

Mr. DORGAN. We had a recent example at the Federal Reserve Board. We sent someone down there who I think had pretty good promise, kind of a different-thinking person. He didn't last too long. At least some of the discussion in the papers about why this fellow left the Federal Reserve Board--I am told it is because he was not accommodated very well. You know, he didn't think the same, so he was sent over to a corner there and wasn't involved in policy very much. The result was that it was not a place he wanted to stay, because it wasn't a place for dissenters or people with opposing views. 
I will finish by simply saying--

Mr. DORGAN. By simply saying the Senator from Iowa does an important service, it seems to me, in a Senate that is empty, pretty much, on an issue of monetary policy and Federal Reserve Board issues, when very few people are willing to discuss or debate or advance these issues. The Senator from Iowa is willing to do that. For that, I am enormously appreciative. 
I know neither of us is going to be given an award, Man of the Year Award, by the Federal Reserve Board or any of the regional banks, and I accept that. But I do think it would serve this country's better interest to have a significant debate about what kind of monetary policy is good for all of our country, good for working families, good for businesses, good for Main Street and Wall Street--good for banks, yes, because we want banks to do well as well as the rest of the American economy. But we have such a lack of thoughtful debate about monetary policy. The two policies of monetary and fiscal policy are the policies that determine whether we have an economy that is doing well. 
The Senator made a very important point. We had recessions and depressions before we had the Federal Reserve Board and we have had recessions and depressions since. Has the Federal Reserve Board done some good things? Yes, I think so. I think in times of difficulty they have made some tough decisions. I think in times of fiscal policy excess they have put the brakes on, in monetary policy. I think there are a number of things that I can point to about the Fed and say, `Good job, we are glad you were there.' But there are other circumstances in which I think it is important to say to the Fed, `You have a responsibility in public policy to do more than just represent bankers' interests, more than just represent your single-minded goal that ignores the needs of a whole lot of the American people.' I don't stand here saying that I think we ought to do things that advance more inflation in our economy. 
Less inflation is better for our economy, and the global economy is what has largely produced a lower rate of inflation. But it is also very important, having the aggressive debates we have in fiscal policy, in monetary policy for us to foster the opportunity for those same debates about what kind of policies benefit whom and how and why. That is what the Senator from Iowa does. I think it is a significant service for him to be here and do that. I am pleased to come out from time to time and be involved in the discussion with him.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana expresses a good number of concerns about the universal service funding issue. I, too, am concerned about the issue of universal service. The discussion this morning is on the nomination of Mr. Kennard to be Chairman of the FCC. If Mr. Kennard is confirmed, and I expect he will be, by the vote of the Senate today, that means four of the five Federal Communication Commissioners will be new Commissioners. Four of the five will be new, taking office at a time when we face some of the most critical decisions we have ever faced at the FCC. 
The Senator from Montana made the point that the universal service fund is critical. It certainly is critical to the area that I come from. I come from a town of 300 people, from a county the size of the State of Rhode Island, that has 3,000 people in the entire county. Now, why is the universal fund issue critical? Because if you don't provide universal fund support for telephone service in the high-cost areas, it will mean many areas of this country will not have good telephone service, because a whole lot of folks won't be able to afford it. 
The FCC estimated that in my hometown it would cost $200 a month to build and maintain a new network to provide telephone service--$200 a month--but of course in a very large city that might be $10 a month. So what we have done in this country historically is to have universal service support for the high-cost areas so that they have comparable telephone service at affordable rates. That is what the whole premise of universal service has been about. 
Now, the reason I worry so much is the Federal Communications Commission has been heading in the wrong direction, headed toward a goal of having much higher telephone costs in rural areas of the country. 
I will support Mr. Kennard's nomination today, but I want everyone to be clear that if this new board, if the new Commission cannot properly define universal service fund support, cannot read the law as we wrote it--and I helped write it--that said comparable service at an affordable price--and that is not unusual English--if they can't understand that and can't read it correctly and can't define universal service support sufficient so we don't have substantial telephone rate increases across this country, then we ought to abolish the FCC. We don't need the FCC and all of its staff. We don't need them if they can't make the right decision. 
I will vote for this nomination, but I also want people to understand these critical decisions must be made appropriately to provide proper universal service support that comports with the requirements of the law--comparable service at an affordable price--yes, even in the smallest towns in the most rural counties of this country, because that is what the Congress directed the universal service fund support to be in the years ahead. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know that there is some business that the majority leader will take up in a few moments. When he desires the floor I certainly will yield to him. But I wanted to take this moment to describe a couple of the things that I think we still need to do, unfinished items, before the Senate leaves following this first session of this Congress. Among those is the issue of campaign finance reform, which we have been debating back and forth here for some long while. There is not any reason, in my judgment, that we cannot take up and at least have a vote on the substance of campaign finance reform. 
Second, it seems to me that we cannot leave town without having done something on a highway reauthorization bill. I know there are some who say we brought a highway bill to the floor of the Senate and we had plenty of opportunity and now we had to pull it, but I want to make the point the bill that was brought to the floor of the Senate was brought here under procedures designed to block legislation, not pass legislation. And we have a responsibility, whether it is a 6-month bill or a 6-year bill, we have a responsibility to address the issue of highway construction and the highway reauthorization bill. So my hope is that through negotiation the leaders of the Democrats and the Republicans here in the Senate can deal with both of these issues in a thoughtful way. 
But I did want to make the point that we also are probably going to deal with the issue called fast-track trade authority in the coming week or so. To the extent we do that, I want Members of the Senate to understand this will not be an easy issue. There are a number of us here in the Senate who feel very strongly about the issue of trade. It is not a circumstance where we believe that our country should put walls around the country and prevent imports from coming in, or that we should ignore the fact that we now live in a global economy or that we should decide, somehow, that trade is not part of our economic well-being, it is unimportant--that is not the case at all. Trade is very important. It is a critically important component of this country's ability to grow and to prosper. But the right kind of trade is important, not the wrong kind of trade. 
The wrong kind of international trade in this country is trade that results in ever-increasing, choking trade deficits, because those deficits, now totaling nearly $2 trillion, trade deficits which in this last year were the largest merchandise trade deficits in the history of this country--in fact, that was true for the last 3 years and will be true at the end of this coming year--the largest merchandise trade deficits in this country. To the extent that is the kind of trade we are involved in, trade that is not reciprocal, trade that is not two-way trade that is fair, trade that substantially increases our deficits and takes American jobs and moves them abroad and overseas--that is not trade that is beneficial to our country. Many of us feel it is time for us to have a debate on the floor of the Senate about what is fair and what is unfair trade. 
I have said many times that it is very difficult to have a discussion about trade. A discussion about international trade quickly moves into a thoughtless ranting by those who say there is only one credible view on trade and that is the view of free trade. You are either for free trade or you are somebody who doesn't quite understand. You are an xenophobic isolationist who wants to build walls around America--you are either that or you are a free trader. I happen to believe expanded trade, in the form of fair trade, makes sense for this country, so I am someone who believes that we benefit from reciprocal trade with other countries, that trade with other countries can be mutually beneficial. But I also believe it hurts our country when we have trade circumstances that exist when we trade with another country and they ship all their goods to our marketplace and then we discover what we produce, our workers and our businesses, can't get our goods into their marketplace. That is not fair, yet that goes on all across the world. 
I notice today the President of China has arrived in our country. Our country welcomes him. We hope we will have a mutually productive relationship with China. I am concerned about a number of things that I see happening in China--yes, human rights. I was in China about a year ago today, when a young man was sentenced to prison, I believe for 11 years, for criticizing his government. So I think there are serious human rights questions in China. But also, in addition to the human rights issues in China, the Chinese leader comes to our country at a time when they have, with us, a trade imbalance of nearly $40 to $50 billion. Last year it was $40 billion and it is now heading to $50 billion. 
So we have a Chinese Government and a Chinese economy that ships massive quantities of Chinese goods to our country. But when it comes time to buy from our country, things which China needs--wheat, airplanes and more--they say, `Well, we want to ship Chinese goods to your country, but we want to look elsewhere for products; we want to go price shopping for a week with Canada and with Venezuela.' 
So while we used to be the major wheat supplier to China, we were displaced as the major wheat supplier even as they were running up huge trade surpluses with us or us being in the position of having huge trade deficits with them. 
Airplanes. China has obviously the largest population on Earth, and they need a lot of airplanes. They don't manufacture large airplanes. They need to buy airplanes. So, since they ship so many of their products to our country for consumption, you expect they would come to us and buy our airplanes. 
They come to our country and say, `We need airplanes, but we'll buy your airplanes if you manufacture the airplanes in China.' That's not the way trade works. That's not a mutually beneficial relationship, and that's the thing that I think we ought to be talking to the Chinese leader about. 
Yes, we ought to talk about a whole range of other issues--human rights, the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology and the transfer of missile technology to renegade and rogue nations. Yes, we ought to talk to them about that. But we also ought to talk to them about this huge growing trade deficit. 
I hope very much that when President Clinton visits with President Jiang Zemin, he will describe to him a trade relationship mutually beneficial, and it is not one where one side has a huge imbalance, in this case China, and in which case the United States has a huge and growing deficit, which means, in the final analysis, that jobs that existed for Americans are now moving overseas. That is what is at the root of this trade imbalance. Jobs that used to be U.S. jobs, jobs held by U.S. citizens, jobs to help maintain U.S. families are now jobs that are gone. 
The same is true with Japan. I happen to be talking about China just because the Chinese leader is in town today. But Japan, we have a growing trade deficit with Japan. As far as the eye can see, it has been $50 billion, $60 billion a year. This year, it is expected to be up 20 or 25 percent, probably reaching a $60 billion, $65 billion trade deficit with Japan once again this year. 
Are there people walking around here saying this is an urgent problem, this is trouble? No, they don't. They say, `Gee, this is just free trade. So what if we have a huge trade deficit.' In fact, one person wrote an article in the Washington Post recently and said those folks who talk about the trade deficit being troublesome for our country don't understand it. He said, `Think of it this way: If someone offered to sell you $10,000 worth of pears for $5,000 worth of apples, you would jump at it.' 
That is a simple and irrelevant example, one I suppose meant to inform those of us from other parts of the country who don't quite get it. Perhaps there is a way to study economics or perhaps there is a school that teaches economics that will tell those people who think that way and write that way that trade deficits represent an export of part of your wealth. Trade deficits will and must be repaid with a lower standard of living in this country's future. Trade deficits are trouble for this country's economy. 
People say to me, `Well, if that's true, if trade deficits are troublesome, why do we have an economy that seems so strong?' You can have an appearance of strength. You can live next to a neighbor that has a brand new Cadillac in the driveway, a brand new home and all the newest toys without understanding, of course, that it is all debt financed and that person is about 2 weeks away from serious financial trouble. 
So our trade deficit matters, and we must do something about it. 
The point I make about fast track, which is the trade authority the President is going to seek, is this: We have massive trade problems, yes, with Japan, with China, yes, with Canada, with Mexico. And before we run off and negotiate new trade agreements in secret, behind closed doors, let's fix some of the trade problems that now exist. 
Senator Helms yesterday reminded me of an old quote that Will Rogers made that I had read many years ago. He said, `The United States has never lost a war and never won a treaty.' That is certainly true with trade. 
Recently, we were asked to provide fast-track trade authority so that a trade agreement called NAFTA could be reached with Canada and Mexico. So the Congress dutifully complied. The Congress passed what is called fast-track authority which says, you go ahead, you negotiate a new trade agreement with a foreign country, you can do it in secret, you can do it without coming back and advising us what you are doing; bring it back, and you come to the Senate and House and it must be considered with no amendments because no amendments 
will be allowed. That is what fast track is. 
Fast track through the Senate says that nobody will be allowed to offer an amendment; no amendments at all. 
So NAFTA was negotiated. They ran off and negotiated NAFTA, brought it back, and ran it through the Congress. I didn't vote for it, but the Congress passed it. When NAFTA was negotiated, we had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. Then they negotiated NAFTA, which includes Canada, and the trade deficit doubled. 
When NAFTA was negotiated with Mexico, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. They negotiate NAFTA and the $2 billion trade surplus evaporated to a $15 billion trade deficit. 
That is progress? Where I come from it is not called progress. Yet, we are told now, again, we need to have fast-track trade authority. 
I come from a State that borders Canada. I just want to tell you that today thousands of trucks come across the border from Canada hauling Canadian durum and Canadian wheat, sold into this country by a state trade enterprise, by a monopoly called the Canadian Wheat Board. It is a monopoly that would not be allowed to sell grain in this country. It would be illegal. It sells its grain at secret prices. Yet, it ships through our backyard enormous quantities of Canadian grain, undercutting our farmers' interests, undercutting our income in our State by $220 million a year, according to a study at North Dakota State University, and the fact is, we can't get it stopped. 
It is patently unfair trade, and we can't get it stopped because all these trade agreements that they have concocted over the years have pulled out the teeth of enforcement of trade treaties in a meaningful way, and so now we can't chew and we are complaining there are no teeth. 
I understand what has happened here. What has happened here is we have concocted bad trade strategy, bad trade agreements and bad enforcement of the agreements that did exist. It is time for us to decide we must insist our country stand up for its own economic interest. Yes, its economic interest is in part served by expanding world trade. We are a leader. We ought to lead in world trade. We ought not close our borders. I don't sound like Smoot. I don't look like Hawley. So those thoughtless people who say, `Well, if you don't chant `free trade' like a robot on a street corner, we will call you Smoot-Hawley'--that is the most thoughtless stuff I ever heard, but it goes on all the time. 
I am not someone who believes we should shut off the flow of imports and exports, but I do believe we ought to stand up to the interests of the Chinese, Japanese and, yes, the Mexicans and Canadians, and other trading partners and tell them it is time for reciprocal and fair trade treatment. If we let your goods into our marketplace--and we should and will--then you have a responsibility to open your markets to American goods. 
If we say to our people, `You can't pollute our streams and air when you produce,' then foreign producers who want to ship to our country ought not be able to pollute their rivers and streams on Earth through that same production. If we say that it is not fair to hire 14-year-old kids and work them 14 hours a day and pay them 14 cents an hour, then we ought to say to them that we don't want your goods if you are employing 14-year-old kids and working them 14 hours a day. We don't want producers to pole vault over all those debates we had all these years about worker safety, about child labor, about minimum wage, about air pollution and water pollution. We don't want that to be represented as fair trade because it is not if producers find the lowest cost production in the world, locate their plants there and produce their products in those circumstances avoiding all of the problems that exist for them in having to comply with what we know now are commonsense proposals: child labor proposals, minimum wage, environmental proposals and others. That is what this is all about. 
My only concern is this: I want us to have a fast track trade debate in which we are able to offer amendments, able to have a lengthy and thoughtful discussion about our trade policies and able to have an opportunity back and forth in this Chamber to describe what kind of trade policies will best advance this country's economic interests. 
If and when the legislation comes to the floor of the Senate, and we will begin with a motion to proceed at some point, when that happens, some of us will be on the floor of the Senate insisting that we have a full, a fair and a thoughtful debate about this country's trade policy. At least those of us, including myself, who believe very strongly that a trade policy that produces the largest trade deficit in the history of this country is not moving this country in the right direction, we will be here demanding that kind of aggressive debate. 
What does our trade strategy now produce and what kind of trade strategy would represent better economic interest for this country? 
Not protectionism, but an interest of expanding the American economy and expanding American opportunities as we move ahead. 
So let me conclude--I know my colleague has things that he wants to say on education issues--and let me once again indicate that I hope very much that prior to getting to fast track, which I expect will probably happen the end of this week or the first part of next week, that we can also address the issue of campaign finance reform with a real vote, and we can also extend the highway reauthorization bill. 
Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Vermont for his patience and thank him for the wonderful work he does on education.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I would like to salute an outstanding young woman who has been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the Sakakawea Girl Scout Council in Bismarck, ND. 
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of this program in 1980. As a member of the Sakakawea Girl Scout Council, Jennifer Horan began working toward the Girl Scout Gold Award in October 1996. She completed her project in the area of human development with an emphasis in interpersonal relationships. 
I believe Jennifer should receive public recognition for this significant service to her community and her country, and that's why I am proud to call the Senate's attention to her outstanding achievement.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President. A bright young reporter, Kevin Wallevand, who covers news in Fargo, ND for WDAY television, has made my State, and me, awfully proud. Kevin's documentary, `The Quilt: Hope from the Heartland,' has been awarded an Emmy, television's highest award. 
In North Dakota, we have always known that Kevin is a talented reporter, writer, and producer. Now, his documentary about the dark side of human nature that allows exploding land mines to do the work of war; and the bright side of human kind, the compassion people show toward one another in the aftermath of war's tragedies, has earned him national acclaim. 
Kevin Wallevand has produced a moving story about a rural community where women create by hand a beautiful, colorful quilt in the hope that it will warm and cheer someone less fortunate than themselves. The resulting quilt begins its travels near the North Dakota border on the Buffalo River, and ends its journey along a river in Angola, Africa where a homeless family--bodies ravaged by exploding land mines--clutches the quilt for warmth and safety. 
Sadly, we learn that the family's story is not an isolated one. Kevin takes us into the hospital beds of other villagers who have fallen victim to landmines--who are displaced and anticipating the help and the arrival of thousands of quilts, blankets and other donated items from American volunteers. 
Hundreds of churches, like the one in Kevin's story, and other humanitarian groups have taken it upon themselves to give a little comfort and a little hope to landmine victims. Now we, as a country, owe it to them to prevent this instrument of war, which targets innocent people long after the peace agreement has been signed, from ever being used again. 
Like Kevin, I have seen first hand the tragic human costs of landmines. While serving in the House of Representatives, I visited a clinic in Central America where landmine victims who had lost hope, along with a leg or an arm, were fitted for artificial limbs. I witnessed how important it was to support this program which could turn their lives around. When I returned, I worked to get funding so that other landmine victims might be able to get prosthetic limbs and I'm proud to say I helped get it done. Kevin must have the same kind of satisfaction--because by showing others the horrors of this war against the innocent, he has struck a blow against the worldwide scourge of land mines. But more must be done. 
I commend Kevin Wallevand, and the others who worked on this story at WDAY, for bringing this tragedy to the attention of others. Landmines are a worldwide problem, but with a very simple solution. We must rid the world of landmines and promise future generations that this weapon of destruction will never be used again for warfare. In sharing this Emmy winning story, Kevin's work heightens our awareness of the problem and brings us a step closer to that ultimate goal. Congratulations to Kevin Wallevand. You make North Dakotans very proud.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are preparing to cast a vote on a cloture motion in another 10 minutes or so, and I thought it would be useful to take the floor of the Senate and describe not only for our colleagues but for those who watch the proceedings of this body what exactly is happening. 
We are nearing the end of a legislative session. We expect from what the leaders have indicated that the Senate will continue for perhaps another 2 1/2 weeks at the most. We have on the floor of the Senate a piece of legislation that we should consider and we should pass. It is called the ISTEA or the highway reauthorization bill. It is a very important piece of legislation. 
Just prior to having this legislation on the floor of the Senate, we had a piece of legislation called campaign finance reform. That is a piece of legislation we should pass as well. It is interesting that both pieces of legislation were brought to the floor and tied up with ropes procedurally so that no one could do anything with either piece of legislation. 
Why? One underlying reason: Because there are some in this Chamber who do not want to allow an up-or-down vote on campaign finance reform. They want to crow about campaign finance reform and how much they support it. They want to go out and talk about their desire to have campaign finance reform, but they don't want to allow this Chamber an opportunity to vote on campaign finance reform. 
The fact is the American people know better. The American people know this system is broken and ought to be fixed. They know we need campaign finance reform, and they know that the votes exist in the Senate to pass a campaign finance reform 
bill. In fact, we have demonstrated on procedural votes there are at least 52, 54, perhaps 55 Senators who will vote for campaign finance reform. But can we get to the vote? No. Why? Because procedurally those who control this Senate have tied ropes around both campaign finance reform and now the highway bill in a manner designed to prevent having an uncomfortable vote on campaign finance reform. 
When I talk about using ropes, I am talking about procedures called `filling the tree.' It is probably a foreign language to people who don't know what happens in the Senate, but it is a rarely used approach, filling the tree, which means establishing through parliamentary devices a series of amendments, first degree and second degree, that offset each other sufficient so when you are finished filling the tree, no one can move and no one can do anything. 
The highway reauthorization, which is on the floor now, was brought to the floor and the tree was filled immediately. As I said, it is a rarely used device and almost always used to prevent something from passing.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New Jersey is absolutely correct. 
The Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, who is on the floor, has, along with the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, brought to us a bipartisan proposal to say, `Let's fix this issue. Let's do something meaningful about campaign finance reform.' 
Every day you look in the paper and there is something new, some new revelation about what has happened in campaign finances, and it is not good. It has been Democrats a good number of times, and I understand that, and I am uncomfortable with that. Today it happens to be Republicans in the Washington Post--$1 million-plus passed from big donors to other groups, then out to campaigns. So what you have is big money being moved into campaigns with an inability to trace any portion of the funds. Yesterday, the same thing, in a little race going on up in New York. Right now, $800,000 put into that race in issue advertising which is unfortunately, under today's system, a legal form of cheating. 
I think it would be in the best interest of the American people that we brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate an opportunity to vote yes or no, up or down, on campaign finance reform and stop the silly dance going on.

Mr. DORGAN. One of the reasons we are told they don't want to have a vote on this is because money is speech, they say. If that is the case, there are a lot of folks in this country who are voiceless in American politics. 
There is too much money ricocheting off the walls in politics. We need to do something about it. Campaign finance reform of the type offered by Senator Feingold and Senator McCain is a step in the right direction. All we need to do is be allowed to have a vote on campaign finance reform.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator mentioned fast track. I would not expect us to have fast consideration of fast track. I would expect that piece of legislation would take some significant time. But that wasn't the reason I asked the Senator to yield. 
There clearly is a wrench in the crankcase here and we are not moving. I suspect the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, feels the wrench is he's not able to get cloture on the highway bill and others feel that the wrench is that we are not able to get a vote on the McCain-Feingold legislation. I wonder whether we wouldn't, in the coming days, be able to accomplish both purposes. Are there circumstances under which we might be able to expect that we can proceed on the highway bill and proceed to find a way to have a vote in some fashion on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill?

Mr. DORGAN. One additional comment. I understand the points the Senator from Mississippi makes. He indicates he would bring it to the floor, that is campaign finance reform. He did that. But when the Senator from Mississippi announces, `I don't understand how it would come up,' it would come up in the regular order, offered as an amendment. The dilemma we have at the moment is the regular order is not allowed because we have a procedure on the highway reauthorization bill to fill the tree, which prevents a second-degree amendment at some point to get back into consideration of it. 
I understand and accept all the points the Senator from Mississippi made about cloture and all those issues. I would just say this, that I think you only have to pick up the paper every single day to see the problems that exist all around in campaign finance reform. I think the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona have crafted an approach that we at least ought to be able to express ourselves on in some detail. 
Bringing the campaign finance reform bill to the floor did not include the opportunity to actually get to those votes. We hope very much to have that kind of opportunity one way or the other in the future. That was the reason I inquired of the Senator from Mississippi to see whether we might not get to that point at some early point in the consideration of the Senate in the final days.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I notice that we are in a situation today that is no different than the circumstances we found ourselves in before we left for the recess last week, and that is the bill that is on the floor of the Senate is the highway reauthorization bill, or ISTEA. Most people want to get some progress made on that piece of legislation. 
I might say to the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Montana who are managing that bill, I think they have done an extraordinary job with that bill and I support what they have done. I very much want the Senate to be able to complete its work on the highway reauthorization bill. 
I also am someone who believes that if the Senate leaves after this first session of Congress without having dealt with the underlying bill of the campaign finance reform issue, more specifically, McCain-Feingold, we will not have done what we should do for the American people on that issue. It is clear we have a serious problem in campaign finance. It ought not be lost on the American people. I am sure it is not. We have a system here that is broken. There is money ricocheting around every crevice of this political system. 
There was a story in one of the newspapers today, some new groups are coming together, suggesting each of the organizations and groups contribute a million dollars so they can do new independent campaign expenditures. The fact is there is all this money ricocheting around the political system, and it ought not be lost on anybody that this system is broken and needs fixing. 
How do we fix it? There are a number of different ideas, but the McCain-Feingold is one that has been worked on and a lot of time has been spent on that proposal. At least we ought to have the opportunity for a vote on the McCain-Feingold proposal. We were told prior to bringing the highway reauthorization bill to the floor of the Senate that we would debate campaign finance reform. In fact, it was on the floor of the Senate for some long while, but we never got to a vote on the substance of campaign finance reform because all we did was talk and talk and talk, and then it was pulled from the floor before there was an opportunity for a vote. 
That is our dilemma. We have kind of a self-imposed set of circumstances here where shackles have been allied in this legislative process so that, first, we can't get a vote on campaign finance reform, and, second, we have the highway reauthorization bill on the floor which we need to pass--it is a good bill, incidentally, which we need to pass--but it is brought to the floor with a Byzantine kind of structure in which the parliamentary tree is filled with amendments and second degrees and they have done what is called fill the tree so that no one else can offer any amendments on this legislation. So we find ourselves in a circumstance where we have gridlock, a self-imposed gridlock, because some are worried that we will force a vote on campaign finance reform--a vote, incidentally, I think the American people would like to see us have. So the result is they take a bill such as the highway reauthorization and load it up by filling the tree so that you can't do anything on that, either. 
Now, I am thinking that perhaps later this afternoon I should come over--I guess what we have is a tree filled and the last amendment is a second-degree amendment--and maybe I should ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment. I think the yeas and nays would be in order on the second-degree amendment, so perhaps in order to try to end this gridlock, we ought to at least ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment. 
In fact, let me just say for the record, the second-degree amendment as constructed by Senator Lott, the majority leader, is one I will support. So if we get the yeas and nays, and I will vote for it, presumably a number of Members of the Senate would vote for it sufficient for it to pass, and then at that point the tree isn't full and people can come out here and offer amendments. Then we have one of two opportunities to do business: Either someone can come to the floor and offer an amendment to try to get a vote on McCain-Feingold, the campaign finance reform bill that will reform the campaign finance system, or someone can come to the floor and offer an amendment on the highway reauthorization act. 
Either of those alternatives is preferable to the circumstance we now find ourselves in. It does no service to the Senate to say, first, we don't want to vote on campaign finance reform, so second, we will bring the ISTEA bill or highway reauthorization to the floor of the Senate and then tie it up with the same rope that we used to tie up campaign finance reform so that we are not able to move on either. 
I again observe perhaps the approach should be for one of us, perhaps myself or someone else, to come over this afternoon 
and ask for the yeas and nays. I assume we can find enough friends to come and get a sufficient second, and at some point we can get the yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment, which is the lowest hanging fruit on this bitter tree that has been constructed, and at that point maybe we can offer some other amendments. My first choice would be campaign finance reform, get a vote on that and move on, but if it is not that, at least other amendments, so we can make progress on what I think is a very good highway reauthorization bill. 
I began by complimenting the Senator from Montana. He was not here, and the Senator from Rhode Island, I don't know if he heard, but you have brought a bill to the floor of the Senate that is an extraordinarily good bill. I like this piece of legislation. This country needs your legislation. I think the country will be better served by having the Senate pass it and going to conference and getting more than a 6-month extension that seems to be the mood on the other side. To the extent we move this bill and put in law some very good legislation, the country will be best served. 
In order to get to that point, however, we have to find a way to untie this whole process, first on ISTEA, especially on ISTEA, saying let's bring the highway reauthorization bill to the floor and tie it up so nobody can move and then also on campaign finance reform. On campaign finance reform we all know the American people want us to at least vote on that issue. They don't want people to be involved in parliamentary maneuvering sufficient so you don't get an up-or-down vote on a bill that a good number of Members of this Senate have worked on for many, many, many months. 
Mr. President, I will not do so now, but I say that if we have what is called a legislative tree filled with first- and second-degree amendments sufficient so that no one else in the Senate is able to move at all on anything, perhaps what we ought to do is take that bottom second-degree amendment, which I support and I expect the ranking member and the chairman would support, and let's vote on that. Let's have a vote on it. I will vote for it, we will pass it, and we will open a spot, and then let's do the business of either the highway reauthorization bill or any other amendment that one may wish to bring to the floor of the Senate, which might include on behalf of some the campaign finance reform proposal. 
That is the only way, it seems to me, that we would be able to get the Senate to begin moving. It probably can only be considered sufficient to Members of a body that understand these rules to believe somehow you make progress when the lights are on and the heat is on. But there is no thoughtful discussion about an issue that allows you to make progress because we have the thing tied in knots. That is not something that would be sufficient to the rest of the American people. 
Let me finish by saying again that we have a very important bill on the floor of the Senate right now. I want to be helpful in moving that piece of legislation, but it is not moving. It hasn't moved a centimeter. We have made no progress at all since the moment it was brought to the floor of the Senate, except for some statements. Why? Because some people are afraid that campaign finance reform will be brought to the floor as an amendment and be voted on and they don't want to have a vote on campaign finance reform, so they tie up the highway reauthorization. 
Let's find a way to untie all of us. Let's have our votes up or down. However they come out, they come out. 
We don't waive those here. We just count them. Let's have them and decide where the votes are. In fact, prior to the highway reauthorization bill being brought to the floor and the cloture vote, it looks to me like there is probably sufficient numbers of Senators who would vote for McCain-Feingold to enact legislation of that type. It appears to me that there are over 50 votes in the Senate for that. But because we couldn't get past the cloture vote we couldn't get to it. 
That is part of the purpose, I assume, with tying the Senate up with this procedural tree. But I guess it would be appropriate for a Member of the Senate to ask for the yeas and nays on the underlying second-degree amendment. I would certainly consider doing that later this afternoon, if that is what is available to us, and if that might get us off dead center and allow us to open up a slot either to do this bill, or for someone to come over and offer some other amendment of their choice. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. It seems to me that the only reason the tree is full with a final second-degree amendment that would be acceptable to everyone is simply to prevent others from offering amendments. I understand the parliamentary strategy here. But the problem is that it puts the Senate in the position of having kind of a glacial progress. I have never tried to watch a glacier move.

Will the Senator from Montana agree that we are not moving; that we have a circumstance where a bill is brought to the floor, and we are virtually tied in knots with a procedural tree, which is not unusual?

Mr. DORGAN. The point is the tree was developed with the longest hanging fruit a second-degree amendment. If that is acceptable to the Senate, my point was, let's come here and ask for the yeas and nays, and have a vote on it. And if the vote is yes, as I expect it would be, then the tree is open, and we can offer amendments. 
My expectation would be that someone would come and say, `We are not going to allow you to offer amendments. We will fill the tree again.' I say that is fine. Let's vote again. Let's keep voting, and maybe at some point we will start making forward progress. You can have your car engine idling, and you can say, `Well, the engine is running.' Yes. But you are not going anywhere. That is kind of what is happening here. What I want to do is have the engine running with the lights on, with the heat going, and some discussion on the floor of the Senate. But we are not going anywhere. I want to go somewhere--both on campaign finance reform, and I want to make progress on the highway reauthorization bill. And we are going nowhere on both of those fronts.

The bill is brought to the floor with a procedure that really doesn't allow any movement on the bill. I expect you will remain on the floor while the bill is being considered, and perhaps at some point when the bill is further considered that we will ask for the yeas and nays and see if by that manner we can make some additional progress.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to visit today about the fast-track trade debate that we are expected to take up here in the U.S. Senate in the next couple of weeks. It is an interesting topic. I expect it will be a hotly contested debate as it deals with international trade. 
I was in North Dakota last week, and I assume the presiding officer was in Kansas and my other colleagues from here in the Senate were in their home States. I saw an interesting editorial in the largest newspaper in North Dakota, the Fargo Forum. The editorial says: Farm Economy Is at Risk. Then it describes the problems that our family farmers are facing in North Dakota including, problems of lower production because of crop disease, the lack of moisture in some parts of our State, too much moisture in other parts of our State, and very low prices that they receive for their grain. The editorial talks about an average size farm penciling out to a $23,000 loss in net worth this year. This is for the average size farm with average production this year. 
I was thinking about this because as I travel in North Dakota I see a great many family farmers. Most of them are descendants of the homesteaders in this country, the people who moved out to build a farm, and try to make a living. For some people it has been very, very hard. 
In North Dakota about 200 years ago, in fact just about 7 or 8 years less than 200 years ago, we had a visit from Louis and Clark. Thomas Jefferson, then President of the United States, bought from Napoleon Bonaparte the Louisiana Purchase, as it was called, for 3 cents an acre. He bought all that land out there for 3 cents an acre. Some jumped up in the Senate and said, why on Earth would you buy land out there? There is nothing out there. There are Indians and sagebrush. Why would you want that land? 
If you were to equate what he paid for the Louisiana Purchase and compared to our current budget, he paid the equivalent of $3 trillion. This is as a percentage of what we spend today at the Federal Government level versus what Jefferson proposed to spend on the Louisiana Purchase. He bought for 3 cents an acre on all of that land. This is equivalent of about $3 trillion of what we would have to pay today. Then he sent Louis and Clark to go look at what he had purchased to try to find a water route to the ocean out west. 
I read, as the Presiding Officer and many others may have, the wonderful book that was just published about Louis and Clark's journey. I discovered that when Thomas Jefferson gave them the charge to go explore that new territory, he gave Mr. Louis the opportunity to sign vouchers for whatever he needed for the trip. Mr. Louis went to St. Louis, MO, and he began signing vouchers. He was buying all kinds of things in St. Louis that he felt were necessary, because he didn't know what he was going to confront on that trip or how long it would take him. 
He hired a bunch of folks and signed vouchers for a lot of things. They said he bought 120 gallons of whiskey for the trip. I wonder if today the Citizens Against Government Waste would let somebody get by with that. Well, probably not. Not 120 gallons of whiskey. Apparently, the theory was he needed enough whiskey to get him up into and through Montana, because at that point it was too late to turn back. I don't know whether that was said tongue-in-cheek or not. 
In any event, the chronicles of the Louis and Clark expedition 
are quite wonderful. It is interesting to see our part of the country through their eyes 200 years ago because they stayed the winter in North Dakota. It was kind of chilly. They got hunkered down for the winter in North Dakota. They chronicled that in their book as well. 
Then, about 100 years passed, and toward the turn of this century we had something called the Homestead Act, which led people to move out to States like North Dakota and claim 160 acres of land and build a house and operate a farm and raise a family, and the land would be theirs under the Homestead Act. So my State was populated by these homesteaders about 100 years ago. It is about as difficult a life as one can imagine, trying to start a farm out in the prairies of North Dakota, facing the wind, and the uncertainty of the weather. Then there was the question of, if you plant some seeds in the ground, will you get a crop? Will you have grasshoppers? Will you have crop disease? Will a hailstorm come along? And then, if you get a crop will there be a price sufficient so you can sell the crop and make a living? 
Now, 100 years after the homesteaders, we discover fewer and fewer yard lights in rural North Dakota. More family farmers are going broke. Fewer family farmers can make a living. We continue to see the type of editorial I just described, `The Farm Economy Is at Risk,' which describes the net loss of so many family farms in North Dakota this year. 
Family farmers are the last of the free marketers in this country. They don't ask for much. They don't get much. And they risk virtually everything they have, based on the marketplace. Yet, one by one those tens of thousands of family farmers, as small producers, confront a marketplace of very large producers whose economic clout is enormous. If you are raising a beef cow when you go to the marketplace you confront the large beef packers, four of which control over 80 percent of the beef packing plants in this country. So you face an economic pressure that really is not particularly fair. The result is, generally speaking, lower prices than one would expect to exist in a free market. 
When you try to market your wheat, you confront other economic enterprises. You confront the big millers, you confront the grocery manufacturers, you confront the folks who are involved in the grain trade, all of whom are large economic enterprises. Yet a family farmer competes in the marketplace against these larger economic interests which want lower prices. They want lower prices for family farmers, which means family farmers lose and they win. 
The reason I describe all that is we come around now to this question about trade. The discussion in the Congress will be negotiating new trade agreements, because the President says, and a lot of both Republicans and Democrats say that the route to economic health is trade. That may be. The theory is the more you trade, the better off you are. If you read the doctrine of comparative advantage from the great economic thinkers going back to Adam Smith and Ricardo and others, the presumption was that every part of the world would do what it could do best and trade back and forth. This was the doctrine of comparative advantage. Of course, what they were talking about was trade from nation to nation, because there were no corporations at the advent of that kind of economic theory. But, notwithstanding that, the provision still exists, I suppose, in the minds of some, that the route to economic health is through trade. They believe that discussion should not be about what kind of trade. Instead, the question should be how much trade. 
Some of us are concerned about our situation with trade. It is not because we believe we should not have aggressive trade practices or that we should not find ways to market our goods overseas in foreign markets that might need those goods. It is not because we believe that American consumers should not be able to take advantage of goods produced elsewhere that they may want. Instead, we are concerned because we see a pattern of trade in this country that is not fair to this country and that in the long-term inevitably weakens and injures our production and manufacturing 
base in America. The manufacturing base is the center pole of a strong economy. If you weaken your manufacturing base, you weaken the sector that provides the good jobs that pay well and have good benefits. 
We have been led into thinking, I expect, by some, that a measure of economic health in America is not what you produce but what you consume. Think to yourself, what are the economic indices that are used every month to evaluate how healthy America is? It is what we consume every month. Were sales up or down? That's the basis by which we evaluate is America doing very well. Yet there is very little discussion about what we produce. 
I want to hold up a chart that describes the aggregate trade deficits in recent years. Even though we have been negotiating trade agreements and we have done a number of these trade agreements under the procedure called fast track, which I will describe in a moment, it is very hard to determine that we are moving in the right direction. This particular chart demonstrates that for 21 straight years we have run merchandise trade deficits in this country, and in most recent years we have had the largest deficits in America's history. Last year, the year before, the year before that, and, incidentally, this year, we will once again see the largest merchandise trade deficit in this country's history. It is very hard to take a look at all of this red ink and discern that somehow we are doing very, very well. 
I had written a piece about trade. Then there was an article in the Washington Post recently. The writer of this article described this trade agreement in ways so that apparently I and others could understand it, suggesting that we just don't understand this. He said that we don't understand that this is not a sign of economic trouble, but that this is a sign of economic health. He reported the bigger the deficits the better off you are. Let me read the description by the writer from the Washington Post:  
If someone offered to trade you $10,000 worth of apples for $5,000 worth of pears, you'd jump at the deal. In the same vein, we Americans can hardly be considered unfairly treated if we obtain more imports that foreigners have slaved to produce for our consumption in exchange for fewer exports that we have slaved to produce for theirs. 
Those of us from the middle of the country would have missed this entire economic theory had he not written this. In fact, I have an uncle, Uncle Harold, who would love to get involved in some of this pear and apple trade. If someone offered to pay you $10,000 worth of apples for $5,000 worth of pears would you jump at the deal? Yes, I suppose you would, unless you didn't need the apples and you didn't have the money to go in debt for the balance. That is the problem. This is always the thoughtlessness we get on trade debate. It is that somehow America is getting something for free. The fact is, America is inheriting the largest trade deficits in its history and no one seems to care very much. This writer says the economists make the point that this is very healthy, it is a wonderful thing. 
In fact, in this same article they were talking about why we have a trade deficit. There is kind of an incestuous relationship between all the sources. The same people go to the same sources for the same quotes. This uses these same sources. The source, an economist, says the reason we had a trade deficit is because America doesn't save enough. There is an interesting thought. Companies close their American plant and move it to Mexico because somebody in Detroit doesn't save enough or somebody in Russell, KS, doesn't save enough? I'm sorry, I studied economics and I taught economics and that's not a theory with which I find credible. Maybe it's another theory that those of us in the middle of the country don't understand. 
This same source that said our problem is that we don't save enough and that's why we have huge trade deficits said many months ago that we have a huge trade deficit because we have mounting budget deficits. He said that when the budget deficit goes down the trade deficit will go down. 
Well, guess what? The budget deficit has gone down 4 years in a row. What has happened to the trade deficit? The trade deficit has continued to increase to new record levels. So much for that theory. The same source says, and some others say, that we have a trade deficit because of our currency valuation. They say that we have a strong dollar and that causes the trade deficit. But, the dollar goes up and the dollar goes down, we still have the trade deficit, and the trade deficit continues to grow. So much for that theory. 
My point is, those who give us this malarkey about the trade deficit somehow don't understand that these deficits, the largest deficits in this country's history, mean that we are buying from abroad much more than we are selling overseas, and the result is an outflow of American jobs. 
That may not mean much to people who write in the newspapers. It probably doesn't mean very much to economists, and it probably doesn't mean much to politicians. Because I don't know of any journalist, politician, or economist who has ever lost a job because of a bad trade agreement. In fact, I want someone to come to the floor of the Senate and advise me, as we have this debate in the next couple of weeks. Give me one name. Tell me the name of one economist, one politician, or one journalist who has ever lost his or her job because their plant moved overseas. It didn't happen. That is why to them this is all theory, and when their theories are wrong, they just wake up with a new theory. It doesn't matter. 
Will Rogers used to say when there is no place left to spit, you either have to swallow the tobacco juice or change with the times. I say to all these economists who have delivered all this nonsense in recent years, there's no place left to spit on these issues. You have given us eight reasons for the trade deficit, and all of them have been disproved. All of them have been wrong, and maybe it is time for some new sources. Maybe it is time for some new discussion about what this deficit means to our country. 
Let me talk just for a moment about so-called free markets. The free-market system is a wonderful system. I am not suggesting that we get involved in managing the economy. We have a free-market system that works pretty well. Inside our country, it is interesting, the free-market system says, for example, that those farmers out there who get up and do chores at 6 in the morning and do evening chores at 6 in the evening, risk all their money and wonder what is going to happen, they can lose $23,000 a year. At the same time the three supporting characters on `Seinfeld,' a leading television program, can get $600,000 a week. That is $600,000 a week for each of the three supporting characters; $13 million a year in salaries. That is our market system. That is fine. 
If you are 7-foot tall and can dunk a basketball, and you are 21 years old and play for a certain team in the Midwest, you can get a $121 million contract for 6 years playing basketball. Pay somebody to play basketball or hire 1,000 teachers. It is the same price. One 7-foot basketball player or 1,000 teachers; one 7-foot basketball player, or a thousand family farmers making a profit. The market system determines what is what, and the market system is a wonderful system, but it produces some aberrations from time to time. 
One of the problems, as we describe a market system in the context of trade, is this: People say, `Well, what we need to have is a market system in which when we trade back and forth, it would be absolutely free and unfettered.' That leads to another question. If it is free and unfettered trade between us and Canada, us and Mexico, us and Japan, or us and China, why is it then that they can get their goods into this country so much easier than we can get our goods into their country? Why? 
Let me give some examples. Canada and wheat. We have a virtual flood of wheat coming into this country from Canada. We had kind of an agreement about how much would come in. Last year, Canada sent in 21,000 semi-truckloads of wheat above the agreed-upon level. What can we do about it? Nothing, because we 
don't have a trade remedy that works here. Canada sends it in through a State trading enterprise, which would be illegal in this country, and with secret prices, so no one knows at what price they are selling it in America. Nonetheless, we have a wheat trade problem with Canada. 
Is that free trade? No; I don't think so. I went to the border in an orange truck, a 12-year-old 2-ton truck, with a man named Earl Jenson. We took 200 bushels of Durum wheat from the United States to try to get it into Canada. Guess what happened to us at the border? They stopped us. They said you can't take wheat into Canada. All the way from the border, we had watched semi-truckloads filled with Canadian wheat that were coming south. 
Is it fair trade? I don't think so. Is it free trade? I don't think so. 
I can describe chapter and verse about the Mexico situation, but let me talk about both Canada and Mexico. We had the last free-trade agreement considered under what is called fast-track procedures. First, the agreement is reached through negotiations that are not public but private negotiations. Then after they come from behind closed doors and say, `We reached an agreement,' it comes to Congress, and Congress, because of fast-track procedures, is prevented from offering an amendment. The last one was called NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement. 
Just prior to the NAFTA trade agreement, our country had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. Now some years later, the trade deficit has doubled. We now have a $23 billion trade deficit with Canada. Just prior to the North American Free-Trade Agreement, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Now we have a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Yet, we have people crowing on the floor of Congress, the House and the Senate, that these have been wonderful agreements. What kind of adding machines do they have? What kind of logic are they using to suggest that when you find yourself in a deep hole that things are going just great? The NAFTA agreement has been a disastrous agreement. 
In fact, the Economic Policy Institute just did a study that said we have lost 395,000 jobs in this country as a result of the NAFTA agreement. Those who claim, incidentally, there have been new jobs created in this country take a look at only one side of the ledger, and that is the amount of exports we send out. They do not consider the amount of imports that are sent in to displace what had previously been produced here. 
For example, they would take a look at Canada and Mexico and say, `Well, gee, we sent a little more to Canada, to Mexico, things are doing just great.' The problem is, we have had much, much more coming in from each of those countries, and we have gone from a positive trade balance with Mexico to a substantial negative trade balance. We have doubled our trade deficit with Canada. Who on Earth can conclude that is a trade policy on the right path? 
Let's take China just for a moment. China's trade deficit has ratcheted up, up, up and way up, and now our trade deficit with China is $40 billion a year and moving up toward $50 billion a year. They say, `Well, we're supposed to have free trade with all these folks.' There is no free trade with China. We can't get much American pork into China. When China wants wheat, it shops elsewhere for wheat. It buys some from us. With the $40 billion to $50 billion trade surplus it has with us, it ought to be buying wheat from us. 
When China needs airplanes and wants to buy airplanes, guess what it says? `We will buy American airplanes only if they are manufactured in China.' It is another way of saying, `We want to trade with you, but we want American jobs to move to China.' That is not fair trade. 
Japan this year will have a trade deficit increased by 20 percent above last year. This year it is projected to reach $65 billion in trade deficits that we will have with Japan. Year after year, every year, the trade deficit with Japan goes on ranging and from around $50 billion to over $60 billion. 
Is our trade relationship with Japan a mutually productive 
relationship? We could talk chapter and verse forever today about the amount of American goods we cannot get into Japan because their markets are not open to us. 
The administration says it wants fast-track authority because it wants to open foreign markets. I want to prevent fast-track authority because I am sick of having trade negotiators negotiate bad agreements on the front end and then fail to enforce them on the back end. I say, `You go out and negotiate, go right ahead, come back and let's see what you have done. If you think these are fair agreements, you will get them passed through the Congress. If not, you are going to get a resounding no.' They say, `We can't negotiate under those circumstances.' 
It is interesting to me, there have only been five trade agreements reached under fast-track trade authority granted by the Congress ever in history. We haven't granted fast-track authority for complicated nuclear arms agreements or test ban treaties. We haven't granted fast-track authority for any of those. Only a handful of trade agreements have had fast-track trade authority, and I ask my colleagues to evaluate what has been the result of those trade agreements. 
Mr. President, I am going to propose a number of things when we talk about fast track. I think that we ought to establish some principles that evaluate what is right for this country. I said when I started that I think we ought to have expanded trade. The more trade the better, as far as I am concerned, but I demand that the trade that we have as a country be fair trade with other countries. We ought not continue to swallow huge deficits year after year only to find the countries that move their goods into our marketplace with impunity decide their marketplace is closed to us. That is not free trade, and that is not fair trade. 
When we discuss fast track, what I am going to propose is a number of principles that represent the basis of our trade policy: 
No. 1: A principle ought to be to end chronic, escalating trade deficits. Is that a goal of this country? If it is, we sure are not doing well. I just showed you that the trade deficits have increased every year. We ought to decide as a country that we ought to end the escalating trade deficits by increasing U.S. net exports. 
No. 2: A trade agreement ought to result in real growth in the U.S. economy, provide more and better jobs and improve living standards. Incidentally, there is no such principle that guides today's trade negotiating. 
No. 3: We ought to provide mandatory performance standards for trade agreements together with enforcement to ensure full reciprocity. It seems to me that when you go from a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico to a $15 billion trade deficit, someplace there ought to be some snapback provision that allows Congress to look at that and say, `Oops, that's not what we meant; that's not headed in the right direction.' 
No. 4: No trade agreement ever ought to be negotiated that doesn't include adjustment mechanisms to prevent currency exchange rate fluctuations from distorting the trade flows. You can't have trade agreements and then have someone devalue their currency which wipes out every single gain, plus 50 percent more, in the trade agreement on lowering tariffs. That doesn't make sense. Everybody understands you must include these. These are the principles, I think, that we must consider when we evaluate whether we want to provide fast-track trade authority for new negotiations dealing with international trade. 
I look forward to the debate we are going to have, because this country, I think, needs a new blueprint for trade negotiations. The old trade blueprints are tired, worn and not working. It is no longer good enough to have trade policies that allow those corporations who decide that they will personally profit by finding a place in the world to produce at very low cost and then ship the production to Pittsburgh or Los Angeles or Fargo or Topeka just because that is good for their profits. It is no longer acceptable to me that this ought to be a model for trade. 
If a company which is now an international concern says, look, `My model for the future is I want to produce in Bangladesh, I want to produce in Indonesia, I want to produce in Sri Lanka, and I want to ship the product to America,' you say to them, `Why do you want to produce there? 
`I want to produce there because we can hire people for pennies an hour, a dime, 12 cents, 14 cents, a quarter, or 50 cents an hour. We don't have the problem with pollution. We can pollute the air and the water. We can hire kids. We won't have OSHA looking over our shoulder because we don't have safe workplace standards, and we can just pole vault over all those things we have negotiated and fought about for 50 to 75 years in this country. We can pole vault over all of those problems as a producer and go overseas, close the U.S. manufacturing plant, hire foreign workers, have no problems on pollution, child labor and wage standards and then produce the same garage-door opener or produce the same toothbrush or produce the same vacuum cleaner and ship it to America.' 
That might be good for these corporations, but it is not good for America because inevitably that means diminishing America's manufacturing base. It means moving American jobs overseas and it means injuring this country's long-term economic strength. 
That is what this debate has to be about: What is in America's economic interests; what is in our country's long-term economic interest; and, what will best represent the opportunity to create new jobs and advance our country's economic interests? That is what this debate must be about. 
I hope in the coming couple of weeks, on behalf of farmers and wage earners, and, yes, American businesses, we can decide we have a trade strategy that doesn't now work, that causes substantial trade deficits, and substantial amounts of American jobs leaving and moving overseas. I hope we can decide that there is a better way and a different way. My purpose is not to promote some kind of xenophobic, isolationist, protectionist strategy. It is not to put walls around our country, but to decide that the trade between us and our trading partners must be mutually productive. We must have trade between us and Japan be balanced trade. If they get their goods into our marketplace, then we have a right to demand we get our goods into theirs. The trade between us and China should be mutually beneficial; that if we have something they want, they have a responsibility to buy it from us, and not demand that we manufacture it on Chinese soil at a time when they have a $50 to $60 billion trade surplus with us or we a deficit with them. 
It seems to me now is the time for us to demand that. 
One of the reasons that I am pleased that we are finally going to have a debate about trade is that we have not been able to have any discussion about it. This turns instantly to a thoughtless discussion--instantly--the minute you start turning to the issue of trade. 
Finally, maybe in discussing fast track this will become a thoughtful discussion about what is in this country's best interests. Yes, expanded trade, but, yes, especially better trade agreements that are better for this country and trade agreements that are enforced with tough, no-nonsense standards, saying we represent the economic interests of our country--not other countries but our country. 
The current trade strategy, resulting in huge recurring trade deficits, hurts rather than helps our country. Those are trade deficits we can solve by requiring that we be able to sell more goods around the world and by requiring that trade agreements be fair and enforced. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. If I might, claiming the time remaining on our side, just make a comment about the pending business. 
We will shortly be casting another vote on cloture on the issue of campaign finance reform. The vote is going to be whether we invoke cloture on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. 
Now, it is interesting, as we have been watching this develop over the recent days, we have seen a form of legislative cholesterol clogging and plugging the system so that at the end some can say, `Well, we have considered campaign finance reform but they have, in effect, killed it.' That has been the plan all along. 
I mentioned yesterday that the great illusionists in America are those who can convince people they have seen something that doesn't exist. We had that yesterday in which there was an assertion that we were presented with a debate on campaign finance reform, but the debate didn't really exist because no one was able to offer any amendments on campaign finance reform. The bill was brought to the floor by someone who wanted to kill it, so he bound it up with a tight rope--what he called filling the tree with amendments, a tree of amendments--so that no one else could offer any amendments, and then filed a cloture motion designed to kill campaign finance reform. 
The fact is this system doesn't work. The campaign finance system in this country is broken. There is too much money in campaigns. I have showed the chart out here on a number of occasions when I have spoken about it. The red line on the chart on campaign spending goes straight up. And yet we have people in this Chamber and across the Capitol who believe the problem is we don't have enough money in politics, there is not enough money in campaigns. What on Earth are they thinking about? We need to reduce the amount of money in campaigns. 
One of the issues that is involved in this legislation is soft money. We ought to abolish soft money, the legal form of cheating from the old campaign finance reform. For every rule there are people who try to figure out how to get around it, over it or under it. In soft money, the growth in the explosion of so-called soft money is the growth and explosion of legal cheating in campaign finance, and we ought to change it. 
There are only two sides to this issue: Those who want to reform the system, and those who are insisting the current system is just fine. 
There are a majority of us in this Chamber, we believe, who will vote for McCain-Feingold, for campaign finance reform, if only we can get it up on the floor of the Senate for a vote. I hope today, or perhaps tomorrow if further votes on cloture occur, that we will have an opportunity to demonstrate that, if we can get the bill to the floor of the Senate, it will have a majority vote. 
On my side of the aisle, 45 Members, every single Member, has signed a letter saying we support this kind of campaign finance reform. We had three, four, five Members on the other side of the aisle who have supported it. If we can get it up for a vote, we will pass campaign finance reform. But there are those who have tried to ride this into a box canyon somewhere from which there is no escape because they by design want to kill campaign finance reform because they believe there is not enough money in politics. They want more money in American politics. I have no idea where they get that sort of notion. 
The American people know better. The American people support with an 80-percent margin the need to pass campaign finance reform by this Congress. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. Vote for cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill and breathe some life into campaign finance reform and let's do what the American people know we should and what the American people know we must--reform the system by which we finance American campaigns, because the current system is broken. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator from South Dakota yielding. I would like to ask just a couple brief questions. 
The majority leader has consistently this afternoon indicated there has been a rather full and extensive debate on campaign finance reform. Isn't it the case that exactly the opposite is true? The master illusionists in America are those who are able to convince people that they have seen things that do not exist. 
Isn't that what we have here? We have had a debate on campaign finance reform, we are told. Isn't it the case, I ask the Senator from South Dakota, that the campaign finance reform bill was brought to the Senate in a very complicated set of almost Byzantine procedures that are called filling the tree so that no one else had an opportunity to do anything to amend this bill, and that under the procedure that existed the bill was debated, but no one, save the majority leader, was able to offer one single amendment? 
Isn't it the case that we had what is called an illusion? I think this is an illusion to convince people to see things that do not exist. 
I think people will see what happened here, a procedure that ties up the Senate, allows no one to offer any amendments, and then a claim, trying to pull the bill from the floor, that we have had a debate on campaign finance reform. Is that an accurate description of what has happened in recent days?

Mr. DORGAN. If I might just ask two brief additional questions. 
Isn't it the case that on the cloture vote on the underlying bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, 53 Members of the Senate voted for cloture, which suggests that 53 Members of the Senate support this bill? So we have a campaign finance reform bill that has the support of the majority of the Senate and a procedure designed to prevent the Senate from having a vote on it. Is that not the case that we now face?

Mr. DORGAN. I know the Senator has another engagement, but let me ask one final question. Isn't it the case now that the pending business in this Chamber was campaign finance reform and the majority leader is asking by motion to go to D.C. appropriations and that those who decide to vote to do that are voting to pull campaign finance reform? If that is the case--and I guess it is procedurally--I think we ought to have a debate about that. I think we ought to have a vote on it, we ought to find out who in the Senate decides to vote to pull campaign finance reform from the floor of the Senate before we have had the first amendment offered to that bill. 
Why haven't we had an amendment offered? Because this bill was tied up tight, brought to the floor with the design and a boast by some that they are going to kill it and be proud they killed it, and they are going to put this in a position where someone else filibusters and gets the blame for killing it. 
This is clearly an illusion. And isn't it the case that the vote we are going to be asked to take--and I hope it is a record vote; you have already asked for the yeas and nays--will be a vote on whether we believe we should pull campaign finance reform from the floor of the Senate? I am going to vote no, but isn't that in fact the vote we are going to have?

Mr. DORGAN. No one is suggesting, certainly not me, that the Senator has not followed the rules. The Senator has used the rules exactly as he desired to use the rules to bring this bill up, fill the tree, prevent it from having amendments, have a cloture vote, and kill the bill. This Senator understands that. I have been curious about why the majority leader would not allow a motion to table. We understand that there was not an interest in allowing a motion to table the Lott amendment to be offered this morning. 
In fact, the Senator in a rather unusual move last evening put us in morning business all morning. Our expectation was we would be able to have a motion to table. I wonder if the Senator would tell us why that was inappropriate or whether he would allow us the opportunity to offer a motion to table the Lott amendment at some point.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from South Dakota. I rise to support his comments. 
Mr. President, there is a wonderful cemetery in a little town called Medora, ND, on the edge of the Bad Lands in western North Dakota. The cemetery has very unusual tombstones in it because they did not always know the names of the people who died when they tried a century later to identify the remains in the cemetery. So they took an oral history of the old folks living around there and did the best they could. 
So if you visit that little cemetery, you will see tombstones that say, on one `Baby From The Hotel.' They did not know who it was. They just knew it was a baby that died in the hotel. On the other, `Man The Bank Fell On.' Still another tombstone, `Cowboy With 2 Acres.' Still another, they knew the man's name was Pete and it said, `Pete, He Died In A Disagreement.' 
It is an interesting cemetery to visit because by these tombstones you can tell, without knowing the names, who is buried there. 
I was thinking about that cemetery today because we have today a group of people who are fixing to try to kill and then bury campaign finance reform. They have been out here for days. Today is their day because today we have some votes. They want to kill it, and they want to bury it. 
The problem for them is no matter what happens today, they are not able to create a tombstone that says, rest in peace for campaign finance reform, because it is not going to rest in peace. Those who believe there is not enough money in politics and we ought to have more, those who believe that we ought to kill campaign finance reform and they are the ones to do it, they want to have a little rest in peace tombstone and run to the back rooms and collect their political inheritance, the tens of millions of dollars that keep flowing into all of these coffers and hard money and soft money for this organization and that organization. 
It is not going to work quite that way. If they kill campaign finance reform today, it will have been a charade. We were told that we would consider campaign finance reform on the floor of the Senate. How did it come to the floor of the Senate? It came to the floor of the Senate tied in ropes with a procedure designed to prevent anyone from offering any amendments or having any votes except those structured by the majority leader. And those structured by the majority leader are intended to accomplish the following: 
According to one who spent a great deal of time on the floor here, `We're going to kill it, and kill it proudly.' Campaign finance reform, that is their goal, `kill it, and kill it proudly.' 
`I set it up so they will be filibustering me,' proudly crows another. 
Conservative columnist Mr. Novak wrote a column and said it as it was,  
The party's preference is * * * no reform at all: Remove all limits on campaign contributions but disclose them daily on the Internet. Because that won't become law, the GOP leaders favor a Senate standoff in which no proposal gets 60 votes needed to end a filibuster. 
I did not say that. A Republican columnist wrote that. That is the strategy. 
Part of it is: `[Speaker] Calls For More, Not Less, Campaign 
Cash.' It is because of a profound difference of opinion. Despite the facts, despite this red line on campaign spending that goes up and up and up, spending that is out of control in politics in this country, despite that, we have people who believe the problem is there is not enough cash in politics. They are dead wrong. They could not be more wrong. 
The American people know and the American people understand that we need to pass some sort of meaningful campaign spending reform. I happen to believe we ought to try to find a way to put limits on campaign spending. 
Individual races, the Supreme Court said by a 5 to 4 decision you cannot support those. I would like the Supreme Court to have another opportunity to rethink that, but in any event there are other ways to do it to provide incentives for spending limits on each campaign. In fact, the bill before us is watered down. They took that portion of the bill out before it was brought to the floor. So what they are trying to kill is even just a skeleton of what we ought to be doing. 
If we get to vote on amendments, those of us who believe there ought to be spending limits will bring that to the floor and ask for a vote on that as well. But that is not in the bill at the moment. 
The strategy is a legislative strategy to bring it up, have no votes, offer a poison pill, fill the legislative tree so everyone is bound up and no one can do anything, then file cloture, have a vote on cloture, and pull the bill and claim to all of America you really allowed consideration of campaign finance reform. 
That is not consideration. That is a sham. That is not about honest consideration of campaign finance reform. An honest consideration of it would be to bring the bill to the floor and let people file amendments and have a debate and have votes and determine what is the will of the Senate. 
The goal of those who want to kill this today is to do nothing because they like the current system. They will feel, I assume, like hogs in a corn crib when this is all done, just rejoicing at their bounty because they will have killed campaign finance reform, and the hundreds of millions of dollars that continue to float around to all these campaigns will magnify and multiply manyfold. 
We have had 6,700 pages of hearings on campaign finance reform, 3,361 floor speeches--make that 3,362 now today and 3,363 with the next Speaker--113 votes over the years, 522 witnesses. And some say, Well, gee, we need more time to consider this. We don't need more time to consider this. Campaigns are not auctions. They are elections. Money isn't speech. If money is speech in American politics, then there is something wrong with the political system. 
If we cannot begin with the germ of an idea that there is too much money in politics, that this red line signifies something that is unhealthy about American politics and that soft money is the legal form of cheating from the old type of campaign finance reform, and if you cannot deal with the form of cheating that erupts from the old campaign finance reform because you don't want to do anything, then somehow we have failed as an institution. 
So my point today is very simple. In 1996, the Democrats, through their organization, spent $332 million. That was up 73 percent over 4 years previous. The Republicans spent $548 million. That was up 74 percent over 4 years previous. 
The fact is, the evidence is all around us that the cost of these campaigns is mushrooming and escalating, and it is unhealthy. The question is, what do we do about it? 
Today, we are going to answer the question who is for reform and who isn't, who wants to do something about this and who doesn't, who cares about this issue and who doesn't care. 
I know some are going to be tempted today to follow the strategy employed by the majority leader: Construct a tent and create an illusion and have several cloture votes through which or behind which some Members can hide with their votes so you never ever get to the central question of, Do you stand for campaign 
finance reform or don't you? 
I just say to those who have conceived of this strategy that this campaign finance reform, if you think you have killed it today, it is going to be resurrected tomorrow. This is not going to rest in peace. You are going to vote on this and vote on this and vote on this until you understand this is a serious issue and the American people insist that this Congress do something about campaign finance reform. 
I am proud, as I believe the Senator from South Dakota, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, is proud and my colleagues are proud of standing for reform and deciding that we support the kind of changes that are necessary to bring some health to the campaign finance system in this country and to do something about the abuses, the outrageous amounts of money in campaign finance. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a cosponsor of the Comprehensive Coal Act Reform Act of 1997, a bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Cochran and Conrad just prior to the August recess. This bill seeks to alleviate inequities and unforeseeable hardships caused by the reachback tax provisions of the Coal Industry Health Benefit Act of 1992 [the Coal Act], while safeguarding the Combined Fund established under the Coal Act to ensure that retired mine workers get the health benefits they deserve. 
As part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress passed a proposal to help protect health benefits of retired mine workers by allowing the trustees of the newly created Combined Fund to reach back and require former employers of retired coal miners to pay substantial assessments to the fund in order to finance such benefits. While its goals are laudable, this sweeping proposal contains some serious shortcomings. For one thing, it unfairly imposes excessive assessments on some companies, while under-assessing others. 
Senators Cochran and Conrad have worked for some time to develop a compromise bill that addresses some of the shortcomings in the Coal Act. This effort led to the introduction of the Comprehensive Coal Act Reform Act of 1997, S. 1105, which I think makes a number of needed changes. I applaud efforts of these Senators to find a workable and fair solution to the reachback problem. And I've added my name as a cosponsor of S. 1105 because I support the primary thrust and goals of this bill. 
I do not know if the formula adopted in S. 1105 perfectly resolves the problems created by the Coal Act. Some companies will probably continue to argue that they are paying too much and that others are paying too little into the Combined Fund. Retired mine workers will undoubtedly be concerned by any bill modifying the Coal Act until it's shown that the proposal causes no harm to them. 
Finally, let me be very clear about one point. My cosponsorship of this bill should not be construed by anyone as a weakening of my support for retired mine workers and their families. They worked tirelessly in their jobs--often at substantial risk to their personal health and safety--to help meet the energy needs of this country. They are entitled to retirement benefits earned for their dedicated years of service. Any corrective action we take in Congress must ultimately be consistent with this obligation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when Police Chief John Whetsel pulled up to the scene of a fiery car wreck, he never expected to recognize the charred remains of a familiar vehicle. After receiving word that a highway patrol cruiser's 100-miles-per-hour pursuit of a fleeing motorcycle had led to a terrible accident involving several bystanders, Chief Whetsel hurried to the scene. 
Upon his arrival, Chief Whetsel quickly recognized his family's smoldering automobile and let out a long cry of anguish as he discovered that his wife and two daughters were the victims of this terrible accident. Unfortunately, 1995 statistics show that 40 percent of all high-speed pursuits end in accidents, causing needless death and injury to our Nation's families. 
I certainly understand the pain that Chief Whetsel endured. My mother was killed in a high-speed police chase on her drive from a local Bismarck, ND hospital. Eyewitnesses say that the speed of this chase was 80 to 100 miles an hour through the city streets. She died as the drunk lawbreaker fishtailed his pickup truck racing away from pursuing officers. She was a wonderful woman, and it was a senseless and painful loss of life. 
There are countless other tragic examples. In fact, there is an entire organization, called STOPP, dedicated to raising the awareness of the dangers of high speed police pursuits. The members of their board have very strong convictions on this issue, for each of them also lost a family member or a friend who was an innocent victim of a high speed chase. 
Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the National Police Pursuit Policy Act of 1997. It is my hope that this legislation, if enacted, would help prevent tragic losses like the episode that occurred to Chief Whetsel, my family, and so many others. High speed chases are dangerous and occur too frequently, and the human losses resulting from high-speed police pursuits in the last several years continue to mount. While we are finally seeing some initiative being taken by various States and local communities to address this problem, these efforts must extend to all State and local jurisdictions in this country to attack the problem. 
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there were 377 deaths nationwide in 1996, and 27 percent of these deaths were police officers or innocent bystanders that died as a result of high-speed chases. Many chases begin as motorists--whether out of fright, panic, or guilt--flee at high speeds instead of pulling over when a police vehicle turns on its lights and siren. Unfortunately, some police become determined to apprehend the fleeing motorists at all costs, and an alarming 60 percent of all police pursuits originate from minor traffic violations. The result is that the safety of the general public--and the dangers that are created by high-speed chases in city traffic--become secondary to catching someone whose initial offense may have been no greater than driving a car with a broken tail-light. 
Increased training and education are essential in addressing this problem. Every single law enforcement jurisdiction in the United States must adopt a reasoned, and well-balanced pursuit policy. With 73 percent of all police officers reporting that they have been involved in a high-speed pursuit in the last 12 months, these officers need specialized training in this area. Currently, new studies show that on average only 14 hours of driver training is provided to new law enforcement recruits, with the majority of this time used for the mechanics of driving rather than practicing safe and effective high-speed pursuit procedures. In addition, statistics show that there is a decrease in high-speed pursuits when law enforcement officers are properly trained in this area. 
Specific training on departmental pursuit policies and regular followup training is necessary to guarantee that all citizens, both civilians and police, receive the benefit of uniform awareness of this problem. There must be a national realization that there are circumstances in which police should not conduct a chase, and our officers should be commended for making these important, lifesaving choices. A drive across country should not be a `pot luck' regarding one's chances of being maimed or killed by a police pursuit. 
I want to stress that the police are not the villains here. It is the folks that run from the police who are the villains. We must focus on the fleeing lawbreakers who are initiating these chases. The punishment for fleeing the police should be certain and severe. People should be aware that if they flee they will pay a big price for doing so. 
The legislation that I am introducing today would require the enactment of State laws making it unlawful for the driver of a motor vehicle to take evasive action if pursued by police and would establish a standard minimum penalty of 3 months imprisonment and the seizure of the driver's vehicle. In addition, my bill would require each law enforcement agency to establish a hot-pursuit policy and provide that all officers receive adequate training in accordance with that policy. 
Mr. President, this public safety problem is not an easy issue to solve. I understand that it will always be difficult for police officers to judge when a chase is getting out of hand and when public safety would be served best by holding back. However, it can improve the situation if we ensure that police officers are trained on how best to make these difficult judgments, and if we send a message to motorists that if you flee, you will do time in jail and lose your car.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I must say that it is interesting when we involve ourselves in aggressive and controversial debates that we find from time to time we disagree with colleagues for whom we have the greatest respect. That is 
certainly the case with me for the Senator from Utah. He is one of the best Members of the U.S. Senate, and I have been privileged to work with him on a lot of things. And, yet, I profoundly disagree with him on this issue. I want to spend a bit of time explaining why that is the case. 
In September 1796, George Washington announced that he was retiring after some 45 years of service. I want to read just a paragraph from his Farewell Address, which is read each year here in this Chamber. 
George Washington wrote:  
This government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. 
George Washington was right about that. I wonder today, as perhaps others have before me, why has the confidence and support of the American people in this institution receded? What is causing that? 
I happen to enjoy public policy. I rather like politics. I feel that it is an enormous privilege to serve here in the U.S. Senate. And, yet, I think the political system is a system that has become distorted in a caricature of itself. The question is, what can we do about that? What should we do about that? In answering that, we should probably answer, what is the problem? Answer the question, what is the problem? And then define, what is the solution? 
I have listened for the last hour and a half with great interest to my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, who I am sure will be back on the floor momentarily. He made references when the Senator from Arizona was speaking that no one can nor should be prevented from involving themselves in issue advocacy, et cetera. No one that I am aware of on the floor of the Senate has ever proposed such a position. No one that I am aware of is suggesting that anyone under any circumstances in this country can be prevented from speaking, or prevented from paying for a political message. No one has made that proposition. 
So, to the extent that it is being represented that is so, let us say, yes, that is the case. And let's move on to what we are debating, and not create a new debate. 
When the Lincoln and Douglas debates were well underway, at one point, I am told, President Lincoln was so frustrated because he couldn't get Mr. Douglas to understand his point. And finally he said to him in great frustration, `Well, then tell me. How many legs does a horse have?' 
Douglas said, `Why, four, of course.' 
Lincoln said, `Well, now if you were to call a horse's tail a leg, how many legs would the horse have?' 
Douglas said, `Why, five.' 
Lincoln said, `See, that is where you are wrong. Simply calling it a leg doesn't make it a leg at all.' 
That is the point in this debate. One can take positions. But if they are not on point and totally relevant to what is being discussed, what is the value of the position? 
I want to describe that just a bit in terms of what I mean by that. 
The Senator from Wisconsin read an advertisement. I want to read it again because I think it is at the heart of this discussion, and it is at the heart of the mess that we find 
ourselves in in campaign finance reform. This was an ad in a Senate race down South. I will just add as an aside that both political parties did this. Independent groups did it. But here is an ad. 
Senate candidate Winston Bryant's budget as attorney general increased 71 percent. Bryant has taken taxpayer-funded junkets to the Virgin Islands, Alaska and Arizona, and spent $100,000 on new furniture. Unfortunately, as the State's top law enforcement official, he has never opposed the parole of any convicted criminal, even rapists and murderers; and almost 4,000 Arkansas prisoners have been sent back to prison for crimes committed while they were out on parole. `Winston Bryant: government waste, political junkets, soft on crime. Call Winston Bryant and tell him to give the money back.' 
Should there be some position that says they don't have any right to say this? No. Whoever did this has every right to put this on television, and did. Do they have a right to put this on TV with soft money so that those who contributed are never disclosed? Do they have a right to say this is not part of the political process; this is not part of the campaign; it is totally unrelated; this is an issue advocacy commercial? Does that pass anybody's laugh test? Not in a million years. 
That is why one Senator, when asked repeatedly by the Senator from Arizona, `Do you really think these are independent; do you really believe these are independent expenditures?'--referencing a series of these kinds of things. It was never answered. I suspect the answer would be no. 
We all understand what is going on. The same people are involved. They hire common television producers to produce the commercials, and the same fundraising networks. But it has become a legal form of cheating. It has taken the old tax reform law and manipulated it and distorted it to the point that is no longer recognizable, and becomes what I think is a legal form of cheating. And I say that we ought to stop this. Stop it by saying You can't say it? No. You can say that. But if you want to get involved in this particular Senate campaign, then you must abide by the rules. You say it by hard dollars and disclose who donated the hard dollars. 
That is the point. It is not that they can't say it. It is that they are required to use the same hard dollars that the people involved in the race are using, and getting it from the same sources and disclosing who made the contribution.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the contribution because the contribution made by the Senator from Utah is that this sort of thing is improper, and that it is chicanery. 
If that is the case--if in fact what I just described is improper and chicanery--then the question isn't whether there is a problem. The question is, What do we do about the problem? 
And there are some people, as the Senator from Utah especially knows, in this Chamber who would say, What problem? There is no problem. The only problem we have, they say, is there is not enough money in politics. 
I want to show my colleagues what is happening with campaign finance. 
This line, the red line, describes what is happening with funding for political campaigns in this country. 
I assume we can find people who will come to the floor and will wave their arms, and say on this floor and on the floor on the other side of this building, Well, the American people spend x hundreds of millions of dollars on Rolaids, they spend x hundreds of millions of dollars on Preparation H, and Oh Henry candy bars and, therefore--what? Therefore, what? It is totally irrelevant. 
The point is what is happening to campaign financing is it is mushrooming and escalating out of control. Is there a problem? Or is it just fine? 
In the paper today there is a statement by one of the leaders of the other body saying there is not enough money in politics; we need more money in politics. In fact, those who debate this issue saying there is too much money in politics are wrong. We need more money in politics, they say. 
I could not disagree more. You see what is happening. There is too much money in politics. Too much money. In State after State after State, all of these campaigns are mushrooming out of control, and it is not just the campaigns; it is the independent expenditures and all the groups weighing in with chicanery and with improper, in my judgment, spending, packaging up things saying, by the way, this is independent, this is express advocacy, this is issue advertising. And all of us know that you cannot say that any longer with a straight face. It is all connected. It is all part of the same campaign. It becomes legal cheating. If we do not have the courage to stand up when we see this proliferation of legal cheating going on and saying, if that's the way the law is going to be interpreted and if, after pulling the teeth of the FEC, we complain they can't chew, if we are left in that position, then let us at least change the campaign finance law to know what we should do in this country and take at least some of the influence of money out of campaigns. 
Now, there is a proposal that is being debated in the Senate called the McCain-Feingold proposal. I don't think it is perfect. If I had written it, I would have written it differently. I cosponsored it, but I would have written it differently. But it is a proposal that deals with a whole range of things, and it needs to deal with some more. I hope that we will add to it an amendment to restore a portion that was not included when it was brought to the floor of the Senate but which was included when it was written. That provision is spending limits. 
Now, I want to deal just a bit with this question of spending limits and free speech. I noticed this weekend some of the columnists talked about the speech patrol and the infringement of free speech, and so on. 
Spending limits, which is not now in this bill, which I think should be--and I hope there will be an amendment we can vote on to restore spending limits--is an attempt to say let's establish a set of rules by which campaigns are waged and let's try to see if we can, if not establish enforceable spending limits, at least establish voluntary spending limits with sufficient incentive that most campaigns would abide by voluntary limits. The limit might be $1.5 million in one State, $3 million in another, less than that in a third State, in which both candidates agree here is a practical limit on spending. 
As I said, there are lots of ways to do that. The Supreme Court has already ruled by a one-vote margin that enforceable spending limits is not appropriate; it is unconstitutional. I think the Supreme Court ought to be asked to rule again on another case because, if it is that close, I think you can make the case they might rule differently in other circumstances. Notwithstanding that, I think we ought to try to work to achieve some approach by which we are able to get spending limits in campaigns. 
The problem is campaigns cost too much. That's why money has such a corrosive influence in politics. Campaigns cost too much. How do you get to the solution of that? Well, you try to establish some spending limits, some spending limits that are practical, that you can make stick. 
John F. Kennedy used to say that every mother kind of hoped her child might grow up to be President as long as they didn't have to be active in politics. I suppose he was musing about how unpopular the process of politics is. I am not someone who believes that politics is something that is underhanded or dirty. I think politics is noble and honorable. I am involved in it because I enjoy the political process. But I do not enjoy what is going on with respect to campaign finance. I think this system is broken. No one in this Chamber can look at this system and with a straight face say, yes, this system sure does serve America well. 
This system does not serve this country well. This system is a disservice to the country. Now, do we fix it by suggesting, as one Senator today has implied, that we prevent this group or that group from being able to speak in the political system? No. No one has ever recommended that--no one. So if you want to have that debate, have that debate alone. You can always win a debate that no one else is involved with. I say good for you; you just won a debate that I was advocating. 
We are not suggesting, none of us, that we would infringe on the right of any group to say anything at any time. I am saying, however, that when you take a look at advertisements like the one I described and read in the Chamber, as did Senator Feingold, and understand that this is a pole vault over the legal definition and becomes on its face a farce and an attempt to undermine the process, if we are not willing to decide to correct this, then there is no hope for us to deal with the issue of campaign financing. 
We have a bill in the Chamber that is called a reform bill. It is cosponsored by Senator McCain from Arizona and Senator Feingold from Wisconsin. Both of them are Senators for whom I have a great deal of respect. I do not agree with them on everything either, but they brought a reform to the floor of the Senate. It is interesting; at least for a half-hour or so today I heard a description of this bill that doesn't match the bill. The description was that somehow Senator McCain and Senator Feingold want to prohibit criticism of the Congress. So I felt, well, maybe I may have missed something here. Maybe they have introduced a bill that I hadn't read previously. 
But then I realized that is simply taking the debate and moving it over here to create an issue that does not exist because one is uncomfortable debating the issue of McCain-Feingold. 
No one is suggesting there would be any manner that one could devise in McCain-Feingoldo prohibit criticism of the U.S. Congress. Lord, read a couple hundred years of history and discover about a Congress that's been criticized. No one is suggesting that you could not do anything that constitutionally prohibits criticism of the Congress. We have generous criticism of the Congress, always will. The issue that Senator McCain and Senator Feingold address is not criticism of the Congress. It is the corrosive influence of money in campaigns. And ads like this sponsored and run by organizations whose funding is secret, undisclosed to anyone in this country, collected in soft money increments perhaps of $20,000, $50,000, maybe $100,000, could be $1 million. We have seen 1 million chunks of money go in soft money, undisclosed secret money, through organizations used as express advertising or express advocacy rather than declare they are not part of the campaign. What a bunch of rubbish. It does not pass any laugh test in any cafe in this country, and that is why we must be serious about trying to find a way to thoughtfully reform this system. 
I would like to just mention two additional items before I close. One of the concerns I have about our political system is so much of the advertising is negative. There is nothing you can do about that; I understand that. We cannot prohibit this kind of advertisement. We can say, if you are going to put this kind of advertisement on the air, you have to play by the rules and get hard money and disclose the donors. 
There is nothing wrong with that. But we cannot prohibit any advertisement. So much of it now is negative and so much of it is a 30-second little political explosion that goes on across our country where candidates are not even hardly named, at least with respect to the person's campaign, in financing the 30-second ad. It is a nameless, faceless, little bomb directed to destroy, tar or feather some other candidate. 
One of the small amendments that I intend to offer is the following. We now require in Federal law that television stations provide the lowest cost for television commercials during certain 
periods of the year. In other words, the lowest part of their rate card must be offered to campaigns for those political commercials. I am going to propose that the lowest cost on their rate card be provided candidates whose commercials are at least 1 minute in length and on which the candidate appears 75 percent of the time. I am not suggesting you cannot continue the 30-second slash-and-tear ads. Everybody can do that. Why should we reward those advertisements with the bottom of the rate card? Why don't we as a matter of law say we will provide and require the lowest rate be offered to those commercials that are at least 1 minute in length and on which at least 75 percent of the time the candidate appears in the commercial. 
Well, we will have a debate about that. I suppose some will say, well, that is interference. We interfere already by saying you must charge the lowest rate that a television station offers for advertising for a political campaign during certain portions of the year. Perhaps we could do so providing an incentive that the campaign commercials be somewhat instructive and somewhat related to the candidate who is actually paying for the campaign commercial. 
There are several kinds of air pollution in this country, one of which is political air pollution, and if we can do anything to in any small, measurable way, provide a little more thoughtful approach to campaign advertising through an incentive, then I would like to see us do it. I expect, however, that when and if I am able to offer this amendment, some will suggest it is some sort of colossal interference. I think not. I think it is a sensible, thoughtful way to address that issue. 
Finally, if the problem is there is too much money in politics and the solution is to reform our campaign financing system in one way or another, then how will we reform our system? Well, we reform it by bringing a bill to the floor and passing it, doing the same in the House, going to conference, agreeing in conference and getting a bill to the President he can sign. 
Now, is that likely? What is likely to be the future of campaign finance reform? I applaud Senator Lott for bringing it to the floor of the Senate for a debate. Giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue is important. But it is the starting line, not the finish line. The finish line for Congress will be when we have, on a bipartisan basis hopefully, achieved an agreement on a campaign finance reform package that will give the American people some basic confidence that what we are holding are elections not auctions; some basic confidence that we will step away from this exponential increase in spending on political campaigns. 
Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have taken a first long jump here to get this legislation to the floor of the Senate, and I hope that in the coming few days we can open up the process and allow some amendments and have a vote. 
I noticed today, when the Senate opened for business, amendments were offered in a very careful way. In fact, it took, I believe, six different amendments today in a series of maneuvers to fill the tree which, for those who don't know about our parliamentary situation, means that no one else is allowed to do anything at this point because the parliamentary tree is full. Amendments are not allowed. So we have had a maneuver that was accomplished today to fill the tree. 
So we will see where all that leads. Every time somebody does that--and both sides have done it about a handful of occasions--every time someone has done it, they have done it to prevent someone else from doing something later. I hope that is not the case. I hope we can shake this tree a bit and shake it sufficiently so that we can offer some amendments and reach a conclusion on campaign finance reform that is good for this country and restores some confidence in the American people that we are moving in the right direction. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is truly what is called getting the last word, as I understand the unanimous consent agreement is for the adjourning of the Senate following my presentation. 
I regret I was delayed. I wanted to be here to be involved in the back-and-forth discussion on campaign finance reform. Nonetheless, I am able to offer a few comments about some of the discussion we have had in the last few hours on this important issue. 
It is important for everybody to understand that we are talking now about campaign finance reform, and we ought not take a victory lap by virtue of the fact that it is on the floor of the Senate. We are at the starting line, not the finish line. The starting line was to scratch and fight and prod to try to get campaign finance reform to the floor because a whole lot of people didn't want us to talk about it or to consider it. 
Well, it is here, and now we are going to have some votes. I am going to offer amendments, some others will offer amendments, and we will see how people feel about reforming our campaign finance system in this country. 
Much of the discussion in the last couple of hours has been by those who say they have constitutional objections to the McCain-Feingold bill, for example, and/or other proposals; that they somehow would violate the Constitution. Earlier in the week, 126 legal scholars weighed in saying, `Nonsense, this wouldn't violate the Constitution at all.' In response to the scholars, one of my colleagues said, `Well, I suppose we could get 126 people who would tell us the Earth is flat.' I imagine you could, but not constitutional scholars. 
The issue here is people who understand the Constitution, people who study the Constitution, weighing in on this question of whether the proposals to change our system of campaign financing runs afoul of the Constitution. The answer, clearly, at least by 126 constitutional scholars is no, that's a bogus issue. 
Mr. President, this issue of campaign finance reform is a critically important issue. I have served in public office for some long while, and I am proud to serve in public office. I am one of those who believes public service is important. I wake up in the morning and feel privileged to be able to serve in the U.S. Senate. I come to work enjoying my job. I have a thirst for public issues and public debate and a contest of ideas. I think this is an honorable profession. I enjoy serving here. I want to do the things to advance public policy in a way that gives the American people some confidence that those of us who serve here serve the public interest. 
I want to tell a story briefly about the campaign I waged for the U.S. Senate, having served for some terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. I was better known than my opponent because I was an incumbent Congressman, although my opponent had run in statewide races previously. Nonetheless, we both were endorsed by our respective political conventions to run for the U.S. Senate. 
So I called for something in public debate with my opponent that I thought was unique, unusual, and something that had never been done before in this country in a Senate campaign. I said 
to my opponent, Why don't you and I engage in a campaign that is the most unique and unusual that has been waged in modern times? Here's my proposition. I'm better known than you are because I've served in Congress and have run statewide a good number of times. I accept that. I will be better known than you are when we start this race. I propose this: I propose that I will not run any television commercials, no radio advertisements, no commercials of any kind during the entire campaign. You commit to do the same thing, and then what we do is we pool our money and we buy 8 hours of prime-time television on the stations that serve in North Dakota, and each week for 1 hour, we show up at a television station and have it simulcast across the stations in North Dakota; we show up with no assistants, no aides, no handlers, no notes, no research materials, just the two of us, and no moderator, and for 1 hour a week prime time that we pay for, we tell North Dakotans why we want to serve in the U.S. Senate and the kind of ideas that we have for the future of our State in this country; we debate the issues of the day, one on one, an hour a week prime time for 8 weeks leading up to the election. 
At the end of 8 weeks, having an hour debate every week, prime time simulcast on all the stations, everyone in North Dakota would know who he is, how he feels about issues, how he reacts in response to a public debate about issues, and they would know who I am and how I respond to the same thing. 
My opponent chose not to accept that challenge. So the result was we had a traditional campaign: He ran 30-second advertisements, the little slash-and-burn 30-second explosion that goes off in our minds that contribute nothing to the public knowledge. It is part of the air pollution in this country that happens every election year, that on television and on the radio, we hear these 30-second and 1-minute explosions that contribute nothing to the political dialog in America. So that is what happened in my Senate race. 
I regret that was the case because we could have had a Senate race that would have hearkened back to the old days in which, without the 30-second slash-and-burn advertisements, we would have had live, prime-time debates without notes, without handlers, without moderators, just talking about what we believed was necessary to do to assure a better future for this country and for our children. 
Election contests should, after all, be a contest of ideas, but it is not that these days. I have run in 10 statewide elections in North Dakota--10 of them. So I know something about statewide campaigns. They are not any longer contests of ideas. They are an opportunity for handlers and aides and gurus and assistants and pollsters and media advisers to put together these little explosions and put them on television, attempting to mischaracterize some other position or some other candidate. 
Often, the television commercial that is paid for by a candidate has no explanation except a little line that no one can see on the bottom that the candidate is even sponsoring it. I have made some suggestions on how we should address that issue, just as an example, and I am going to offer it as an amendment and we will have a chance to vote on it in the Senate. Some will not like it. I don't know if it will prevail. 
Here is what I think we should do. We, by law, say television stations are to provide what we call the lowest card rate for political advertising during certain political periods during campaigns. If you are running political campaigns and 
buying political time, you get the lowest rate on the rate card and you are guaranteed that by law. I am going to offer an amendment that I think will change the culture of these 30-second little slash-and-burn commercials that have become the trademark of American campaigns. Mine will be very simple. The only commercials in political advertising that will qualify for the lowest rate or lowest cost will be those that are at least 1 minute in length and on which the candidate appears on the commercial 75 percent of the time. If those two conditions are not met, they don't buy at the bottom of the rate card. 
It costs them much, much more. Let us at least, if we are going to have a law that requires cutrate advertising prices, be afforded campaigns, as now exists in law, let us at least allow that to provide an incentive for the right kind of public discussion. No one who is thinking, in my judgment, can believe the right kind of public discourse in this country these days is the little 30-second pollution out there on television and radio that contributes nothing to public dialog; it simply attempts to cut down the other candidate and demean the other candidate, having nothing to do with the issues. 
Am I suggesting those who run for public office ought to be free of public scrutiny and free of public criticism? Not at all, but we ought to provide some incentives in which the public gets a decent debate about public issues in our campaigns. So we will have an opportunity to vote on my amendment during this discussion. 
I come to the floor of the Senate as a supporter of the McCain-Feingold legislation. Would I have written it differently? Yes, I think so. There are some things I would have changed substantially, but I have great admiration for Senator McCain and Senator Feingold and for the persistence with which they bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate. They believe the current system of financing campaigns is broken and something ought to be done. There are some in the Senate who believe that things are just fine, let's just keep going just the way we are going, things are just terrific, and they don't want anybody to do anything to change what is now happening. 
There is an old saying that the water `ain't' going to clear up until you get the hogs out of the creek. The only way we are going to clear up the water of campaign financing in this country is for those of us who believe that we need to change the method by which we finance campaigns in this country is if we are able to beat back, by voting on the Senate floor, the attempts of those who want to stall, once again, our ability to change this system. 
Mr. President, I want to show a chart that describes better than all the words I can use what is wrong with our campaign financing system. 
This is money in politics, an explosion of money in politics, spending on all congressional races, 1976 to 1996. 
And you say, `What's happening to this line?' Money in politics. 
I wonder if when George Washington and Mason and Madison and Ben Franklin sat in that little room in Philadelphia and talked about what kind of a constitution they should create for this country, I wonder if they thought that we would get to this kind of situation where a representative democracy would see the election of those representatives part and parcel of a system in which there is an explosion of money and elections all too often become auctions rather than elections. I do not think so. 
I do not think this represents the best of democracy. I do not think it represents something that we can be proud of, as those of us who participate. I think we ought to change it. 
So the question for me and some others in this Chamber is not whether we address this issue and make some changes, the question is, What kind of changes should we make? The McCain-Feingold bill comes to the floor of the Senate--as I have indicated, I am a cosponsor but I might have written parts of it differently. 
As I understand it, the specific McCain-Feingold proposal that is brought to the floor of the Senate now does not contain some of the central portions that I think are necessary in really making progress in reforming our campaign financing system. 
For example, we have to, in my judgment, have expenditure limits on campaigns in order to be effective. There is too much money in politics. If we do not put spending limits on campaigns, then we are not going to solve the problem. I understand that the spending limits which were in the McCain-Feingold bill, which were voluntary spending limits, have been removed and we will now have to try to put them back in by amendment. 
So the question for the Senate is going to be, Can we attach individual spending limits, State by State, to campaigns and enforce them in some way in this piece of legislation? 
Originally, the legislation had what are called voluntary spending limits which had incentives in order to get people to say, `Yes, we'll accept spending limits.' And the incentives persuading them to accept spending limits would then impose limits on the campaigns. 
It is interesting, the Supreme Court in a case called Buckley versus Valeo ruled by a 5-4 decision that we cannot have spending limits that are enforceable in campaigns. I would like to see the Supreme Court revisit that issue, the 5-4 decision. Everybody has a right to be wrong. When the Supreme Court is wrong, of course, it is the law of the land. 
The Supreme Court, in my judgment, was fundamentally wrong here. We really ought to have the Supreme Court review this once again--and I think we reach a different result. But, nonetheless, the result we now have in Buckley versus Valeo says that you cannot have enforceable spending limits. So the attempt has been to provide what are called voluntary spending limits and sufficient incentives in law that would persuade people to abide by and adopt those spending limits. 
I think in the coming days it is going to be clear, with respect to the debate in the Senate, the difference between the two groups. I am not talking about Democrats and Republicans; I am talking about two groups of people. There is one group that says, `Look, things are fine. What do you mean, there's too much money in politics? Too much money spent on Rolaids or 
Kleenex,' they will say. `Gee, we don't have enough money in politics.' 
There is another group that said, `Wait a second.' I mean, it does not take glasses to see what is going on here. What has happened is an avalanche of money is thrown into this political system, and it is corrupting the system. If we cannot have some spending limits someplace, if we cannot, as a group, decide there is too much money in politics, if we cannot decide that this red line going nearly straight up represents the corrosive influence of money in politics, then we are not going to succeed. Yes, we got the bill to the floor of the Senate, but we will not succeed in solving the campaign finance problem that exists in this country. 
So we will see now in the coming weeks, I suppose the coming 2 weeks, perhaps, when this is finally complete. There is a group that says, `Gee, things are terrific. Let's leave things the way they are. We like money. In fact, the more the merrier.' They don't say it, but I think they are kind of concocting a golden rule--he who has the gold, rules. The fact is that we have one group that has twice as much as the other group, so they want the rules to admire that and suggest that that is just fine. 
I suppose you can make the case that those who do not have as much money would like to put limits on those who do. But you know, the American people are eventually going to rule the day here. The American people are going to make the decision through their representatives here in Congress and through public pressure to say either, `Yes, we think this is great. We think this flood of money coming into politics is a wonderful thing. It really nurtures our political system,' or the American people will likely say, as all the polls tell us, by 70 and 80 percent, `This doesn't make any sense at all. This avalanche of money is hurting our political system.' 
We have what is called `hard money' and `soft money' and contributions on this side and that side. I imagine that people have difficulty understanding `hard money' and `soft money.' The easy way to understand it, for example, is soft money is the legal form of cheating--cheating, yes--because no one anticipated, with current campaign laws, that the kind of money that is now used called `soft money' would be, could be, or should ever be used for purposes it is now being employed to achieve; that is, millions, tens of millions of dollars, yes, by both political parties, tens of millions of dollars thrown into what is called party building. But it is not party building. These are moneys that are spent in a way designed to influence individual elections and designed carefully in ways to avoid it appearing like they are direct expenditures under regulation of the Federal Election Commission. 
The corrosive part of the soft money issue is that is money that can be thrown in--it can be by a corporation, labor organization, rich individuals, you name it--it can be thrown into a race under the guise of not part of the hard money contribution, but it can affect that race in a dramatic way. The source of the money is never revealed--secret money out there, never revealed. And you can move the money around three, four different ways to different organizations, and the source of the money is never revealed--half a million dollars here, a million dollars there. 
You know who the victims have been of that? We can name some of the victims who at the end of their campaigns, thinking 
it was them versus another candidate in a contest of ideas in their State, found out it was not that. Yes, that was part of it. Then there are organizations, unnamed and newly named organizations, off to the side, running in with saddlebags full of soft money, the source of which no one would ever disclose, putting advertisements on television, negative, corrosive, ugly advertisements in order to knock one of the candidates out of the race. 
That is what this political system has become. If we do not fix it, if we do not address that, shame on us. The American people know it is wrong, and we ought to know it is wrong. 
So the question ought not be for anybody in this Chamber whether we address this issue in a thoughtful way and pass some legislation finally to reform the campaign finance system; the question ought to be, how? How do we do it? We have a couple weeks in which this Senate can express its judgment on that issue. 
I have great respect for every other Member of this Senate. There are some who stand here today and say they are very concerned about this aspect or that aspect. I have great respect for them. I am not going to suggest they have impure motives. But I am saying that in the strongest possible ways, if they believe that what we ought to do is nothing, if they believe the current system of financing campaigns in this country is good for this country, then they are dreadfully wrong. So we will see in the next couple of weeks. 
I just mentioned soft money and independent expenditures. There is another category called issue advertising which is tied in with the same sort of thing--issue advertising. 
Let me read from an article out of Rollcall.  
While presidential, Senate, and House candidates spent a record $400 million on TV ads last year, more than two dozen organizations dumped an additional $150 million into controversial issue advertising in the 1995-96 cycle . . . 
And guess what? What kind of advertising was this? Eighty-one percent of it was negative advertising; 81 percent negative advertising. That is the air pollution in this country that we ought to worry about. We ought to do something about it. 
I am not suggesting it is inappropriate to have issue advertising. But we ought to make it all accountable. If you are going to come in and play a role in these campaigns, then tell the American people where you got your money, whose money is it you are spending, and what is the purpose of the expenditure. 
Mr. President, we have had a lengthy discussion today and the discussion will go on, I assume, for about 2 weeks, and it will be between those who believe we ought to have reform and those who don't. 
Speaker Gingrich calls for more, not less, campaign cash, in an article in the Washington Post. He represents a group who believe that money is not a problem--we probably need more money in politics, not less. I absolutely disagree with him. 
In another article, `Group launches effort against campaign finance reform bill.' Some very large influential groups in this country who are deeply involved in issue advertising of the type I just described don't want campaign finance reform. I guess I can understand why, but I think they are wrong. 
Mr. President, 45 members of my caucus signed a piece of legislation saying they are prepared to vote for McCain-Feingold; four in the other caucus said the same thing. If we can get a vote, up or down, we are looking for one or two additional Members of the Senate who will decide whether we pass this legislation. 
There are those, I suppose, who will say, `We need more time.' We have had 6,700 pages of hearing, 3,361 floor speeches--and we can add today's to that, all of this on the issue of campaign finance reform--446 legislative proposals, and 113 votes in the Senate. I don't know of anyone who can credibly say we need more time. 
What we need is the nerve and the will to do what is right. I hope we might see that kind of nerve and will in the next couple of weeks.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been so tempted today, I wanted very much to come and speak about fast track, which the President is asking with respect to trade authority, and I was intending to do that at time when it was appropriate today, but because of the debate on campaign finance reform time was not available for that. I thought about doing it at the end of my remarks on campaign finance reform, but I know that there are those who want to do other things and there is some sort of dispatch for the Senate to adjourn. I will respect that. But I want to say about two paragraphs as I conclude. 
I hope to come back on Monday and find some time to discuss President Clinton's proposal to provide fast-track trade authority so he can negotiate additional trade agreements. I am opposed to that, and I am going to resist vigorously trade authority that would provide the President, any President, the opportunity to negotiate new trade agreements until we fix the problems in the old agreement. 
Let me leave with a couple of statistics. We now have a pretty good economy, that is true. We tackled the fiscal policy budget deficit. But the other deficit, the trade deficit, is the highest in this country's history. 
Every time we negotiate a new trade agreement we seem to lose. We negotiated an agreement with Canada. Our deficit was $13 billion with Canada; now it is double. We negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico. We had a $2 billion surplus; now after the trade agreement we have a $14 billion deficit. We have a $50 to $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, a $40 to $50 billion trade deficit with China. We are up to our neck in trade problems and cannot resolve virtually any of those problems because our trade treaties, first of all, were negotiated inappropriately to provide the kind of sanctions they ought to for those that don't open their markets to American goods. And second, we don't enforce trade treaties that other countries have signed with us. 
I want to speak at some great length, I hope on Monday, on this subject. I am not speaking on trade because I am what is called a protectionist, xenophobe, or isolationist. I believe in trade. I believe in free trade. I demand fair trade, and I believe we ought to expand our trade opportunities. But I believe this country ought to, for a change, stand up for its own economic interests and demand that manufacturing and jobs and opportunity exist in this country's future and not trade away those opportunities so that corporations can access dime-an-hour labor by 14-year-old kids working 14 hours a day to ship products to Fargo, ND, or Pittsburgh. That is not free trade. I will talk at some length on Monday about that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the Defense appropriations conference report, which the Senate is now considering. 
The distinguished chairman and the distinguished ranking member, Senators Stevens and Inouye, working with our House counterparts, have done a remarkable job in fashioning a truly balanced bill that will meet our Nation's security needs for the 21st century. I would like to salute Senators Stevens and Inouye for their leadership and skill in balancing the competing needs of our Nation's military. 
I also would like to thank the chairman and ranking member for working with me to address some Defense issues that are of a very high priority to North Dakota. Let me just highlight some of these matters. 
B-52 BOMBERS 
First, this Defense spending bill provides an additional $57.3 million above the administration's budget request to fully fund our Nation's fleet of B-52 bombers. My colleagues will recall that we deployed 66 B-52's during Operation Desert Storm, and that these planes dropped 40 percent of the ordnance dropped by allied forces during the Persian Gulf war. Yet the administration has consistently recommended sending 23 of these valuable planes to the boneyard. I am pleased that the bill now before us specifically rejects that suggestion. 
As those who fly B-52's out of Minot Air Force Base know, the B-52 is a highly capable bomber, one that can continue to contribute to our national defense through at least 2030. Nearly every part of the B-52 has been replaced or modernized, and we have spent over $4 billion in recent years to upgrade and update these planes. The B-52's that entered service in the 1960's still have only about one-third of the flight hours of the average 747 now in commercial service. 
If we were left with 71 B-52's, only about 44 of the aircraft would be combat-coded, making it impossible for us to repeat the B-52's gulf war performance in any future regional conflict, much less hold some in reserve for a second regional conflict or a nuclear role. 
Lastly, to retire strategic bombers would reduce Russia's incentives to ratify the START II Treaty. This major arms control agreement will help us achieve greater strategic stability. But we should not throw away bargaining chips before the Duma acts to approve START II.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference agreement to H.R. 2209, the fiscal year 1998 legislative branch appropriation bill. The conference agreement provides a total of $2.25 billion for fiscal year 1998 for the Congress and other legislative branch agencies. This represents a reduction of $144 million from the budget request. 
All in all, this is a good conference agreement. I wish to take just a minute to point out the level of funding agreed to by the conferees with respect to the General Accounting Office [GAO]. As Members are aware, an agreement was reached last Congress between the GAO and appropriators to reduce the GAO's budget by a total of 25 percent over fiscal years 1996 and 1997. The GAO successfully implemented a plan for this reduction, without having to be dragged kicking and screaming. Our commitment to them, in return, was to stabilize their funding at that reduced level. Unfortunately, for fiscal year 1998, the House recommended an appropriation of only $323.5 million for the GAO, a reduction of $37.9 million below their budget request. The Senate bill, after thorough consideration and cooperation from the GAO itself, found that an appropriation of $346.8 million would be sufficient to maintain GAO's level of operations. 
Madam President, this was the most difficult issue in the conference. Chairman Bennett joined me in urging the House to come up substantially from their level. Ultimately, the conferees agreed to an appropriation of $339.5 million for fiscal year 1998, $7 million above the fiscal year 1997 appropriation and $16 million above the House-passed bill. While not providing GAO every last dollar that they would like to have had, this level of funding comes very close to fulfilling our commitment to the GAO. 
I commend Senator Bennett for his fairness and the leadership he showed during our conference with the House. I also compliment the House conferees, particularly the House subcommittee chairman, Congressman Walsh, and his minority counterpart, Congressman Serrano, as well as their very capable staffs, Ed Lombard for the majority and Greg Dahlberg for the minority. 
Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference agreement.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, approximately 1 year ago the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act became law. 
Next year at this time, September 30, 1998, section 110 of this act will be implemented and will adversely--and unintentionally--affect our neighbors in Canada. Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] to develop an automated entry and exit system for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure of every alien arriving and leaving the United States. The United States has never had such an alien departure management system. 
Unfortunately, section 110 as enacted fails to recognize the decades-long practice of not requiring most Canadian nationals to fill out INS documents--referred to as `I-94s' at the border. 
In a December 18, 1996 letter to the Ambassador of Canada at the time, Raymond Chretien, Senator Alan Simpson, and Representative Lamar Smith, the chairmen of the Senate and the House Judiciary Subcommittees on Immigration, respectively, indicated to Ambassador Chretien that it was not the intention of the Judiciary Committee to impose any new requirements for border crossing cards--so-called I-94's--on Canadians who are not presently required to possess such documents. 
The legislation which I am introducing today--which was introduced in the House on September 16 by Congressman John LaFalce of New York--would simply clarify the intent of Congress by exempting from the section 110 provisions of the act Canadian nationals who are not now required by law to possess a visa, passport, or border-crossing identification card to enter the United States. 
There is no logical reason to inhibit the flow of traffic between the United States and Canada. If the committee's intention is not clarified, and section 110 is implemented at the Canadian border, congestion would become intolerable. 
According to U.S. Customs, the port in Pembina, ND, saw 963,665 individuals cross into North Dakota in fiscal year 1996, averaging 2,640 people a day. Customs estimates that if the entry/exit system had to be implemented on the Canadian border, providing the agent to spend just 1 minute per person entering it would take two customs workers a nonstop daily shift of 22 hours to process them. 
An estimated 116 million persons cross into the United States at all land points on the Canadian border. Of these, 76 million are Canadian or United States permanent residents. More than $1 billion in goods and services trade crosses the United States/Canadian border each day. I urge the Judiciary Committee to consider soon mine or other legislation to clarify the intent of the 1996 act.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Burns and I see the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations on the floor and we would like to engage him in a discussion regarding assistance from the Department of Energy (DOE) to help finance the construction of a pipeline to transport carbon dioxide (CO2) now produced as a waste gas at the Great Plains Gasification (Great Plains) plant near Beulah, North Dakota to existing oil fields to be used for enhanced tertiary oil recovery.

Mr. DORGAN. We thank the Chairman. This project will enhance tertiary oil recovery efforts in North America which will help the United States and Canada secure greater energy independence from foreign oil. It is also critical to the long-term operation of Great Plains, which has been a priority for the federal government since it sold the plant to the Dakota Gasification Company in the late 1980s. 
The financial assistance Senator Burns and I are proposing would consist of a loan from funds currently available to DOE in a Great Plains trust fund. DOE staff has reviewed the details of the CO2 project and the Department believes that a loan is appropriate if so directed in an appropriations bill. 
Is the Chairman willing to work with us and the House conferees to include Statement of Managers language in the conference agreement that permits DOE to provide such a loan at reasonable terms to the owners of Great Plains and to the government?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while I agree with my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, on the entire discussion about deteriorating schools and equal opportunity and a range of other things, this issue is very simple. This issue is about national testing. It is not about a national curriculum. It is not about investing in schools. It is national testing. 
The reason I support this is we can either decide as a country to figure out what we are getting from this educational system and have some kind of national testing to determine are we reaching achievement levels in the fourth grade and eighth grade or we can have no such approach. 
The other body is passing legislation that would prohibit any approach of this point. `We don't want to evaluate what is happening,' they say. That is a very strange position. 
It seems to me you ought to evaluate if children can read sufficiently at the fourth-grade level because these are gateways to the rest of their educational life. If you can't read sufficiently at that level, you are not going to do well the rest of your educational life. So we are talking about can children read in fourth grade. Do they have a mastery of the mathematics principles in the eighth grade they need? This is what this is about: national testing to evaluate in these two areas. 
It is voluntary. Any child may opt out. Any school may opt out. Any State may opt out. It is purely voluntary, but it does say, as a country, we aspire to reach achievement levels and aspire to give our parents across this country the opportunity to understand what are we getting for the education dollar we are spending, where are the problems and how do we fix them. That is what you get with this kind of national testing opportunity. 
Again, it is not about national curriculum. It is not about a national requirement. It is a voluntary approach to national testing to determine whether our children can read sufficiently in the fourth grade and perform the basic tests of mathematics in the eighth grade. 
To the extent we do that as a country, we will aspire to better understand our education system, better understand what we are getting for our education dollar, and in that way I think will be able to improve the system of education in this country. 
I appreciate very much the cooperation of the Senator from Indiana, the Senator from New Hampshire, and others, and especially the leadership of the Senator from New Mexico. Doing this today I think is a step forward for the American people and is in marked contrast to what we are going to see come from the other body. I hope when we go to conference we will accept the Senate provision because it is moderate, thoughtful and the right thing for this country and its children. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for his leadership in urging the creation of this White House Office on Tribal Colleges and Universities. Like Senator Bingaman, I supported S. Res. 264 and was among the Senators that subsequently urged the President to issue the Executive order. It was at my request that the committee included language for increased funding support for this office, and I am most grateful to the chairman for his help on this matter and for clarifying the committee's intent. 
North Dakota is home to five tribal colleges, and these institutions are an important part of the higher education community in my State. It is my belief that the White House initiative has the potential to galvanize Federal support for these institutions, and in so doing will open the door to college wider for many Native Americans.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the President has sent to the Congress a determination that he would like Congress to provide what is called fast-track trade authority with which he could negotiate additional and new trade agreements with other countries. It is my hope that in the coming weeks, this request will result in a significant, new and interesting debate about this country's trade policies. 
I know as I begin this discussion that we will almost retreat immediately into two camps. The one camp is `We're for free trade, we're for, therefore, what is called fast-track trade authority.' The other side is somehow a bunch of know-nothing protectionists, a bunch of xenophobes who just don't understand the world, and all they want to do is create walls around our country. 
That is the thoughtless way that most trade debate has been conducted in this town and in Congress. I hope, however, that this time, when we discuss fast-track trade authority, we will have an opportunity to evaluate trade policy. 
The issue for me is not fast track. That is a procedural issue. Yes; I will want to evaluate the underlying law from 1974 on fast track, and I am going to do that to see whether that fast-track approach might be changed. However, I am much more interested in the question of what will be the results? What kind of trade agreements and what kinds of trade policies are they seeking under fast track? 
We had fast track most recently for something called NAFTA, a set of trade agreements with the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Just prior to fast track, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Now we have a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Can anyone believe that should be described as a success? I think not. Just prior to this trade agreement, we had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. Now we have a $23 billion trade deficit with Canada. Can that be described as a success? I think not. 
Our trade problems go and on. There is China, Japan, and more. We will have a trade deficit with China of well over $40 billion a year. Our trade deficit with Japan has hovered between $50 and $60 billion a year as far as the eye can see. 
No one wants to talk about the central question we ought to debate with respect to trade, and that is, what about enforcing the trade agreements that already exist? 
I want to give my colleagues an example of one of the things that bothers me so much about where we go in this trade discussion. Right at this moment we have an ongoing discussion with Japan on the issue of the United States aviation industry's access to the Japanese markets. In trade with Japan, in the arena of airline passenger service, we have a net surplus with Japan of a couple billion dollars. We have better carriers in terms of being able to compete. They are better able to compete with the Japanese, and we actually do quite well. We have a surplus in that area. 
If we had completely open skies and unlimited competition and unfettered competition with the Japanese with respect to airlines, we would have an even larger surplus with Japan. But we have trade agreements with Japan that we made previously with respect to passenger aviation and with respect to hauling freight on airlines, and so on. 
What has happened is the Japanese have not abided by the previous agreements. We have had a freight agreement with them that they simply have ignored, and have not abided by. Now we are back into negotiation with the Japanese, and the Japanese have done a couple of things. For one, they said, `We don't like the fact that you have a surplus with us on hauling airline passengers.' 
Think of the arrogance of that. Here is a country that has a 
$50 billion trade surplus with us--and has had such a surplus every year, year after year after year--complaining about one little sector where we have a surplus with them, and then they want to get us into a negotiation. Instead of going to open skies where you have free and open competition, they want to get this administration--and I think this administration is headed in that direction--to reach an agreement that is not in our interest. 
That is an example of what is wrong with trade policy. We ought to say to the Japanese that on aviation and other issues that we believe that our trade policy ought to result for this country, for the United States, increased economic opportunity and increased trade and, yes, balanced trade. This country cannot and should not countenance long-term trade deficits with countries like Japan of $50 and $60 billion a year. 
We ought to say to China, for example, that you have a $40 billion trade surplus with us. We have become a cash cow for your hard currency needs in China, and we will no longer stand for it. If you want to send us all the goods from China into the United States, then we say to you, you have a responsibility and an obligation to buy more from us. 
Why is all this important? Because it represents economic vitality and jobs. It is interesting. I hear people talk about trade and they say, `Gee, we've done so well in trade. We've doubled our exports to this country or that country.' That is the first thing they will point out in a press release. 
So the headline is `U.S. Doubles Export of Goods to Country X.' What they didn't say was that imports from that country increased 10 times during the same time period, which means that our trade deficit with that country skyrocketed. 
So the whole story, the rest of the story, would describe failure, but the press release describes success--`We've doubled our exports.' 
In sectors where you have tradable goods, we actually have had a net job loss in this country as a result of all the trade agreements. The job gains which are often trumpeted as being the result of exports actually come from areas in the nontradable sectors of our economy, particularly in services. 
The point I am making about all of this is we are going to have a debate about fast-track trade authority. I want the debate to be about trade policy. Is our trade policy working for this country or isn't it? 
I happen to believe in expanded trade. I believe in free trade to the extent that it is fair. I also believe in trade agreements to the extent that we negotiate trade agreements that are in this country's interest. But, for a change, I would like the negotiators who negotiate trade agreements to start wearing the jersey of our side. It is our team that we are worried about. 
Is that economic nationalism? Well, I don't know about all those terms they throw about. Do I care about the long-term economic opportunities in this country? Yes. Do I want economic growth here? Yes. Do I want jobs in this country? Yes. 
So when a country like China says to the United States, `We want to ship you all of these goods and run a very large surplus with you or have you run a large deficit with us,' and then China says, `By the way, we want to buy some airplanes,' and they say, `We don't want to buy airplanes made in America, we want you to have your American company produce these airplanes in China,' we ought to say that's not the way a trade relationship works. 
A bilateral trade relationship works in a way that says, `When you have goods our consumers need, we will buy them from you and you have access to our marketplace, but when you need what we produce, when you need what our workers and our companies produce, we expect you to buy them from us.' That is the way a trade relationship works in a manner that is mutually beneficial to both parties. 
Our country has been satisfied to have a trade policy that has produced trade deficits, net trade deficits for 36 out of the last 38 years. You show me one CEO of one American company who has had 
167 successive quarters of losses, quarter after quarter after quarter forever, who isn't going to stop and say, `Gee, I think there's something wrong here. Something is out of whack.' That is exactly what is wrong with our trade policy. Yet, Republicans and Democrats will tell us on the floor of this Senate that our trade policy is working very well. What a terrific policy, they tell us. 
I want for us to have greater access to foreign markets. For example: If China wants to send us goods that exceed the amount of goods they will accept from us by $40 billion a year, I want us to say to China, `You have an obligation to buy much, much, much more from the United States of America to have a balanced trade relationship.' I want us to say the same thing to Japan, the same thing to Mexico, the same thing to Canada and others with whom we have large, abiding trade deficits. We need to say that because those deficits weaken this country. Those deficits detract from our economic growth and fundamentally weaken the American economy. 
There are those who, I guess, believe that whatever the interests of the largest corporations in the world are, that they are also in the common interests of the United States. Things have changed. We do, indeed, have a global economy, but the largest corporations in the world now are not national citizens. They don't get up in the morning and say, `Well, you know, I'm an artificial person, I'm a corporation, what in law is described as an artificial person; I can sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with; I'm an artificial person and, therefore, I have allegiance to this country.' That's not what they do. 
We are not talking about American corporations anymore. We are talking about international corporations that do global business that are interested in profits for their shareholders. 
How do you maximize profits for your shareholders? You access the cheapest kind of production that you can access in the world, produce there at a dime-an-hour, a-quarter-an-hour, or a half-a-dollar-an-hour wages and then ship the products to Pittsburgh, Toledo, Los Angeles, or Fargo and sell it on a shelf in a store in one of those cities. Produce where it is cheap and then access the American marketplace. 
The problem with that strategy is that while it presents increased profits for international corporations it tends to undermine the American economy. I am not saying the global economy and the growth of the global economy is wholly bad; it is not. It provides new opportunities and new choices for the consumers, and in some cases lower-priced goods for the consumers. The question we have to ask ourselves is: what is fair trade and what advances this country's economic interests? 
If deciding that you can produce something that you used to produce in Akron, OH, in a factory in Sri Lanka or Indonesia or Bangladesh and you can get 14-year-olds, pay them 24 cents an hour, working 13 hours a day--if you decide that is in your company's interest--is that in this country's interest? I don't think so. 
Is it in this country's interest to see that kind of manufacturing job flight from this country to a low-wage country so that the same product can be produced to be shipped back into this country, and the only thing that's changed is the corporation has more profit and the United States has fewer jobs? Is that in this country's interest? I don't think so. 
I was on a television program 2 days ago. When I asked this question the moderator said the conditions under which goods are produced in other countries is none of our business. If another country wants to hire kids and pay them dimes an hour, if another country wants to produce by dumping chemicals into the water and pollution into the air, if another country wants to produce having no restrictions on those companies and allows them to pollute the air and water, hire kids, pay a dime an hour, if that's what they want to do, is that none of our business? And if the production from that factory--hiring kids and polluting the air and polluting the water--if that production comes into this country and goes on the grocery store shelves, is that all the better for the American consumer because it is going to be cheaper? 
I think that is a catastrophe to have that kind of attitude. This country spent 60 years debating the question of what is a fair wage? This country spent decades debating whether we ask polluters to stop polluting, and whether we demand that polluters stop polluting in order to clean our air and water. This country spent a long while debating the question of child labor and whether we should allow factories to employ 10-year-olds and 12-year-olds. 
This country has debated all those issues. Yet, in the so-called global economy, fashioned in the interest of those who want to accelerate profits from it, there are those who would tell us that they can just pole vault over all of those issues. They don't have to worry about minimum wages. 
They do not have to worry about pollution control. They do not have to worry about any of that because they can move their factories elsewhere and ship their products back into the United States. That is not fair trade. That is not something that advances the economic interests of our country and ought not be allowed. 
What we do is we pass trade agreement after trade agreement, and we don't enforce any of them. When someone hears me speak they say, `Gee, this is just another protectionist that wants to put walls around this country.' I do not; not at all. I am very interested in saying to other countries, first of all, you have an obligation. There is an admission price to the American marketplace. The admission price is that you must abide by certain standards with respect to clean air and clean water, and you can't hire kids, and you can't pay a nickel an hour. Yes, that is the admission price to compete in our domestic market. 
And, yes, there is a requirement with other countries with whom we have a trade relationship. That requirement is if they want to access the American marketplace and dump tens of millions of dollars of products into that marketplace, then they have a responsibility to America. That responsibility is that their marketplace must be open to us. If our workers and our producers want to go to Japan and go to China to sell our goods in their marketplace, they must have their marketplace open for that. And to the extent you don't, it is unfair trade. 
To the extent any country is involved in unfair trade, this country ought to have the will and the nerve to say that we're not going to put up with it. 
Mr. President, one final point. This advent of a global economy post-Second World War has been an interesting kind of development. The first 25 years after the Second World War we could compete with anybody in the world with one hand tied behind our back. It did not matter much. Our trade policy was almost all foreign policy. Whatever we did or had with another country had to do with foreign policy. For the first 25 years we could do that easily. We did that and our incomes kept rising in this country. 
The second 25 years we have had to deal with competitors who are shrewd, tough economic competitors. We now must insist on trade relationships and trade agreements that are fair to this country's interests. The conditions of trade must be conditions with rules that are fair to our workers and producers. The absence of that means that this country is the economic loser. This ought not be what we aspire to achieve in trade agreements. 
Mr. President, I have more to say, regrettably, for my colleagues who do not like this message. I will say it often in the coming weeks as we discuss the trade issue. For now I will yield the floor. I see the minority leader has come to the floor. I know he is going to talk about another topic of great interest. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is quite a remarkable day. I am enormously gratified by the announcement. We have 45 members of our caucus, every single member of our caucus, who signed a letter saying we support the comprehensive campaign finance reform bill called McCain-Feingold. There are three cosponsors, I think, on the other side. That brings to 48 the number of people who have signed up to say, `We will vote for comprehensive campaign finance reform.' 
There are some around this town who I think are quitters on this issue. This is not a time to quit. They say, `Well, it's clear you can't get much done. Just do a little piece over here.' This is the wrong time to quit. We have 45 people in our caucus who have said they will vote for comprehensive campaign finance reform of our campaign finance system and at least three other cosponsors. We are at 48 votes just with that. And the question is, are there two other votes out there? Are there two other votes? I think there are. 
So, those who say this cannot be done, I think what we are demonstrating here with this letter is a substantial reservoir of support to say this system is broken, this system needs fixing, and it ought not be done with a niche over here. Let us do it with comprehensive campaign finance reform that is embodied in the McCain-Feingold proposal. 
I ask the Senator from South Dakota--I noticed we have had 3,361 floor speeches on campaign finance reform. So that is 3,362, and mine is 3,363, and we will have a couple more, I reckon. We have had 446 legislative proposals on campaign finance reform. If ever there was a demonstration of this statement that when all is said and done, more is said than done, it must certainly be on campaign finance reform. 
Isn't it the case that with this news that we have one caucus with 45 people who have signed up and with several others already cosponsoring, that we are within striking distance of having the opportunity to pass comprehensive campaign finance reform?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to describe to my colleagues an amendment that it is my intention to offer on this appropriations bill. I intend to offer an amendment on behalf of myself, and Senator Johnson, from the State of South Dakota, who will be speaking on it when I finish. We are joined in this endeavor by a fairly large number of Senators: Senators Campbell, Daschle, Domenici, Inouye, Burns, Conrad, Bingaman, Kohl, Wellstone, McCain, Harkin, Murray, and Levin--a very distinguished and significant bipartisan group of Senators--and, as I mentioned previously, by Senator Johnson of South Dakota who has worked very closely with me on this amendment. 
The amendment deals with tribal colleges. Before I describe the amendment I would like to make a comment about this subcommittee. 
I am privileged to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee. I consider it a distinct privilege to work with the Appropriations Committee, with the distinguished chairman, Senator Stevens of Alaska, and the distinguished ranking member and former chairman, Senator Byrd of West Virginia. I also serve on the Interior subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to work with the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, whose leadership has been excellent. Although he is not at the present moment on the floor, I want him to know that the chart he brings to the floor to describe the breakdown of expenditures for this particular subcommittee is unique, and particularly useful. It is the only chart of its type that I know of that has been presented to Members, and it, more than almost any other approach, really gives us a good description of where we are spending the money in this subcommittee, how much we are spending, and the purpose of that spending. 
So I say `thank you' to Senator Gorton, and to the ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator Byrd from West Virginia as well, for their leadership. 
I would like to thank Bruce Evans, Anne McInerney, and Sue Masica, the staff on this subcommittee who have been very helpful in working with me on a wide range of issues. 
The purpose of my offering an amendment today is to increase the funding for tribal colleges. And I want to describe why I think that is necessary. 
Funding for tribally controlled colleges has not increased for 3 years. The President's budget requested $30,411,000 for these colleges--a $3 million increase over the last fiscal year. Both the House and the Senate bills have provided for a $1 million increase. And I would like to add the extra $2 million to bring funding up to the President's request in his budget recommendation. With the adoption of this amendment, the Senate will be at the budget request level. And that is still only half of the authorized level. Nonetheless, I think it is a very important step forward. This amendment will be offset by a pro rata reduction in travel for all agencies covered by this bill whose budgets exceed $20 million. 
I can think of no more worthwhile investment in the future of native Americans than to invest in their education, particularly at the postsecondary level. All of us know that education is the key to success. We have 24 tribally controlled community colleges in this country that will be covered by this amendment. These colleges now serve more than 20,000 students. 
There are five tribal colleges in North Dakota. And I have been pleased to play a role in trying to help them, all of which I have visited personally. I must say that they have made a significant difference in the lives of many, many students. These 
colleges have been successful in educating native American students by preserving the cultural environment in which these students are familiar while still providing them with the skills to be competitive in the society at large. I am proud of what they have accomplished. I think the extra $2 million will be very, very helpful. Unfortunately, tribal college appropriations have failed to keep pace with inflation, and actual per student funding has decreased by $317 while the student enrollment has increased by more than 230 percent over the last decade. 
Mr. President, I would like just for a moment to describe a couple of people that I have either been privileged to meet or have heard about, who have demonstrated to me the importance of tribal colleges. 
I was invited to speak at a tribal college commencement in North Dakota a few years ago. As they lined up in cap and gown, enormously proud of their achievement on their graduation day, I felt pride as well. I was visiting with several from the class, just kibitzing back and forth, and I asked, `Who is the oldest of this graduating class?' A woman raised her hand. She said, `I am the oldest.' She was, I believe, 41 years old. She was a single mother of four children, whose husband had left her. She had been employed as the janitor in that school at the tribal college cleaning the hallways, cleaning the lavatories, working long hours, and working hard to try to care for her children. As she was cleaning the lavatories and the hallways in this tribal college, she got a notion that she would very much like to graduate from this college. 
So from the position of custodian or janitor at a tribal college, on this day when I was to speak at the graduation, she was wearing a cap and a gown, and at age 41 was getting a college degree. She had a smile so wide and such pride in her eyes because of what she had achieved for herself that no one will ever take away. It was, I think, Ben Franklin who suggested that if we empty our purse in our head, no one will ever been able to take it from us. And she knew that. But think of the odds to overcome--a single mother, raising four children, few skills, without much pay coming from the employment she then had. But on this day, she was a college graduate. I have never forgotten that smile. It was a remarkable achievement for her. But you will find that similar stories at all these tribal colleges. It changes people's lives. 
I want to tell you about a friend of mine named Loretta De Long, a North Dakotan. I am privileged to know Loretta. She was a single Chippewa mother of two. She was wondering about her life and her future. And tribal colleges were established just about the time that she realized the key to her future could be a higher education. 
After getting her high school diploma in a GED Program, this mother of two young children, the youngest of which was 6 weeks at the time, enrolled in one of the tribal colleges in North Dakota and that allowed for her to stay near her family and care for her children while she pursued her education. She said that `going to college was like looking in the mirror and seeing myself for the first time that college seemed to tap a leadership quality that had been squashed by the outside world.' 
Well, today Loretta De Long is Dr. De Long, Dr. Loretta De Long. The same woman, yes. She is also the Superintendent of Education for the Turtle Mountain Agency of the Turtle Mountain Tribe in North Dakota--another example of one person, but a success as a result of tribal colleges. 
I don't know Myra Lefthand, but Myra Lefthand is a Montanan, and she is a Crow Indian from Montana. She and her daughter lived on clerk's pay and after 15 years in the same position on clerk's pay, not doing very well, she felt there were many positions that she saw in and around her job situation that she would like to have had but was never able to apply for them because she didn't have the education. 
Here is what she said. She entered a tribal college to get an education. She said:  
For me, it meant a commitment to a goal. When I quit my job, I left behind what little security I had for myself and my daughter and I could no longer expect a paycheck, no matter how small. But while I was at the Little Bighorn College, I was encouraged daily in my pursuit of an associate degree in chemical dependency counseling by the dean of students, Punkie Anne Bollis, and by my sister, Clarice Deny. Between the two of them, a lot of hitchhiking, a lot of scrimping to make small savings go a long way, and the generosity of a sister who brought daily lunches to me, I was able to persist and to graduate from the Little Bighorn Tribal College with an AA degree. 
To all potential tribal college students, I say that going to get a professional degree is possible. With a little effort, hard study, support, prayers of family members, some financial aid, and the encouragement of some good teachers, an associate degree can be earned. 
The reason I mention today Myra, Dr. De Long, or Wilma, the first woman I described, is that these are people whose lives have been changed by the ability to go to a tribal college, the ability to, on an Indian reservation, have the support of family and have the other support that is available and still enter college and get a degree and change their lives. 
Now, what I am suggesting by this amendment is that we provide the additional $2 million which will bring the request up to the President's budget request. It is not a large amount of money by some Appropriations Committee standards, but it is an important amount of money that will I think invest in and benefit the lives of many Americans who now attend these tribal colleges, the enrollments of which are growing very rapidly but student funding has not kept pace. 
My intention would be to have this amendment offered. I will offer it or it can be offered on my behalf at the appropriate time after the committee amendments have been offered and I would like to work with the committee chair and the ranking member to see if we can find a way to adopt this amendment. 
The chairman of the subcommittee is here now. He was not here when I described the compliments I have for the chart that he provided the Senate. He does that every year, and it is the only one I know that exists with these subcommittees. It is an awfully good way to describe to the Congress what we are spending and where we are spending it, and I want to say thanks for the Senator's excellent leadership, and thanks to the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership as well. 
I know the Senator from South Dakota wishes to speak on this amendment, and I thank him very much for his strong work and 
support. I hope as we move along this amendment can be offered and hopefully we can agree to it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, many people ask the question--if you have other colleges elsewhere in the country, why is there a need for tribal colleges? The answer to that, very simply, is that a substantial number of women are attending these colleges, especially women who are living in poverty, many of them well above the 18- or 20-year-old age when people are moving into college. And because tribal college students are older and female--often single mothers in their late twenties or thirties--the ability to go to a tribal college on the reservation itself allows them to access the support of families for child care. That support is often the difference between going to college and not going to college; being able to have an opportunity for a higher degree or not being able to have the opportunity. It is in evidence all across this country that these tribal colleges work, whereas in other circumstances those same people, who are now proud graduates, would probably not have had the opportunity to go on for an advanced education. 
I appreciate very much the Senator's yielding. I would like to make one additional comment if I might, if the Senator will indulge me. 
When I mentioned the thank you for so many staffers who worked with us on this amendment, I did not mention Mary Hawkins, who works with me on appropriations issues. Mary is going to be leaving the Hill at the end of this year. She has worked for a long while and does wonderful work. I am blessed having her work with me on appropriations issues, and I wanted to say thank you to her as well.

Mr. DORGAN. Because the Senator mentioned United Tribes Technical College, I wanted to say how much I appreciate what the subcommittee did in that area. That is a unique institution which has been very successful and has not had a funding increase for a long, long while. Just last Saturday I was at the United Tribes Technical College, where they had one of the largest Indian powwows in this country. It is a wonderful cultural celebration, about as colorful and beautiful a celebration as you will see anywhere in the country. I can tell you the people at United Tribes Technical College were enormously grateful for what you have done in this appropriations bill for them. I think they understand that the increase you have provided is a recognition of excellence in education, an investment in human potential. They are very grateful for it. Because you mentioned that, I wanted to say how appreciative I was as well.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we are not yet on the appropriations bill today. It has not been formally called up. We have a number of issues in the appropriations bill that is now before the Senate, and I know the majority leader and others would like to complete it soon. I want to describe one of them that I think is very important that I hope will get resolved today. 
That is the issue that was raised last week on the subject of national testing with respect to achievement levels at various grades in our schools. 
President Clinton has suggested, and others have called for some kind of national testing system by which we can evaluate at the fourth grade level whether children are able to read sufficiently and at the eighth grade level whether they have sufficient capabilities in mathematics, because those are the benchmarks in the education system that allow you to proceed and succeed. If you are not able to read sufficiently in fourth grade, you are not going to do well beyond that. If you don't have a basic grasp of the concept of mathematics by the eighth grade, you are not going to do well beyond that. The question is, What are we getting for our education dollars? We spend a substantial amount of money in this country on elementary and secondary education. What are we getting for it? 
The proposal is a proposal that says, let us measure that, let us evaluate that, student to student, school to school, State to State, so that we know what we are getting out of our education system. There isn't a more important subject, in my judgment, for this country's future than the subject of education. Is our education system a good one? Does it work? Does it prepare our country for the future? 
Benjamin Franklin once said that if you invest your purse in your head, no one will ever take your purse from you. His point was that, if you invest in education, nobody can ever take from you what you have achieved yourself. That is a very important point. That is why it is so important for our country to make sure that we have an education system that works. 
Although reading is the foundation for virtually all other learning in our country, it is estimated that 40 percent of America's fourth graders cannot read at a basic level. Likewise, nearly 40 percent of eighth graders in our country are not achieving at a basic level, and 76 percent are not achieving at a proficient level. According to a recently released Third International Math and Science Study, 55 percent of U.S. eighth graders score below the international average in math. 
Now, the point about national testing is not to suggest in any way that the Federal Government try to run the local school systems. School systems ought to be run locally. They are now and they will be in the future. But we ought to give parents information about how their students and schools in our States are doing, comparing them student to student and school to school and State to State. We simply don't have that capability. Providing parents with that information, through a national testing program, will be an important step in trying to evaluate where we are in the educational system and then what we need to do to strengthen and improve it. 
Again, this is a proposal that says, let us try to evaluate across this country how our children are doing in reading at the fourth grade level and how our children are doing in mathematics at the eighth grade level. Giving parents that information will be enormously beneficial. I have two children in public schools this morning. They are the most wonderful young children that live in this country--as all parents feel about their children. I want them to have the finest education available to them. They are in public school. I like their teachers, I respect their school. But I happen to believe that, to the extent that we can improve this country's educational system, we will do that if we arm parents with more and more information about how the system does, how the schools are doing, how the teachers are doing, and how our students are doing. 
There are three things that will work to improve education in this country, and all three are necessary in order for the educational system to work well. First is a student that is willing to learn. Secod is a teacher that knows how to teach. And third is a parent that is involved in their student's education. The failure to have any one of the three means we don't do nearly as well as we can. 
Now, the proposal for a national testing program has substantial support. Polls have shown that 77 percent of the American people support national standards for measuring the academic performance of schools. It has substantial support from leaders all across this country, national business leaders like the National Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Alliance of Business, and it is clear to them that our ability to succeed in the long term and compete in the long term with other countries rests in our ability to provide an educational system that educates our children sufficiently so that we do succeed and prevail. 
Here is the testimony from the business leaders in America. Let me read a couple of the pieces of testimony. This is Jim Barksdale, the CEO of Netscape Communications, and L. John Doerr, a partner in the firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, on behalf of 240 technology industry leaders in a bipartisan call for national education standards in reading and math:  
Every State should adopt high national standards, and by 1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading and eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are met. President Clinton's national testing initiative offers a new opportunity to widely accept national benchmarks in reading and math against which States, school districts, and parents can judge student performance. 
Now, the proposal is completely voluntary. No student is required to take tests. Any student can opt out, any school can opt out, any State can opt out--a completely voluntary proposal. Then we had some amendments offered in the other body, the House of Representatives, an initiative, and some amendments here in the Senate, which I think will be withdrawn, that would prohibit any kind of national testing. So there has been discussion back and forth in recent days about, should we prohibit any kind of national testing? I think the answer to that should be no. 
We are proposing that the National Assessment Governing Board, called NAGB--a bipartisan, independent board--will oversee and ensure the integrity of these national tests. NAGB was established by Congress in 1989 to independently formulate policy guidelines for the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
I don't have any interest, again, in having the National or the Federal Government decide that we are going to, in any way, impose restrictions or arbitrary requirements on school districts across this country. That is not my interest. It is my interest to provide some leadership to see if we can't describe some kind of national achievement levels which we aspire to reach as a country. 
It is interesting. You go on a radio show, talk radio, these days--and it has been that way for some years now--and somebody calls in and talks about how any effort by anybody to test some sort of achievement level is some intrusive encroachment on education. I don't think that at all. As much as we spend on education, we ought to try to find out what we are getting for all of this. Where are we succeeding and where are we failing? That is what this initiative is all about. It is not an attempt to eclipse the powers, rights, or interests of local school boards. It is an attempt to see if we can't, all across this country, give parents more information about what they are getting for their education dollar and give school administrators and give other administrators who are interested in this an evaluation of where we are with respect to reading at the fourth grade level and mathematics at the eighth grade level, to see whether we are reaching the goals that we aspire to reach as a country. If we can't take that first baby step, if we don't have the opportunity or courage to take that step, then we are not in any way going to achieve the goals we have for this country's education in the years ahead. 
I thought this was going to be resolved last week, and I understand it is still ricocheting around the Chamber. If it's not resolved, I am inclined to offer a second-degree amendment to one of the first degrees that has been noticed, which would simply say that the National Assessment Governing Board would be the board that would be empowered to help provide this national testing. I want us to have an affirmative discussion and decision on this. I think that will be a very important thing for the Senate to say with respect to this appropriations bill because it is likely the appropriations bill coming to conference from the House side will say, in a negative way, that they don't want anything to do with this kind of national testing. 
So I came to the floor today to say that I thought this had been resolved last week, and it has not been. If it is not resolved soon, I would like to offer an amendment. Senator Bingaman has one noticed. If that is not offered, I will probably offer a second degree, and we should have a vote on this issue. This country can do better in education. One way to do that is to aspire to have a national evaluation of what we are getting and what our performance levels are at the fourth grade level for reading and at the eighth grade level for mathematics. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before I ask the question, I say I think the remarks by Senator Gorton are important and raise the right question. 
I would not suggest that we have some sort of aspiration for national testing that would in any way lower standards. We need to raise standards. It seems to me that the proposals that have been advanced, for example, with respect to the reading at the fourth grade level is one of these gateway activities. If you do not get through that fourth grade level and are able to read and go beyond, and you are beyond that and aren't able to read sufficiently, nothing else will come together in your educational career. That is the problem. That is why you need to measure on some of these gateway activities like reading at the fourth grade level and mathematics at the eighth grade level. 
The Senator from the State of Washington made a couple of important points. There are some good testing activities going on in some States. Some are terribly deficient. It is important to understand that, whether it is the National Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, or the technology firms in 
our country who are asking for this and who believe this is an essential part of understanding what we are getting from our educational system and how to fix it. They feel that we have a significant problem. And, in order to fix that problem, you need to figure out where you are, and where you go from that point to fix it. I share that feeling. 
I say to the Senator from Washington that the points he made are accurate. Isn't it the case, however, that we should be able to recognize the concern some people have about who would do the testing, or what kind of testing would be done? Shouldn't we be able to overcome those concerns by saying at least we aspire as a Nation to achieve some goals with respect to our children who are in the fourth grade and the eighth grade, and with respect to their meeting the mathematics skills? Shouldn't we be able to meet the concerns that the Senator from Washington expresses?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator to yield for one additional question, I come from a school where I was involved in a graduating class of nine. I come from a county that has 3,000 people. The community in which I grew up has 300 citizens. My high school class was a class of nine. That school district was educating the children in my school to go out into the workplace and to do things with the kind of background they gave us in a different time. And that school district still exists, and the school still exists. It is still a very small school. But now those children that are being educated in that school are going out into the marketplace in a different era. We are now involved in much different kinds of global competition in which we are competing against kids in Germany and Japan who are going to school 240 days a year. Our kids are going to school 180 days a year competing with respect to jobs and economic opportunity. And it is a much different world. That ought not suggest that we manage in any way our schools differently. The control and the authority and the payment for the schools ought to come from local government and local school districts and State governments. 
But the point that is made by the people in the technology area, by the chamber of commerce and elsewhere, is that we are involved in global competition, and our education system must produce the quality of education that meets that competition in order for this country to succeed and to achieve what we want to achieve in the future. 
That is why it is important for us to be discussing these issues. What are we getting for our education dollar? And are we achieving with our children proficient levels of mathematics in the fourth grade and education in the eighth grade, and how do we measure that?

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my support for the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation currently being considered by the Congress. 
I am cosponsoring the McCain-Feingold bill because I believe this Congress must address the issue of campaign finance reform. The American public and the people in my State of North Dakota are demanding that we clean up the system and that we clean it up now. Day after day, they read another story in the newspaper about the ever-increasing, and often unregulated, money flowing into campaigns, all the while seeing a Congress that appears unable or unwilling to tackle the problem. The time has come for us to do the job we were sent here to do and enact meaningful, comprehensive reform. 
Mr. President, the current system of electing Members of Congress is badly in need of reform. Elections are too long, too negative, and too expensive. Voter participation continues to drop to new lows, and far too often, the bulk of the debate the American public sees takes place in 30-second attack ads. And the costs of running for office are exploding. The average Senate race in 1996 cost $3.6 million. Twenty years ago, the average Senate race cost just $609,100. The cost of a race for the House of Representatives has increased sixfold over the last 20 years, from $99 million in 1976 to $626 million in 1996. 
Spending on Federal election campaigns increased to an estimated $2.7 billion in the most recent election cycle, a threefold increase over campaign spending just 20 years ago, even after adjusting for inflation. 
Even worse, the money is increasingly coming through channels designed to skirt the Federal Election Campaign Act. The use of soft money, which I call legalized cheating, has skyrocketed in the last 4 years. In the 1995-96 cycle, the two major parties spent $263 million in soft money, compared with $81 million in the 1993-94 cycle. That's an increase of 224 percent. 
Now, these contributions often come in very large amounts, and are clearly intended to have an impact on Federal elections even as they are designed to snake around the laws that are supposed to regulate Federal elections. So we have large chunks of money entering the system in ways that are largely unlimited, unregulated, and undisclosed. No wonder the American people think the system is broken. 
Just as our campaign law has been stretched to the breaking point in order to push more money into the system, the protections in current law have recently been handed a severe blow by the Supreme Court. As a result of a decision handed down last year, independent expenditures that aren't really independent can be spent and have a dramatic impact on elections without any notion of what the source of the money was. 
These, and many other areas of campaign spending cry out for reform and this Congress must address it now. 
McCain-Feingold is a strong step in the right direction, and I am pleased to serve as a cosponsor of the legislation, consistent with the changes the sponsors announced on May 22. It includes voluntary expenditure limits, with a variety of 
carrots and sticks to encourage candidates to comply. It tightens the definition of independent expenditure in ways that will help make sure the expenditures truly are independent. It will prohibit the national political parties from raising and spending soft money to influence Federal elections. And it makes a strong first step toward controlling soft money spent by outside groups on so-called issue advocacy. 
This last point is important, Mr. President, so I want to take a moment to elaborate. As currently defined under FEC regulations, only communications which use such words as `vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `defeat,' `reject,' or `Smith for Congress' are considered express advocacy which must be paid for with money raised in compliance with Federal election law, that is, hard money. 
This overly narrow definition of what constitutes express advocacy has created a giant loophole for attack ads. Simply by avoiding the magic words I mentioned above, corporations, unions, and other special interest groups can pay for brutal attack ads. Anyone who has seen some of these ads can tell they're intended to influence the outcome of Federal elections. And because they can be paid for with soft money, groups can raise money for them without limits, buy them in the millions of dollars, and never have to disclose what they're doing to the FEC. 
This is a critical part of the soft money puzzle, Mr. President, and McCain-Feingold takes strong steps to remedy it. Far from limiting discussion of the issues as some of its critics would suggest, this provision simply says that if an ad is meant to influence a Federal election, it should be paid for with money raised under the purview of Federal election law. It's simple common sense, and it's a badly needed, and long overdue, reform. 
Now, I admit, there are several provisions in the McCain-Feingold bill that I would write differently and that I hope we might change along the way. I'd like to add a provision that provides that the lowest television rate for political advertising will apply only to commercials which are at least 1-minute in length and in which the candidate appears 75 percent of the time. The 30-second political attack ad does little, if anything, to inform the public about the issues and advance the debate. And by appearing in the commercials, candidates will be more accountable for the ads and will likely be more responsible about their content. When selecting their leaders, the American people deserve better than a `hit and run' debate. 
I would also like to add provisions with greater inducements for candidates to participate in the voluntary spending limit system, and with greater penalties if they choose not to, in order to virtually require people to adopt the limits for their campaigns. I would like to encourage more participation in the process by ordinary citizens by restoring an annual 100 percent tax credit for the first $100 of contributions to congressional campaigns. And I would like to see some changes in the provisions dealing with political action committees as well. 
But having said that, I think this is a worthy campaign finance reform proposal and I am going to fight hard for it. I want to get it passed, and get it signed by the President. The American people demand and deserve no less from us.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. I listened with interest to the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader. I think it is important to point out that there is no intention that I am aware of on this floor to interrupt the business of appropriations bills. The principal business in this month of September is to finish, and work hard on, the appropriations bills; by the end of September, have them down to the White House, so the President can sign them and avoid a continuing resolution. So we want to do that, and there is no objection that I am aware of, made by anyone, which would interrupt in any way the conduct of business on appropriations bills. 
The Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, knows there is great concern about the issue of a contested election in Louisiana, by which a Member of the Senate was seated without prejudice and an investigation was begun. The conduct of that investigation causes some significant concern here in the Senate. It is not December, it is not January, February, March, or April; it is September, and we have a Member of the Senate who is still seated in this Senate, seeing activities of a committee on an investigation in which allegations of fraud were made. And I might say that the committee hired a couple of investigators, lawyers--a Republican and a Democrat--and the first report they gave to the committee was to say there is nothing there. But that was not enough. 
I am not going to go into what is going on in the committee. I don't think we need to have that discussion. But, you know, it is September. It's September, and we have a Member of the U.S. Senate who is still held in limbo, here, on this issue of investigation. I saw yesterday newspaper after newspaper after newspaper in Louisiana, the editorials and stories say, `There is nothing here. Let this go. Stop this investigation.' 
So, you know, the concern that some exhibit on the floor of the Senate about this issue is not without foundation. The Senator from Mississippi points out that he is concerned about delay. I don't think any of us want a delay.

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, he clearly should and will not be surprised at concern expressed now in September about this issue. Those concerns were registered in July and early August, and the Senator understands that we have a Senator from Louisiana whose election is still being contested, and it is now September. I just want to, if I might, just show you some of what is happening in Louisiana in the press: 
`When will investigation end? Voters might not be happy with prolonged debate.' 
`Poll: State's voters believe Landrieu probe unnecessary.' 
`Enough's enough,' an editorial in the Times-Picayune. 
`Senate investigation will hurt Louisiana.' 
`No evidence of widespread fraud.' 
It is September, and there is no demonstration of any kind that I am aware of that any irregularities existed in that election that would in any way overturn the results of the election, and yet we still have what I think is a concerted effort by some to drag this out and drag it out and drag it out.

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one more comment, the issue of delay applies especially and indelibly to the issue of the investigation in Louisiana, and delay, it seems to me, continued delay is unfair to Senator Landrieu and unfair to the people of Louisiana. It is not our intent to cause problems for the Senator from Mississippi in the scheduling of the Senate. I understand it is not easy to be involved in running this place. So it is not our intention to cause those kinds of problems. That is especially why----

Mr. DORGAN. You actually act like you are enjoying it. We have done a lot. This has been a pretty productive year, but at least a good number on our side say with respect to delay, one of the delays that occurs now in the Senate is the delay on this investigation and the end of the investigation, and the investigation has found nothing on the issue of this contested Senate election. We hope that we will get beyond that and get on with the business and not have that hanging over the head of Senator Landrieu or the people of Louisiana. 
So our point is this: Let's continue with the Senate business. Let's pass these appropriations bills, get them to the President, get them signed. That is the regular order. Let's also resolve this issue with the Louisiana election. It is now September. It is not March or April or July. It is September, and it is long past the time when that should have been resolved.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Pennsylvania allowing me to offer this amendment at this time. I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa for their work on this legislation. I am going to talk just a bit about my amendment. Before I do, however, let me commend both Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for the work they have done on this piece of legislation. 
My amendment specifically deals with funding for the National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and specifically an interest I have in trying to provide additional resources for NHLBI to be used to provide funding vitally needed for cardiovascular disease research. 
I am proposing $8 million be added to the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute that I hope would be used for that purpose. The offset is from a corresponding reduction in the NIH buildings and facilities account. I believe that both the chairman and the ranking member, at the conclusion of my comments, will accept this amendment and for that I am grateful. 
It is undoubtedly true, as people watch the proceedings of the U.S. Senate, that many of us come to the floor of the Senate to talk about legislation that we think is necessary based on our personal experiences and observations. That has certainly been true with respect to a couple of issues I have worked on, including cardiovascular disease research. 
Madam President, I have a very personal interest in this, as others do. I have lost a daughter to heart disease. I have another daughter who has a heart defect that we hope, God willing, will not need surgery in the future. But I have spent enough time in cardiologists' offices and I have spent enough time talking about cardiovascular disease to understand that we must continue to substantially increase funding for research on cardiovascular disease. 
I have been involved, along with Senator Frist, as a Senate cochair of the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition to try to provide additional attention to the issue of heart disease and stroke and the need for greater research into these diseases. 
Many Americans are unaware of the extent and scope of heart disease and stroke, even though virtually all of us has a friend or loved one who has been affected by cardiovascular disease, so I would like to share some startling facts. 
Heart disease has been this country's No. 1 killer since 1919 for both men and women. 
Stroke continues to be the No. 3 killer in this country and the leading cause of disability in America. 
One in five Americans, more than 57 million people, suffer from one or more types of cardiovascular disease, including close to 14 million living with symptomatic coronary heart disease. 
One in two women will eventually die of heart disease or stroke. 
About one-sixth of cardiovascular disease deaths are among people under the age of 65. 
In 1979 there were 1.2 million cardiovascular operations and procedures performed in this country. That number climbed to 4.65 million in 1994, close to a fourfold increase. 
The number of Americans suffering from congestive heart failure has grown to about 5 million, with hospital discharges rising from 377,000 in 1979 to 874,000 in 1994. 
More Americans die from heart attack and stroke each year than from AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. Let me repeat that because I think it is important. More Americans die from heart attack and stroke each year than from AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. 
I do not come to the floor of the Senate to in any way suggest that we ought to enhance research funding on one disease at the expense of critically needed research funding for others. I have supported substantial research for AIDS, supported efforts to improve research and treatment of diabetes and cancer. In fact, I have supported a substantial increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health and I voted earlier this year to double funding for the National Institutes of Health over the next five years. I think this would be a wonderful investment for our country. 
I have become increasingly concerned, however, with what has been happening with respect to the amount of money spent on heart disease research. Even with the significant increases that Congress has been giving the National Institutes of Health over the past decade, funding for heart disease research specifically has simply not kept pace. In fact, heart disease research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has decreased by 4.8 percent in constant dollars over the last decade, while the NIH overall budget has increased by 31 percent in constant dollars. 
A step toward rectifying this concern was taken this year. For that I commend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin. They have provided in this bill a $99.4 million increase for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the third largest dollar increase among the NIH institutes. But even with this increase, if we look beyond the surface, we can see that, without my amendment, the funding for cardiovascular disease research would continue to decrease relative to the overall budget. 
The $8 million that my amendment would add would bring the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute budget up to the same 7.5-percent level of increase as the overall budget at the National Institutes of Health. It is my hope that this funding would be devoted to cardiovascular disease research. 
It is interesting to visit the Bethesda campus of the National Institutes of Health. I encourage my colleagues to do so. There are wonderful men and women working there doing remarkable, breathtaking research on a wide range of issues. I have talked to physicians doing research in the area of cardiovascular disease and what they are doing is remarkable. It has already saved lives and can save even more lives with additional resources. 
We now routinely see people with advanced heart disease with symptoms that in previous decades would have caused death. Today, these patients are able to undergo procedures and operations that allow them to continue to lead productive, active lives. These advances are the wonderful result of an investment in research. 
We can do much, much more. 
I said I don't want to decrease research funding for other diseases. In fact, I would like to substantially increase the amount of funding for the NIH generally, far above its current level, because I think the rewards for the people in our country and around the world would be substantial. 
It should be noted, however, that heart disease and stroke receive one-twentieth of the research funding per death of AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. Now if you divide the amount spent on research into the number of people who are dying from various diseases, it is clear that the amount of research funding invested in cardiovascular disease is not keeping pace. That is why I offer this amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is my hope that in some small way, with this small step, a researcher will now unlock one more mystery of how the human heart works. 
I mentioned the wonderful discoveries that are made through research and the wonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in the area of cardiology, and yet there is so much we still do not know. Those of us who have waited through heart surgery with members of our family know that when you talk to the cardiovascular surgeons they will tell you that there are times when they simply don't know what has caused this or that condition. 
It seems to me more and more research can unlock those mysteries and give us the opportunity to save more and more lives in this country that otherwise would be lost to this insidious enemy called heart disease. 
With that, I thank very much the chairman and the ranking member and ask that my amendment be favorably considered. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I expect we will have a rather spirited debate about this amendment, and we should have. I think this is an interesting, timely, and important subject for the Senate at this point. My understanding is that there will be lengthy debate and a hearing in the Senate tomorrow morning, followed by a vote tomorrow on this subject. 
This debate is not about developing some sort of enforced Federal standard. Rather, this is a very important question about this country's educational system and whether parents, no matter where they live, have an opportunity and the ability to measure how well their children are doing at two levels. Can they read at the fourth-grade level, and how do they read relative to other kids in this country, and can they achieve basic proficiency in mathematics at the eighth-grade level? 
We have some significant choices to make in this country on the subject of education. No one that I know of suggests that we wrest the control of educating our kids in the elementary and secondary schools from the local school boards. No one. That is where we make decisions about how to educate our kids. But we do as a country have an obligation, I think, to begin asking the question: Should we not have some basic standard of measurement to find out what our children are achieving in our schools to be able to measure community to community, school to school, State to State? How are they doing? Are they able to read at the fourth grade level? Are they proficient in mathematics at the eighth grade level? 
I want to read a couple of comments as we begin. 
Jim Barksdale, the CEO and president of Netscape Communications, one of the new communications companies in our country, and L. John Doerr, a partner in the firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, on behalf of 240 technology industry leaders in a bipartisan call for high national education standards in reading and math, say this: 
Every State should adopt high national standards, and by 1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading and eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are met. President Clinton's national testing initiative offers a new opportunity to use widely accepted national benchmarks in reading and math against which States, school districts, and parents can judge student performance. 
This national testing initiative is not about suggesting a national or Federal system by which anyone from up here can control someone down there. 
The Senator from New Hampshire, I think, began by saying he was not opposed to developing some kind of national testing program. I think from that statement we ought to be able to find a way to develop a program of achievement standards. I am not wedded to the notion that it be here or there or with this money or that money. I am wedded to the notion that this country deserves to know what it is getting for the money it is spending for elementary and secondary education. 
We spend a substantial amount of money sending our children to school. A substantial amount of money is spent sending our children into the classrooms of our country. The question is, what are we getting for that? What are we achieving? What kind of accomplishments exist at the fourth grade level? Are our fourth graders able to read? In which schools? In which States? And if not, why not? Before one can embark on a plan to improve education, you must first know where you are. And we don't have a basic approach by which we can measure achievement. 
You get to 17 or 18 years of age, and guess what? You want to go to college. You are going to show up someplace, and you are going to have to take a test. That test is going to measure what you have achieved, what you know, what you have studied, and what you have retained from that. So when you get to be 17 or 18 and begin to take the college entrance tests, then at that point somebody is going to measure what you have been given, what you have learned, and what you are prepared to do. But by that point, we have spent a substantial amount of money. 
Why don't we decide, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and literally hundreds of other business leaders in this country have, that we ought to get more for our education system by measuring whether our students, student to student and school to school and State to State, are reaching certain levels of achievement? 
I am a parent. I have two little children sitting this afternoon in a public school classroom. They are the most wonderful kids in the world. I assume that every father would say that about their children. I want those children to have the best possible education that our school system can give them. But I, as one parent, believe that it is important for us to measure as we go along what our children have learned from that school system. 
Things have changed. This is not 40 years ago when we as a country could tie one hand behind our back and beat anybody else in the world at almost anything, and do it easily. We now face shrewd, tough international competition in every direction that we look. We now face competition, yes, in the job market, yes, in our economies, in our schools, and we face competition with countries who send their kids to school 240 days a year. We send our kids to school 180 days a year. 
You have seen and I have seen some of the comparisons of students in the United States with students from Japan, students from Korea, students from Jordan, and students from around the world. 
What the business leaders in this country, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, technology industry leaders, and others, including education leaders, are saying, is let us find a way by which we establish a measurement of achievement, by which we aspire to a goal that says that by the fourth grade children ought to be able to read competently, and let's measure to make sure that our school system makes that happen so that by the eighth grade they have certain proficiency in math. That is what this is about. 
From the discussion I just heard--I expect there will be a lot of it today--the issue is, should there be a Federal mandate by a Federal agency that federally enforces some Federal test? No, of course not. No one has proposed that. I would not support that. 
If you say, however, that with the money we spend for education, we ought to measure the output as taxpayers, and as parents we ought to find out what are we getting, if you say that ought to be the goal--it is my goal, I expect it is probably your goal--then let's find a way to do that. Parents have a right to know whether their kids have mastered the basics in education, no matter what State they live in, no matter what city or school district they live in. 
Those in this country who are concerned about our education system know that we must make some improvements. How do we make improvements? You create a blueprint, a plan, or a design for how you fix what is wrong. But before you can do that, you must assess what you have. What are the achievement levels? What are you getting for what you are now spending? That is what this is about. 
I think that the debate--I guess I shouldn't prejudge; I will listen to it--will not be so much about whether it is useful for parents to learn how their kids or how their schools stack up against other kids or other schools in other cities or in other States. I think the debate will not be about that because I would expect most parents and taxpayers would want that kind of information. 
Incidentally, this effort to develop tests to measure achievement is all voluntary. There is nothing here that is mandatory. Any school can opt out. Any student can opt out. Any State can opt out. 
If there is heartburn over the question of who develops these benchmarks, let us find agreement on some independent entity that would establish appropriate goals for ourselves and for our children. 
Occasionally, I--as I am sure everybody in the Senate does--get on a radio call-in show. Inevitably, someone will call in and say, `This is some one-world international conspiracy. This is the Federal Government wanting to run the local school system.' You have heard all of the debate about all of these issues. In fact, going back, that became the argument that was used to say, `Let's get rid of the Department of Education at the Federal level.' We do not hear much about that anymore. I don't expect we will see an amendment about that, although there may be Members in the Chamber who believe that we should offer that amendment and have that debate. 
Does education reach a level of national importance sufficiently so that we have a Department of Education? I think so. Most of the American people think so. But we have had in the not-too-distant past those who say, `Let's abolish the Department of Education. What on Earth should we be doing thinking nationally about education?' Well, the American people know what we should be doing nationally about education. It is not running the school systems--not at all. What we should be doing nationally is worrying about whether we as a country are able to measure achievement--basic achievement in a range of areas, especially reading and mathematics, sufficient so that our students are prepared to be everything they can possibly be. Achievement that allows them to contribute not only to themselves but to this country, and to help us compete internationally. That is what all of this is about. 
We are faced with tougher and tougher tests as a country. We are faced with a changing world economy and global markets. Companies these days are not national companies. They are international conglomerates. They want to produce where it is cheaper to produce. They want to go wherever they can find the skilled labor at the least cost, and so on. So it is tougher competitively for us than it was before. That is why our education system is so much more important now than it was. That is why it is so important that the education system work well. It is important that we as parents have information with which to measure what we are getting from this education system. 
So let me, so that no one misinterprets what I have just said, say it again. I think parents and taxpayers have every reason to believe that we ought to be able to measure what we are getting from our education system student to student, school to school, school district to school district, or State to State. We ought to be able to measure that. The first standard ought not be when you reach 18 decide to take a test to go to college. But the development of achievement standards ought not be confused with some of the discussion about a Federal agency developing a federally enforced standard that they will use to mandate Federal policy for local education. That is totally hogwash. That is not what this effort is about. 
I will be interested in listening to the later debate because my hope is that through this discussion perhaps we can find common ground to say, Yes, let's aspire to some achievement levels that we can measure across this country in order to better prepare our children for the future. If you measure achievement levels, you know how your children are doing relevant to other children; you know how your schools are doing; you know how your teachers are doing. If we aspire to do that and have the tools that give parents the ability to better manage the school, to better help their children, then we will be better off as a country. If that is a goal--and I hope it is--then we should be able to find a way to cooperate in reaching that goal through the development of some kind of entity that does not impose the specter of Federal control over local schools, because that is not the desire at all. 
The proposal originally by the President was a proposal for a voluntary system in which any State, any school, or any student can opt out. But even if that causes heartburn because it has the specter of a Federal entity creating the tests, then let us find a method by which we create that same kind of measurement and give parents the same kind of opportunity without inciting the fear that some would ascribe to it as representing a Federal initiative. We can do that. I think we can do that. 
But we cannot do that if we stand up and mischaracterize the initiative in the first place. This is not about Federal control and a federally enforced test and Federal usurpation of local prerogatives with respect to education. 
Having given that initial discussion, I will anxiously listen to the debate by two of the Members for whom I have the greatest respect. I think both are bright and interesting people who have contributed a great deal to this Senate, and while we might disagree on this, the purpose of my standing up is that my hope is perhaps we can find an area of agreement. Both of my colleagues are parents. I think they probably want the same output here that I want from this system, the best possible education our schools can give our children and along the way as parents the best opportunity to measure how our kids are doing and how our schools are doing. If we have those opportunities, we will improve not only our children's future but the future of this country. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I noted in a news report recently something which I have heard previously. The news reported that President Clinton and his administration will in just a matter of days from now, on September 10, send a legislative proposal to give President Clinton and this administration something called fast track trade authority. 
Now, that might sound like a foreign language to a lot of folks, but the notion of fast track trade authority is relatively simple. It is that trade negotiators shall negotiate trade agreements between the United States and other countries, then bring these trade agreements to the Congress, and they shall be considered in Congress under something called fast track procedures. That means no one here in the Congress is allowed to or will be able to offer amendments to alter that proposed trade agreement. 
That is what fast track means. It is a special deal for a trade agreement brought back to Congress so that all Members of Congress are prevented from offering amendments. Members of Congress will be allowed only to vote yes or no on the entire agreement. 
The Constitution of the United States in article I, section 8 says, `The Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.' 
Yet, in recent decades we have developed this notion of fast track trade authority that has given both Republican and Democrat Presidents the opportunity to bring trade agreements to the Congress under a procedure that handcuffs Members of Congress and prevents them from offering any amendments at any time. 
I want to share why I think this is important and why I believe it is inappropriate to grant fast track trade authority to this administration. I should say that when I was in the House of Representatives, I led an effort in the Chamber of the House to prevent fast track trade authority being given to a previous administration as well. 
The Washington Post, in an article written by Ann Devroy, titled `Battle Lines Forming Over Clinton's Bid for Fast Track Trade Powers,' states the Business Roundtable, among others, will work to help President Clinton get these fast track procedures in place by getting Congress to pass a proposal to give the President fast track powers. `The job won't be easy,' it says. 
It reports that the Business Roundtable has written in a letter to its members, `The political climate for new trade agreements is not good. Organized labor, human rights groups, protectionists, isolationists and environmentalists are questioning the benefits of trade.' 
Now, I guess I don't fit any of these descriptions. I am not an isolationist. I am not a member of organized labor. I am not a member of a human rights group. I am not a protectionist. I am not a member of some environmental organization. I am not some xenophobe, and I am not someone from a small town who cannot see over the horizon. I studied a little economics. I even taught a little economics in college. I understand something about the trade issue. 
I understand that in international trade this country is not moving forward; it is falling back. We are not winning; we are losing. We ought not proceed to develop new trade agreements until we solve the problems of the old trade agreements. And I want to recite a few of those problems. 
This was an interesting article written by a journalist who is a very good journalist. But nowhere in this article in talking about trade authority--and this is the difficulty we have in this Chamber--does it point out that we will have the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country. Nowhere does it point that out. How can you have a discussion of trade and fail to mention in the context of that discussion that we now suffer the largest trade deficit in the history of our country? 
I don't understand that. This is not theory. It is not some academic discussion. It is a discussion about whether we are going to proceed to give this administration the ability to have fast track authority for a new trade agreement they or trade agreements they will negotiate, and bring them to Congress and tie our hands so that no amendments may be offered. 
Some do not mind, I suppose, that we have the largest merchandise trade deficit in history. They say trade is trade. In fact, this article quotes the Business Roundtable as saying, `Those who oppose this question the benefit of trade.' 
What a lot of nonsense that is. I don't question the benefit of trade. In fact, much of what we produce in my State, an agricultural State, must find a foreign home. I understand the benefits of trade. I also understand the benefits of trade that is fair and the benefits of trade relationships with other countries that are fair trade relationships. I also understand about being taken advantage of. I also understand about trade policies that have been more foreign policy than trade policy over the last half century. 
For the first 25 years following the Second World War, our trade policy was foreign policy. It had very little to do with trade. The fact was that this country was bigger, better, stronger and could outtrade and outproduce almost any other country in the world with one hand tied behind its back. So we could afford to exercise a foreign policy disguised as trade policy with dozens of our trading allies and still prevail. And it was just fine, at least in the first 25 years following the Second World War. 
During those first 25 years, incomes in this country continued to rise. However, in the second 25 years, we ran into some very shrewd, tough international competitors and it has not been as easy for us to compete unless the trade rules are fair. Unfortunately, the trade rules have not been fair because we have continued to negotiate trade agreements that are more foreign policy than trade policy. As a result we have trade agreements that are fundamentally unfair to American workers and American producers. I want to go through a few of these in this discussion. 
The first chart that I want to show is a chart about the merchandise trade deficit in our country. Nobody seems to care much about it here in the Congress. You don't hear people talking about it. There is always this angst about the budget deficit, and we have worked on that and finally have our fiscal house in some order. But there is no discussion at all about the other deficit, the merchandise trade deficit, which is a sea of red ink and growing every single year. In fact, we had the largest merchandise trade deficit in American history last year, and we are most likely going to exceed that this year. We have had deficit after deficit after deficit. There have been 21 straight years of merchandise trade deficits. 
Let me just describe what has happened following our trade agreements. We rush off and send our best negotiators to negotiate trade agreements. When they finish negotiating some agreement with some country, whether it be Japan or the GATT agreement or NAFTA or some other agreement, they have a huge celebration or giant feast at which they all declare they have won. 
But, what have our negotiators actually won? We had a $28 billion merchandise trade deficit in 1981 when the trade agreement took effect from the Tokyo round of trade talks. By 1989, this Congress passed--without my vote, I might add--a United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, at which time we now had a $115 billion merchandise trade deficit. 
In 1994, a trade agreement, negotiated under fast track with Mexico and Canada, called NAFTA or the North American Free-Trade Agreement came into effect. By that time, we had amassed a $166 billion merchandise trade deficit. Then there was the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or GATT, and the trade agreement enacted by Congress which took effect January 1, 1995. By that time, we had a $173 billion merchandise trade deficit. That has now grown to a $191 billion merchandise trade deficit, and is continuing to grow again this year. 
DRI and McGraw-Hill, which is a company that does econometric projections, suggests our merchandise trade deficit will likely double in a 10-year period. We are headed in the wrong direction, not the right direction. So the question is, Do we continue doing this? Or does somebody stand up and say, `Wait a second, this doesn't make any sense. You are asking us to give fast track trade authority to negotiate another trade agreement when all we have seen is an ocean of merchandise trade deficits.' 
With this discussion, I am not suggesting that we ought not trade. Of course we should trade. But we ought to say to our trading allies that the conditions under which we trade with them must represent fair trade. If you get your products into our marketplace, that's fine. But, then we expect our products to get into your marketplace. If we have standards that will not allow our producers to pollute our air and water, then we expect you to produce under the same standards. 
If we have standards that say we can't hire a 14-year-old and have him work 14 hours a day and pay him 14 cents an hour to produce a product that we then ship to Pittsburgh or Los Angeles and Denver, then we expect you not to employ a 14-year-old and pay him 14 cents an hour, producing something you ship to those same cities. Those are the conditions under which our workers, our citizens, and our businesses ought to expect trade to be handled under our trade agreements. 
Now, when you look at this ocean of red ink which no one writes about and no one talks about, it seems to me it is time to stop to evaluate where we are. Daniel Webster said, on the floor of this Senate about 160 years ago, `When the mariner has been tossed for many days in thick weather and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the first pause in the storm, the earliest glance at the Sun, to take his latitude and ascertain how far the elements have driven him from his true course.' That might be a good suggestion for this Congress on the issue of trade. 
Instead, what this Congress will debate, without even talking about this choking trade debt, will be fast track. 
There is fast food, fast lane, fast living, fast talk, and fast break. I remember when I played high school basketball the notion of a fast break was to move quickly and rush and get ahead of the defenders before they could get set up and make the basket. That's what a fast break is all about. You go ahead, before anybody notices you, and score your points. 
Everything that says fast somehow connotes lack of preparation. That certainly has been the case with fast track in trade. Anyone, I say, anybody who believes that we have been successful in representing the economic interests of this country in pursuing the kind of process we pursued in recent years in trade just is not looking at the same set of facts that exists for this presentation I am giving today. 
Madam President, the instant you discuss these issues there are those in this town who categorize you in one of two camps. You are described as a free trader, period, end of story. This connotes, by the way, that you support all of these negotiations and fast track and so on. You are either a free trader, or you are some kind of xenophobic, isolationist stooge who doesn't get it and are called a basic protectionist. Those are the two camps. You are one or the other, and you can't be in between because there is no thoughtfulness in between, we are told. 
I stand right square in the middle of this issue, saying that this country has a problem and we ought to deal with it. We ought not be talking about negotiating new trade agreements as long as we have vexing, difficult problems with old trade agreements that we refuse to deal with. Fast track--if we are going to fast track anything, let's fast track the efforts to solve old trade problems. 
We negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico. At the time, we had a nearly $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Guess what? It has not been very long--only 3 years later--and we have ended up with nearly a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico. We go from a small surplus, to a big deficit. 
We negotiate a trade agreement with Mexico and we are told what is going to come into this country from Mexico will be the product of low-skill and low-wage work. 
What is actually coming in from Mexico? Automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics parts. Do you know we now import more cars from Mexico into the United States than the United States exports to the rest of the entire world? Think of that. 
Has the United States-Mexico, has the NAFTA agreement worked out the way we expected? I would like one person to come to this Senate and say, `Boy, this really worked out well. What we wanted was to have an agreement with Canada and Mexico positioned such that at end of it, we would have a combined trade deficit of nearly $40 billion.' Is that what we wanted? I don't think so. 
At the root of all of this, whether it's with Mexico or Canada is our past agreements and the fast track process that wouldn't allow the agreements to be changed and corrected. As a result we have a severe problem with Canadian grain flooding across our border in a fundamentally unfair way. 
And by the way, we can't resolve these issues now because we pulled the teeth of our own trade laws in all these trade agreements. We have pulled the teeth of those provisions which could have been effective in representing us and in remedying these problems. And now that the teeth are pulled, we wonder why we can't chew on these issues. You can't chew because there is no effective remedy left. 
Does anybody think that this represents progress? Is it progress to have Mexico and Canada have a huge trade surplus with the United States? Is it progress that we have this deficit with them? 
China has a large and growing trade deficit, which has been growing exponentially. In a dozen years it has grown from $10 million up to over $40 billion. How about Japan? Every single year, we have had a recurring trade deficit of $48 billion to over $50 billion a year. 
What does all of that represent? It represents jobs. And it represents, by and large, a diminution of our manufacturing sector. No economy will long remain a strong economy if it doesn't retain a strong manufacturing base. 
There are those who believe it doesn't matter where you produce. Get in your Lear jet or get in your Gulfstream and travel around the world. Look out the window and find out where on this Earth, what patch of ground can you find where you can build a plant and have people come in the front door of that plant and pay them a quarter an hour, a half a dollar an hour, or 75 cents an hour. Pay them no benefits, no pensions, no insurance, and pollute the air and water as you produce because that represents profit and that represents progress. Not to me it doesn't. Not to this country it doesn't. 
The consideration of fast-track trade authority by this Congress ought, it seems to me, to persuade us finally to ask ourselves, what truly is progress in international trade? Do we really think that a trade picture that looks like this is progress? 
Six countries have 92 percent of our record level merchandise trade deficit. Nearly 30 percent of the trade deficit is with Japan. It is 24 percent and growing with China. Canada and Mexico together, have another 24 percent. The latest figures show that NAFTA, the crown jewel of trade agreements has produced a record nearly $40 billion combined trade deficit. Do we really think that those kinds of numbers represent progress? 
This is not working. It is not a case of this country saying we want to close our borders and shut off imports; it's a case of this country saying we expect the trade rules to be fair. We expect our negotiators who negotiate trade agreements to win from time to time. Should we expect that every time our trade negotiators run off someplace that they lose? I don't think so. Yet, that is what happened. 
We have a beef agreement with Japan. Nobody knows much about these things, because all this is like a foreign language. We have an avalanche of Japanese goods coming into America. I do not object to that. All I ask is that American goods get into Japan on a fair basis. 
We couldn't get much American beef into Japan, so we had a huge negotiation with the Japanese. It must have been 8, 10 years ago, by now, that they announced this breakthrough. You would have thought there was a national day of fiesta and rejoicing. It was a major breakthrough; a big beef agreement with Japan. Guess what the agreement was. We have such a low expectation of our trade negotiations. 
The agreement with Japan was the following: When the agreement is fully phased in, there will remain only a 50-percent tariff on American beef going into Japan. That tariff will be reduced, except if the quantity increases, it snaps back to 50 percent. Under any other set of circumstances, that would be defined as failure, but it was defined in our negotiations with Japan as a success. That is true with virtually every single set of negotiations this country has been involved in the last two decades. 
This is not a complaint about Republicans or Democrats. It's a complaint against both and all. I have not yet met anyone who is willing to look me in the eye and talk about the facts about the merchandise trade deficits in this country and have them tell me that this is a record they want to stand on. 
My hope is that in the coming couple of weeks, as we discuss the issue of fast-track trade authority, we might finally have the debate we really need. We don't want a thoughtless debate about `this person is a protectionist' and `this person is a free trader.' Rather we need a thoughtful debate about precisely what kind of trade agreements represent this country's real interests, what kind of trade agreements require us to compete internationally and compete effectively and fairly, and what kind of trade agreements make certain that this country, when it does compete in the international marketplace, is able to do so on an even and fair basis. 
Madam President, it is obvious, I suppose, that I will be aggressively opposing the fast-track authority that this President will request. If he, on September 10, makes a formal request, he will no doubt have substantial support for it. I have had several people come up to me in my State who said to me, `Oh, by the way, Byron, I was supposed to tell you to vote for fast track because my company sent out a memo to all the employees saying, `We want you all to contact your Senator to vote for fast track.' I don't know about fast track,' they said, `but that is something my company wants you to vote for.' 
I am not going to support fast track. I will be on the floor of the Senate often to talk about what I think are the problems in international trade and what I think are our priorities. 
We have massive problems with Canada, for example, on grain trade. The responsibility that we have is not to create some fast-track procedure for new agreements, but to create a fast-track determination to solve old trade problems from previous agreements that do not work. 
Until trade negotiators demonstrate a willingness to do that, and until this administration demonstrates a willingness to do that, I do not think it ought to get the vote of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House for a peculiar and unique authority called fasttrack that, in my judgment, undercuts the constitutional requirement of Congress, to regulate commerce. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may consume of the time allocated to our side. 
I come to the floor today to say I intend to vote for this conference report and am pleased with the work that has been done in the Congress, and especially the work that has been done by so many people who invested so many hours to try to do the right thing. 
The Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, has disproved the old adage about what a committee is, which is: A group of the unwilling chosen from the unfit to do the unnecessary. This committee, under this chairman's leadership, and the men and women from the Republican and Democratic caucus who were assigned to that committee, I think have done some very substantial work that will engender a substantial vote in the U.S. Senate, a bipartisan vote. I am glad to stand on the floor in this circumstance and say, finally, we have reached a point where both parties have come together to say that we fashioned something that we think will work for this country. 
We have a very different view of how we got here. I heard some remarks earlier. Some of that is probably typical and traditional rhetorical comments from both sides about where we have been and where we are going. I can remember 4 years ago on the floor of this Chamber when the deficit was going up, up, up and out of control, following a decade in which the description by the new economic guru to previous administrations was, `Well, let's double defense, cut taxes and things will be just peachy.' Defense spending doubled, taxes were cut, and we nearly choked on deficits in this country. 
We came to an intersection in 1993, 4 years ago, with a new President and a Congress, and this President said, `Let's take a hunk out of that deficit and tackle that Federal deficit,' and we voted for it and did it by one vote--one vote. 
I can recall the cries of alarm on the floor of the Senate: 
`You're going to throw this country into a recession.' 
`You're going to ruin this country's economy.' 
No, we didn't do that. We were willing to stand up and vote for harsh medicine to say this fiscal policy has been out of control, we need to get it back into control and play no more games. We cut some spending, we increased some taxes, yes, and we cut this deficit down, down, down and down, and guess what happened as a result of it? Unemployment plummeted. More people are working, inflation is down, the deficit is down, the economy is growing, and it is a better place because of it, and only because we are standing on the shoulders of those in 1993 who cast that vote, some of whom are not here, because we took a clobbering for that medicine in 1993. Only because of that tough decision are we now able to do the rest of the work and say to the American people, this country is moving ahead, moving in the right direction, and economic growth is sufficient so that now we can provide some tax cuts, as well as some spending cuts, and not only tackle the rest of the budget deficit problem, but also provide some much-needed relief to overburdened American families. 
Carl Sandburg said once:  
I see America not in the setting Sun of a black night of despair ahead of us, I see America in the crimson light of a rising Sun, fresh from the burning creative hand of God. I see great days ahead, great days possible to men and women of will and vision. 
My attitude about where we are in this country is we are headed in the right direction. As I said, unemployment is down, jobs are up, crime is down, the country is growing. Is everything perfect? No, not at all. We have a lot of changes ahead of us. Is everything in this bill perfect? No. If I had written it, I would have made some changes. But have we come together at this juncture, together with a Democratic and Republican Party, a Democratic President, a Republican Congress, men and women of both parties to do something that is good? Yes, I think so. 
In this legislation, today we say to the American people we think education is critically important and we are going to not only invest in education in the bill we passed yesterday, we are going to provide significant new tax cuts to relieve the tax burden on families who are sending their kids to college. The effort that is made in this piece of legislation to value education is critically important because this country's future is in educating its kids. 
Yesterday, we talked about expanding Head Start to a million new American children. That is a significant achievement. 
Today, we say that families--45 million children in this country--will receive ultimately a $500-per-child tax credit, which I think will be a significant benefit to American families. 
In addition to the significant achievements in education and the significant achievements in investing in jobs and other things, inducing savings and the things that, I think, have great merit for the future of this country, this legislation provides some specific things I want to mention just very briefly. 
One, there has been a lot of controversy about estate tax reform. People say if you provide estate tax reform, that affects a small slice of people with an enormous amount of income. I come from a part of the country that is sparsely populated and losing population. My home county has 3,000 people living in an area the size of the State of Rhode Island. It used to be 5,000, but people are moving and leaving many rural areas. I want to do everything I can to encourage every family business and every family farm to be passed from parents to children, to keep operating and keep open and stay there in rural America, and this estate tax provision is going to be enormously helpful in doing that. 
I might say that one other piece of good news in this legislation is parochial, but important, to people of South Dakota and North Dakota, Minnesota, and other disaster victims around the country. There is in this legislation several provisions that I had asked be put in that are going to be helpful to disaster victims. There are a number of provisions that say, because of disasters you are unable to file your tax return, and the IRS extends the time in which you are able to file a return--the IRS said, `We'll do that, but we still must charge interest'--this waives the interest for taxpayers who were not able to file a tax return because their house and all their records are down the river someplace in a massive flood. That is a tiny little issue, but important, and I am very pleased that it was put in this piece of legislation. 
The folks who were victims of blizzard after blizzard after blizzard in the Dakotas, Montana, in our part of the country, who had to sell cattle because they had no feed and now are going to restore their herd, this piece of legislation says you are not going to have to pay capital gains tax on the herd that you sold. 
This piece of legislation has a very important benefit to livestock producers who were victims of the disaster in our part of the country. It overturns an IRS ruling, a tiny little thing, but it is going to affect tens of thousands of farmers. The IRS took a position a while back on what are called deferred contract sales that farmers have made routinely for years and years at the country elevator, that they were going to be taxable under certain circumstances. We have no idea where the IRS came up with that interpretation. It is completely wrong. They had no basis for doing that. 
This legislation says to the IRS that you can't do that. Senator Grassley and I, and nearly 60 of our colleagues in the Senate, joined and said to the IRS, `Look, everybody in America has a right to be wrong, it is a democracy, but when the IRS is wrong, America pays. In this case, you're wrong, and we're going to change the law so you can't misinterpret what we write.' 
Those are the kind of things in this piece of legislation that have great merit. Those are some of the smaller things I wanted to mention. 
Finally, in closing, because I know other colleagues have things they want to talk about, I think this piece of legislation represents an awfully good instinct of the political system to get together and see if we can't do things together that represents a consensus that will be good for the future of this country. 
We so often fight among the political parties to prevent the other side from winning that, instead of getting the best of what each has to offer, we get the worst of what both can offer. That makes no sense for this country. This piece of legislation is a credit, yes, to this President and the White House who worked so hard for it and proposed so much of this; it is a credit to Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan and so many others on the House and Senate side from both political parties who I think have done a commendable job. Would I have written it differently? Yes. Am I concerned about the outyears a bit? Yes. We need to put up fences to make sure we don't go back into a deficit situation. 
We haven't finished dealing with the deficit. As my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, pointed out, this is a unified deficit. We still have a Social Security problem we must deal with. I probably would have preferred to take even more benefits in this piece of legislation and provided it to working families, but I didn't write every piece of it, and this is a compromise. I also would have preferred to have some limit on the issue of capital gains. I support the capital gains tax treatment that exists, but I would have had some limit on it. 
Having said all that, I am pleased to come to the floor today to say I can vote for a piece of legislation that I think advances this country's interest, and it rests on a bed of good news that comes from our colleagues who, in 1993, stood up and said, `Count me in, let me vote for the first giant step in tackling this Federal deficit.' And this next step, a bipartisan step which is good for this country, is one which I hope will give the American people a good feeling about their future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from New Mexico for his courtesy, and I will take the time under the control of the Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, I will make a couple of general comments first, and then I want to speak specifically about a provision in the conference report which is before us that is enormously troubling. 
First let me explain that I intend to vote for this legislation. The Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from New Mexico and others have, I think, done a remarkable job of crafting a bill that represents a compromise with the White House, with the Republicans and the Democrats, putting together a piece of legislation that tackles this budget deficit, and is the second step of several steps that we have taken, first in 1993 and then now in 1997, which will lead to a fiscal policy that is under control in this country--not only tackling the deficit but doing so in a way that makes a great deal of sense, cutting spending in some areas and increasing investment yet in other areas. 
This builds on accomplishments that we began earlier by tackling the budget deficit effectively but also by saying there are several other things in this country that are enormously important. One is children's health, what to do about children's health care in this country. The fact is this piece of legislation and the accompanying piece of legislation will make available a substantial amount of money to provide health insurance for children who are not now covered with health insurance. The question of whether a sick child gets health treatment or gets treatment in the medical care industry when that child is sick ought not ever be a function of whether that child has a parent with money in their checkbook. This piece of legislation will provide substantial additional coverage to provide health care to children, especially those who come from impoverished families. 
This piece of legislation also says education matters, education is a priority in this country. This bill puts on track 1 million additional kids to be enrolled in Head Start by the year 2000. Head Start matters and Head Start works. Anybody who has been to a Head Start center and seen those bright little eyes of children who are getting a head start, coming from circumstances of difficulty getting a head start, understands this program works. This program saves money. And this program invests in the young lives of young people who otherwise would not have had an opportunity. 
Mr. President, 300,000 more eligible college students will get additional help in Pell grants. This agreement places a priority on education, and that is exactly where the priority in this country ought to be. And finally this agreement solves a problem that caused me to vote against this legislation when it left the Senate. When the legislation left the Senate, it had two things that I did not support. One, increasing the eligible age of Medicare from 65 to 67 and, two, means testing Medicare. 
Let me explain quickly I am willing to support means testing of Medicare. I am not willing to support providing a means test for Medicare for any purpose other than making Medicare solvent --certainly not for the purpose in a reconciliation bill of making room for some tax cut somewhere else. We will have to and we must find a way to deal with the ticking time bomb, the demographic time bomb that is going to cause us problems both in Medicare and also in Social Security because of the aging of our population. I understand that. In the construction of solving these problems, I am willing to cast hard votes on the issue of Medicare with respect to means testing. I am unwilling to do so in the construct of a reconciliation bill. This is not where that sort of thing should have been done, and I did not support it when it left the Senate. That has been solved. Those provisions are out of this legislation. This legislation is better because of it. 
Let me mention one additional point. Senator Rockefeller, from the State of West Virginia, is here to discuss another subject with me, but the point about health care and Medicare especially is one that all of us ought to understand. Even though it is a challenge, we ought to understand that this is born of success. Mr. President, 100 years ago, the average life expectancy in America was 48 years of age. Nearly a century later it is 78 years of age. Why? A lot of things. Better nutrition, better lifestyle, breathtaking changes in health care, new knees, new hips, cataract surgery, open up the heart muscle when it has been plugged, give people additional life, breathtaking medical advances, and therefore a 30-year increase 
in life expectancy in our country in one century. It is wonderful. It is born of enormous success. It is also very expensive, and that is also causing part of our strain with respect to the Medicare Program, and we must make that program solvent for the long-term because it is too valuable a program for us not to fix it for the long-term. 
So I wanted to make a few comments. I intended to make more, but I will abbreviate them because we have another subject that is critically important. I want to make a few comments about the job that I think was done by the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from New Jersey, the President and many, many others. It is nice for a change to be talking about something that is bipartisan. The American people tend to believe, and in many cases rightly so, that instead of getting the best of what both political sides have to offer we often end up with the worst. At least in this circumstance we have engaged in a bipartisan agreement that I am going to vote for, I am going to support. 
Is everything here the way I would like or the way I would write it? No. But we have advanced in the area of education and health care and tackling the deficit and a number of other areas in a way that is significant and in a way that will be beneficial to this country's future, and I am going to vote for it. 
Now, having said that in laudatory terms, let me say there are a couple things that give me enormous heartache here, and one of them is a problem the Senator from West Virginia and I want to talk about for a couple of minutes. And at the end of this I intend to make a point of order under the Byrd rule against the universal service provisions in this conference report. 
Let me describe it very briefly and then yield to the Senator from West Virginia. There is, in my judgment, a fundamental mistake being made in the conference report in this reconciliation process. And that mistake is this: This conference report will use universal service funds in the Telecommunications Act for the purpose of plugging a hole in the budget process. 
In my judgment, that is totally and completely inappropriate and without foundation. Those who were involved in it were repeatedly told this is inappropriate and yet somehow through the mechanisms of the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget and a range of other interests it got stuck into this piece of legislation. 
Let me describe it very briefly. We have in this country something called the universal service provision in the Telecommunications Act. What does that mean? It means that in this country, even if you are in an area where it is very expensive to provide telephone service, we want to make sure you have good telephone service at an affordable price. If you happen to live in an area where it is very expensive to provide telephone service, we have a universal service fund that collects resources from all of the users in the country and uses it to drive down the cost to those in the highest cost areas of the country so that everyone in this country has affordable telephone service. 
That is what universal means. It has been around forever and for a good purpose. Every telephone in this country is more valuable because there is a telephone in the smallest highest cost area of this country and we have decided to drive down those costs so that telephone service is universally affordable. 
Now, the universal service fund produces the money to do that. It is not a fund that comes into the Federal Government. It is not Federal money. It is not a fund that has money that the Federal Government spends. It is completely apart and separate from the Federal coffers. 
Two years ago, we passed something called a Telecommunications Act and now we are told by the Congressional Budget Office and by some others that the way the universal service fund is worded in the Telecommunications Act there is justification for the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget to rule that the universal service fund can be used in the construct of a Federal budget as both revenues and outlays. 
That is pure nonsense. This has nothing to do with the Federal budget--nothing. And those who believe it does have either misread the law or don't know the foggiest thing about what they are reading. 
Now, we have tried very hard to pull this out of this conference report because it is a couple, I guess it is a $3 billion plug they stuck in, just like a cork in a big hole. They walk around with corks in their pocket down at OMB or CBO, and say, well, here is a big hole we can't explain; we will stick a cork in there. This cork is the universal service fund. And the minute you start using that as a cork the cork will get bigger every year they manipulate it. This is a misuse of the fund. And the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget had no business and no capability of suggesting that this is a part of the Federal Treasury. 
Now, I would like to yield for purposes of discussion. At the end of the process, I am going to make a point of order, a Byrd rule point of order. And let me, as I yield to the Senator from West Virginia, say that the Presiding Officer, who is on the Senate Commerce Committee and was integrally involved in the issue of the construction of the Telecommunications Act and the universal service fund, has been involved in signing letters and discussions with other Members of Congress about this very subject. The Senator from Arizona, the current chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, feels the same way I do. It is inappropriate to have it in this conference report in this manner. The Senate minority leader feels the same way. A good number of us feel the same way. And yet we seem powerless at this point to pull it out of this conference report. I expect that my challenge on the Byrd rule is probably not going to survive for reasons that I will understand, but I think it is critically important that we raise this issue now so it will not become habit forming; this will happen once and only once. And between now and the next time someone has an urge to do this with the universal service fund, I hope we have the law changed to disabuse anybody that they can interpret any language in the Telecommunications Act with the universal service fund in any way which suggests it is part of the Federal Treasury assets receipts or outlays. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona I notice is in the Chamber. I just mentioned him. He is the distinguished chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. I know the Senator from West Virginia also wishes to be recognized. I would be happy to yield the floor so the Senator from Arizona may speak.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate very much the comments made by the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Arizona, and others. I say that the Senate minority leader, Senator Daschle, feels very strongly in opposition to this particular provision. 
I was very careful when I began this discussion. I was not critical of the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I said that I thought they had brought a product to the floor that is a compromise which represents the best of public service. 
There is much in here to commend this. I am going to vote for this. This is what we are going to vote on. It is a pretty good piece of work. This page is what I am talking about, coming right out of the middle of this provision, `Universal Service Fund Payment Schedule.' 
There was a story once about a fellow--I do not have backwoods in North Dakota. In fact, we rank 50th in America in the amount of our native forest lands. So we do not have any backwoods stories. But down in your part of the country, we hear all these backwoods stories. 
There was a story I heard once about a fellow that came over a hill in the backwoods, and he found a couple of old codgers there sitting over a pot that was hanging over a fire, and they were making something. He said, `What are you fellows making?' 
They said, `Stew.' 
`What kind of stew?' 
`Horseradish stew,' they said. 
`How on Earth do you make horseradish stew,' they asked. 
`Well,' one said, `You take one horse and one radish.' 
That is the menu here--`horse' and `radish.' 
You have to look through this whole thing to find out what has been brewed, what has been cooked. And I like a lot of this. I think a lot of this advances this country's interests. The provision I brought to the floor today to talk about is a terrible provision. It is a terrible provision and ought not be here. 
Mr. President, I heard discussion earlier by the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and others, that there will be legislation--first a hearing, and then legislation to deal with this. We may never again be back at this intersection, an intersection where we are having to come to the floor to say, `You can't use money, you can't count money that never comes to the Federal Treasury as part of a calculation to balance the budget.' Why, in my hometown of 300 people, you would be laughed out of the cafe in 2 seconds. You can't count money that does not come to the Federal Government. 
So, despite the fact that I am going to offer a point of order under the Byrd rule--and my understanding is that I will probably not prevail--I do not intend to ask then for a vote to appeal the ruling of the Chair. I will accept the ruling of the Chair as a ruling, and will disagree with it, I suspect, if the ruling is what I expect it to be. But I will say this: I expect us never to be back to this intersection because I expect that those of us on the authorizing committee who know what the fund is and what it is for and what it is about, we will never again allow a discussion to go on somewhere in the bowels of this building in which OMB and CBO bring to the table a menu of items that say, `By the way, here is a way to count money to make things look different than they really are.' 
I say, the Senator from New Mexico talked about this being a White House creation. My understanding is that, indeed, the Office of Management and Budget and the White House have agreed that this provision is part of this budget process. In fact, the latest provision, which is, I think, the third provision of this type, this was, in fact, brought to the table by the White House. Originally, I understand it came from the Congressional Budget Office, agreed to by the Office of Management and Budget. But notwithstanding what its conception was, I think it is terrible, terrible public policy, and I hope that we never again are at this point. 
I think the discussion we have had is a useful discussion, which has served notice to every Member of Congress that while we cannot get at this provision at this point, there will be a time when we will no longer debate this because we will have changed Federal law to prevent this sort of thing from happening.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the chairman of the Budget Committee. I was prepared to make a point of order, a Byrd rule point of order, on this universal service provision. I am persuaded that making a point of order, in which the Parliamentarian would likely rule that this provision is not violative of the Byrd rule, would put us in the position of having a ruling by the Chair blessing an approach that I think deserves not a blessing but condemnation. So I am not going to proceed to make the point of order. 
I am persuaded to decide that by the fact that the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the authorizing committee, of which I am a member, indicates, first of all, a determination to hold hearings in support of changing the law to prevent this from occurring again and statements by the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and Senator Rockefeller and others, including Senator Hollings. 
It is clear to me that we will not likely come to this point again. We will likely see a law change that says universal service funds cannot be used for this purpose. For that reason, I will not require the Chair to rule on a Byrd rule point of order on the universal service provision because I simply don't want anybody to believe there was any blessing applied to this approach in this piece of legislation. 
Let me make one additional point. The Senator from New Mexico made a point some while ago, and I suspect he thinks that we are here in some ways jabbing away, and so he made a point that, gee, this isn't the only place this stuff goes on. Everybody in the Chamber would agree with that assessment. We understand that there are games and there are games. We also understand that this piece of legislation, the reconciliation bill, this year provides significant traction toward the goals we all want for this country: getting our fiscal house in order, making the right investments, cutting spending, and doing other things. I understand all that. 
My point was--and I was not critical of the Senator from New Mexico--there is a provision right in the middle of this, which is a tiny provision, that is fundamentally wrong and ought to never be put in a piece of legislation like this. I am now believing from this discussion this afternoon that we will not likely be forced to discuss this again on the floor of the Senate, because those of us who are involved in describing what a universal service fund was in the Telecommunications Act will join and conspire, in a thoughtful way, to change the law, so no one--OMB, or CBO, or anyone--can misinterpret whether those revenues touch the Federal Government. They do not and they cannot, therefore, be used to plug some kind of a hole in the budget process. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, our Nation has an obligation to its citizens and to the world community to be a leader in working toward improvement of the global environment. Coming from an agricultural State, I am particularly concerned about the potential impacts of global climate changes on our ability to produce the food that is so vitally needed, both at home and abroad. However, if we are going to be effective in achieving our goals for a better global environment, we not only have to do what is necessary to reduce emissions here in our own country, we must also take the lead in negotiating agreements that will require the reduction of greenhouse gases in other countries around the world. 
Frankly, I am deeply concerned over the negotiations related to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in which the United States and other countries are discussing the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases. These negotiations are currently headed in a direction that will ask those who have already made great progress in reducing emissions to reduce them even further, while at the same time allowing those who have made no serious attempt to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases to do virtually nothing to comply. 
I'm proud to say that my State, North Dakota, was the first State in America to comply with the Clean Air Act. We have taken the responsibility of reducing emissions in my home State and throughout these United States very seriously. Even though we have doubled our use of energy in the past 20 years in this country, we now have cleaner air. Have we done all we could? No, we can do more and we will. But, everybody needs to do their fair share. 
The question in these negotiations is an issue of fairness. Is it fair to our economy to impose stringent controls that will cost substantial money to get a small margin of additional environmental benefit, when other have not even really started? Is it fair when we have already made significant strides in reducing emissions to exempt other countries, whose economies are competing with ours, from any meaningful compliance? 
In recent trips to China, I have observed the degradation of that country's air shed because of the lack of meaningful laws or enforcement restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases. Yet, these negotiations would effectively allow China, India and other countries in similar situations a free ride. They would have virtually no significant requirements to clean up their act in any reasonable time period. 
I refuse to accept negotiations that impose a burden on ourselves that we are unwilling to require of others, particularly when we have made progress and others have not. This reminds me of our negotiations on international trade in 
which we unilaterally have opened our markets to foreign goods, while allowing foreign markets to remain closed to our goods. While we bear the burden, others reap the profits. Unfortunately, we have not been willing to require other countries to take the reciprocal actions to achieve fair trade. 
I see exactly the same mentality in these negotiations on the reduction of air emissions. Our country once again appears willing to impose burdens on our own economy that we will not require of others. Even if we were not competing with these other economies, this would not make good sense. 
I want to make it clear that I think our country has done the right thing by insisting that part of the costs of producing a product includes the costs associated with reducing pollution and preventing the degradation of our air or water. I am proud that our country has been a leader on these environmental issues. 
As we move forward in establishing and developing compliance with global environmental standards that will protect the Earth's environment, we must do so in a fair and evenhanded way that does not put America at a significant disadvantage with its trading partners. 
For example, if we are competing with the Chinese in the production of goods and we are required to assume a burden in compliance with emissions standards that the Chinese are not required to follow, then we are imposing a penalty of fewer jobs and slower economic growth on our own economy. I think that's unfair to this country. 
The administration should not mistake the concern that we have in Congress about this issue as one of weakness on environmental issues. That is simply not the case. In fact, the Congress has demonstrated its strong support for environmental cleanup for more than two decades. 
If the administration intends to negotiate global requirements for environmental compliance, then this Congress will insist that these requirements are fair. We will insist that the negotiations do not impose burdens on our own country, while other countries are exempted from their enforcement responsibilities. This is a matter of fairness and doing what is right for our Nation and our planet.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, we learned that last evening the White House and congressional leaders reached agreement on a budget and tax cut proposal. I think that will be good news for the American people. 
I have been in Congress for some long while, as has been the Presiding Officer, and we have seen budgets and more budgets. We have seen claims and counterclaims. We have seen good times and bad times. We have seen economies that are expanding and economies that are contracting. 
I remember the action taken in 1993 by this Congress, at a point in time in 1993 when the budget deficit was swelling in an almost uncontrolled manner and the budget deficit was, in the unified budget, over $290 billion--if you count all the money the way you ought to, it was well over $300 billion--and then in 1993, with that deficit out of control, this Congress took action. By one vote here in the Senate and one vote in the other body, this Congress passed what should be called the Balanced Budget Act. We then called it a deficit reduction bill. And it has worked. 
From 1993 until now, we have seen the budget deficit go down, down, down and way down. That has allowed, I think, the American people to be more confident about this Congress' willingness and ability to deal with fiscal policy in a responsible way. The economy has blossomed and provided more economic growth, and because of that, unemployment has gone down, way down; inflation is down, way, way down; and because all the economic indicators are good and because economic growth has been up, we have seen the budget deficit now nearly disappear. 
As a result of this economic boom, Members of Congress, working with the President, have reached a budget accord on not only spending issues for the coming 5 years, but also the question of what kind of tax reductions should be made available. 
The one thing that is certain about all of us is that none of us will be around here 100 years from now; 100 years from now, we will all be gone. We will be faint memories. And 100 years from now, if someone wanted to look and evaluate what was this Congress about, what were the American people about, what did they hold dear and what did they think was important, they could look back a century at the budget of the United States of America 100 years prior to that time and evaluate what that Congress and the American people felt they should spend their money on, what they felt they 
should invest in. So 100 years from now, if they look back and evaluate what it is we held most dear, what we thought was most important, they could look into this budget agreement and evaluate what, in July 1997, motivated these men and women, what did they think was important. 
The reason I came to the floor this morning is I think a number of the impulses in this budget agreement and the tax agreement are precisely the right kind of impulses for this Congress and for the American people to act on. First of all, I have, over time, tended to categorize the policy issues as kids, jobs and values; working on the issues of kids, jobs and values. Somehow the threading of those issues together in providing the right kinds of policy initiatives gives us the right direction. 
Well, let's take a look at what's in this budget agreement and the proposal on tax reductions relative to kids, jobs and values. 
First of all, what has happened in this agreement is the President pushed, and we pushed, and we pushed some more, and we have in an agreement a substantial new investment in education, $35 billion worth of tax relief targeted for education. This agreement says to the American people that when you send your kids to college, you are going to get a tax credit that is an inviting and important tax credit for you. 
Why is that important? Because there is no substitute for education. A society, a country that is not educated is not going to improve and advance. Thomas Jefferson once said, `Those who believe a country can be both ignorant and free believe in something that never was and never could be.' 
So this agreement, thanks to the President, thanks to many of us in Congress who pushed and pushed and pushed and would not quit, says to parents who are going to send their kids to school, there is $35 billion for investment in education in the form of tax credits, a 100 percent tax credit for the first $1,000 you spend in sending your child to college, and 50 percent of the second $1,000 in the first 2 years of postsecondary education. This agreement says education is important. That is the one that says kids and their future represent the future of this country. 
Also, child health. Twenty-four billion dollars in this agreement is dedicated to insure more children in this country who are now uninsured. Of the 10 million children who have no health insurance and no health coverage, 5 million of those children will be able to see the benefits of health insurance under this piece of legislation. That is a priority. That represents the kids portion of what we deem important here in this Congress and in our country. For poor children, 5 million poor children, the question of whether they get health care will no longer be a function of whether their parents have money. Health care for those sick children ought to be a right. And this budget agreement--again, thanks to this President and to many of us in Congress who pushed very hard to say children's health is important; when we have 10 million children without health coverage, we had to do something about it--moves a giant step in that direction. 
Jobs, values. Well, this proposal on the budget and on taxes also is a proposal that says that saving is important. Savings and investment are important. It manifests that by the tax incentives; it says that we want the American people to have the incentives to save and to invest by providing tax incentives for that purpose. My grandmother, who is gone now, bless her soul, once said to me, `You know, Byron, I never hear anybody talking about saving up to buy anything anymore because the whole economy is to say, `Come over here and buy this, we will give you a rebate and give you the product, and you don't have to make the first payment for 6 months.' That is the whole economy these days. 
But the fact is, our economic strength and future economic growth rests on the ability to promote savings and, therefore, investment. Savings is critically important, and this budget agreement provides incentives, more tax incentives, for savings. 
Home ownership. This tax agreement provides substantial tax help for those who sell their home and who now will no longer be 
paying any kind of capital gains tax on the value of that home sale. 
Most importantly, with respect to children again, is the children's tax credit, a $500 tax credit. It is phased in in different ways. But the fact is, for those families who have children and who are struggling to make ends meet and pay bills and go to work every day and provide for their children's needs and send their kids to school, this provides a $500 child tax credit. The President pushed for that, the Congress pushed for that. That is also part of this agreement. 
Now, we had a big fight about who is going to get that and should some children be left out because their parents don't make enough money--both parents working, both at minimum wage, neither of which pay much income taxes, but both of which pay a substantial payroll tax, and the payroll tax is the tax that has been increasing. 
This agreement, as I understand it from last evening, does move in the direction of saying, yes, you are a taxpayer, if you make $25,000 a year and don't pay much in income tax but if you are paying a payroll tax, we consider you a taxpayer, and we think you deserve some tax reduction as well. So this $500 per child tax credit is going to be very beneficial to a good number of families who feel the pinch of the burden of taxes that they would like to be relieved of if they could in order to better provide for themselves and their families. 
Now, I happen to think that the first goal and the first objective of eliminating the budget deficit is the important one. I want to go back to 1993, which is where I started this discussion. In 1993, when we passed on the floor of this Senate a budget agreement which we thought of as the Deficit Reduction Act. I voted for it. It wasn't the popular thing to do and certainly wasn't the political thing to do. There was nothing but political heartache and headache as a result of voting for that. It passed by only one vote. Some of my colleagues are no longer in this Chamber because they voted for it. They were defeated or they left. 
I think, in retrospect, that history will show that, in 1993, this Congress turned the corner and made a U-turn and said to the American people: we want to tell you something. We are committed to deficit reduction and we are willing to make the tough choices and demonstrate that to you. And we passed the Deficit Reduction Act, which should really be called the Balanced Budget Act, because that is what has created the confidence in this country by the American people that Congress was willing to head in the right direction. 
We have all these economists in the country who explain to us what has happened and what will happen. Most of them don't have the foggiest notion of either what happened or what will happen. I used to teach economics for a couple of years in college. I think economics is principally psychology pumped up with a little helium. All these economists tell us what is going to happen. Well, in 1993, we had this what I call the Balanced Budget Act, which I voted for. We had people here, some of whom were economists, stand up and say, `If you pass this legislation, this economy is going to go in the tank. We are going to have a recession, or a depression, and joblessness.' I mean, the predictions were very dire. 
In fact we passed that legislation and we have had unemployment go straight down, new jobs go straight up, inflation go straight down, and the deficit go straight down. The unified budget deficit was $290 billion in 1992. This year it may end up at less than $40 billion. The economy is on better footing. Why? Because it is not the economists that understand what is going on. 
This economy rests on a cushion of confidence. If the American people are confident about what we are doing and the direction in which this country is heading, then they make the right decisions. `We are confident about the future,' they say, so they buy the next washer and dryer or the next car and make the decision to purchase a home. 
If they are not confident, they make the other decision. `We will defer the purchase. We will not buy the car. We won't buy the home. We won't buy the washer and dryer. We won't buy the refrigerator.' And, as a result, the economy contracts. 
But this economy is expanding. Why? Because in 1993 this Congress made the right decision--the tough decision--to put this country on the right course. It allows us now, in 1997, to make some other decisions. Yes, to make budget choices that are the right choices in many cases and to make tax reduction decisions that will be good decisions for many families in this country. 
Are there some things in this piece of legislation that I don't like? Sure. There are probably some of them I don't yet know about. 
Watching this crowd work on budget issues is a lot like taking your car to a garage. Once they lift your hood and tell you what they are charging you for, you do not have the foggiest idea what they are talking about. Some of that same mentality can certainly be true about the budget negotiations here in Congress because they are down there outside the regular committee process making deals. And I am sure that I will discover things that give me heartburn and stomach ache with respect to what they have put in this legislation. So, will there be some things that I don't like? Yes. 
But, in the main, have we succeeded in pushing and pushing the kind of agenda that is important for this country? Have we expanded health insurance for 5 million kids? Have we provided a $500 tax credit that goes to working families--yes, all working families? Have we improved your ability to pass on a family farm or a small business to your sons and daughters who want to run it with the estate tax changes that are in this piece of legislation that Senator Daschle from South Dakota worked on and that I worked and others have worked on? Have we helped you to more easily send your kid to college and get tax credit for doing so, helped working families so that their kids have the opportunity to go to college? Have we done all of these things? The answer is: yes, we have. 
Are they going to be helpful? I think so. 
So I come to the floor today feeling that we are moving in the right direction and we are making the right decisions. Frankly, I am one who believes that the ability for the Republicans and Democrats to get together and work together and have common goals together for the future of this country is good for this country. Sometimes we should fight over things, and we do. We fought, for example, over the question of whether a family that is going to make $25,000 a year working full time should have access to the $500-per-child tax credit. Some in Congress said, absolutely not, because they are not paying much of an income tax. We said absolutely that they should get it, because they are paying taxes--significant payroll taxes. So we fight about those things. 
But I am pleased to say that in the main much, much more of what we fought for is going to be in this conference agreement. I think the joining of the issues today on these range of issues in this budget agreement will spell good news for this country. 
Let me finally mention one additional point. As we proceed to do these things on both the spending side and the tax side of this budget reconciliation agreement, it is very, very important that all of us decide that the budget deficit still matters, and at the first sign of ratcheting up a budget deficit once again, this Congress must take action. What we hope will happen is that this agreement will continue the economic growth we have had, and to the extent it does, that we will have a balanced budget not only in the year 2002 and perhaps even before, but also in subsequent years thereafter. 
But when and if it appears that expenditures will exceed revenues--that we will run a deficit--then this Congress must be prepared to take action to stop it, because balanced budgets are important. 
Now we have some room to provide some capability of tax cuts and some other things in the budget agreement that makes some sense for the American families. But American families most of all understand that balancing the budget is what will give them confidence in this economy. They know that balancing the budget is what will give this country the chance to grow and to provide jobs and to provide hope for all Americans, now and in the years to come. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with my good friend and colleague Mr. Conrad. that will promote economic development on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in our State. 
Economic development must be among our top priorities in Indian country, and our Federal policies should support, not hinder, the creation of new employment opportunities on our Nation's Indian reservations. This bill is aimed at addressing a provision in Federal law that is unnecessarily hampering the economic development efforts of Three Affiliated Tribes in North Dakota and has the support of the Tribes' Business Council. 
The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation has been working for years to develop partnerships with the oil industry to explore the development of oil and gas resources on its tribally owned or allotted lands. The Fort Berthold Reservation covers about 1 million acres of land in the middle of the proven oil-rich Williston Basin. There has been active oil and gas exploration and development on the lands surrounding the reservation, but Three Affiliated Tribes itself and its members have been able to participate in this activity in only a very limited way because of a Federal requirement that 100 percent of all tribal members with ownership in an allotment agree to the leasing of that allotment. Some of the allotted land tracts on this reservation are owned by up to 200 individuals, and if even one of these owners will not sign the lease, the exploration cannot proceed. This outmoded 100-percent requirement makes it virtually impossible for tribes and its members to pursue this kind of economic development, even if a vast majority of allottees are supportive. 
This legislation, which is narrowly drawn and applies only to the Fort Berthold Reservation, would allow a leasing agreement to go forward if more than 50 percent of those with an interest in specific allotted lands agree. By keeping in place a majority requirement for the leasing of mineral rights, the rights of individual landowners would still be protected. The Secretary of the Interior would also still have to review and approve a proposed leasing agreement. 
The economic implications of this legislation for Three Affiliated Tribes are enormous. The drilling of just 1 well would create 50 to 100 jobs, so clearly, this bill can help the Indian people on Fort Berthold Reservation to move away from welfare dependency to economic independence. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is Monday today, and somewhere deep in the bowels of this Capitol building, the budget people are meeting to finalize a budget agreement in something called the reconciliation bill, which deals with both spending and taxes. These are the budgeteers, the people that come from the Budget Committees, and they work on the budget; they know the budget. They deal in almost a foreign language, speaking to each other in a language that most Americans would not understand. Somewhere down in the recesses of this building, they are now meeting, finalizing two reconciliation bills--one on spending and one proposing tax cuts. 
The issue that brings me to the floor today for a moment will also bring me to the floor tomorrow morning on an amendment that I have offered. It deals with something that most Americans will not recognize; it is called the universal service fund. Somewhere in this room, where these budgeteers are working, they have a hole in their budget plan. In other words, it doesn't quite add up. So when something doesn't quite add up, what do you do? Well, in this case you get a different adding machine. You can actually build an adding machine that adds it up the way you want. So they plug this hole with a plug number, and the plug number they use in their budget hole is called the universal service fund. I want to describe what it is and why what they are doing is fundamentally wrong and will lead us down the wrong path and cause a great deal of trouble for a lot of Americans. 
We have something called the universal service fund in this country because we wanted to provide telephone service to all Americans at an affordable price. How do we do that? Well, it costs a substantial amount of money to provide telephone service 
for a very small town because you have to have the same infrastructure, and you have to spread the costs over very few telephones. I come from a town of 300 people, so I know what that is about. It is much different than the cost of providing a telephone in a city like New York, where you have literally hundreds of thousands, or millions of telephones, and you spread the fixed costs over millions of telephone instruments. 
So we decided in this country we would offset the cost of telephone services for those very high cost areas, where it might otherwise cost people $50, $100, $200 a month to have a telephone. We would offset the cost to make it affordable for everybody by charging everybody a little bit that goes into a universal service fund, and that is used to drive down the telephone costs in the very small areas. 
Why did we decide that was important as a country? Because the presence of every telephone makes every other telephone more valuable. If the folks in the big cities could never call people in small towns because the people in small towns found that telephone cost was too expensive and therefore they didn't have a telephone, the system would not work, would it? That is why we have the fund. 
A year and a half ago the Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. It was the first time in nearly 60 years that Congress had reformulated the laws on telecommunications. The Congress also changed the universal service fund some. Now, this is not money that comes into the Government or goes out of the Government. It is a fund that is established that is administered and set up privately, or on a quasi-private basis at least. 
What we have today is a new budget deal that is being put together in which the budgeteers are taking the universal service fund money--some of it--and bringing it into the Federal budget and then spending it out again and using it to manipulate their numbers to plug a $2 to $4 billion hole that will show up sometime in the year 2002. 
If this sounds like foreign language to most Americans, I can understand that. But it won't sound like foreign language if the manipulation and misuse of the universal service fund means that, in the longer term, people in small areas, in small towns and rural areas, end up paying much higher monthly telephone bills because of it. 
There is no excuse, no excuse at all, for people who are now negotiating today on this budget deal to be talking about manipulating or misusing the universal service fund. It doesn't belong to the Federal Government, doesn't come into the Federal Treasury, and is not to be used or misused by the people who are putting this budget deal together. 
Now, I raised this issue last week, and it doesn't mean a thing, apparently. You know, there are some people who apparently just can't hear. I think the budgeteers are in a soundproof room and don't hear. The Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, has raised objections to this. Senator McCain has raised objections to it. Senator Hollings has raised objections to it. I have raised objections to it. Others on the floor of the Senate have raised objections. It doesn't seem to mean a thing. They just do their thing in this room. And the White House is negotiating with the Republican leadership in Congress. That is why the deal is being struck. Somehow there will be some immaculate conception announced from some room here in the Capitol in the coming hours, maybe later today, tomorrow, or Wednesday. There is no chance to get into that deal and pull something out that is as egregious a mistake or an abuse as this is, because then we will only have a certain number of hours, and we will be able to vote `yes' or `no' on the construct of this deal. 
The reason I came to the floor is to say that if there are people who are putting this together and if they are in fact listening, listen carefully and listen closely: You are doing the wrong thing. You are making a mistake. This money doesn't belong to you. This money ought not to be used to plug a hole in the 
budget. If you are going to add something up, add it up honestly. If you come up short, find an honest way to cover the shortfall. Do not misuse or manipulate the universal service fund. 
I saw on television once a program by a fellow named David Copperfield, a great illusionist, and he provided marvelous entertainment, creating these wonderful illusions for his television audience. Most people, like me, understood it was a trick. The wonderment was, how did they do that trick? I don't understand it. But with respect to illusions performed by Mr. Copperfield, I suppose everybody understands it's trickery. 
Why don't we understand in Congress when we create an illusion like this in the budget, it is also trickery, and trickery doesn't belong in these budget agreements. It doesn't belong here, and they ought not bring to it the floor, using the universal service fund--or I should say misusing those funds. 
We will vote on that tomorrow. I offered an amendment last week, which is scheduled for decision in the morning. We will, if we are not too late, send a message to the budgeteers: Do not do this. It is the wrong thing. 
I said on Thursday that I recall at a motel in Minneapolis near the airport, they had a little sign where the manager parked. It was near the front door, so I suppose everybody wanted to park there. It said, `manager's parking space.' Then below it, it said, `don't even think about parking here.' I thought, wow, I bet no one thinks about parking there. That is what this Congress ought to say to the people negotiating these deals: Don't even think about doing something like this. It is not the right thing to do. It misuses funds that are not yours. Don't even think about it.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, because the Senate has very little business today, I wanted to come to the floor to talk about the universal service fund issue. But because we don't have much else to do, I need to unburden myself on a couple of other issues. 
This deals with a subject discussed by my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, on the issue of trade. He was discussing one small issue with respect to China and the WTO. I want to talk about another issue that is going to be the subject of substantial debate in the month of September. When we get back from the August recess, which Congress will take, we are told that the administration will request from this Congress something called fast-track authority for trade negotiations. 
Fast-track authority, again, is a term that doesn't mean much, perhaps, to most. Everything with fast seems to me to connote something that is kind of interesting. 
There is fast food, fast talk, fast track. It all kind of connotes doing something unusual, not taking time to prepare. Fast track means that somebody can go negotiate a trade agreement someplace, bring it back to Congress, and once they bring it to Congress nobody in Congress has the right to offer amendments. That is fast track. To me that is undemocratic. But it is called fast track. 
We have negotiated several trade agreements under fast track. All of them have been abysmal failures, terrible failures. We were told that we should grant fast track authority once again so our trade negotiators can go abroad and negotiate new trade agreements with other countries. 
Let me review for just a moment what this has gotten us, and why I and some others in this Chamber intend in September to come and aggressively oppose both the President and those in this Chamber who want to extend fast-track trade authority. We asked for fast-track trade authority for negotiating a trade agreement with Mexico, our neighbor to the south. Do you know that just before we negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico under fast track that we had a trade surplus with Mexico? In other words, our trade balance was to our favor--not much, but a trade surplus. So we negotiated a trade agreement with Mexico. 
Guess what happens? Now we have an enormous trade deficit with Mexico. What has happened to American jobs? They go to Mexico. 
Do you know that we import more cars from Mexico into the United States of America than the United States exports to all of the rest of the world? Think of that. We import more cars from Mexico to our country than we export to the rest of the world. We were told that if we would just do this trade deal with Mexico, all it would mean is that the products of low-skilled labor would come into this country from Mexico but certainly not high-skilled labor. 
What comes from Mexico? Cars, car parts, electronics--exactly the opposite kinds of products given the assurances that we were given when the deal was done with Mexico. I didn't support the North American Free-Trade Agreement--this so-called free-trade agreement with Mexico. They attached a free-trade handle to this agreement. That is another name thing--free trade; free lunch. There is no free lunch. The fact is there is nothing free about free trade. 
You would think our trade negotiators ought to be able to go out and negotiate a trade agreement that we would win from time to time. Why is it that our trade negotiators seem to lose every trade agreement that they enter into? 
Then there is Canada. We had a free-trade agreement with Canada. Now the trade deficit with Canada has gotten much worse. We have a peculiar and difficult circumstance with our Canadian border up in the North Dakota area with the flood of unfairly subsidized Canadian grain coming south across our border. 
How about Japan or China? We have massive trade deficits every single year with these countries. And the trade deficit doesn't diminish. It doesn't get smaller. It doesn't improve. These trade deficits are abiding deficits every single year. 
What does it mean to our country when you have a long-term trade deficit? With China it has gone from $10 million up to $40 billion in a dozen years. As a result, our country has become a cash cow for China's hard currency needs. It is fundamentally unfair to our workers in our country, and it is unfair to our factories and our producers in our country. 
People say, `Well, but those of you who do not like these trade agreements, you just do not understand. You do not have the breadth and the ability to see across the horizon. You do not see the world view here.' What we do see is this country's interests. 
I am all for expanding our trade. I am all for fair trade. But I will be darned if we ought to stand in this country for a trade relationship--the one we have with Japan, the one we have with China, the one we have with Mexico, or Canada for that matter, and others--that allows our producers and our workers to be put in a position where they cannot compete against unfair trade. 
We cannot and should not have to compete in any circumstance with any country that produces a product using 14-year-old kids working 14 hours a day, being paid 14 cents an hour, and then ships their product to Toledo, Fargo, Denver, and San Francisco. Then we are told, `You compete with that, America. You compete with that.' We shouldn't have to compete with that. 
When we put people in our factories, we have a child labor law. When we put people in our factories, we have a minimum wage. When our people work in our factories, we have air pollution laws against polluting air and against polluting water. 
Then a producer says to us, `Well, that is fine if you want to do that. If you want to protect children, pay a decent wage and protect your air and water, we will go elsewhere. We will produce elsewhere. We will produce in China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Mexico. We will produce elsewhere where we are not nearly as encumbered by the niceties of production such as child labor laws or minimum wages.' We shouldn't have to put up with that. 
The point I am making is this: Those who come to us in September and say, `Give us fast-track trade authority so we can go out and negotiate new trade agreements,' ought to understand that some of us believe that you ought to correct the old trade agreements you have first. You ought to correct the problems that are causing massive deficits with Mexico, massive trade deficits with China, and massive deficits with Japan. 
I am not saying that we want to close our markets to them. Instead we need to be saying to them, `When you want to buy things, then you buy from us.' We say to China, `If you have a $40 billion trade deficit with us, when you want to buy airplanes, you buy them from us. When you want to buy wheat, you come shop in this country.' 
Instead, China shops around the world for wheat. When it needs airplanes, it says to one major American airplane company, `By the way, we would like to buy your airplanes, but we want you to manufacture them in China.' 
That doesn't work. It is not fair trade. It is not the way the trade system ought to work. 
Those of us who feel that way in September are going to be here on the floor saying fast-track trade authority ought not be extended. What we ought to do to the extent that we have the energy is to fix the trade problems that now exist--yes, in NAFTA, in GATT, and in bilateral trade relationships with Japan and China and others. That is the job we should be doing. Congress has the responsibility to insist the administration does it, and Congress itself needs to be involved in doing it. 
I know what will happen when we do that in September when the administration asks for fast-track authority and some of us stand up and say, `Wait a second; we wonder whether this is in the interests of our country.' We will have people immediately jump up and say, `Yes, you people are against free trade. You are a bunch of xenophobic, isolationist stooges who simply don't understand this world now is a smaller world. We from day to day and minute to minute have trade relationships with each other all around the globe, and you don't understand that. You never have gotten it, and you don't get it now.' We hear those discussions virtually always when we raise the question of trade. 
On the other hand, I think maybe those who view us in such a cavalier way will have to deal with the insistence of some of us that we finally must as a country insist on fair trade relationships. Perhaps they will begin to understand these abiding and long-term trade deficits. Incidentally, the largest trade deficits in the history of our country are occurring now. We currently have the largest merchandise trade deficits in our history. Maybe they will come to understand that these trade deficits will retard this country's long-term economic growth and hurt this country and we must do something about them. 
There is great anxiety in this Chamber--and has been for a long while--about the budget deficit. We have made enormous progress in reducing that budget deficit. But there has not been 
a whisper in this Chamber about suggesting we do something about the largest trade deficit in American history. That trade deficit relates to jobs, economic opportunities, and the future of this country as well. It is long past the time when we do something about it.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would like to make comments on one additional subject today, a subject that many of us are working on in both the Republican and Democratic caucuses, and one that is also very important to our country. 
The inspector general about a week and a half ago in Health and Human Services released a report on the Medicare Program, and indicated to us in Congress and to the American people that they felt that as much as $17 billion to $23 billion a year is essentially wasted in the area of Medicare, for a range of reasons and a range of areas--waste, fraud, and abuse. They describe bills that were inappropriate, bills that were erroneous, services billed for that were never provided, and some fraud. 
The reason that is an important report is that it follows on the heels of the Government Accounting Office, the inspector for the Congress, the GAO, which also had indicated that it felt somewhere in the neighborhood of $20 billion to $23 billion a year is wasted in the area of Medicare. By `wasted,' I mean waste, fraud, and abuse. 
A good number of people have tried to tackle this subject at one time or another and with some limited success. 
The American people would look at Medicare and probably conclude that it was a very important program. I happen to be a supporter of Medicare. I think it was a very important program for this country to develop. 
Prior to the 1960's, when this country developed the Medicare Program, far fewer than half of the American senior citizen population had any health insurance at all--and that was for obvious reasons. There are not insurance companies formed in this country to run around seeing if they can provide unlimited insurance to people who are reaching an age of retirement and where they are going to need more and more health care in older age. It is not the way insurance companies make money. Insurance companies search for that healthy 25-year-old who is not going to need any health care and sign them up to pay health insurance premiums. All of us know that. That is where insurance companies make money. Do you know of an insurance company that says, `Our mission in life is to make a profit by searching out old folks and seeing if we can provide insurance to old folks'? I don't think so. That is not the way it works. In order to have health insurance for people at any age, they would have to charge so much that most people couldn't afford it. The result was that in 1955, 1960, 1962 fewer than half of America's senior citizens had any health care coverage at all. 
We passed Medicare and made certain that the fear of reaching retirement age and not having health care coverage would be gone forever. Medicare guaranteed those citizens who reached that age--age 65--that they were going to have health insurance coverage. And it has been a marvelous program in many ways. After health care was provided for senior citizens in the early 1960's in the Medicare Program, 99 percent of the senior citizens in this country have coverage for health care--99 percent. That is a remarkable success. 
Something else has happened in this intervening period, and it is also called success. People are living longer and living better. Medical breakthroughs extend life in a very significant way. One-hundred years ago at the turn of this century, if you were alive, you were expected on average to live to be 48 years of age. One century later, you have a reasonable expectancy to live to be 78 years of age--from 48 to 78 in one century. That is progress. These days, on average, you live to 77 or 78 years of age. You have a bad knee, replace the knee; a bad hip, replace the hip; cataracts, get surgery, and you can see again. Plug up your 
heart muscle for over 50 or 60 years, open the chest and unplug the heart muscle with open-heart surgery. I have been to meetings where people have stood up at a meeting and said, `You know, I have a new knee. I have a new hip. I had cataract surgery and had some blockages removed with heart surgery,' and then said, `and we are sick of the Government spending money.' 
Well, all of that cost money in Medicare. It is remarkable. It is breathtaking. It is wonderful that people live longer and medical breakthroughs allow them the opportunity to walk when they couldn't have previously walked and see when they couldn't have seen--and to do other things that give them a better life. But it is also very costly. It has costs with expanded Medicare payments, and all of us must understand that. 
This program has grown largely because of success. The life span increases with breakthroughs in medical care. All of that spells more money in Medicare. We understand that. I think the American people accept that as a success story, except no one will believe it is a success story to have a program that has up to $20 billion a year of waste in the program. When the American people hear the stories that for a bottle of saline solution that you can go down to the drug store and buy for $1.03 and Medicare pays $7.90 for it, they have a right to say, `What on Earth is going on here?' Medicare will pay $211 for a home diabetes monitor used by diabetics to test their blood sugar levels. You can buy the same one not for $211 but for $39 at the local store; or the gauze pad that Medicare paid $2.33 for that you can buy for 23 cents. The American people have every right to say, `What on Earth is going on? If you can't run a program, get a crowd in here that can run a program.' Or, `If the Congress can't pass the laws to make sure it is run the right way, then get somebody else to pass the laws to make sure it is run the right way.' 
We ought to aggressively pursue fraud. When we see people committing fraud in Medicare, we ought to send them to jail, arrest them and prosecute them, and say, `You commit fraud against the American people, your address is going to be your jail cell to the end of your term.' When we see overbilling and overcharges, when we see administration that is not competent, we need to take action. 
The inspector general report of a week and a half ago sends another warning to this Congress that we must take action to prevent this kind of Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Mr. President, $20 billion a year is outrageous. If we are going to continue the support that is necessary for a Medicare Program that is important for this country, this Congress has to take action and take action soon. 
There are some remedies in the reconciliation bill that will come to the floor this week but not enough. We must do much, much more. I know there are Republicans and Democrats in this Congress anxious to work together on this problem to hopefully prevent there from ever again being another GAO report or inspector general report that provides this kind of awful news about a Federal program that is so important to so many Americans. 
Madam President, with that I conclude my remarks.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill introduced just yesterday by Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, the code of conduct on arms transfers. 
Many of our colleagues will recall that Senator Hatfield was the leader on this issue prior to his retirement last year. He introduced this bill as S. 1677 in the 103d Congress and S. 326 in the 104th Congress. I cosponsored both bills, and I was pleased to offer the code of conduct as an amendment to last year's foreign operations appropriations bill. 
I am delighted that the Senator from Massachusetts is showing his usual leadership on arms control issues by authoring this bill in this Congress. 
This is a particularly timely effort because the code of conduct is a part of the version of the State Department authorization bill approved by the House of Representatives, a bill that is now in conference between the House and the Senate. I hope that by introducing this bill we will encourage our Senate colleagues on the conference committee to support the House provision.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have on previous occasions come to the floor of the Senate to support amendments offered by the Senator from Arkansas to strike the funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. I must say that I was surprised and very pleased by the actions taken by the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina and the subcommittee to strike the funding in the subcommittee and recommend to the full Senate there be no funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. 
The chairman and the ranking member say it very simply. They simply cut the $30 million out. In their report, they tell us that: 
The National Endowment for Democracy was originally established in 1984 during the days of the cold war as a public-private partnership to promote democratic movements behind the Iron Curtain. Limited U.S. Government funds were viewed as a way to help leverage private contributions and were never envisioned as the sole or major source of continuing funds for the National Endowment for Democracy. 
I might say parenthetically, it wasn't really a private-public partnership, it was public funding. There was never very much private money available. But the subcommittee says: 
Since the cold war is over, the committee believes the time has come to eliminate Federal funding for this program. 
Once again, I am pleased by this recommendation. I think it is the right recommendation. 
We have a weed in North Dakota out in ranching and farming country called the leafy spurge. The leafy spurge is kind of an ugly weed. It grows anywhere, without moisture. You just can't get rid of it. You can cut it, you can spray it, you can mutilate it, you can dig it up, and you come back and it is still growing. We have some things in the Federal budget that remind me a little bit of leafy spurge. It doesn't matter what you do, you just can't kill it. 
The chairman and the ranking member bring a proposal to this floor from the committee that says this program is a program that is done, it ought not be funded. I think the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from South Carolina, and others, have said it well. Most taxpayers, I think, would be surprised to discover that we were spending nearly $30 million and we were dividing it up and saying to groups, `Take this and go around the world and promote democracy.' We would give a pretty big chunk to the National Democratic Party. Then we would give an equivalent chunk to the Republican Party, because you can't give to one without the other. Then we would give a big chunk of money to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and then give an equivalent amount of money to the AFL-CIO, and we would say, `With this, promote democracy, promote free enterprise, promote unionism.' 
It is 1997. The cold war is over. The Soviet Union doesn't exist. There is no Berlin Wall. There is no Warsaw Pact. Democracy has marched across the continents on this Earth, and yet, today, we face an amendment that says, `Let us decide to continue to spend $30 million a year for the National Endowment for Democracy.' 
I must tell you that I sort of view these things also in the context of what else is necessary to be done. The Senator from New Hampshire talked about trying to make a telephone call from a U.S. embassy on foreign soil to the United States or to use a computer in an American embassy abroad to try and connect to the United States. He talked about the Department's equipment needs, and I understand that. I think most of us have seen that first hand. He is talking about the needs of the State Department. 
Those needs are great, and yet the funding to meet those needs is cut under this amendment, in order to pay for this $30 million for the National Endowment for Democracy. 
There are other needs that frustrate me from time to time, sufficient so that I sit and grit my teeth and wonder why, why can't you get something so small done that would help people who are so important? But you just can't. And yet $30 million is available for a National Endowment for Democracy. 
I think for 4 or 5 years, I have come to this floor to try to get, first, $1 million, then $2 million, to deal with the issue of child abuse on Indian reservations. I have been unsuccessful all these years to get that money. 
I held a hearing one day, and at the hearing, we heard the story of Tamara DeMaris, a young Indian girl 3 years old who was put in a foster home, and they didn't have enough time to check out the foster home. So this 3-year-old girl was in this foster home, and a drunken party ensued. The 3-year-old girl was beaten severely, her hair was torn out at the roots, her arm was broken and her nose was broken. Why? Because she was put in a foster home and no one checked to see that the foster home was safe. Why? Because one person had 150 cases of children who needed help and didn't have time to check the foster home. 
At a hearing on this issue of child abuse, I had a young woman sit at the table and begin to weep. She was in charge of child welfare. She said, `I have stacks of folders on the floor alleging physical abuse and sexual abuse that haven't even been investigated because I don't have the money.' She began to weep. She said, `I don't even have the ability to transport kids to a doctor.' 
I tried for 4 or 5 years to get money to start a pilot project to deal with those child abuse issues. The money is not available. But $30 million for the National Endowment for Democracy? A big chunk to the AFL-CIO, to the chamber of commerce, to each political party, and then send some contracts around the world, fly around the world to meetings in the biggest cities in the world and talk about democracy? 
We are going to come to a portion of appropriations, as the Senator from Arkansas said, where we will spend $4 billion for something called the Agency for International Development. That is a program that promotes democracy abroad. That is a program that helps people around the rest of the world. Four billion dollars, I am told. The U.S. Information Agency is a program that helps people around the world; Food for Peace; the contribution we make to NATO. 
I was asking somebody today, if we contributed the same amount of our national income as all of our NATO partners do to the defense of Europe, what would it mean to us? I discovered something interesting: $100 billion a year of savings. If we were contributing the same average amount for defense as all of our allies are contributing, $100 billion a year. Think of that. 
So we spend $100 billion extra a year to promote democracy, to help our allies, to help defend the free world, and then we spend money in AID, we spend money in USIA, we spend money in Food for Peace in a dozen other ways, and then we want to duplicate it in a minuscule program that doesn't have a reason for being, except that we fund it and it sets up a very well-connected board. The Senator from New Hampshire said, I guess he called it the club, I think that was the reference. 
I don't know much about this club. The names I see are some of the most distinguished Americans, no question about that, people for whom I have great respect. I would expect every single one of them associated with this organization would support the organization. I understand that. 
The point is, we spend billions and billions of dollars supporting democracy abroad through this Government's programs--the foreign aid program, the Food for Peace Program, USIA, AID, and dozens of others--and there is not a need when the cold war is over, when there is no Soviet Union, when times have changed, to resurrect a $30 million program that this subcommittee decided it wanted to kill. 
It is unusual to see a bill come to the floor of the Senate with a recommendation that says, you know, this program has outlived its usefulness. This program is no longer needed. This money ought to be saved. It is very unusual to see that happen here in Congress. But it happened today when Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings brought a recommendation to the floor saying this organization that produces these slick annual reports is no longer necessary. 
That conclusion is contested by some who say, yes, it is. We want $30 million more added to the bill to support the continued existence of this organization, the National Endowment for Democracy. 
We live in the greatest democracy on the face of this Earth. Half of the people in the last election said they did not want to go vote. If we want to endow a democracy, let us invest this $30 million here, let us continue an investment in this democracy. 
You know, I know some people look at, I suppose, some of the things I talk about on trade and other things I talk about and say, `Well, it's some of the same old story, kind of isolationist, and don't understand things, can't see over the horizon. You just don't have the vision, the breadth of understanding that it takes to know why this is necessary.' 
I think I do understand this. 
I am not a foreign policy expert by any means, nor am I an isolationist, nor do I believe the world is growing larger--it is growing smaller--nor do I believe that we do not have to be involved in what is happening in the rest of the world. But this country can no longer afford to spend money it does not have on things it does not need. And it does not need the National Endowment for Democracy, an organization with a fancy title, that gives its money to the AFL-CIO, the chamber of commerce, the two national political parties, and then goes without much strain to promote democracy abroad. 
There is plenty of democracy to promote here at home, plenty of reasons to decide either to save this money or to invest it here in things we need to do in this country and use the promotion of democracy as it is effectively done in AID, in USIA, and Food For Peace, and so many other organizations, yes, including, as Senator Bumpers said, the foreign aid bill. That is where we promote the principles of democracy abroad. It is where it should be promoted. 
Finally, let me just say this. This organization was created on a recommendation offered in 1983, created in 1984 in the middle of the cold war, I assume for good purposes at that time, for people who felt it was a necessary organization. It is now no longer necessary. 
The subcommittee is dead right. This is a colossal waste of the taxpayers' money. If we cannot kill this organization, and end this funding, then in my judgment we have a very difficult time taking a look at other areas of questionable funding and making the right choice. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been working on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which I hoped to have the agreement of a number of Members of the Senate who have similar interests on the issue of the using universal service funds for the purpose of reaching a balanced budget in the budget reconciliation conference that is now going on. I know that sounds foreign as a subject to those who are not familiar with it, but I want to explain it a little bit and describe why this is important. 
I have spoken to a number of Senators in the Chamber this evening--Senator Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hollings, Senator Daschle, Senator Snowe, and others who are concerned about something that is happening in the reconciliation conference that could have a significant impact on the cost of telephone service in rural areas in this country in the years ahead. Here is what it is. 
Our country has been fortunate to enjoy the benefits of a telecommunications system that says it does not matter where you live. If you live in an area where you have very high-cost service, there will be something called a universal service fund that helps drive down that high cost so that everyone in this country can afford telephone service, universally affordable telephone service. That is what the universal service fund is designed to do and has been designed to do for a long, long while. I come from a town of 300 people and telephone service there is affordable because the universal service fund drives down the rate of what would otherwise be high cost. The benefits of a national system is that every telephone in the country makes every other telephone more valuable. A telephone in my hometown in Regent, ND, makes Donald Trump's telephone more valuable in New York City because he can reach that telephone in Regent, ND. That is the whole concept of universally affordable telephone service, and it is why we have a universal service fund. 
Now, having said that, the universal service fund was reconstructed some--but not dramatically--during the Telecommunications Act passed by Congress a year and a half ago. We now have a balanced budget proposal that is in conference between the House and the Senate and some are saying in this negotiation that they want to use the revenues from the universal service fund out in the year 2002 in order to help plug a leak on the budget side. 
The fact is the universal service fund was never intended to be used for such a purpose. In fact, the universal service fund does not belong to the Government. It does not come into the Federal Treasury and is not expended by the Federal Government. It, therefore, ought not be a part of any discussion on budget negotiations, and yet it is. 
This week I have spoken several times to the Office of Management and Budget, and they have explained to me in great detail with no clarity at all why it is now part of this process. I have spoken to people who claim to be experts on this, and none of them have the foggiest idea about what the proposal actually does. 
Now, the reason I come to the floor to speak about it is this: We are nearing presumably the end of a conference, and if a conference report comes to the floor of the Senate using the 
universal service fund as part of a manipulated set of revenues in the year 2002, in order to reach some sort of budget figure, it will be an enormous disservice for the universal service fund. It will deny the purpose of the fund for which we in the Commerce Committee worked so hard to preserve in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This provision in the reconciliation bill will set a precedent that will be a terrible precedent for the future. The result will be, I guarantee, higher phone bills in rural areas in this country in the years ahead. 
I once stopped at a hotel in Minneapolis, MN, and there was a sign at the nearest parking space to the front door, and it said `Manager's parking space.' And then below it, it said, `Don't even think about parking here.' I don't expect anybody ever parked in that space besides the manager. Don't even think about parking here. I hope that the Senate will pass the sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have proposed that says to the reconciliation conference: `do not even think about this.' I say to the budget reconciliation conferees: `do not try to bring to the floor of the Senate or the House a budget reconciliation conference report that manipulates and misuses the universal service fund.' It is not right, it is not fair, and it will destroy the underpinnings of what we have done in telecommunications policy to provide affordable telephone service across this country for all Americans. Yes, especially, most especially Americans who live in the rural areas of this country. 
I have enormous respect for those people who put these budgets together. It is not easy. But this instance of using the universal service fund as is now being proposed is, I am afraid, budget juggling at its worst. Juggling I suppose at a carnival or in the backyard is entertaining. Juggling in this circumstance using universal fund support to manipulate the numbers in 2002 is not entertaining to me. It is fundamentally wrong. This money does not belong to the Federal Government. It does not come to the Federal Treasury, and it is not spent by the Federal Government and has no place and no business in any reconciliation conference report. 
I was flabbergasted to learn that it was there and it is being discussed. I have spoken to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget about this several times this week, spoken to others who are involved with it. And I must tell you I think that the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and any member of the conference that espouses this is making a terrible, terrible mistake. I hope that the Senate will pass the sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have proposed and that we can garner the support of the position I now espouse to say as that parking sign, `don't even think about this.' It is wrong, and it will disserve the interests that we have fought so hard to preserve affordable telephone service all across this country. 
The Senator from South Carolina has spent a great deal of time on this issue, as has the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Maine, and so many others. As I said, the wording is not yet agreed to on the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I hope it will be very shortly, and when it is I hope we will pass it and send a message that any conference report that comes back here ought not use universal service support funds because they are not our funds to use. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a number of us this morning want to visit about the issue of tax cuts. We are having a debate--I was going to say a dispute, but it is more a debate--in Congress, between the House and the Senate and between Members of both parties, about how taxes should be cut. It is clear now from the votes in the House and the Senate that there will be a tax cut. We do have bills in conference that call for a tax cut in a number of different ways--cuts in the income tax, cuts in estate tax, cuts in capital gains and a range of other areas. But there is substantial debate about who gets what. 
Mr. President, the debate is not idle, and it is not just political. I suppose there is some partisanship involved in this as well, but when you say that the Federal Government has the capability of reducing taxes for the American people, the question then is, for whom and by how much and with what purpose? The stakes are fairly large because we are talking about a fairly substantial tax reduction, and the question is how to divide that. 
There has been a dispute on the floor of the Senate about what the numbers show and who puts together a chart that shows what part of the population will get how much in tax relief. There have been editorials written about that in the Washington Post, New York Times, and others and a substantial amount of analysis of these charts. 
One thing to me is certain, however. There are impulses in Congress to define how we provide a tax cut in a narrow way in order that the tax cut ends up providing substantially greater benefits to those at the upper end of the economic ladder than those at the lower end of the economic ladder. I happen to come from a part of the country that largely believes that the 
economic engine in this country comes from work, from people who go out and work and toil all day. That represents the economic engine that keeps this country going. They earn a wage and they have a view about the future in this country. 
If their view is optimistic, if their view is positive, then they make decisions with the money they have earned. They perhaps buy a washer or dryer, buy a car, buy a home, take a vacation. If their view is pessimistic or if their outlook is less than positive, they make decisions to defer those purchases. They don't buy a washer or dryer. They defer it. They don't buy a car. So our economy really rests on a cushion of confidence. 
You can talk to all the economists in the world, you can talk to the best trained people in this country in the field of economics, and it doesn't matter what they say. What matters is that the American economy rides on a pillow of confidence. If it exists, the American economy does well; if it doesn't, the American economy retracts. 
People in this country generally feel pretty good today. The economy is generally moving in the right direction. Unemployment is down, inflation is down, the deficit is down, way down. People feel pretty good. Economic growth is up. The result is we have more revenue coming in to the Federal coffers, and the decision by Congress is to give some back in the form of tax cuts. Then the question is, to whom? 
I come from a town of about 400 people, when I left. It is now 300 people. If, in my hometown making this decision, a local community decision, we had proposed what is proposed in terms of the distribution now in Congress of this tax cut, I think it would cause some real consternation. 
Let's think just a moment about my hometown of 400 people. When there is a meeting, they put a little sign in the middle of Main Street, because there is not that much traffic and the sign won't be knocked down, that says, `Meeting tonight, 8 o'clock, the Legion Hall.' Then folks come to the meeting. 
So they come to the Legion Hall, and 400 of them would come and we would say, `All right, now we have some money we want to distribute here, and it comes from you because you pay taxes. The question is, How shall we give it back?' And someone in the back of the room stands up and says, `I have an idea. Why don't we give 60 percent of this money to those four people sitting up in the front row. Out of 400, we will take 4 of them. That is 1 percent. One percent of the people, those four people we propose should get 60 percent of what we are going to give back.' 
Gosh, I think that would cause real trouble in that room. Let's assume they are all working now, all working, all paying taxes, but we say, `Let's have the four people up in front get 60 percent of the tax cut.' 
Then we say, `Let's take the bottom 20 percent, let's take 80 people who make the least money in town. They are working, but they make the least money in town, the lowest wages. They are having the toughest time. Let's take those 80 people and have them move their chair over to the left side of the building, and we are going to give them one-half of 1 percent of the tax cut.' Gosh, I don't think that is a decision my hometown would make in a million years, not if they are all working. 
Yet, that is what is at the root of the proposals in Congress. It is to say, if we are going to give a tax cut, let's give it back only on the basis of taxes paid, sufficient so that we say let's have a child tax credit of $500 per child, but you don't get it if you don't make enough money. It's true if you are working, in two-thirds of the cases, the American workers are paying more in payroll taxes, yes, to the Federal Government, more in payroll taxes than they are paying in taxes. But those in the bowels of this decisionmaking process say, `Payroll taxes don't count. We don't want to measure payroll taxes that you pay in terms of whether or not you should get a tax cut; it is only taxes.' 
The result is this family. Lashawn Buckman is from Washington, DC. She works downtown as an administrative assistant in a hospital. She is expected to earn about $25,000 this year. She has a child aged 3 and a child aged 7. She will pay about $3,250 in income and payroll taxes this year, and under the bill that was passed by the House of Representatives, despite the fact that it advertises a $500-per-child tax credit, she will get no income tax cut. She will get no tax cut at all, because she doesn't quite earn enough money. She pays a substantial amount of payroll taxes, works hard, but she is defined as ineligible. 
To those of us who think she ought to be eligible, we are told by those who oppose it that we are proposing welfare. No, we are proposing giving some taxes back to someone who works who pays substantial payroll taxes. 
Here is another family. Elisa Garcia lives in Fairfax County, VA, and works for a technology firm. She makes about $10 an hour, works 40 hours a week. She works hard. She expects to earn about $20,800 this year. She has three children --George, Samantha, and Liz. They are 6, 10, and 15 years of age. She pays about $2,200 in taxes and payroll taxes, and under the tax bill passed both by the House and the Senate, she will receive no tax reduction. She works hard, she pays taxes, but because of the way we have defined it, we say it doesn't count. Unless you are paying a specific amount of income tax and unless you are in a specific income category, it doesn't count, you don't count as a taxpayer and, therefore, when it comes time to provide some tax relief, you don't get any. 
The reason I mention this is we have a lot of occupations in this country. This is from Parade magazine describing the incomes of people that just get left out. This would not happen in my hometown, I don't think. I think if everybody came to a meeting in that town, and 400 people said, `Let's decide how to divide up the tax cuts,' they would say, `Everybody is working and paying taxes, so let's have everybody get something back from this tax cut.' 
Here is a store owner, $25,000. They are not going to get anything. They don't make enough money. A preschool teacher, $11,000; a medical technician, $13,000; an assistant store manager, a nurse, a policeman, they do not make enough money. They pay payroll taxes, but they do not make enough money to get a tax cut. I am sorry, that is wrong. And we have a chance to correct it. 
The opportunity to correct it exists right now in that conference committee, the opportunity to say to this country that it is wrong to provide 60 percent of the tax cut to the top 1 percent of the American people. 
It is right to decide that we ought not continue to decide that we should tax work and exempt investment. It is right to decide that we ought to have a fair distribution of the tax cuts so that all of the American people who are out there working are benefited by this proposed cut in taxes. 
Mr. President, my colleague from New Jersey is here, and I appreciate him coming to the floor today to speak about this same subject. Let me yield the floor to him for as much time as he may consume.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend Senators Cochran and Bumpers for the excellent bill they crafted to fund many crucial programs affecting American agriculture. They have done a superb job of balancing the competing yet meritorious interests covered in this legislation. It was a pleasure working with them as a new member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and I thank them for the generous way in which they responded to my requests to ensure that the needs of North Dakota farmers and ranchers were addressed. 
There is one issue which was not addressed in this bill which is of great concern to me. I hope it will be addressed in conference. The buildings and facilities account of the Cooperative State Research, Extension, and Education Service received no funding in this bill. While I understand the chairman's desire not to continue to fund this construction account, I think it is unfair not to fulfill our responsibilities to complete the projects in the pipeline. There are a number of institutions in this category. These institutions have already received partial Federal funding, have met all the program requirements, including their 50-percent State matching requirement, but they cannot be completed unless the conference committee provides the balance of the Federal funding needed to do so. 
North Dakota State University [NDSU] falls into this category, and it is a unique case. Since fiscal year 1992, it has received approximately $1.9 million in Federal funds for an animal care research facility. It was not until June 30, 1995, when the House indicated in its report on the fiscal year 1996 Agriculture appropriations bill that it was making an `in depth review of policies and practices related to this program,' that there was any indication that the program might be changed. In fact, it was not until September 28, 1995, that we had notice that time might be of importance and that it was the conference committee's intent to terminate the program after fiscal year 1997. 
Since North Dakota has a biennial legislature, which did not meet in 1996, it could not meet its 50-percent cost share requirement in 1996. When the legislature met early in 1997, it appropriated the relevant State cost share funds for this facility. Let me repeat, the only reason NDSU did not meet the committee's 1996 requirement is that it could not since our State legislature did not meet. 
The animal care facility at North Dakota State University is an extremely important project for the State and the region. Livestock production is a $1 billion industry in our State. It is likely to grow. But livestock disease is always a threat to the industry, especially some of the anabiotic-resistant organisms and viruses we have to deal with today. Work in this proposed facility can help protect incomes in the livestock industry by reducing livestock disease and deaths, contributing to the development of more effective pharmaceuticals and helping to ensure the quality and safety of food products. This facility is absolutely crucial to the future health and growth of agriculture in our region. 
Not to provide the balance of the Federal funds necessary to complete this facility, when North Dakota State University and the North Dakota State Legislature acted in good faith, seems unfair to me, and I urge my colleagues on the conference committee to seek an equitable solution to this problem. 
Again, I thank the chairman and ranking members, Senators Cochran and Bumpers, and their excellent staffs, especially Becky Davies and Galen Fountain, for all their help on this bill.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, I rise to comment briefly on an action taken by the Senate last week. We voted on an amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, expressing the sense of the Senate that China should not receive most-favored-nation tariff treatment. 
I voted against the Hutchinson amendment, but not because I necessarily support the further extension of most-favored-nation status to China. I opposed the amendment because I believe this kind of amendment should not have been offered to a must-pass appropriations bill, especially when the Senate had limited time to debate it. 
At the appropriate time, we do need to have an extensive debate concerning our trade relationship with China. That debate is long overdue and greatly needed, and that debate should cover a range of issues. One of the issues that we should debate is the geometric growth in our trade deficit with China. In the past dozen years, our merchandise trade deficit with China has grown from $10 million to the staggering total of $40 billion. 
Mr. President, trade is only beneficial if it is a two-way street. And right now there is no way that we can characterize our trading relationship with China in that way. We do not have reciprocal, free, and open access to China's markets. 
Yes, our exports to China may have grown threefold and more since 1980, from $3.6 to $12 billion. However, Chinese exports to America during the same period grew almost fiftyfold, from $1.1 to $51.5 billion. 
China is a critical part of the overall trade crisis that we face right now. We have the largest merchandise trade deficit in our history. Our second highest trade deficit is with China. China is rapidly working to build its manufacturing base and export trade. It is following in the footsteps of Japan, which has consistently been the country with which we have had our largest individual trade deficit. 
We need to be concerned because trade statistics released last week indicated that for the third time in history, our monthly trade deficit with China exceeded our monthly trade deficit with Japan. That should give us cause to take a second look in considering what the future may bring in our trade relationship with China. 
So I am very concerned about our trading relationship with China. But we ought to have a substantial debate on this issue. We ought not offer an MFN amendment to an unrelated appropriations bill, have a quick little debate, and then vote. 
At the proper time, let us have a real debate about our trade relationship with China. Let us talk about trade deficits, market access, and reciprocity. Let us talk about selling more American wheat, oilseeds, beef, pork, and other agricultural commodities to China. Let us talk about China's tariff and nontariff trade barriers, content rules, and labor systems. Let us debate most-favored-nation status for China and the MFN law itself. And, most certainly, let us debate the issues of religious freedom and human rights in China, since these should have a bearing too on whether we grant MFN status to China. 
These are important issues that deserve full and thoughtful consideration by this body and our entire Nation. I look forward to contributing to that debate, and hope that it can be done in a way that is productive and useful for the people of this country.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to visit today on the floor of the Senate about something that will come to the Senate, according to what I read in all the journals and newspaper articles, in the month of September. This will be a request from the Clinton administration to the Congress to give them something called fast-track trade authority. 
This poster behind me will tell my colleagues of course how I feel about fast track. There will not be any great suspense by those who look at this poster to understand that I think fast-track trade authority is the wrong track for this country. I want to spend a little time talking about what fast track is. I expect most people in the country are unfamiliar with the term. What is fast-track trading authority? And why are we debating it? 
Just the words `fast track' tell a story. We all come from towns that have understood what the word `fast' means. We have all had some folks come through our town with the modern-day equivalent of the old covered wagon and the fellow wearing silk pants and a silk shirt and a top hat, selling some sort of bottled medicine that cures everything from hiccups to the gout--the fast talker, fast-buck artist. We know about fast food and fast lanes. 
This is fast track. What does fast track mean? Congress under the U.S. Constitution has the authority on trade issues. I will put up a chart which shows that authority in the Constitution. Fast track means that Congress will take its authority and essentially subjugate its authority to a process by which an administration will go out and negotiate a trade agreement and then bring it back to Congress with an understanding that there shall not be any amendments on the agreement. Fast track means that every Member of Congress will be prevented from offering an amendment to the trade agreement. 
The Constitution of the United States in article 1, section 8 says, `The Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate commerce with foreign nations.' Interpreted, it means that the responsibility for the issue of trade resides here in the Congress. We also have an executive branch and a President and an office of Trade Ambassador and others who go out and negotiate trade agreement with other countries. 
Of course, it is a different world now than it was. We have much more commerce, back and forth across the oceans, country to country, and across national borders. So then the question is, who wins and who loses in this trade? Some would have us believe that everyone wins in every circumstance. 
I was on an interview show last Thursday in downtown Washington, DC, with Jack Kemp. Jack Kemp has a view about trade, and he is a good friend of mine. I like Jack Kemp a lot, but his view of trade is, `All trade is just fine, because everybody wins. Open it up and expand it and everybody wins.' 
However, that is not the case in international trade. There are winners and there are losers. Yes, expanded, freer, and more open trade is good for the world. There is no question about that. But trade rules that are fair are required in order that one country is not winning at the expense of the other country that is losing. I want to talk a little about that today and how that fits with my concern about the issue of fast track. 
Now, there are a lot of things that are right in this country at the moment. We have a country that tends almost inevitably to insist on talking about what is wrong. But, there are a lot of things right in this country. Our economy is growing. It has been growing for some long while. Unemployment is down, way down. Inflation is down, way down, 5 years in a row, and is almost nonexistent. The Federal budget deficit is down, and has been for 5 years in a row. 
The fact is, there is some good economic news in this country. People feel better about the future. Our economy rests on a cushion of confidence. When people are confident about the future, they make decisions that reflect that confidence. They will buy a car. They will buy a house, buy a washing machine, or buy a television set. If they are not confident about the future, they make the opposite choice. They decide not to purchase that washing machine or that car or that house. So our economy rests on a notion of confidence. 
Do people have confidence about the future? At this point they do have more confidence about the future than they had in the past. It is because most of the fundamentals about our economy are moving in the right direction with one exception, and that is the area of international trade. 
People look to this country and say, well, gee, in international trade, America is remarkably successful. It is not. Two centuries ago, this country was known as a country of shrewd Yankee traders. We could outtrade anybody anywhere any time, the shrewd Yankee traders from that new United States of America. What happened? 
What happened was that in the last half century, following the Second World War, our trade policy inevitably became our foreign policy. We did not have a trade policy; we had a foreign policy with other countries. That foreign policy drove all of the trade decisions we made--with Japan, with Europe, with all of our trading partners. 
Our trade policy was driven by our foreign policy. At the time, of course, we were bigger, stronger, and had greater capability of dealing in international trade. We could whip almost any of these countries with one arm tied behind our back. That is how strong our economy was compared to a Japanese economy that was wrecked by World War II, a European economy that was wrecked by World War II and in tatters and trying to rebuild. We could compete easily. We could provide concessions to every one of those countries, even giant concessions at that, and we did. Despite the fact that we did that, in the first 25 years after the Second World War, we saw continual wage gains in this country up and up and up, and we did very, very well. 
But then what happened was Japan and the Western European economies were rebuilt and became very strong. And, they became shrewd, tough, international competitors. Meanwhile, our trade policy with them was still driven by our foreign policy. 
With Japan, we began to become accustomed to deficits in international trade relations every single year. In recent years these have amounted to $40 to $50 billion, and even $60 billion a year trade deficits with Japan, every single year. The same has been true with some of our other trading partner relationships. 
Now in recent times we have had a series of trade negotiations, some of them under what is called the fast-track procedure. After every trade negotiation we have had days of feasting and rejoicing by those who negotiated them. They talked about how wonderful the agreements were for America, but at the conclusion of it our trade deficit kept growing and growing and growing. 
There has been angst in this Chamber, an enormous amount of discussion about the other deficit, the fiscal policy budget deficit, and it is a very serious problem. Fortunately, we have made significant progress in dealing with it. 
Yet, the deficit called the trade deficit does not provoke one utterance in this Chamber. No one talks about it, no one thinks much about it, and no one appears willing to lift a finger to do anything about it. I will show my colleagues and those watching these proceedings what has happened to the trade deficit. The merchandise trade deficit, that is, the imbalance or the deficit between what we ship into this country versus what we ship out, is this year 21 years old. We have had 21 straight years of trade deficits growing worse and worse every year. It is now of legal age, since we have had 21 years of trade deficits. 
Last year, we had the largest merchandise trade deficit in this country's history. Does it matter? Some say it does not. Some say it just does not matter at all. It means that we are importing cheap goods from around the world and so someone else has the American dollars that we paid for those goods. 
What will they do with these dollars? They will invest them in America. That is what they say. I suppose that suggests it does not matter who owns the productive facilities of our country or the real estate of our country or who owns much of the assets of our country. I don't happen to believe that, but I suppose some probably say it does not matter. There are those who believe it is an international economy, let the chips fall where they may, and if you cannot compete, you cannot compete. 
The dilemma is this: The U.S. producer and the U.S. employer can compete with anyone in this world as long as the competition is fair. But no U.S. worker and no U.S. employer ought to be required to compete against someone who works 14 hours a day, is 14 years old, and makes 14 cents an hour. Yet this goes on all across the 
world, as I speak. 
Is that fair competition? Should we expect someone in Toledo, Fargo, Denver, or Los Angeles to have to compete against 14-cent-an-hour wages? I don't think so. I don't think anyone actually believes that represents fair trade. 
Should we be expected to compete against a country that insists on shipping its goods in wholesale quantity to our country but keeps its market closed to the goods produced by American workers? I don't think so. That is not fair trade. 
Now, as a result of a number of those considerations, and others, we have a trade deficit that continues to grow. Fast track is a process that started back a couple of decades ago of negotiating trade agreements under a procedure called fast track so that no one could amend the trade agreement when it came back to Congress. 
Look what has happened under fast track. There is nothing but a sea of red ink. Is it because of fast track? I don't know. All I know is that within trade agreements there are serious problems. For example, the one we have with Canada results in a massive, massive problem with a flood of Canadian grain coming into our country unfairly and we cannot do a thing about it. We seem powerless to deal with it. 
I voted against the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement because I thought it was negotiated in a way that was fundamentally unfair to our country. I thought the negotiators effectively sold out the interests of American agriculture in negotiating that trade agreement. Now, we find ourselves now with a growing trade deficit with Canada, and an avalanche of Canadian grain flooding into our country, undercutting the price that farmers in our country received from an already weak grain market. Is that fair? I don't think it is fair. 
Let's take a look at NAFTA, the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the Uruguay round of GATT talks, the Tokyo round, all under fast track. What happens under fast track is that we negotiate a Tokyo round, bring it to Congress, shove it through the Congress, and say you have no right in Congress to amend it. 
Now, Congress decided that it should have no right to amend it. That is what fast track is all about. There was fast track with the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Shove it through Congress, with no right to amend it. None. Then there was NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Mexico--Congress had no right to amend it. I led the fight against fast track on this particular agreement when I was in the House of Representatives. We lost by about 30 or 40 votes. Then the Uruguay round comes to Congress. There was no right to amend it because fast track means that whatever they negotiate you have to accept up or down, with no amendments. 
The bars on this chart represent the merchandise trade deficits that we have had since these trade agreements were adopted through the use of fast track. Can anyone in this country who has not had a fifth of Wild Turkey take a look at these and say that this is success? You have to be dead drunk to believe this is a success. This is an abysmal failure. Part of it, in my judgment, comes from fast track. This is a process that says to negotiators, go out and negotiate and do what you want to do and bring it back, and then we will have a procedure in place that prevents any Member of Congress from correcting a mistake you might have made. This is not success. This ocean of red ink represents failure. 
Let me take a closer look at one of them in particular, the NAFTA agreement. The NAFTA agreement is a trade agreement that we negotiated with Canada and Mexico together. We already had the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. We rolled that into a broader agreement which included Mexico with NAFTA. Just prior to the time the NAFTA trade agreement was implemented, we had an $11 billion merchandise trade deficit with Canada and a $2 billion merchandise trade surplus with Mexico. 
Look at what has happened to this country since this agreement was phased in: The deficit with Canada has gone from $11 billion 
to $14 billion to $18 billion to $23 billion. Success? You would have to be dead drunk to call that a success. That is not a success. That is a failure. 
With Mexico, we had a $1 billion surplus in the first year of the trade agreement under NAFTA. The next year, we had a $15 billion deficit. The next year, it was a $16 billion deficit. In other words, we now have a nearly $40 billion combined trade deficit with both of our neighbors. 
So what does it matter, some say. `So what? Things are going fine. So what?' What it means is that in the past 21 years, we have accumulated close to a $2 trillion account deficit that will have to be repaid with a lower standard of living in this country at some point in the future. So what? So it means that we are inevitably weakening the production and the manufacturing sectors of this country. No country will long remain a world-class economy unless it has a world-class manufacturing sector. If it does not have a strong manufacturing base, it will not retain a strong world-class economy. You cannot have a strong economy just selling hamburgers and insurance and so on, back and forth to one another; you must have a strong manufacturing base. 
Now, let me describe a bit about what has happened with the free trade agreement. We were told that if the Congress passed something called NAFTA with Canada and Mexico that we would receive products that came from low-skilled jobs from Mexico. 
We were told that as a result of NAFTA, we would have more American jobs because of the trade agreement. Do you know that now, after a few years of NAFTA, we have more automobiles shipped into this country, produced in Mexico, than are shipped from America to the rest of the world? 
Let me say that again because I bet most people don't believe that to be the case. Now that we have opened these borders and we have allowed the largest enterprises in this country to go find the cheapest labor they can find, we now import more automobiles from Mexico than the United States exports to the rest of the world combined. 
Think about that. Why does all this matter? It matters because the manufacturing sector in this country is critical to an economy that is based on good jobs with good incomes. If we are going to produce shoes, pencils, automobiles, electronics products, and we are going to do that in Mexico, in Bangladesh, in Sri Lanka, in Indonesia, because we can hire a worker in those areas at a fraction of the cost of what it would require us to pay to hire a worker in the United States, what does that mean? It means production moves offshore. Our production moves overseas. What does that mean to the core of the economy in this country? It is weakened. 
The central question I ask about these trade relationships is whether it is fair trade? Is it fair trade for a company to be able to just pole vault over all of the problems in this country that they have in producing? For example, the problem of having to overcome a prohibition against hiring kids. We say in this country that you can't go hire a 12-year-old kid and work him 12 hours a day. That violates the Child Labor Act in this country. We say, you can't produce a product and dump chemicals into the air and throw chemicals into the water because we have environmental laws that prevent you from doing that. So that company can say, fine, if you say we can't hire kids, we can't dump chemicals and sewage into the water and air, we will go to a country where we can. We will produce it there and ship it back to Fargo and to Buffalo and we will ship it to Dallas and put it on the shelves of the stores to compete with products made in the United States, where you have had to pay higher wages and you have had to obey child labor laws and you have had to obey environmental laws. 
I question, is that fair trade? I don't think so. Yet, that is exactly what we are facing. Yes, we face it even close to our border, but especially in many other places around the world. 
We have a trade deficit in which 92 percent of the merchandise trade deficit is with six countries: Japan, with nearly $50 billion; China, $40 billion; Canada and Mexico with another $40 billion; and Germany. 
I was in China last November and met with the President of China and talked about our trade relationship. I have no idea whether I made any impact. He was a wonderful person. China has a terrific deal with this country. We talk a lot about most-favored-nation status here in this Chamber. We had a vote on it last week. I didn't think we should vote on that within an appropriations bill without any significant debate, so I voted against that amendment. But I specifically indicated that that wasn't a vote for me on the substance of the MFN issue. I think we ought to have a vote and a significant debate on most-favored-nation status for China. 
But let me say this. We talk a lot about most-favored-nation status and about human rights. Certainly human rights is very important. The week I was in China, a fellow--I believe his name was Wang Dan--was sentenced to 9 years in prison for criticizing the government. Those human rights are important. 
At the same there is something else that is also important. What about a country that is exponentially increasing its trade surplus with this country? We have become a cash cow for the hard currency needs of China. Again, it weakens us and strengthens them. They ship us their goods. In fact, almost half the Chinese exports come to the United States of America, and yet, we get so 
few goods into China. 
We ought to say to China, to Japan, to Canada, and to others, that we expect and demand reciprocal and fair trade treatment, and if you don't give it to us, the United States marketplace is not open to you. The U.S. marketplace is open to you if you treat us fairly. Yes, we are willing to compete. We should be required to compete. But the competition ought to be fair. If it is not, then we ought to have the nerve and the will to stand up to these countries and say it is not fair to this country. And, it is not fair to American workers and to American producers either. 
In September, when we have a debate on fast track, I am going to be on the floor fighting as hard as I know how to fight to prevent us from granting fast-track authority for new trade talks. Do I support the trade officials? Yes, I want them to succeed. I want them to negotiate something that they can win for a change. I am really tired of us losing in international trade talks. 
Let me give you some specifics. Last Saturday morning, in Minot, ND, I met with a group of grain producers. These are family farmers, who raise Durum and spring wheat. They have one problem. On the horizon of trade problems, is this big or significant? Probably not, on the whole horizon. But to them it is it big. You bet. In many cases, it is a question of whether they survive and do they make it. 
Here is their problem. We had a fellow named Clayton Yeutter go to Canada and negotiate a trade agreement with the Canadians. I didn't vote for that. I said at the time that I thought it was a terribly flawed agreement. At that time, I didn't know of the side deal that had not been made public. That side deal that had been made with the Canadians was about how to compute whether or not there was a subsidy for grains. When that was made public, it just destroyed my faith in these kinds of negotiations. 
So now we find ourselves down the road some years from the United States-Canadian Free Trade Agreement and here's what we have. We have a Northern border with wonderful people. They are good neighbors of ours. We share a lot and we have a lot of commerce back and forth. 
However, in the area of grain, we have had a flood of grain coming across, especially Durum, since this agreement. For those who don't know what that is, let me explain. Durum is the wheat you grind into something called semolina flour and that is what you use to make macaroni and other pasta. Eighty percent of the Durum produced in America is produced in North Dakota. So if you are buying some noodles or elbow macaroni or spaghetti, you are likely buying something, if it is sourced in this country, that was raised somewhere in a field, or grew somewhere in a field in North Dakota. The Durum market is a very important market to our farmers. 
Well, we passed the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement and all of a sudden, a flood of Canadian Durum came into our country, a literal flood of Canadian Durum and, following it, other wheat and barley. But you can't get much grain into Canada. I have told my colleagues before about the time that I got in a little orange truck with Earl Jensen, and we took Earl's orange truck up to the Canadian border with 200 bushels of North Dakota Durum to try to get it into Canada. They said, `No, you can't go across the border here.' 
We had a woman from Bowman, ND, who lived in Canada. She married a Canadian and went home to Bowman for Thanksgiving, and she had a desire to bake some whole wheat bread. So she took a sack of hard red spring wheat--good for baking bread--and she couldn't take that back to Canada. This was at a time when over 50 million bushels of Canadian wheat was coming into our country. Truckload after truckload that were clogging our roads. This lady got to the border and wanted to take in one grocery sack full of wheat in order to make whole wheat bread. Guess where it ended up? Dumped on the ground because you can't take one grocery sack of wheat into Canada these days. 
Are our farmers angry about this? You're darn right. Do they have a right to be angry? Absolutely. They have a right to be 
furious about a trade relationship that is fundamentally unfair to our side. Now, can we get someone to fix it? We are trying. Mickey Kantor, a former Trade Ambassador, took the first step. The fact is that it got better for a time. But once again, this flood of wheat is exceeding the limits we had agreed to with Canada. 
I use that illustration only to say that this example is just but one of the examples of problems we have with trade issues that you can't solve anymore, because we pass trade agreements with something called fast track. Under fast track you can't fix them when they are here. You either have to vote yes or no, up or down, and the result is that these flawed agreements then become law. Those treaties or agreements are then wedded into American law and it prevents us from providing remedies for the trade problems that exist--yes, with Japan, with China, with Canada, with Mexico, and others. 
I think it is time for us to decide to put a stop to it. I think it is time for us to say to negotiators in trade that you go negotiate just as all of the other negotiators do. When we send someone abroad to negotiate arms agreements, they don't do so under fast track. We didn't have fast-track authority to prevent any amendments on the floor of the House or Senate on the nuclear arms reduction treaties that we had. There was no fast track there. Why on earth, if we don't need fast track on arms control agreements, do we need it on trade agreements? Are our trade negotiators so weak, so inept that somehow they need fast track when others don't? 
Last Friday, the Commerce Department released the statistics that describe what happened to our trade numbers for the month of May. It indicated that our trade deficit in goods, the merchandise trade deficit for the month of May, was $17 billion, just for the month of may. That is up from $15.5 billion in the month of April. The big news was that China's trade deficit exceeded Japan's trade deficit for the month, for the third time in history. 
These monthly statistics demonstrate another failure in trade. Unfortunately, it is greeted with a series of yawns here in the Congress and in this town. Were someone to try to put an op-ed piece in, for example, the Washington Post about this issue, they would say, no, thank you, they don't do those kinds of pieces. You can't have a debate about trade issues in this town, because too many believe there are only two sides of this issue. On one side there are those who say we are for free trade, free, expanded, and open trade, and that is good for the world. And they say everyone who doesn't subscribe to that is somehow an uninformed xenophobic stooge who wants to put walls around America. Those are the two camps that you are put into. You are either for free trade, period, or you are some sort of xenophobic, isolationist stooge. That is just a thoughtless way to deal with what I think is a significant problem for this country. 
This country needs to understand that our trade policy ought to disconnect from our foreign policy. Our trade policy in dealing with trade competitors who are savvy, tough, and shrewd, ought to be a policy that cares about the well-being of this country. I believe in open and expanded and more trade. I also demand that it be fair. If it is not fair, we ought to say to other countries, you either get it fair and allow entry to our products on a fair basis, or we are not going to continue this one-way relationship. 
This is not going back to some Smoot-Hawley notion of how we should trade. It is not calling for higher tariffs; nothing of the sort. It is demanding of other countries that we stop being mistreated. It is demanding of other countries that those who believe they can continue to access our marketplace must understand that their marketplace will have to be open as a consequence of that, and the failure to open it means that we will impose reciprocal trade treatment on our trading partners. 
Now, we are going to have a meeting in the next day or two with the United States Trade Ambassador and the Secretary of Agriculture to talk about the issues of United States-Canada grain. That is but one issue among these larger sets of issues, but nevertheless it is important. I hope that this issue doesn't continue to fester. I hope that this side, that this Government and this country, will say to the Canadians on the grain issue: You can't do that. We are not going to allow you to do that. 
But my experience has been, regrettably, over many years, that standing up for this country's interests has been the exception rather than the rule in trade issues. All too often our country backs away and says, well, we don't want to ruffle any feathers here. 
I am just a little tired of that. 
When China wants to buy airplanes, guess what? China is a huge market with 1.2 billion or so people, and they need to buy airplanes. So I am told that China comes to our country and says to us, `Well, we need to buy some airplanes, and we don't manufacture airplanes. But instead of buying it from you, what we want you to do is bring your technology and produce it in China.' 
I don't understand that either. This country ought not be interested in that. When we have a country with a $40 billion trade surplus with us, or we a deficit with them, and they need something we have, then they ought to buy it from us off the shelf. China ought to buy more wheat from us. They ought to buy airplanes from us produced in this country with U.S. employees and from U.S. companies. 
We ought not to continue to allow our trading relationships to be foreign policy relationships. They ought to be economic relationships with tough, shrewd negotiators working out relationships where the rules are fair, where our employees and our producers can expect fair treatment and fair ability to compete. 
So, in September when the President brings to this Congress a request for fast-track trading authority, I intend to be on the floor of the Senate saying no. I have no idea how many of my colleagues will join me. I know for sure as I stand here today that those of us who do say no will be branded as some sort of isolationists. Those who do that are wrong and thoughtless, but they will do it. 
But I will insist that finally this country have the nerve and the will to stand up for itself and its interests. I believe that my children will inherit, just as they inherit the budget deficit, a trade deficit that means we will have a lower standard of living in this country unless we take action to deal with it and deal with it effectively. 
Let me conclude where I began. This country can compete on any terms anywhere in this world as long as the rules are fair. But we have not been able to satisfactorily conclude trade negotiations in recent decades in any reasonable way that gives us the feeling--or at least gives me the feeling--that we have succeeded. 
Time after time after time our trade negotiators celebrate after they have lost. They don't understand they have lost. I am not even sure they do when they see the red ink pile up and the growing, record merchandise trade deficit that now exists in this country. 
I hope that one day we can have a thoughtful and interesting debate about trade policy. It should not be between camps who think trade is good or bad. Everyone ought to believe that expanded world trade, provided the circumstances and rules of trade are fair, is good for this world. But everyone also ought to believe that when this country is taken advantage of with markets that are closed, rules that are unfair, and countries that employ child labor and pollute this Earth's environment, that is not fair trade and is not something we ever ought to have to subscribe to. 
Mr. President, once again, I expect September will be an interesting month and a challenging month on the issue of trade largely because of the debate on fast track. I intend to be back often to discuss this subject. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if there is a cure for insomnia, as I said the other day, this kind of debate surely must be it. This is so arcane and technical, to be talking about antitrust issues and VIII(C) and section 271, and all of these issues that almost no one understands. They seem not very important to many, I am sure. I suppose most who would listen to this would think it incredibly boring. But, in fact, it is very, very important. We have a market system in this country that works only when there is competition. When you don't have competition, the market system doesn't work. 
We have something called a referee several places in this Government: One at Justice, in the Antitrust Division; we have a referee function in the Federal Trade Commission. In fact, we have 1,000 attorneys, roughly, I understand, whose job it is to deal with antitrust issues and the issues of monopoly and so on. The purpose is to make sure that we don't have enterprises, where people come in and grab markets and develop trusts or monopolies and extract from the consumers a price that is unfair, a price that is not set in an open market or an open competition. That is what this antitrust enforcement is about. 
Mr. Joel Klein is, by all accounts, capable, smart, and a fellow with a distinguished career. I have met him. I think he is a nice fellow. We should not be voting on this nomination at this point. We should not have been voting on a cloture motion on this nomination either, as we did a week ago. Why? Because there are substantial questions that a number of us have raised about the nomination of Mr. Klein that have not been answered. I feel I must vote against this nomination. I don't like that position, but I don't intend to vote for a nomination with the kind of questions that remain about a number of positions that have been taken, a number of things that have been written and said by this potential nominee on antitrust issues, that give me great concern. 
I intend to speak only briefly because I think my colleagues have covered this subject. After I complete my presentation I will yield back the remainder of our time. But I want to make a couple of important points. 
The fight on the Telecommunications Act, which was the first major reform of the telecommunications laws in this country in five or six decades, was a substantial battle between behemoths in our country--organizations that provided local service that are collecting tens and tens of billions of dollars of revenue, and organizations that are involved in long distance telephone service that are just as big. These titans then clashed as we wrote a Telecommunications Act. One of my concerns as we wrote this act was that we would end up, not with more competition, but, instead, with more concentration. If you have less competition and more concentration you will have higher prices. 
My colleague from Nebraska held up something that was in the paper this morning in Nebraska, `So Far, Consumers Losers in Battle for Dial-Tone Dollars; basic rates for telephone service are up for 93 percent of Nebraska residential customers the past year.' I don't know much about Nebraska, but I fear what will happen if we don't have aggressive antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department, something I fought very hard for, as did the Senator from South Carolina, as did the Senator from Nebraska, when we passed the Telecommunications Act. We were the ones standing out here on the floor talking about the VIII(C) test. We are the ones who fought for a role for the Justice Department in all of these issues. Were it not for us, it would not have been there. 
Now, the Justice Department role is critical, as is the role of the Federal Communications Commission. If we have a Federal Communications Commission that does the wrong thing, or we have a Justice Department that doesn't do the right thing in antitrust enforcement, I guarantee the result of the Telecommunications Act last year will not be more competition and lower prices, it will be more concentration, fewer companies, and higher prices. I guarantee it. 
This is important. This is about billions and billions and billions of dollars of additional charges that consumers may or may not have to pay in the future, depending on antitrust enforcement in the Justice Department and on thoughtful, responsible decisions in the Federal Communications Commission that properly implement the Telecommunications Act. There will be more discussion about that because we also have some disagreements about nominations to the Federal Communications Commission.

Mr. DORGAN. I have sent Mr. Klein this letter. 
Let me say this. It may well be that the irreversibly open to competition standard is a tougher standard, as they allege. I don't have the foggiest idea. I don't know. Nobody knows. And I am not prepared to have someone say, `I reject the standard that Congress determined to be the standard when it passed the Telecommunications Act, and I create my own standard,' and none of us know what that means here--I am not prepared to say, `Yes, let me sign up for that. Let me be a partner in that process.' I am not willing to do it. 
It may be, at the end stage of this process, maybe it is proven to us that Mr. Klein was right. I hope so. I hope that is the case. But if he is not right, if we are right, what is going to happen is everybody in this country who uses a telephone, everybody in this country who is a consumer of telecommunications services, is going to end up paying higher prices. That's the test. 
Mr. President, one final point and then I will conclude. During the debate on the Telecommunications Act, something happened to me that was a real learning experience. All of us in the Senate have learning experiences, despite the fact that some say we never seem to be able to learn. 
I offered an amendment on the floor of this Senate on the issue of concentration, because the bill that came to the Senate said, `Let's take the limits off. Let's let these companies marry up. The more weddings the better. Let three companies become one. Let two companies become--let's have mergers, let them go off and get married--it is just terrific.' That is what the bill was. So I offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate and said, `Let's put these limits back on at this point.' I don't support taking the limits off how many television stations you can own, how many radio stations you can own. 
We had a vote and guess what? Guess who won? I won. My amendment prevailed. I was so surprised I could hardly stand, and it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The then-majority leader did not support my position. He was on the opposite side. He changed his vote--had another Member change his vote, and asked for reconsideration after dinner, 3 hours later. And do you know what happened? There were four, five, or six Members of the Senate that went out to have dinner--Lord only knows what they ate--they came back and 3 hours later they had some sort of epiphany that allowed them to vote against my amendment, so I lost. 
I learned that winning around here sometimes means you only win for 3 hours. It felt good from 4 to 7, but the fact is I lost. Then the bill went to conference and the bill had enough in it to make me feel that maybe we will move in the right direction. But I would rue the day of supporting any portion of this telecommunications act if we don't have the most aggressive antitrust enforcement and the best decisions, the most thoughtful decisions comporting with what we decide is in this act from the Federal Communications Commission. 
I have a lot more to say but I know there are other times when Members will be anxious to hear it, and I will save it for those times. 
Let me compliment the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Nebraska. 
Let me say a word, finally to the nominee. I expect the Senate will cast a favorable vote for this nominee. I hope this nominee succeeds. I hope this nominee proves that the standard that he has developed is a tough, no-nonsense standard. If he does, I will come to the floor at some point in the future and say, `Hurrah for you. I support what you have done.' I think we should not be voting on this nominee today. I wish we had more time. If we had more time, maybe some of these votes would have been different. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield the remainder of our time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. 
As my colleague knows, IFAD is a specialized agency of the United Nations that has the mission of fighting hunger and poverty throughout the world. Since 1977 IFAD has helped rural poor to increase their nutrition, their food production and their income. It has reached about 160 million people through 429 different projects, mostly in Africa and Asia, the regions where most of the world's poor live. In its lending work, IFAD has an overhead of less than 10 percent, and it has achieved loan repayments of 97 percent in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Benin, and Dominica. 
More importantly, IFAD has been an innovator in providing microcredit to vulnerable groups that are often difficult to reach, such as small farmers, the landless poor and rural women. 
Mr. President, that is why I was interested to read language related to IFAD in the report of the House Appropriations Committee on the House's version of the foreign operations bill. I was pleased to read, on page 18 of the House report, that the House Appropriations Committee `requests that AID [the Agency for International Development] examine the possibility of using the International Fund for Agricultural Development as an implementing agency in providing microenterprise assistance.' 
This is in the context of the House's $10 million increase over the administration's request for the AID microenterprise account. As my colleague knows, the Senate Appropriations Committee has increased the same account by $15 million. 
Mr. President, I wonder whether my distinguished colleague could tell me whether he would support the House position in conference, that the Agency for International Development should consider using IFAD as one of the implementing agencies in providing microenterprise assistance.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to talk today about a debate that is going on in a conference committee on who gets what portion of the tax cut that is now proposed by the Congress. It is, I suppose, a debate that one would expect if the Congress decides there shall be a tax cut, and the Congress has decided that taxes shall be reduced in some measure for the American people. 
The obvious question is, for whom and for how much? Who gets the benefit of the tax cut? 
We had a generous discussion on the floor of the Senate with an enormous amount of data and charts, with each side demonstrating that it is right and the other side is wrong, and each side using economists and all of the research groups that say this side is right, that side is wrong, or that side is right, this side is wrong. I suspect people watching this do not have the foggiest understanding of how you manufacture all these numbers. It is like making sausage, I assume--somebody over there, huddled over a bowl, is throwing all kinds of things in a bowl, and they grind it out and say, `Here's our sausage.' 
I come from a farm State, so I suppose I talk a lot about agriculture. I was thinking about an old story that a fellow in my hometown told me years ago about the chicken and the pig. It reminds me a little of this debate about the tax issue, who gets what. A chicken and a pig were prancing around the farmyard and they were talking about the upcoming birthday for the farmer and deciding what they would give the farmer for his birthday. The chicken said, `Why don't we give him ham and eggs,' and the pig thought about that for a long time, and said, `Well, gee, for you, that's terrific, because for you that's just a contribution, but for me that requires real commitment.' 
Well, commitment or contribution, this is the kind of chicken-and-pig issue on who gets what in the Tax Code, who contributes what taxes in this country. 
I want to talk just for a moment today about this commitment or contribution issue, and when it comes time to providing tax relief, then who gets some help. There is a discussion in this Congress that occurs almost every year around something called tax freedom day. The Tax Foundation, in fact, puts out a little publication. This year it was May 9, I believe, and it says tax freedom day is May 9. We have someone dutifully coming to the floor, and they hold it up and say, `Here is the day in which we are free. Up until this day, all of the things we earn have to go to pay taxes, and beyond this day we are free.' 
It has always been curious to me that the amount of money I pay for my children to go to school is somehow considered a burden. It is not to me. I consider it an opportunity to put my kids in a good public school system, and the taxes I pay to help that public school system is not a burden to me. But some people feel every dollar they pay is an enormous burden and a waste. They say, `Here is tax freedom day, May 9, this year.' When they talk about tax freedom day, the same people that come to the floor and do that say tax freedom day is the accumulation of taxes that people have to pay, including income taxes and payroll taxes. And, incidentally, payroll taxes are a big chunk of the taxes people have to pay in this country. When they talk about tax freedom day, they include payroll taxes. 
When they talk about who gets what in terms of tax cuts, guess what happens? The Congress then says we are only going to measure income taxes. We are only going to measure the income taxes you pay, and that is the basis on which you get a tax cut. So you have a situation in this country where over two-thirds of the American people now pay a higher payroll tax than they pay in income tax. Two-thirds of the American people pay higher payroll taxes than income taxes. Payroll taxes have grown, and rather substantially. 
So when it comes time to give a tax cut, we are told that the tax cut shall go to people based on the income taxes they pay, and if you don't pay substantial enough income taxes, you do not get a tax cut. 
Some of us feel that the working families toward the bottom of the ladder, those working families somewhere between the 50th percentile and down who are paying more in payroll taxes than income taxes, they are working, they are paying taxes. It is a different kind of tax--payroll tax--they ought to get a tax cut, as well. 
Here is the dilemma. We have a tax cut that is proposed in part of this package that is a per child tax credit of $500, and we are told that the per child tax credit will go to only those people who pay enough income taxes to earn the credit. What does that mean? It means 4 million to 6 million American kids will not get a per child tax credit, despite the fact their folks are working and their folks are paying substantial payroll 
taxes, sufficient payroll taxes to earn this tax credit. But they will be denied any tax benefit under this plan because they pay payroll taxes and not enough income tax. 
Why is it their fault? Because they are not earning enough money, they are at the bottom of the economic ladder. They are told in this plan, payroll taxes don't count. So, therefore, these 4 to 6 million children, the parents of those children, are not going to get a tax cut, because they only work and they only pay payroll taxes. That makes no sense at all. It does not make any sense. 
Why would we prevent the parents of 4 to 6 million children, the parents of those 4 to 6 million children who are working, from getting a tax credit of $500 per child, as all other Americans will get? 
We were told last week by a Member of the majority who believes we should not provide a child tax credit to those people who are working and paying payroll taxes, that if we did, it would be welfare. Why welfare? These are people who are working, these are people who are paying taxes, and these are people who also deserve a tax cut. 
It is always interesting to me that every time we talk about a tax cut in this Chamber, if you get way into the upper end of the income scale--an area, incidentally, where they have had enormous increases in income--that somehow the most generous portions of the tax cut always go to those folks. 
I want to read some information that was in a piece yesterday in the Washington Post about what has happened to incomes in this country. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Americans in the bottom one-fifth of the income distribution, the lowest 20 percent of income earners in the work force, saw their after-tax incomes drop by 16 percent between 1997 and 1994. When you adjust all that for inflation, they have 16 percent less purchasing power in a 20-year period. The next-to-the-bottom fifth lost 8 percent. The middle fifth stayed about even. 
The members of the wealthiest 20 percent saw their incomes rise by 25 percent, and the top 1 percent of the income earners in this country in the same 20-year period saw their income rise in real terms by 72 percent. So if you look at who has benefited substantially in the last 20 years, you conclude that the top 20 percent of income earners, especially the top 1 percent, have benefited enormously. 
Why is it, then, when we talk about providing tax cuts, that we say to those who have not benefited at all, those who are in the work force who have not received any substantial increase in income, in fact, who have lost ground, we say to them, `You are working, you are paying taxes, but we're sorry, you don't get a tax cut.' What kind of logic is that? This does not make any sense to me. 
I will read a couple of other things that have been written recently. Today, in the Washington Post, with respect to this debate about who is providing what benefit to which income group in this country, the Washington Post editorial says:  
The Republicans have written a tax bill tilted heavily toward the better-off * * * 
The Republicans in turn have adopted a new technique. Rather than argue as they might have done in the past about the virtues of the bill, they engage in distortion. 
They are talking now about the numbers that are bantered back and forth. 
The people who wrote this bill aren't defending its distributional consequences; they're denying them. The plain facts are that the bill over time would not just mainly benefit the better-off but would cost the government revenues it can't afford. 
I want to talk about this issue of better off, however, because if we have a proposal passed by both the House and the Senate to reduce the tax burden in this country, it seems to me it ought to be targeted to those families who have faced an increasing tax burden. 
Which taxes have increased in recent years in this country? Does anybody know the answer to that? Which taxes have increased? I guess most people would say the payroll taxes, and they would be right. 
Payroll taxes in the last decade have increased, increased again, and increased again. The income tax rates have come down, except for one circumstance. But the payroll taxes have increased. 
So the result is, when the discussion of the Congress is about giving a tax cut, I think we ought to talk about providing tax relief to those who are paying higher payroll taxes. But some say they want to prevent those people who are paying higher payroll taxes from receiving any of the significant benefits of the tax cut. Frankly, that is just wrong. 
The piece in the Washington Post, written by E.J. Dionne, called `The Tax War,' is an interesting piece that appeared a day or two ago, and it says the following: 
The Republicans are missing a chance to make their best case for a tax cut. For years, they argued that government should not tax people into poverty or make life tougher for the pressed middle class. They were right about this, especially since regressive payroll taxes take a much bigger chunk from the incomes of the middle class and the working poor than from the wealthy. 
That's why it is incomprehensible that Republicans have so fiercely resisted Clinton's proposal to give the $500-per-child tax credit to families who owe no income taxes but pay substantial payroll taxes. Most of these families earn roughly $17,000 to $30,000 a year. 
People at the middle and bottom of the income strata need tax relief for another reason: For nearly two decades--until the last 2 or 3 years of the current economic recovery--they have lost ground or barely kept up. 
Now, the point I come to the floor today to make is this. We are in conference between the House and the Senate on the question of what kind of tax cut and who receives the benefits of this tax cut. The chart I have here shows the percentage of working families in this country whose payroll taxes exceed their income taxes. You will see this by quintile. 
The bottom fifth, 99 percent of them, pay more payroll taxes than income tax. These are people who work. They get up every day, go to work, work hard, try to take care of their families. The second quintile, 97 percent, pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income tax, and right on down, until you get to the top fifth, and they pay 16 percent in payroll taxes. Sixteen percent have payroll taxes that exceed their income tax. 
You can see the import of this chart. It shows the folks in the bottom 60 percent of the income strata in this country who are out working, are paying higher payroll taxes than income taxes. Any proposal that says that does not count, that does not matter, the payroll taxes you pay are not part of our concern, is just plain wrong. 
Now, we have an opportunity to fix it, and we can fix it in this conference committee. The House and the Senate conferees can decide to consider payroll taxes paid as a measurement against who gets the $500 child tax credit. They can do that. Some don't want to do it because it means they will not be able to get their special little deal in the Tax Code. They have lots of special trunks in cases that have been put in this bill. Some want to have their special deal, so they don't want to do this because it costs money. 
If you want a fair tax cut and you want to be fair to working Americans and working families, you must say to those out there in the work force, `We will give a tax cut based on a $500-per-child tax credit and we will measure it against the taxes you pay--all taxes, including payroll taxes.' The failure to do that means that this Congress is not doing right by middle-income families. This Congress is not doing right by nearly 4 million to 6 million children and the parents of those children who will be denied a reduction in their taxes only because the taxes they paid, the higher taxes they paid, were payroll taxes rather than income taxes. 
So we have an opportunity to do this right. Most people look at the Congress and they think, if you cut taxes, guess what Congress will do? It will cut tax and give people at the higher income levels, at the upper end, the biggest tax cut. 
Congress has two ways of doing things. It deals with cakes and crumbs. The folks at the bottom get the crumbs and the folks at the top get the cake with lighted candles on it. That is the way people think Congress behaves because too often that is the way they do behave. We have an opportunity in constructing a tax bill in this conference to do it the right way, which would be to say to all Americans we are going to give a $500-per-child tax credit, which the Republicans proposed and which the President proposed, which the Democrats and Republicans voted for, but that tax credit will not be denied the people just because they paid a payroll tax rather than an income tax. 
This conference in the next couple of days can do this right or it can do it wrong. I hope they will listen to the voices of some in this country who say, if you are going to give a tax cut, pay some attention to the needs of the middle-income earners in this country who deserve a tax cut, yes, based on income taxes paid, but also based on the higher sales tax they pay every day as they go to work and work hard to support their families. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1019, the fiscal year 1998 legislative branch appropriation bill, and applaud the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett, for the work he has done in reporting this bill to the Senate. This bill, as recommended by the committee, provides $1,537,827,000 in budget authority, exclusive of House items. This total is $64,947,000 below the President's request and $51,600,000 above the fiscal year 1997 enacted level. As I indicated, these figures do not include spending by the House of Representatives, as each body normally defers to the other body to set its own budget. To date, the full House has not yet acted on the legislative branch appropriation bill for fiscal year 1998.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on my flood relief amendment, which is now pending to the defense appropriations bill. 
As my colleagues know, this spring the Red River Valley suffered its worst flooding in recorded history. Personnel at Grand Forks Air Force Base pitched in to fight the flooding that everyone knew would come--they helped operate `Sandbag Central' to enable volunteers to go to the front lines on the dikes. 
When the water finally won, a 500-year flood emptied Grand Forks, ND, a city of 50,000 people, and sent 4,000 residents to the Grand Forks Air Force Base for shelter. Many of my colleagues saw on television the base hangar that was converted to a shelter and that provided refuge for those citizens. 
What my colleagues may not know is that many of the base personnel who fought the flood for weeks were themselves victims of the flood when it came. Over 700 military personnel were forced to evacuate during this disaster. And 406 servicemembers have suffered losses to personal property, including 95 families whose homes were inside the diked area near the Red River and were extensively damaged. 
However, without the flood relief authority my amendment would provide, these servicemembers will be victims of unintended discrimination. 
If these servicemembers had lived on base, they would be eligible to file a claim with the Department of Defense for losses incident to service. The Air Force pays such claims pursuant to section 3721 of title 31 of the United States Code. But as the law now stands, military personnel living off base are not eligible to file such claims, even though they are stationed at Grand Forks Air Force Base as a result of their military service. 
My amendment would simply permit the Air Force to reimburse these servicemembers for their losses despite the fact that they lived off base. It makes available up to $4.5 million of the funds already available to the Department of Defense for paying claims. 
Let me assure my colleagues that this amendment supplements private insurance and benefits provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Air Force claims practices and FEMA regulations prohibit duplicative benefits. Military members who have private insurance will be required to file claims against that insurance before the Air Force will pay claims under this amendment. 
I understand that this amendment is acceptable to the Chairman, Senator Stevens, and to the ranking member, Senator Inouye. I thank them very much for their support of this amendment, and for the work of their staffs in clearing this amendment. 
I look forward to this amendment's approval by the Senate, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. My hope is that we will approve this amendment and save the $118 million that has been added to this bill for something called the space-based laser program. In supporting the Senator from New Mexico, I want to point out to my colleagues that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has reported to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, `There is no validated military requirement for space-based laser.' 
I will read that again because I think it is critically important. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization has reported to the appropriations subcommittee, `There is no validated military requirement for space-based laser.' 
Yet, $118 million is added to this authorization bill for the space-based laser program. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the cost of deploying 20 space-based lasers, starting in the year 2006, would be $24.6 billion. According to Defense Week, however, the Pentagon's Program Analysis and Evaluation Office estimates the cost of the space-based laser at closer to $45 billion. Neither estimate includes the annual cost of replacing the space-based laser satellites. The Congressional Budget Office pegged those expenses at $1.6 billion per year. 
The question is, do we need it and can we afford it? That is a question we ought to ask about almost everything, I suppose. Do we need it and can we afford it? In answer to the first question--do we need it at this point?--it seems to me that the answer is no. 
The experts themselves tell us we don't need it, and the adding of $118 million continues the incessant desire by the Congress, over many, many years, to throw money at this program. And $100 billion has been spent on national missile defense in over four decades. The question is, what have we gotten for the $100 billion? What would $100 billion have done invested in other areas of our country or spent for other purposes? Then, what have we gotten for our $100 billion invested in national missile defense? 
In North Dakota, we have the remnants of what was the free world's only antiballistic missile program. It was opened after the Nation spent billions and billions of dollars on it. Then we mothballed it within 30 days of its being declared operational. 
America's taxpayers have a right to question and wonder whether this is a wise use of their money? If I felt this program was a critical element of what is necessary for this country's defense, I would be here supporting it. But the Pentagon doesn't feel it is a critically important program, necessary for our country's defense. That is why they didn't ask for the $118 million. That is why the $118 million is now being added here in the authorization bill. 
The Senator from New Mexico asks that we take this $118 million out of this bill. I support the Senator from New Mexico on the question of, do we need it and can we afford it? The answer is no on both counts. It is not just an answer that I give; it is an answer that comes from military officials themselves who say there is no validated military requirement for the space-based laser. 
Mr. President, I hope that when we vote on this amendment, those who wish to save money, those who wish to stop spending money that we don't have on things we don't need will decide that we will approve the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico and cut the $118 million for this program, which has been added to this program in this defense authorization bill. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for yielding me time, and I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, no one in this country at any time should ever have a problem sleeping as long as there is an opportunity to talk about antitrust issues. It is for many some of the most boring, lifeless set of issues available to discuss anywhere in public politics. Antitrust enforcement--what on Earth is it? 
When I came to Washington, DC, I threatened to put the picture of the 1,000 lawyers who are hired in our Government for antitrust enforcement purposes on the cartons of milk in grocery stores because I felt that these 1,000 lawyers hired by our Government for antitrust enforcement had surely vanished. I knew that we were paying 1,000 of them. But it was clear to me there was no antitrust enforcement, so they must have vanished. 
So it is a decade and half later and we are now talking about antitrust issues again. And the discussion today is with confirming a nomination to head the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice. 
This is, while boring for many people, an important question because we have what is called a free market system in our country. A free market system only works to the extent that you have referees who are willing to intervene in circumstances where people try to rig the market and where there is not open competition and where there is monopoly pricing in circumstances where the market is not free. In many cases, that is the same as stealing. 
You go back to the beginning of the century and you will find examples in a range of industries--petroleum, natural gas, a whole range of industries, railroads--in which there were monopolies and trusts. They were stealing from the American public. We put in place a number of things to deal with that. 
One, we prosecuted some people and threw some people in jail. 
Second, we put in place certain legislation which said that if the free market is going to be free, then let's make sure there are some referees to keep it free. That is the whole issue of antitrust enforcement. 
Today the issue is, shall a Mr. Joel Klein from the Justice Department, who is now acting in this role as Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Enforcement, be confirmed by the Senate? President Clinton sent his name down here and asked for confirmation. And I am standing here to say that Mr. Klein, by all accounts, has a distinguished career. 
I met with Mr. Klein yesterday. He is a very likable fellow who has much to commend him. But I believe it is not the time to proceed to this nomination because a number of very important questions remain unanswered. The Senator from South Carolina mentioned some of them. 
We had an enormous fight on the floor of the Senate about the Telecommunications Act. For the first time in 60 years, we reformed the telecommunications laws in this country. One of the fights we had on that legislation was about what the role of the Justice Department with respect to whether or not there is competition with local phone service providers so that the Bell system can be freed then to go to compete against long distance companies. When is there effective competition locally that would free the Bells to compete in the long distance system? We said let's have an important role for the Justice Department in that 
area. We specifically talked about the test for that role, what is called the 8(c) test. 
Now we have a person who is down at the Justice Department and writes a letter to a colleague of ours when questioned about all of these issues, and he says, `Well, I specifically reject the so-called 8(c) test,' in terms of how the Justice Department will evaluate the kinds of activities that are involved in whether or sufficient competitive market place conditions exist before a Bell company can enter the long distance market. 
There are a range of issues that we want to have answered. I have written to the President and Senator Kerrey has written to the Attorney General. We have received no responses at this point. We would like responses to a series of questions about positions taken by this nominee. 
I am not standing here suggesting that Mr. Klein is unworthy. I am saying at this point that the questions, which are very serious questions, have not yet been answered. We have asked them, but they have not yet been answered. 
In light of that, I don't think any name should proceed until we receive answers to very important questions. 
The Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger was approved by Mr. Klein. Why was that approved without conditions? We had some abbreviated discussion of that yesterday. But I think we need more information about that. Why was that not approved with some conditions? We had the opportunity to establish conditions. How does this decision relate to the stated objective that the Department of Justice is really concerned about promoting competition? 
I would like more information about the Justice Department's interpretation of facilities-based competition, which is a standard that we discussed at some length in the Telecommunications Act. Why? I would like to ask and like to get some additional answers. 
Does the nominee before us specifically reject the so-called 8(c) standard outright when Congress specifically recommended that standard for evaluating the issues of competition? And where does the nominee stand on the issue of media concentration? 
It is very hard to see that a telecommunications bill, which by its nature was to promote more competition, is moving in the direction of being successful when we have, instead of more competition, more concentration. We have behemoth organizations marrying up and two becoming one or four becoming two and two becoming one. So, by definition, you have less competition. We have more and more galloping concentration in the telecommunications industry--television, radio, and all the rest of it. And, yet, I would like to know, where does the Justice Department and where does this nominee stand on the issue of concentration? 
Is that alarming, or do we have people who want to shake the pom-poms to become cheerleaders for it, as Mr. Baxter did when he was at the Department of Justice? There wasn't any merger that wasn't big enough for him. It didn't matter. The bigger, the better. That is not the role of the Department of Justice and antitrust enforcement, in my judgment. 
I am here to say that this is premature. This nomination should not be considered until we have received sufficient answers to some of these questions. 
Again, let me reemphasize. I am not standing here today to say that Mr. Klein is not someone without distinguished credentials. I have met him. I kind of like him. But there are a number of questions unresolved, and those questions should be resolved. The Senate should insist that they be resolved before we move this nomination forward. 
So I will speak at some length on Monday. The Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, Senator Hollings, and I believe, will also speak and explain the kinds of answers we are awaiting from the administration, from both the President and the Attorney General, before we proceed on this nomination. 
We have every right in this nomination process to say that before this nomination proceeds, there are certain questions we think the American people deserve an answer to. I intend to ask them not only today but on Monday, and we hope perhaps before this process is complete, that the Attorney General might respond or the White House might respond to the questions that have been put to them about some of the things that have been written, some of the things that have been spoken and said, and some of the decisions that have been made by the Acting Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division. 
Mr. President, I will speak at greater length on this subject on Monday. I yield the floor. 
I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, now that the disaster relief money is flowing to disaster victims, I would just like to take a moment to thank some special people for their hard work in passing the disaster relief law several weeks ago. 
First, I would like to thank my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate for their help in passing the disaster relief legislation, which is already helping people back in my home State of North Dakota. I know it was a grueling process and a difficult time for many of you, but I want you all to know that your efforts have already proven to be worth it. On behalf of the people of North Dakota, I want to thank you for your help. 
Legislation like the disaster relief bill is only possible when there is a bipartisan effort, not only among senators but among their staffs as well. You know, I often wonder if the people who watch us on C-SPAN or who read about the Senate in the newspaper fully understand just how important our staffs are to the work we do here. So, while our staffs often work out of the spotlight, I'd like to put the spotlight on some truly special individuals whose work on the disaster relief bill represents public service at its finest. 
First, I'd like to thank Steve Cortese, the majority staff director for the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Jim English, the Committee's minority staff director. Like most things, good legislation doesn't just happen--it takes hard work to write the language, negotiate painstaking compromises, and make the literally hundreds of difficult decisions legislation like the disaster bill requires. I'm grateful that when the people of the upper Midwest needed the help, these positions of great responsibility were held by such gifted and thoughtful public servants as Steve Cortese and Jim English. 
I would also like to thank Mary Hawkins, who led my office's effort on the bill. Her vast experience in Congress was constantly on display throughout the effort to pass this legislation. A legislative expert and a good negotiator, Mary's contribution was inestimable. 
Finally, I would also like to thank Doug Norell, my legislative director, who brought a combination of knowledge of Congress and knowledge of North Dakota to the table in this process, in addition to a dedication to do the right thing for our State and a willingness to work as hard as it took to get it done. 
Dedicated men and women on both sides of the aisle helped make this badly needed disaster relief legislation a reality, and North Dakota is very grateful.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a second-degree amendment to the amendment that has been offered by Senators McCain and Levin, an amendment that was just supported by my colleague and friend from Virginia. I do this with great respect for the views of those who have offered the amendment on base closing. But I come to a different conclusion than they do on this subject, and represent that conclusion with a second-degree amendment. When I conclude my remarks, I will send my second-degree amendment to the desk. 
I would tell my colleagues I offer the amendment on my behalf, on behalf of Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Thurmond, Senator Domenici, Senator Conrad, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, Senator Bingaman, Senator Boxer, Senator Burns, Senator Landrieu, Senator Roberts, and Senator Ford. 
I am offering this second-degree amendment to the amendment now pending, which would authorize two additional rounds of base closures, one in 1999 and the other in the year 2001. 
For those unfamiliar with the issue of base closures, they should know that we have established in this country previously, on several occasions--actually, through four rounds, but three of them really full rounds--something called the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission. And the Commission then begins to study what kind of military installations do we have in this country, where are they, what is their capability, and how many of them might now be surplus and might be closed in order to save money for the future. That is what the base closure process was about. 
I have supported the base closure process on those occasions. I have voted for it and believed it was appropriate, as we downsized the military after the cold war, that we also then needed to get rid of the surplus in our facilities and save the money that we can save that is necessary for other areas, such as training and readiness and weapons programs and other priorities. So I have supported that in the past, believing that as you downsize force structure, you also are going to have surplus military installations that must, in fact, be closed. 
In the process of doing that, we have ordered the closures in the rounds of 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. That resulted in the decisions to close 97 military installations in this country. The military is slightly over halfway through the process of closure of these 97 installations; slightly more than one-half of those bases have, in fact, been closed. In fact, the second base closure round is scheduled to finish this month, and those are the bases that the 1991 Base Closure Commission decided to close. The 1993 and 1995 closures, the third round and the fourth round, they will be shut down completely--and they are in the process now--but they will be shut down completely perhaps in the year 2001. So we have been involved in the substantial shutdown of military facilities under the Base Closure Commission process, have done it now for a number of years--9 years this process has been in effect--and now the proposal in this defense authorization amendment is to say, let's have two additional rounds of base closures. 
What is the problem with that and why do I offer an amendment? Let me describe my amendment first and then describe the problem. I say in my amendment that the Secretary of Defense shall prepare and submit to Congress, to the defense committees of Congress, a report on the costs and the savings attributable to the base closure rounds before 1996, and on the need, if any, for additional base closure rounds. The rest of the second-degree amendment describes what we would like the Secretary to report to us on. The 
amendment also would prohibit the funding of further base closure commissions until the Congress has received that report. 
But I would like to go through a series of charts, to tell you why I think there are significant questions that must be answered before this Congress should authorize one additional or two additional rounds of base closures. 
The General Accounting Office, the GAO, which is the congressional accounting watchdog agency, says that `Congressional auditors can't verify the estimates of base closure savings'; the Department of Defense `cannot provide information on actual savings' from the previous rounds; the DOD's savings estimates, according to the GAO, are `inconsistent . . . unreliable . . . incomplete.' That is the GAO. 
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, says: `The Congressional Budget Office was unable to confirm or assess the Department of Defense's estimates of costs and savings because the Defense Department is unable to report actual spending and savings for BRAC actions'--in other words, the base closures. 
The Congressional Budget Office also says: 
CBO cannot evaluate the accuracy of DOD's estimates without empirical data. 
The DOD does not track . . . actual savings that have accrued. 
And on the specific subject of the McCain-Levin amendment, the Congressional Budget Office says this about additional rounds of base closing: 
The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. 
And then it says, and this is important for my colleagues to understand: 
That consideration, however, should follow an interval during which the Department of Defense and independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far. 
Finally, CBO says:  
Such a pause [or an interval] would allow the Department of Defense to collect the data necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives and to determine the actual costs incurred and the actual savings achieved. 
That is not me. It is not a conservative or liberal or Democrat or Republican; that is the General Accounting Office, the GAO, the investigative watchdog, and the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, saying that after all of these rounds of base closures, they can't get information about what have the costs and the savings been. 
What has been the experience? What is the impact for the American taxpayer on all of this? How much do you save when you close them down? And what have been the costs of closing them down? 
The Congressional Budget Office says it would be a reasonable thing to do to have an interval to really evaluate what are you doing, what are you achieving, how much are you saving. That is why I think it makes no sense for us in this authorization bill to proceed immediately now, before nearly one-half of the bases that have been previously ordered closed are closed, and say, `Well, now, let's do two additional rounds. We don't know what the costs and benefits are of the previous rounds, we don't know what the savings to the taxpayers have been, we don't know what the costs have been, but let's order two more rounds.' 
So I offer a second-degree amendment that says the Secretary of Defense shall prepare and submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the costs attributable to base closure rounds. Let's get a full accounting before we move for two additional base closure rounds. 
Let me respond to some of the other statements that have been made on this issue. Proponents of more base closures suggest more closures are needed to match the base infrastructure to our force structure. They say as the force structure comes down, clearly we should be able to close some bases, and that is true. But let's look at the figures. 
According to Congressman Hefley, the chairman of the House National Security Committee's Subcommittee on Military Installation and Facilities, if you measure by plant replacement the value of bases in the United States and around the world, base infrastructure has fallen by 27 percent, very close to the one-third or 33 percent reduction in force structure. Other estimates of reduction in base structure are either not calculating the plant replacement value or they are calculating values of only bases in the Continental United States, which ignores the 43 percent reduction in U.S. bases overseas. 
In addition to that, the military's operational bases--that is, the bases that host the combat units--are already closing down in proportion to the defense drawdown. For example, when all the BRAC rounds are done, the Air Force will have closed 22 of 74 major air bases, 30 percent; the Navy will have closed 10 of 17 naval stations, nearly 60 percent, and 12 of 29 naval air stations, 40 percent; the Army will have closed 10 major combat and training facilities, about one-third of those Army bases. So with respect to the operational bases, there has already been an appropriate amount of base closing done. 
Proponents of the amendment to authorize two additional rounds of base closings say we need more base closing rounds in order to be able to afford new weapons. We will achieve savings from base closings and, therefore, be able to afford the new weapons programs. Let's examine just a bit what these arguments mean by asking what the savings from base closures are or will be or have been with what sketchy information we have. 
There are various estimates of savings from the BRAC implementation period from 1988 to the year 2001. The Congressional Budget Office in December said they were not able to get very much information. They estimated, with what information they had, that we would save $5.3 billion in that period, this despite four base closing rounds in closures that began 9 years ago. 
So, if this number is accurate, with sketchy information, yes, base closures save some money but very slowly, and if future base closing commissions decide to close bases in 2001, the savings would be available, again, very slowly perhaps by the year 2010. And the savings here are only estimates from sketchy information that both the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office indicate is unreliable and incomplete. They say the information on this is simply not available from the Department of Defense. 
The Government Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget 
Office also say in closing military installations that the Department of Defense has not taken into account the full cost of environmental cleanup when a base is closed, the accurate proceeds from the sale of land in closing bases, the economic transition costs, especially those not funded by the Department's base closing program, the higher costs of operation at bases that gain missions from the bases that are closed and higher construction costs at the bases that gain missions. 
In summary, Mr. President, my amendment is important because it would require the Pentagon to report to Congress on what have been the actual costs and savings in four base closing rounds over nearly a 10-year period. Until and unless we get information about what are the costs and benefits, I don't think we ought to legislate in the dark, and that is what we would be doing if we were to decide now to rush off and authorize two additional rounds of base closures without knowing the impact of, the costs of, or the benefits of the closures in the previous four rounds. 
I am pleased to offer the amendment with some very strong support from some very influential Members of the Senate. The majority leader, Senator Lott, is a cosponsor; the minority leader, Senator Daschle; the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond; and many others. 
I think all of us feel the same way. There may be at some future date a need to reconcile further base capacity with troop strength. We understand that, we have understood that through four rounds of base closings. However, there will also be, and is now, a requirement that we understand exactly what we are doing, what are the costs and what are the benefits, and this would not be the time to authorize additional rounds of base closures prior to our having the information available on what we have done in the past. 
One final point. All of us perhaps have some parochial interests, and I would certainly understand if someone said, `Well, but you have some military installations in your State.' Yes, we do, and I have supported previous base closing rounds despite the fact that we have military installations, and it would probably not be in my best interest to do that, but I supported that because I understand we must reduce capacity in these installations. 
But, I also understand that every time you go through a base closing round, there are additional costs imposed on nearly every community that has a military installation that is not calculated anywhere on these papers, and that is the cost of the economic investment that doesn't happen and the stunted economic growth in a community because a potential investor says, `That, community, I don't want to invest there at the moment. I want to wait a couple years to see if that military installation, that community is going to be there for the long-term future. If not, that region is going to have 20 percent unemployment, and the last thing I want to do is lose my investment.' 
So community after community after community has imposed on it a stunted cost of economic development whenever we begin this process. 
I am not here today to say I will never support another BRAC round, but this is the wrong time to initiate two additional rounds. If we look in the future at what the overcapacity might be, if there is, in fact, an overcapacity, then we should respond to that. But I do not want, in this circumstance, to authorize two rounds before we know the full cost, the full value and the full benefit of previous base closure rounds. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ford from the State of Kentucky be added as a cosponsor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say just a couple of more words about the amendment that is now pending. It is a second-degree amendment offered to the first-degree amendment that had been previously offered by Senator McCain and Senator Levin. 
I indicated when I started out I have great respect for both of them. We reach a different conclusion and come to a different judgment on this question, and I do want to say in response to some of the discussion that has been held in this Chamber that this is not a question about whether closing bases saves money. I accept the notion that closing military installations saves money. 
That is why I have been involved in supporting four previous base closing rounds. It clearly will save money. We do not know how much. I do not think anyone here knows how much. The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed it, the Government Accounting Office has reviewed it, and they are trying to understand how much money is saved and what are the costs. Are we saving a little bit of money and having very substantial costs? Are we saving a lot of money? We do not know. There has not been a decent accounting. 
I am not standing here quibbling about whether closing additional bases will save money. It likely will save money. The question is should we in this authorization bill launch two additional rounds of base closures when the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office indicate--especially CBO indicates --it would be wise for us to have an interval at this point during which we fully understand what we have done in the previous four rounds by which we have said let us close 100 military installations only about 50 of which are now closed. 
Let us finish the job we have done in the previous four rounds before we decide whether and when we initiate two additional rounds of base closing. We might discover that the basis for the previous closures and the conditions under which those closures were ordered and the experience of those closures might persuade us to do something different, maybe closing other installations in a different way. I do not know. But we ought to have the benefit of that experience and that knowledge before we proceed. 
That is the issue. I know the Senate Democratic leader is in the Chamber and wishes to speak on this subject, and I shall not go further. I may have something to say later. But this is an interesting and, I think, a useful discussion for us to have, and I appreciate the cosponsorship of both the majority leader and the minority leader to my second-degree amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas has just used information that is not accurate. He is referring only, when he talks about 18 percent, to the bases in this country. We have also closed bases overseas. When you add that to it, the total bases closed represent about 27 percent of the infrastructure. 
But the point of my second-degree amendment is to say this: Let us at this point not authorize two additional rounds of base closures until we figure out what we have done, what the consequences of what we have done are in the last four rounds. We do not have all the facts about what the last four rounds have given us in terms of costs and benefits. 
Let me not speak for myself. Let me have the Congressional Budget Office do it, and the GAO has done something similar. It says: 
The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. 
That is what CBO says. Then CBO says: 
That consideration, however, should follow an interval during which the DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken thus far. 
Why does CBO say that we ought to wait and take a measure of what we have done? Because they cannot get the facts. No one knows what are the costs and what are the savings. What CBO is saying is let's figure out what we have done. We have ordered the closure of nearly 100 military installations and only about half of them have been fully closed. At this point, let us finish that closure, assess the costs and the benefits, and then proceed, if necessary, to authorize additional base closures. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I have voted for every previous round of base closings and intend to vote again when additional bases are needed to be closed, but if this is, in fact, about saving money, then let us at least pay some heed to the Congressional Budget Office. 
The Congressional Budget Office says that additional base closing rounds ought to follow an interval during which the Department of Defense and independent analysts examine the actual impact of what has been done so far. If this is, in fact, about saving money, let's take the advice of the Congressional Budget Office and figure out what we have done before we decide to do more, what has the cost and the benefit been of what we have done. 
The majority leader, the minority leader, Senator Thurmond, Senator Stevens, and so many others have cosponsored this second-degree amendment, which is very simple. The second-degree amendment asks the Secretary of Defense to prepare and submit to Congress a report on the costs and savings on the closure rounds that have already been occurring and to give us information that we don't now have before we proceed to talk about additional rounds of base closures.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the defense authorization bill. I have been privileged to listen to a number of presentations. They deal with, in many instances, very significant and very important issues for the future of this country. 
Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two issues. One is an amendment that I intend to offer later in the consideration of this bill. The second is to support an amendment that is to be offered by Senator Lugar and, I believe, cosponsored by Senator Bingaman and a group of others, dealing with the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the funding for it. 
Before I discuss those two, let me indicate, however, that it is curious to see a cloture motion filed on a bill like the defense authorization bill this early in the process. A cloture motion suggests somehow that we should have a vote cutting off debate when debate has hardly begun on this defense authorization bill. This is a very significant piece of legislation. There needs to be time for significant debate on issues that are very substantial. 
I hope this is not going to be habit forming--filing cloture motions virtually at the same pace when a piece of legislation like this comes to the floor of the Senate. A desire to shut off debate ought not be initiated before there is some demonstration that debate is going to go on forever. If a bill is moving at a reasonable pace, there is no reason, in my judgment, for anyone to be offering cloture motions or shut off debate. I just say that is a curious thing to have happen on this bill right at the start of the legislation. I hope that won't be a habit. 
Now to the issue of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Mr. President, folks in my hometown, in most cases, won't know much about this program because the American people have not been given much information about the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. It is kind of a foreign title to a program that in most cases benefits the lives of every American citizen. 
I want to describe what it is and why it is important and why I support the amendment that was offered, I believe, by Senator Lugar, along with many other distinguished colleagues, and is now pending before the Senate. 
The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is a program by which we engage with our resources under an arms control agreement to help a former adversary, the former Soviet Union, now Russia, and its surrounding States to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and warheads that were previously in place aimed at the United States of America. Doing so reduces the threat against our country. I think it makes eminent good sense to see a missile destroyed in its silo rather than having a missile fired and have to deal with a missile that is flying toward a target of the United States. 
Obviously, things have changed dramatically with the Soviet Union now being gone, and we now have Russia and other independent States. We are dealing with a new world, and we have a cold war that is largely ended. We have a circumstance in which we want to work with what had been a former adversary to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons that that adversary now possesses in concert with the arms control agreements that we have already had with them and that we have negotiated and signed with that former adversary. 
Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to have an object on the floor that I might use to demonstrate to my colleagues that this, in fact, works. 
Mr. President, I want to show my colleagues a picture. This is a picture of some workers in Russia with power saws sawing the wings off Russian bombers. These folks are bent over a wing of a bomber sawing the wings off Russian bombers. Why are they sawing the wings off Russian bombers and sending these bombers, now unable to fly, to the boneyard? Because of arms control agreements. They are required under arms control agreements to reduce the number of bombers they possess in their arsenal. 
A smaller picture shows former Secretary of Defense Perry inspecting an SS-24 silo. This is a missile silo in the Ukraine. This silo had 550-kiloton warheads on top of a missile--nuclear warheads capable of being delivered over 6,200 miles. This silo is now empty of warheads. There are no nuclear warheads in that silo. And our former Secretary of Defense Perry is inspecting a silo that is now cleared of its missile and its nuclear warheads. 
Finally, this picture. This is a picture of silo No. 110 near Pervomaisk in the Ukraine which held an SS-19 missile. As you can see, it is now only a hole. And, in fact, if you saw a later picture you would see sunflowers planted where missiles were previously planted poised and aimed at the United States of America. This is a hole. The hole is now covered up. There is no missile, no 
warhead. And, in fact, sunflowers are now planted there. 
Mr. President, this piece of metal comes from that missile and the missile silo. This piece of metal was removed from this missile silo in the Ukraine. This little piece of metal is a demonstration of the success of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. This was part of an armament in the ground on an intercontinental ballistic missile with nuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America. Now it is here in this Chamber. And where this silo and missile with a warhead used to sit there is now planted sunflowers. 
Why? Why at silo 110 near Pervomaisk in the Ukraine is there now a planting of sunflowers rather than a nuclear missile or an intercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States? Because this program works. This program makes sense. This program reduces the number of missiles, the number of bombers, and the number of nuclear warheads in an arms control agreement. It reduces the number of those weapons that previously had been poised to strike at the United States of America. 
Let me describe the facts about how this program has worked. We have seen the elimination of 212 submarine launchers, 378 intercontinental ballistic missile silos, 25 heavy bombers, more than 500 ICBM's. 
Fiscal year 1997: 131 additional ICBM silos--70 of them in Russia, 61 of them Kazakhstan--and 43 heavy bombers gone under this program; and 80 submarine launchers, all in Russia, gone; 84 missiles--48 in Ukraine, 36 in Russia--gone under this program. In effect, we helped a former adversary destroy weapons that had previously been poised and aimed at us. 
I can't think of anything that makes more sense than to destroy a missile by dismantling its silo, the missile and the warhead, and it is gone. 
That is exactly what the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has done. Senators Lugar and Nunn were the authors of this program. Many others in the Chamber have worked hard on this program. 
There is an amendment pending that will restore the money for this program which is necessary to continue the progress to reduce the number of nuclear arms in Russia and the independent states under this program. It is a bargain by any stretch. It makes eminent good sense for this country to do it. 
I am proud to say that I support the amendment. I commend Senator Lugar, Senator Bingaman, and so many others for offering the amendment today. 
Mr. President, let me turn then to one other item. We will in the context of debating this piece of legislation also discuss whether we wish to authorize two additional rounds of military base closings or whether we want, to say it another way, create a base realignment and closing commission that would recommend, in two rounds, closing certain military installations in our country. 
I am not here to support having more capability in military bases than we need. That would be wasteful. I understand that. On the other hand, we have had three full rounds of base closings and one abbreviated round. In the three rounds of closing military installations, we have ordered the closure of over 100 military installations in this country. My understanding is that only 50 of them have been finally and completely closed. We have no accounting at all--none--of what the costs and the benefits have been from the closings that have occurred so far. 
I think it is far better for us to decide that we should finish the job on the previous rounds of base closings before we authorize two additional rounds. 
I have another motive, obviously. I am concerned about what the rounds of base closings that are authorized do to communities in our country. We have had a couple of Air Force bases put on the list and taken off the list, put on the list and taken off the list. What happens in communities when you have a base closing round is that the minute your community or your facility is remotely involved in that round of base closings, economic growth is stunted and new investment is stopped. 
There isn't anyone who will come to Cheyenne, WY, or to Grand Forks, ND, or Minot, ND, or Rapid City, SD, or you name it, where they have military installations, and say, `Oh, by the way, there are going to be new rounds of base closings here.' 
So what we want to do is make a new investment in the community of apartment buildings or commercial property, or a plant here or a plant there. That is not the way it works. What they say is, `Gee, we do not know what the future is going to bring.' You might have 30 percent unemployment in that region 2 years from now because they might close that military installation, and if they do, the last thing I want to have done is to have made an investment in that community and find that investment going belly up. It terribly stunts economic growth in these communities while you have these base closing rounds. 
In fact, at the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, the subcommittee of which I am a member, General Fogleman, who indicated in response to a question of mine that 
he would not likely be here when we have additional base closing rounds and said he would not recommend that we have two additional rounds. If we have additional rounds, and he indicated that he felt there would be some overcapacity, we should have only one, he said. That would be his recommendation. But I believe very strongly that we should not authorize two additional base closing rounds in this defense authorization bill for a number of reasons. 
The Congressional Budget Office stated the following. The Congressional Budget Office said:  
The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of base closures if DOD believes there are surplus military capacity after all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, should follow an interval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact of measures that have been taken thus far. Such a pause would allow DOD to collect the data necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives and to determine the actual costs incurred and savings achieved. 
The Congressional Budget Office thinks it would be unwise to initiate additional base closing rounds without having the information available about what have been the costs and the benefits of the previous three rounds. I think we would be wise to heed the admonition of the Congressional Budget Office on this issue. 
A good many Senators have expressed an interest in this amendment on both sides of the aisle--Senator Daschle, Senator Conrad, Senator Lott, Senator Domenici, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, and others. I know we will likely have a significant and robust debate when this occurs. 
I simply wanted to alert my colleagues that some of us feel very strongly that we should not initiate additional base closing rounds in this defense authorization bill until we receive the information that we think we should have about costs and benefits on previous rounds. 
Let me close with a word about the subject that I originally discussed; that is, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. 
There are those who are critical of the political process, and I suppose in many cases justifiably, because there are a lot of things that are done in the democratic process that are not efficient, some not effective. It is not a very efficient form of government--the best form of government but not the most efficient form of government. But I say to all of those who question the effectiveness or the efficiency of Government that the program called the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program in which we help finance the destruction of weapons--bombers, missiles, and nuclear warheads--that previously were aimed at the United States of America is a program that is a bargain by any standard of measure. That makes this world safer; it makes it a better world; and to the extent that we can continue this program and fund it the way it should be funded, I want to be a part of that. I hope very much we can get a vote on the amendment that is now pending, and when we do I hope very much the amendment will prevail. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me inquire of the chairman of the committee, my understanding is that the Senate is technically on the defense authorization bill now, and that there is also anticipated time for morning business during the day. If not inappropriate, I will proceed to discuss a couple of items in morning business. But I do not want to do that at any time today that would interrupt the consideration of the bill. I will do it at the pleasure of the Senator from South Carolina.

Mr. DORGAN. Let me begin by talking just for a moment about trade. 
I generally come to the floor to talk about NAFTA, which is our trade relationship with our neighbor to the north, Canada, and our neighbor to the south, Mexico. Let me limit that this morning to our trade with Canada. 
I say on a broader scale that our NAFTA trade agreement in my judgment has been a failure. We now have a $40 billion combined deficit with our two neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Prior to the enactment of NAFTA, the trade agreement with our two neighbors, we had a much more positive balance of trade. But since the enactment of NAFTA, we now see a nearly $40 billion combined trade deficit, which I think is a very serious problem. It is a growing problem, and one that we must deal with. 
But let me just deal with one part of the trade problem with Canada today. There is an avalanche of Canadian grain that is moving across our border, flooding into our marketplace, and that is depressing grain prices here in this country and taking money out of the pockets of American farmers. 
This might be a fairly boring subject to some, but not if you are a farmer. If you are a farmer out there struggling, and you see the prices drop for wheat, Durum, barley, and other things you are producing, and then see Canada flood our markets with Canadian grain, you get pretty angry about it, and justifiably so. 
We had an agreement with Canada, something called tariff rate quotas, for a year which established levels of Canadian shipments of wheat, Durum, and other wheat coming into this country. That tariff rate quota expired, but the administration indicated they would unilaterally enforce that quota. Well, at this point Canada has shipped a quantity of grain into this country that is already above the tariff rate quota for this marketing year. And it is shipping Durum wheat into this country at a level that will exceed the tariff rate quota as well. It has not yet done so, but will exceed the tariff rate quota. 
Canada seems not to care very much about what this country thinks about these trade arrangements. We had a consultation with Canada about a week or two ago in Montreal, I believe, and the Canadians responded in a way that was wholly unsatisfactory to these issues. In essence, the Canadians seemed to be saying, I am told, that they intend to do nothing about it and they intend to continue to ship their grain into this country. 
I am asking the President to do a couple things. One, inasmuch as the Canadians are not exercising a good neighbor policy on this trade, we should take some action. 
Just to back up for a moment, when the United States-Canada Free Trade 
Agreement was enacted by Congress, the Trade Ambassador, then Trade Ambassador Clayton Yeutter, said to Congress that the evidence of good faith in this trade relationship is that there will not be an increase in grain coming across our border following the enactment of this trade agreement. Well, that was not worth the paper it was written on. But that is the assurance he gave in writing to Congress. Of course, we have been flooded with Canadian grain ever since. 
Here is what we ought to do. First, the United States ought to target Canadian foreign markets overseas. We ought to use our export enhancement funds in Venezuela, South Africa, West Africa, Tunisia, for example, to replace Canada as a major wheat supplier to those markets. If Canada is going to cause injury to our domestic marketplace for wheat, then it is time for us to go after their foreign markets and have them pay a price for their behavior under this trade agreement. 
Second, I think the administration ought to take immediate action to unilaterally stop Canadian wheat shipments from coming into this country. They said they would unilaterally enforce the tariff rate quota. Canada has already exceeded that tariff rate quota on spring wheat and other wheat, and will exceed it on Durum. The administration should shut the border to additional wheat shipments coming into this country. 
Third, the Canadian Wheat Ambassador is coming to this country, I believe, this week. I intend to seek a meeting with the Canadian Trade Minister, and ask some of my colleagues to participate in that. I am also going to seek a meeting with the Trade Ambassador and deliver to him personally my concern about what is happening with Canadian grain. 
The fact is, grain prices are collapsing in this country. Family farmers are struggling to make a living, and at the same time they are seeing their prices collapse and their income go down. The Canadian grain is flooding across our border. It does not make any sense at all. 
I will share one additional point with my colleagues. I went to our border with Canada. I of course come from North Dakota, and we share a long border with Canada. I went to the border in a little, orange, 12-year-old truck with some Durum wheat in the back. We went to the border to take that Durum wheat into Canada. And all the way to the border we saw 18-wheel trucks coming from Canada to the United States hauling Canadian grain--all the way to the border, truck after truck after truck after truck, coming into the United States hauling Canadian grain. 
We got to the border in this little, orange, 12-year-old truck with a little Durum in the back. And guess what. You could not take one grocery sack full of American Durum wheat into Canada, not one. Not only couldn't you get this little, orange truck with Durum into Canada, you could not take a grocery bag full of wheat into Canada. 
That trade relationship is unfair, and it ought to be changed.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me turn to a second trade issue just very briefly. That is the issue of trade with China. We are going to confront, in the coming weeks, the issue of most-favored-nation trading status with China. 
I was in Beijing a few months ago and met--along with Senator Daschle, the minority leader, and some others, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Glenn, and Senator Leahy--with the President of China. The President of China talked about the trade between the United States and China, and said that they were enjoying this trade relationship. They should. This trade relationship is too much now a one-way relationship between the United States and China. China now has a $40 billion trade surplus with the United States, or, to put it another way, we have a $40 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. It is unforgivable that kind of failure in trade should occur. 
Now, let me talk just a little about that. I have put on the easel a chart that shows merchandise trade deficits. We have had a lot of talk in this Chamber about budget deficits and a lot of work to deal with budget deficits. Nobody talks about trade deficits. We have the largest merchandise trade deficit in American history right now. What does that mean? That translates into jobs leaving this country. That is what the merchandise trade deficit means--a weaker manufacturing sector in America and jobs moving overseas. 
Now, the largest merchandise trade deficit in history occurs because we have a significant merchandise trade deficit with a number of countries, one of which is China. Here is what has happened in merchandise trade deficits with China in recent years. Go back 10 years and what you will see is a massive increase in the merchandise trade deficit with China, now nearly $40 billion. The growth in United States exports to China is not nearly as strong as the growth in imports from China. 
Now, people say if you read a newspaper about our trade with China, here is the way they do it. It is like dancing the jig. They say, did you know our exports from the United States to China are up triple? We have tripled our exports. Yes, that is right here. It went from $3.6 billion in 1980 to $11.9 billion in 1996. So we read that in the paper, and they do this all the time, we have tripled our exports from the United States to China. You think, gee, what a terrific thing for our country. They do not tell you the other half of the story. Imports from China are up 46 times--not triple, 46 times. They went from $1 billion to $51 billion. So the people that give you only half the story say, gee, we have tripled our exports to China, but they don't tell you that the amount of imports from China are up 46 times. 
Now, just a short trade quiz. To which countries did the United States export more goods than it did to China in 1996? Did we import more goods to Australia than we do to China? China has 1.2 billion people. Did we export more to Australia than to China? What about Belgium? Did we export more to Belgium than China or Brazil or the Netherlands or Singapore? Did we export more to those countries than China? To which of these countries did we export more than to China? The answer is, all of them. We are a sponge for China, sending us all of their goods. Very close to half of all Chinese exports come to the United States of America. 
What does China buy from us? Well, here is what they buy from us. In the trade flow with China they buy cereal, textile fibers, fertilizers, and some aircraft. What do we buy from China? Electronics, heavy machinery, toys and games, and footwear. This trade relationship is not fair, it does not make sense, and it weakens our country. 
All of the debate here in Congress is about the most-favored-nation status and human rights. I was in China the day they sent Wang Dan to prison--I think for 9 years--sent him to prison because he criticized the government. If you criticize this Government, is somebody going to send you to prison? No, we have 
something called a Constitution. You are welcome to criticize this Government. It is part of what this country is about; the hallmark of freedom is free speech. In China, Wang Dan found free speech might be free but only up to a limit. You criticize your government, you spend years and years in prison. 
So, human rights are important. Yes, we ought to be concerned about human rights with respect to China and with respect to most-favored-nation status. But even if the human rights issue were addressed and even if that issue were resolved, what about the abiding trade problem with China with respect to the imbalance of trade, a $40 billion trade deficit and growing? What about that? What about the other deficit, the trade deficit? 
This administration and this Congress needs to deal with the other deficit, and that is part of this issue. I hope the journalists, newspapers, and others would also start writing about this, carry some op-ed pieces about it. You cannot even get this information in an op-ed piece. They will not carry it. 
What about the $40 billion trade deficit? Why ought not we as Americans expect that if we buy all of these goods from China, they ought to buy a massive quantity of American-manufactured goods as well? China says it wants airplanes, needs airplanes. Guess what? Instead of saying we will buy your airplanes manufactured in the United States, they say we want American manufacturers to manufacture their airplanes in China. It makes no sense. That is not fair trade. 
We will have a discussion this month about most-favored-nation status with China, and yes, part of it should be about the issue of human rights. But part of it also needs to be about the abiding, growing and dangerous trade deficit that we now have with China and about reciprocal trade treatment that would require China to understand that when it sells into our marketplace, it must also then buy in the American marketplace goods that China needs and uses.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to introduce a piece of legislation today that I will describe briefly. 
In the Senate a couple of years ago, I authored, with Senator Feinstein from California, and several others, a piece of legislation that says we ought to have zero tolerance in this country for guns in schools, zero tolerance for guns in schools. We said in the legislation that school districts in this country should have in place a policy that says if a student is caught bringing a gun to school, the student will be expelled for a year. Mr. President, over 6,000 students have now suffered expulsion as a result of bringing weapons to school. 
Weapons in school are serious. You cannot learn unless a school is a safe place for learning. Yet, even today we see the news stories. On February 17, this year, a 16-year-old Miami Edison Senior High School student shot a 9th grade girl at school. In Memphis, TN, on March 28, this year, a 16-year-old student was shot on the campus of Chicksaw Junior High by a 15-year-old student. On February 11, two students were shot and wounded in Bronx high schools. On March 29, Detroit, MI, a 16-year-old student was shot seven times while standing in the back hallways of a high school. On February 18 this year, a 13-year-old middle school student was charged with attempting to murder his teacher. 
I was at a school not too many blocks from this building a couple of years ago. You go through metal detectors; there are security guards seated at the front of the school. The school is a lock-down school. When the students get in, they lock the door. You have to go through metal detectors to get in. About a month after I was there, a student bumped another one at the water fountain and the other student pulled a gun and shot him four times. That is a school within blocks of this U.S. Capitol building. 
We passed a piece of legislation that says there shall be zero tolerance for guns in schools, and students bringing guns to school shall be expelled from school for a year. That has worked in the sense that it has taken those who brought guns to school out of school to make sure other students are safe. But something has happened in the meantime. After we passed that legislation and it became law, a court in New York issued a ruling that was about as goofy a court ruling as any I have ever heard. In New York, in a school, a young boy came in one day wearing a leather jacket and went through the front door of the school and began walking down a hallway. The security guard noticed a bulge under the leather jacket near the waistline, so he apprehended the student and reached under this jacket and took from the student a loaded pistol--a loaded pistol was in the possession of this 16-year-old boy walking down the hallway. The 16-year-old boy was obviously taken from school that day and put in a disciplinary proceeding and expelled, and a number of things happened. The boy appealed it, and a court in New York decided that the evidence of a gun on a 16-year-old boy in school had to be discarded because the security guard did not have probable cause to search the student in the hallway of the school. 
Now, when I saw the decision by the New York court, it occurred to me to be so nonsensical as to require nothing from any of us. Then I decided that if we do nothing, it means that somehow someone believes that court was thinking straight. Well, it was not, and I introduced in the last session, and will reintroduce today on behalf of myself and Senator Feinstein, a piece of legislation that makes it clear that evidence of a gun seized in school cannot be dismissed as evidence. Evidence of a gun can be used in a school disciplinary proceeding. 
There is no right to carry a gun in school. If that 16-year-old boy had gone to National Airport to try to board a plane, they would have forced him to go through a metal detector and they would have said you cannot get on a commercial airplane if you are carrying a pistol. But the judge's decision seems to say somehow that the security guard was at fault. The security guard noticed a gun on this young student, or at least a bulge in the 
leather jacket, and took a loaded pistol from this boy in a public school, and the security guard is at fault for obtaining evidence inappropriately? I do not think so. That is not the way this country should work. If we say you cannot take a loaded gun on an airplane, we ought to be able to say a 16-year-old boy cannot take a loaded pistol into a school. If we do not have the opportunity and ability to say that and make it stick, there is precious little hope for education in this country. 
This legislation will make sure that no judge ever again is able to say that a security guard erred in taking away a loaded pistol from a 16-year-old boy walking in the hallways of our public schools. When we passed the Gun Free Schools Act and said that there shall be expulsion all across this country for kids bringing guns to schools, we wanted to send a national message to every student in this country, `Don't even think about bringing a gun to school, because there will be certain and immediate results. The results will be you will be expelled, no ifs, ands, or buts.' 
It has been successful. Have we prevented every act of violence in school? No, but thousands of children who brought guns to school are now not in the classroom threatening other students. They are expelled from those classrooms, many of them probably in some alternative setting, but they are not in the classroom terrorizing other students. 
I am so appalled by the decision of the court in New York that I want a Federal law to complete the Gun Free Schools Act with the legislation we introduce today called the Safer Schools Act. Any young person who brings a gun to school should expect that a security guard at the front door can remove that gun from them and that it will later be used as evidence in a school disciplinary proceeding. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from South Carolina. I know that the piece of legislation that he brings to the floor of the Senate, called the defense authorization bill, is one of the largest pieces of legislation that we deal with at any time during the year here in Congress. It contains important matters dealing with America's preparedness. I am anxious to debate parts of that bill and I wanted to compliment the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for his leadership and Senator Levin from Michigan for his leadership. I hope we can make significant progress this week on the legislation. I hope my speaking in morning business has not impeded that in any way. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate voted on a reconciliation bill that will make some of the most significant changes in the 30-year history of the Medicare Program, and I want to explain to my colleagues and constituents why I opposed the Senate's bill. 
I opposed the bill with some regret, because, for the most part, it reflects the bipartisan budget agreement, which I have supported. For example, I voted for the bipartisan budget resolution earlier this month. That plan requires the Congress to pass legislation to cut the deficit by just over $200 billion over the next 5 years, with about $115 billion of that deficit reduction to come from slowing down the rate of growth of Medicare. So I am not unwilling to vote for restraining Medicare spending in order to reduce the deficit. 
We must put this country on track toward a balanced budget while ensuring the health and stability of the Medicare Program. Doing so requires that we limit the rate of growth of the Medicare Program. The Medicare Program has been growing at a rate of about 10 percent a year, a rate of growth that the country cannot sustain, especially once the baby boomer generation begins retiring and putting additional financial stress on the program. 
I had hoped to support the Senate's bill. In fact, the bill includes many items I have supported for a long time, including expanding Medicare's coverage for preventive benefits, expanding the health plan options available to seniors in North Dakota and across the country, and other changes to improve access to health care in rural areas and strengthen our ability to fight fraud and abuse in the program. I voted for a substitute Medicare package offered by Senator Reed that included these provisions but did not include the more controversial provisions found in the Senate bill. Most notably, the Reed substitute, like the Senate bill, would have extended the life of the Medicare trust fund for 10 more years, but would have done so without asking Medicare beneficiaries to pay significantly more for their health care and without knocking a number of seniors out of the Medicare Program. 
Unfortunately, in several extremely important areas, this bill did not abide by the bipartisan budget agreement achieved during months of negotiations this spring. The Senate bill abandoned this approach by including several provisions that will result in significantly higher out-of-pocket health care expenses for our Nation's older Americans. 
The Senate bill included two significant structural changes--an increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 and a means test for the Medicare part B premium paid by upper income older Americans. I voted to strike these provisions from the Senate bill because I think it is inappropriate to make these kinds of central changes to the Medicare Program on the spending side of the budget ledger in order to make room for larger tax cuts on the tax side of the ledger. It is my view that changes made to Medicare should be made for the purpose of strengthening the program--not to provide room for tax cuts, the bulk of which will go to upper income earners in this country. Let's keep Medicare healthy and our older Americans healthy as well. 
Why in this bill was it proposed that we ask seniors who make more than $50,000 to pay higher prices for their Medicare policies so that investors who make $500,000 or more could be given tax cuts? There is no denying a direct connection when the Medicare changes were proposed in the context of reconciliation legislation that includes tax cuts. In this reconciliation process, the act of achieving Medicare savings was intertwined with the desire for tax cuts on the revenue side. 
There are some signs of reasonableness in this bill. For example, I support this bill's creation of a national, bipartisan commission charged with making recommendations to Congress on the long-term changes necessary to ensuring the extended solvency of the Medicare program. On the advice of this Commission we should confront the demographic changes facing our country over the next 30 to 40 years as the baby boomers retire and our Nation grays. The commission will have one year to study and report its recommendations to Congress. Let's hope that this process will ultimately result in a solid package of changes that the Congress will act on quickly. 
With this package of recommendations on long-term solvency I am willing to consider basic structural changes to the program, including means testing and/or increasing the eligibility age if the following conditions are met. 
First, if we consider increasing the eligibility age, we must be able to respond to the needs of the retirees between the ages of 65 and 67 who will still need affordable insurance coverage. The Senate bill does not consider this issue. It simply proposes to leave these folks uninsured. Already, the number of retirees with employer-provided health insurance has dropped 14 percent in the six years between 1988 to 1994, and every indication is that this trend would be exacerbated by raising the Medicare eligibility age. Most low- or even middle-income seniors in their mid-sixties will never be able to afford the premiums that will be assessed by the health insurance industry to cover people of that age. 
Now, I voted in support of increasing the Social Security retirement age in 1983, as part of a plan to extend the solvency of the Social Security program well into the next century. But I do not agree with those who compare the increase in the eligibility age for Medicare to increasing the Social Security retirement age to 67. Under Social Security, seniors who need or choose to retire before age 67 will still have the option to do so, at a reduced benefit level. The ramifications are very different for increasing the Medicare eligibility age. Under the Senate bill, these seniors will not have an option for getting Medicare benefits before they turn 67 and many of them will become uninsured. 
If we raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67, we must provide some means to guarantee the availability of affordable insurance coverage for the citizens in that age group. One of the issues the Medicare commission created by this bill is charged with studying is whether it is feasible to allow retirees who have not yet reached the eligibility age for Medicare to buy into the program. This idea deserves consideration before we act to increase the eligibility age. 
With respect to means testing or income relating, as it is called in the Senate bill, I am willing to support means testing for Medicare, but again, only after careful consideration of the ramifications for the entire Medicare program and for the purpose of extending the solvency of Medicare, not as part of a reconciliation bill that is designed to cut spending for the purpose of accommodating additional tax cuts. 
One of the reasons that Medicare has such widespread support is because it provides health insurance coverage for virtually all older Americans. If through means testing we create an incentive for wealthier, healthier people to drop out of the program because they can get a better deal outside of Medicare, then we ought to at least understand and consider the ramifications of that. 
There are other things about the Senate bill that create substantial new burdens on low- and moderate-income older Americans. Under this bill, seniors will be asked to pay significant new out-of-pocket costs. In North Dakota, 70 percent of our senior citizens have incomes under $15,000, and on average, they spend $2,500 for prescription drugs and other health care expenses not covered by Medicare or supplemental insurance. Many of these folks simply cannot afford to pay much more. 
I am concerned about the new $5 co-payment for home health visits. I voted to eliminate this new cost from the Senate bill. While $5 may not seem like a lot of money to many of us, a lot of the seniors who rely on home health care cannot afford this extra expense and might be forced to enter a hospital or nursing home at significantly greater cost to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
This bill also erodes the protections that currently exist in Medicare which limit the amount doctors can charge Medicare beneficiaries above and beyond the Medicare-approved amount. This bill results in millions of dollars in new out-of-pocket costs. 
The conferees on this bill have an opportunity to address these concerns and to drop troubling provisions from the bill, such as the means testing of the Medicare premium, the increase in the Medicare eligibility age, and the new home health care co-payment. Eliminating these provisions from the final bill would still lengthen the solvency of the Medicare program for 10 more years, and I hope the conference committee will take this action.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, I would like to make a few comments to associate myself with the comments of the majority leader and the Senator from Montana. These two gentlemen have demonstrated great leadership on this issue, and I especially admire their dedication to educate our colleagues about this important issue. I believe that at the bottom line, if we allow this critical technology to be stifled in the United States I believe our national interests will be severely undermined. We must do our best to allow U.S. companies to compete in the world marketplace, and do so without in any way undercutting our national security interests. 
I believe that the bill that was reported last week out of the Commerce Committee does not achieve those objectives. In fact, I fear that bill may be nothing more than an attempt to ensure that no bill passes in Congress this year. This would be a victory for the administration, which has rigorously resisted changes to their outdated and obsolete policies. I must say that I try to support the administration on many issues, but on this issue, I have found that their arguments and policies simply do not withstand scrutiny. 
And, Mr. President, I was an original sponsor of the Burns bill and I worked very hard with the Senator to help shape the consensus position that was rejected by the 
committee. I would like to take a few moments to set the record straight about the true differences between the McCain-Kerrey bill and the Burns' approach. 
The bill that passed the committee certainly represents a victory for those within the administration opposed to any relaxation of export controls in this area. In fact, it may be a perfect bill from their standpoint. It allows them to begin the process of domestic control while actually freezing exports to a weak enough level of encryption technology that was actually decoded by amateurs the very day before. And it is very unclear to me exactly where the McCain-Kerrey reaches a compromise position. 
The Burns' bill however, merely allows that we would allow export of 56-bit encryption immediately, but we would establish a process for understanding the level of encryption that is generally available throughout the world. That review process would include panels and advisory boards consisting of government and industry representatives equipped to determine the security strength of particular software that is available in the world market. Our belief was that it was in the national interest for American software companies to maintain leadership in this area. The very notion that we would let foreign companies get a head start on new technology while forcing American companies to come to a government entity to plead for the right to catch up was troubling enough to both Senator Burns and myself. But, we agreed to this compromise because we thought it represented the appropriate middle ground. 
As the majority leader reminded us, we did not accomplish what many of us had hoped that we would while in Committee, but we will continue to work within the process to improve the legislation. I remain committed to encryption reform and will do everything possible to try to educate my colleagues about this issue.

Mr. DORGAN. Senator Conrad is exactly correct. And, if I might reclaim my time, let me add to Senator Conrad's presentation something that is not from us, but something from the New York Times. Let me read an editorial from the New York Times, because I know anyone can bring anything to this floor. You can bring a chart to this floor that says shrimps whistle, pigs fly, and the Moon is made of green cheese. You can bring a chart that shows anything you want. Will Rogers said it best about this debate. He said: `It's not what he knows that bothers me. It is what he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.' 
Let me read you the New York Times editorial about this discussion we are having: 
Before Congress votes on anything, it should get its facts straight. The Republicans present bogus tables suggesting their tax package is fair. The tables stop at the year 2002, before the cuts that favor the wealthy on capital gains, inheritance and retirement accounts take hold. Also, the GOP treats as burdens the tax payments that the investors will voluntarily make as they sell stocks and bonds to take advantage of a lower capital gains rate. The bizarre implication is that investors are hurt by a rate cut. These tables suggest that the middle class reaps most of the benefits. Independent analysts say that about 50 percent of the cuts will go to the richest 5 percent of the taxpayers. 
That is not me saying it, it is a New York Times editorial. 
Is the New York Times correct? Yes, they are correct. Why? Here is the reason. The chart that we have just seen illustrated on the floor of the Senate about burdens is a chart that covers only the years up to 2002, and it ignores 94 percent of the costs of capital gains, estate, IRA tax cuts in the Senate bill. When the tax cuts proposed in this bill are fully phased in, there is no question what the distribution of this tax cut is. By far, the preponderance of the tax cuts offered in this bill will go to the richest Americans. 
This chart that we have just seen, the burden table that is offered on the floor of the Senate, portrays capital gains tax cuts as increasing the tax burden on upper income taxpayers, and it also excludes the estate tax cuts, which total $35 billion in the Senate bill. That is why you have a table that is simply wrong. 
Is it right in the context of what it proposes to tell people in a snapshot of time? Sure, but what it proposes to tell people is something that doesn't include all of the facts. It says, take a look at this little slice, and then we are going to give you the conclusion about this little slice of facts, but it is not real. 
Mr. President, we are having a discussion about whether the proposed tax cut can be improved. The answer is, yes, it can; it can be improved. One of the things that traps everyone in this Chamber and I think everyone in Congress is the minute you start talk about cutting taxes, we rush immediately to the corner and begin to talk about taxes, and then we begin immediately to talk about capital gains. Let me describe another approach that makes more sense. 
Two-thirds of the American people pay higher payroll taxes than taxes. The tax that has increased in this country in recent years has been the payroll tax. The folks who go to work, work hard, sweat, get dirty, take a shower after work are the folks 
who earn a wage. They don't sit home clipping coupons. They don't get big dividends. They don't have big stock gains. They work for a wage. And then someone who showers before work and sits on the front porch and never raises a sweat and never gets dirty because they are simply cashing in their dividend checks and watching the stock market go up, and so on, they get capital gains. But we are told that stream of income somehow is preferable to the income from work. 
So we have a philosophy in this Chamber that says let us tax work, but let us exempt investments. Why? Why tax work and exempt investment? And if you do that, what is the consequence? The consequence is easy to understand. Who has the investments and, therefore, who gets the tax break if you exempt investment? Who works and who pays the higher payroll taxes because they work? Then who is largely left out of this equation when it comes time to talk about cutting taxes? 
The other side says to us, `Well, except we propose a per-child tax credit, and that's going to help all those families with children,' except they propose the tax credit not go to nearly 40 percent of the children in this country because the folks don't make enough money to qualify for it. Why? Because they measure it only against the income those folks earn as opposed to measuring it against the payroll tax they pay--and, I might add, a higher payroll tax at that. 
Can this be improved? Absolutely. Should it be improved? You are darn right it should be improved. Has Senator Daschle proposed something that will dramatically improve this tax relief proposal so when you pass around the largess of tax cuts, you go around that table and you see the income earner sitting at the table, those at the bottom fifth, those at the second fifth, on and on, each of them are going to get a significant part of the tax relief? Is that what Senator Daschle has proposed? I think so. If we don't pass this substitute, we will end up with a tax bill that goes around that table and passes out tax cuts in a way that is fundamentally unfair. Oh, there are some at the table who will get almost nothing, some just a few crumbs, some a few tiny little slices, and some at the other end of the table will sit there with a huge platter and three-fourths of the cake. All we are suggesting is there are other ways to measure proposals for tax cuts that provide a fairer distribution. 
I find interesting this discussion we have about the economy and where we are and where we are headed. The economy is doing better in this country. Some wouldn't give this administration credit under any set of circumstances. But this economy rests not on the shoulders of the Federal Reserve Board, the last American dinosaur that sits down there in that concrete temple; this economy rests on the confidence of the American people that we and others will do the right thing to keep this economy on track. 
Doing the right thing in 1993 meant a Deficit Reduction Act that brought down the Federal budget deficit in a serious way. It was not fun to vote for that because it wasn't politically smart to vote for that, and my party paid a significant price for passing it. I can recall--and I won't mention names--I can recall those who stood up and said, `You pass this and this country will be in a recession.' `You pass this and this country will be in a depression.' `You pass this and you will throw the economy completely off track.' 
We passed it. We indicated to the American people we were serious about reducing the deficit. Guess what? The American people took hope and confidence from that, and the result is when you have confidence, you buy cars, houses, you make decisions about the future based on that confidence. When you lack confidence, you defer those purchases and you have an impact on the economy that is negative. When you have confidence, you have an impact that is positive. I am pleased we did what we did in 1993, and the economy is better because of it. Inflation is down, the deficit is down, unemployment is down, economic growth is up. 
So, in that context, while we balance the budget, or attempt to balance the budget, with a series of decisions now and attempt to provide some tax relief, the question today is, who will receive the relief? And we get these burden sharks that give us a vision of who gets the relief that is simply wrong. 
Again, I refer to the New York Times editorial. You can't give us a description of who gets tax relief by leaving out the bulk of the tax relief that is going to go to the upper income folks. 
Let me finish on one additional point. One of my concerns about what we are doing is we will create a tax shelter industry if we go the totus-porcus route of capital gains. I believe very much that recreating the tax shelter business in this country is unhealthy for America. 
Senator Daschle is proposing something that makes sense. Let's measure against payroll taxes paid; let's measure against that an ability to receive tax relief based on the refundable child care tax credit. That makes great sense to me. If we don't make that child care tax credit refundable against payroll 
taxes paid, which are the taxes that have increased in recent years, then we will not have done working families a great favor with this bill. 
So I stand today and hope that colleagues will support the substitute offered by Senator Daschle, cosponsored by myself and others. I think it is substantially more fair, and I think it substantially improves the tax relief bill the Senate is now considering. 
Mr. President, I know others wish to speak. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Texas. My understanding was we were going back and forth, and I appreciate very much the courtesy of the Senator from Texas. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment that is relatively simple and it deals with the issue of capital gains. Capital gains, as most of us know, has long been a controversial issue here in the Congress. 
Some will remember, if they relate back to the good old days of the Tax Code--I call the good old days those old days in which there were people in this country who would do things not because the market system suggested they should do them, but because the Tax Code provided incentives to do them. I do not think they were good old days, but there was created in this country an army of people whose lives were devoted to figuring out how you can convert ordinary income to capital gains and make money off the Tax Code, and how you can decide to build what the market system says you should not build but still make money because the Tax Code provides the incentives to build it. 
Well, we got rid of that army of accountants and lawyers and others in the tax shelter industry with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. 
The proposal for a capital gains tax preference in the bill that comes to the floor of the Senate has no limitation. I did not take Latin so I don't know if `totus porcus' means whole hog, but I certainly think the term applies to this capital gains tax proposal. You can convert unlimited amounts of ordinary income to capital gains and have the tax break that is imbedded in this bill forever. 
I propose the following. If a capital gains tax break truly is proposed in order to help those families who save for their kids' college education, to help a small business, to help a family farm that might sell the business or the farm, then let us have at least some reasonable limitation on the capital gains tax benefit. 
It is interesting; in this country we have two different philosophies of taxation. One says let us tax work. If you are on a payroll someplace and working, let us tax work. And nobody worries much about the consequence of that. Nobody worries about the impact of inflation on the wage and says let us index work salaries for inflation. Nobody says that. 
If you work and you take a shower at the end of the day after you work because you worked hard and you sweat, you earned an honest wage, you pay a tax up here and nobody is running around this Chamber saying, gee, let's index that for inflation. Let's talk about a work gains index. Nobody talks about that. 
But then others say let us tax work, but let us exempt investment. Somebody else is an investor, takes a shower in the morning, does not get dirty during the day, does not sweat, sits in a chair someplace and invests, we have all kinds of folks running around the Capitol saying, oh, we have to do something to provide incentives for people who get their income that way. 
Let us tax the income from work and let us exempt the income from investments, that is what is at the root of this debate. Now, the question is, who gets what and who has what? 
Here is a chart that describes very well why I have offered this amendment. The bulk of the capital gains go to those in the very upper income bracket. One-half of 1 percent of the taxpayers of this country have gains of $200,000 or more, and they get fully half of the capital gains that people get in this country. So when you say let us give a tax benefit through capital gains and have no limit on it, what you are saying is let us provide an enormous benefit to the upper income folks. Eighty-nine percent of the taxpayers that have capital gains have very small capital gains, under $10,000. And all of that in aggregate, 90 percent of the taxpayers have 15 percent of the dollar amount of the capital gains in this country. 
So, to repeat, one-half of 1 percent of taxpayers get half of the Nation's capital gains, the bulk of the capital gains. And nine-tenths of the taxpayers get about one-sixth of the capital gains. It is clear that any attempt to give a tax break to capital gains income will disproportionately benefit folks in the very upper income bracket. 
My proposal is very simple. It says let us limit the capital gains tax preference in this bill to $1 million in a taxpayer's lifetime, $1 million. We will give you a tax preference on capital gains for a million dollars. Isn't $1 million enough? Should there not be some limitation? Is there no end? Is there no bottom to this pot? Or do we just insist that somehow investment has greater merit than work and we will continue to fight and struggle to reward investment and penalize work by saying let us tax work and exempt investment. 
This is a painfully simple amendment. I have offered it previously here in the Congress. I hope that as we now begin this effort to restore a capital gains preference, we at least will have the good sense to limit it. 
So that is the amendment I have offered. I reserve the remainder of my time. I would like to respond to some of the comments that are made, but, Mr. President, this amendment will have a significant impact on the construction of a capital gains tax preference. I do not propose we abolish it. I propose instead we limit it to $1 million per taxpayer in the taxpayer's lifetime. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was staying right with the Senator from Utah until he mentioned the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. In ancient Rome they used to have augurs, and the practice of augury was to read the flight of birds and the entrails of dead cattle in order to predict the future. 
I have said perhaps the Fed could use some augurs, given their recent performance. They indicated that if unemployment ever fell below 6 percent we would have a brand new wave of inflation. Unemployment has been under 6 percent for 38 months and of course inflation is down, way down. But that is another subject for another day. 
The folks at the top of the income structure in this country already have a 30-percent tax differential on capital gains. They pay 30 percent less on capital gains than ordinary income tax rates. My proposal to limit to $1 million for a lifetime the capital gains tax benefits in this bill will effectively relate to about 1 percent of the taxpayers. 
I do not disagree with the comments by the Senator from Utah about the germ of an idea and the spark of interest to own a business and that is where success is developed and that is where millionaires come from. I do not disagree with that at all. 
I would make this point, however. There are people out here working today who have that same instinct inside of wanting to own their own business and wanting to build a business. Their only stream of income is a wage, and they pay a higher tax on that wage than is being proposed for capital gains. Because of that higher tax they may not be able to accumulate the capital to invest in the business and become the entrepreneur and become successful and make a lot of money. 
So my suggestion is this. We have other streams of income in this country which we measure for tax purposes. We have rents, we have salaries, we have capital gains, we have a range of interests, we have a range of incomes. And there are those who take out one stream of income, one kind of income called capital gains and say let's give a tax break to capital gains. 
I am not opposed under any circumstance to a tax break for capital gains. We now have one, the 30 percent tax preference. What I oppose is a circumstance where the bulk of the tax preference goes to such a few in the population. I am saying we ought to do this differently, and I have felt that way for 10, 15 years. I think it would be good for the country to do it differently. 
I say this finally. If we go back to the `totus porcus' approach for capital gains--buy a share of stock, hold it 6 months and 1 day and get a tax preference--go back to the broad approach, much of which is proposed here, we will resurrect the tax shelter industry, resurrect an army of people in the tax shelter industry, and we will rue the day we do it. 
The tax shelter industry is to productive enterprise like professional wrestling is to the performing arts. I defy anyone to tell me one good thing that comes from the tax shelter industry in this country. We largely got rid of it in 1986 with the 1986 bill, and I am worried very much we create now a new set of circumstances to allow taxpayers of this country to hire the best minds in America, not for productive enterprise but to tell them how can they create, from their stream of income, capital gains by which they can make money off the Tax Code. That is my great concern. So I propose we limit the capital gains treatment for a taxpayer to $1 million during the taxpayer's lifetime.

Mr. DORGAN. We will have an opportunity to discuss this further. I respect the views of the two Senators who spoke in opposition to this amendment. I would say we are talking in the outyears about $4 billion to $5 billion a year without my limitation. That $4 billion to $5 billion I would like to use to reduce taxes on wages to the extent we can. 
The tax increases in this country have come from payroll taxes now. Two-thirds of the American workers pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes, and I would have structured the tax bill completely differently than it is now structured. I would have addressed the issue of burgeoning payroll taxes which tries to be a clothes hanger on all of the acts of creating a job to say, `By the way, we are going to hang all of these social obligations on the act of creating a job.' 
I am very concerned about that in terms of the disincentive it gives to someone in business to create new jobs. I don't want to go far afield, but there is no social program we discuss in Congress that is as important or effective as a good job to cure what ails this country. 
So this $1 million limitation makes good sense. I hope Members of the Senate will consider it and hope that we will have a chance to vote on it.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be brief. This motion is relatively simple. 
My concern about where we are heading is this. I am concerned that we will decide to have balanced the budget and provided substantial tax cuts. And then, because the tax cuts are so backloaded, in the second 5 years our country will find itself back in a deficit. 
I propose that we remedy that by having a trigger mechanism that would sunset the provisions of capital gains and the IRA's in the following circumstances: First, if the estimated loss as a result of the tax cuts exceeds our current expectations; and second, if the Treasury Department says we are running a deficit in the previous fiscal year. 
My point is very simple. If we begin to run a deficit, and if running a deficit is because the cost of these tax cuts exceeds what we now think it will be, I would like us to trigger them off so we can get the budget back in balance. I just do not want to get into a circumstance that we have found ourselves in previously. We do not want to think we will turn out all right, and find 7 years down the road a huge Federal deficit. 
I point out that the tax cuts in this bill are fairly well backloaded, and the upper-income tax cuts, just as an example, $17.8 billion in 2002, the same tax cuts will cost nearly $100 billion in the year 2007. My fear is because the tax cuts are backloaded we could find ourselves in a circumstance where we are right back into a deficit. 
Again, the two points are this: If the cost of the tax cuts significantly exceeds what we estimated them to be, and if we have had a deficit in the previous fiscal year, then my motion would trigger a repeal, temporary repeal, of four provisions of the tax cut dealing with capital gains and IRA's. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, I am not suggesting that we should increase taxes. I am saying to the extent that we now reduce taxes and reduce revenue, and to the extent that that helps cause another Federal deficit in the second 5 years because the cost of those tax cuts explodes, I say we should put an insurance or safety mechanism in this bill to prevent us from running a deficit again. 
Now, I hope that we will have learned from the last decade. There is merit, and I compliment the Members of this Congress who care about the Federal deficit, there is merit in fiscal discipline in dealing with the deficit. I just urge if we have a circumstance where we can provide protection in the outyears against an exploding of the Federal deficit, again we try to do that. 
I am somewhat concerned that the chairman will make a point of order against my motion. I understand that there will be a budget enforcement mechanism offered by the Senator from New Mexico. Will a point of order will be made against them? Enforcement mechanisms that provide protection against an explosion of the Federal deficit make great sense to me. That is the proposal that I offer with this trigger. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Well, let us suppose that in 7, 8, or 9 years we see the deficit begin to explode on us. Is the Senator suggesting that we cut health care for kids, but that we retain tax cuts that are backloaded, that are six and eight times as large in the year 2007 than in the year 2002, and are for the largest income earners in this country? I would like to see us vote on that in the U.S. Senate. 
My point is we are making deliberate decisions about the Tax Code here, some good decisions, some I think are not so good. 
We need to think about the consequences of these decisions. This motion would help us do that. If the tax cuts exceed the expected amount and if we are also running a deficit in the outyears, four provisions of this tax cut bill would be temporarily suspended. 
That is my motion to refer today. I hope the Senate would consider it favorably. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the votes on this reconciliation bill included two votes on spending cuts in the Medicare Program. The two controversial amendments dealt with increasing the eligibility age for Medicare from age 65 to 67 and income-testing of Medicare for upper income beneficiaries. 
I support the change that will result in substantial savings through reduction of Medicare reimbursements to providers. I also agree with other changes that will improve and streamline the program. 
However, I voted against the proposal included in the Committee's bill which would increase the eligibility age from 65 to 67 and the proposal to impose a means-test for higher-income beneficiaries. 
I am willing to consider supporting both of these proposals under the right conditions, which I will describe below but I think it is inappropriate to be making Medicare cuts on the spending side of reconciliation in order to make room for larger tax cuts on the revenue side of reconciliation. 
Whatever changes are made in Medicare should be made exclusively and specifically for the purpose of extending the solvency of Medicare--not for the purpose of providing additional room for tax cuts, the bulk of which are proposed to go to upper income earners in the United States. We must look at the right ways to keep Medicare solvent without breaking faith with the country's senior citizens. 
Asking senior citizens who make more than $50,000 to pay higher prices for their Medicare policies so that investors who make $500,000 can be given tax cuts seems inappropriate to me. There's no denying a direct connection when the Medicare proposals are made in the context of a reconciliation bill that includes spending and taxing. The act of achieving Medicare savings then becomes intertwined with the desire for tax cuts on the revenue side. 
The reconciliation bill specifically calls for a commission to make recommendations on long term changes necessary to ensure the solvency of the Medicare Program. I support that and I hope that such a commission will be established quickly and will ultimately result in solid recommendations which the Congress can then act on quickly. 
When we are able to look at recommendations which are developed specifically for the purpose of extending Medicare solvency, then I am willing to consider changes to Medicare, including means-testing and/or increasing the eligibility age under the following conditions. 
First, with respect to increasing the eligibility age, if and when we do that, we must be prepared to respond to the question of what happens to those senior citizens whose incomes are inadequate to pay the higher cost of private health care insurance between age 65 and 67 when they would no longer be covered. Changing the eligibility age from 65 to 67 without providing some mechanism to provide for the availability of affordable insurance coverage for the citizens in that age group would simply mean we have millions more uninsured Americans. Low income senior citizens between the ages of 65 and 67 will never be able to afford the kind of premiums that will be assessed by the health care industry to insure people of that age. So, the eligibility age increase cannot simply be considered on its own as it was in the reconciliation bill. Nor can it be argued that the increase in the eligibility age parallels the increase in the social security retirement age. The ramifications are very different for increasing the medicare eligibility age. 
Second, with respect to means-testing or income-testing, as it is called, I am willing to support means-testing for Medicare, but again, only on the condition that the means-testing itself is done for the purpose of extending the solvency of Medicare and not part of a reconciliation bill that is designed to cut spending in a way that will accommodate additional tax cuts. 
The temptation is too great for those in Congress who never supported the Medicare bill in the first place. It is a concern of mine that the proposed changes to Medicare in this bill are there not for the purpose of increasing the solvency of Medicare, but rather are there to accommodate tax cuts for upper income Americans. This, in my judgement, undercuts the Medicare Program.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise this evening to offer some amendments. I will do so and understand that they will be set aside for other business to be conducted after these amendments. I wanted to have an opportunity to discuss them, some of which I hope the chairman and ranking member will be able to support. Others I expect they will not. 
But I do so with great respect. And I say, as I begin this process, that I was very impressed that the chairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Delaware, clearly sought bipartisanship and sought a working relationship with all members of the committee as he constructed the piece of legislation that is now on the floor of the Senate. I, for one, applaud him for that. 
Some of the proposals in this piece of legislation I think are excellent proposals, I support them. Others, I would have written differently. And that is the purpose of offering some amendments. But generally speaking, I think the Senator from Delaware has done the Senate a service by saying, when the committee writes a bill, he wants to involve all members of the committee. Instead of, as is so often the case here in the Senate, having a political debate ending up with the worst of what each has to offer, reaching out and getting the best of what both sides have to offer on these issues makes a great deal of sense. 
So I begin by paying my compliments to the manner in which the Finance Committee wrote this bill. As I said, some parts of 
the bill I support very strongly. Other parts, I would have written differently and would like to change. That is the purpose for this discussion.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me describe a motion to refer I intend to offer that I want to get a vote on as we proceed. It is a motion that would do the following: 
We are proposing, and Congress will likely allow to become law, a series of tax cuts. I support some of these proposals. I want to be certain, however, that the direction that we are heading is a direction that will not explode the deficit in the outyears. 
We are all familiar with the stories about the 1981 tax cut proposals and the discussion about the fiscal policy in which we then had less revenue but built up our military spending, double, and then entitlements continued to rise, and the result was we blew a real hole in the Federal deficit. 
I am going to propose a trigger, in essence. I will do it, however, in a different manner. I will do it with a motion to refer the bill back to the committee with instructions to report back with an amendment providing for a mechanism to temporarily suspend sections of the bill dealing with capital gains and the IRAs in any fiscal year after the year 2002 if two things occur: 
One, the Congressional Budget Office reports that the revenues lost due to the bill have exceeded the budget agreement's restrictions on tax cuts, and, two, the Department of the Treasury reports there has been a deficit in the previous fiscal year. 
My point is very simple. I would like us to have some safety mechanism in this piece of legislation that says, if where we are headed beyond the first 5 years results in additional Federal budget deficits, that then we could suspend temporarily a part of these tax changes so that we can get the budget back into balance. 
I have proposed it the way I have proposed it because I do not want us to discover that we are having budget deficits in the outyears simply because we are spending more money. That is not my purpose. But I do want to be in a circumstance here or have the Senate be in a situation that if the amount of tax cuts exceed the revenues that we had an agreement for in this piece of legislation, and if the Treasury Department reports that we had a deficit the previous year, that four sections of this tax cut would be temporarily suspended in order to get the budget back in balance. 
That will be one of my recommendations. I do that simply because I want us to be certain beyond the first 5 years that we maintain the fiscal discipline that I think is commendable and I think is necessary. 
We have, I think, achieved some things together in this Congress with a budget agreement, one which I voted for. I do not want to blow that apart in the sixth, seventh or eighth years out believing then, well, we balanced the budget for 5 years and then all of a sudden the budget is out of balance and in a deficit condition once again. 
So I send this motion to refer to the desk and ask for its consideration.

Mr. DORGAN. Next, Madam President and the chairman of the committee, I intend to offer three amendments that are relatively small, targeted amendments that deal with the issue of disasters, natural disasters. Most of us recognize that we have spent a lot of time talking about disaster relief and issues affecting people dealing with flood disasters, earthquake disasters, tornadoes and fires and so on. 
We had a circumstance in our region of the country where the Red River had a massive flood, a 500-year flood. We had 90 percent of a community of 50,000 people who were displaced out of their homes, many hundreds of those homes--nearly 1,000 homes--have been totally and permanently destroyed. 
In many of those cases, all of their records were destroyed as well. People left with a half hour's notice and only the clothes they were wearing and lost everything. The Internal Revenue Service knowing that this happened the first week or so of April, second week of April, they said, `We will allow an extension to file income tax returns.' It is pretty clear people fleeing a flood and who have lost everything, including all of their records, will not be able to file tax returns on April 15. 
So the Internal Revenue Service said they would extend the tax filing deadline. I appreciate that. And it made a lot of sense because hundreds of those people, thousands of those people could not have complied, people in South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota. The IRS said, `We will consider a tax return timely filed if it's filed by the end of May.' Then as this flood continued, they moved it to August, and that is where it is. 
The IRS said to those victims of that disaster, `If you file by that date, there will be no penalty because we have moved the filing date,' recognizing you could not possibly comply. But then the IRS said, `But you are going to have to pay interest because we don't have the authority to waive the interest.' The disaster victims have asked the question, `Well, if it is considered timely filed, why are we being charged interest?' And the Internal Revenue Service said, `Well, you're being charged interest because we don't have the capability of waiving it.' 
The Treasury Secretary said he is sympathetic to my amendment, he will support it. I have talked to the majority on this, and I hope this will be one that--it will have an almost insignificant revenue consequence, but just makes sense. It gives the IRS the authority clearly to do what it wants to do and should do but does not now have the authority to do. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the motion to refer.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will be brief on the next two amendments. They relate to the same issues. As I indicated, the first dealt with the waiver of interest, which I hope we can do. It will have almost insignificant consequence, but will be significant to the disaster's victims. 
The others, I have been visiting with the staff of the majority and the minority and other Members. 
One deals with the question of the use of IRAs by victims of the disaster who now find themselves with a need to invest in their home to repair it, but they do not have any money except that which is in an IRA, or the need to invest in a business that has been destroyed, and they have no resources except that which is in an IRA. 
I hope with the chairman that we can find a way to provide that opportunity. I am happy to provide a reasonable limit on it. 
I offer the amendment and hope we can visit about it in the ensuing hours prior to this bill's conclusion. 
Let me offer that amendment.

Mr. DORGAN. I offer one additional amendment this evening to be sent to the desk. Let me describe the amendment before I send it to the desk. It is an amendment that I wrote years ago, and I have offered it previously but feel that I want to offer it again on the issue of capital gains. I have long felt when we provide capital gains differential treatment that we should provide a lifetime limit on the amount of capital gains one is able to take at a preferred tax rate. 
I have proposed in the past, and will propose with this amendment, a $1 million lifetime limit on capital gains tax treatment per taxpayer. I will describe later, and we will have an opportunity tomorrow to discuss some of these issues, but I really feel that the Congress should address this with respect to capital gains. 
Let me make one additional point. There are some--and we can have a philosophical discussion about the tax situation--some that say, let us exempt income from investments which tend to favor those who invest. Why not say, let us exempt income from work and favor those who work, or maybe a balance between those who work and those who invest. But I have great difficulty believing that somehow investment has more merit than work. 
Let's index investment. Let's index the income from work. I want to have a discussion in the context of capital gains as to why do we always in Congress, when we talk about giving some break or cuts, why do we always talk about taxing work and exempting investment? It is not that I am opposing trying to provide encouragement to investment, but why not provide similar encouragement to work? 
I want to have that discussion on the issue of capital gains, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. DORGAN. A final comment. I wanted to offer these amendments so we could begin discussing them. I hope a couple of them might be accepted and a couple of them we can have votes on, especially the issue of triggering the tax cuts beyond the first 5 years to make certain we are not once again experiencing a Federal deficit in the long term. I am very interested--and I will be here to talk tomorrow--about other issues with respect to an alternative that I think has great merit. 
Let me leave, as I began, to compliment the Senator from Delaware. There are a number of provisions in his piece of legislation I support and think have great merit. I hope some of the amendments that I offer and others offer that will improve the bill might be accepted, as well. If we can get the best of what both sides have to offer in this debate, the Congress will pass a tax bill that is worthy of consideration by the American people. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Durbin and I want to visit a bit with our colleagues about the tax bill that is now being written in the Senate Finance Committee, and the tax cut bill that was written by the House Ways and Means Committee--to talk about who will receive the benefits of this legislation. 
I served for 10 years on the House Ways and Means Committee, and was involved in the writing of tax legislation. And I understand that, generally speaking, when tax legislation is written you have a lot of very important interests who come to the table and want to have access to some of the benefits of the tax cuts. My concern is that when Congress decides to provide tax cuts that it provide tax cuts especially to working families in this country who have seen an increase in their payroll taxes. 
One of the circumstances that exists now in this country is that nearly two-thirds of the American people pay higher payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. Yet, every time we talk about tax cuts around here we have folks who talk about the tax cuts that will generally say if you invest you are going to be exempt but if you work you are going to be taxed. In other words, they go right back to the old approach: Let's tax work and exempt investment. I happen to think investment is a worthy thing. We ought to encourage more of it in this country for those who work. Why can't we construct a tax bill that will value work as much as we value investment? 
It is interesting to me that the bill that was constructed by the House of Representatives is a proposed tax cut bill which says here is the way we are going to deal out our tax cuts. We are going to provide for the bottom 60 percent of the people in this country that--if you have a table and the American people are sitting around that table--the bottom 60 percent of income earners are going to get 12 percent of the tax cuts. Then we say for the top 10 percent of the income earners around this table that you are going to get 43 percent of the tax cut. 
Let me put it a different way. It says for the bottom 20 percent of the working population in this country you are going to get one-half of 1 percent of the total tax cut given by Congress. The bottom 20 percent gets one-half of 1 percent, and the top 1 percent gets nearly 20 percent of the benefit of the tax cut. 
You can construct a tax cut that is much more fair than that. 
The tax increases that people have experienced in this country in recent years has been the payroll tax. The folks who go to work--especially at the lower wages and then find their wages are largely frozen. It is hard to get out of those brackets. But the one thing that isn't frozen is the payroll tax, and they have to pay higher and higher payroll taxes. 
What happens to them is--despite the fact they have not had increases in income but they have had increases in payroll 
taxes--when it comes time to figure out how Congress is going to give back some taxes and provide tax relief, they discover that the tax relief isn't really available to them. It is going to be available to the folks at the top. Those are the folks that have had the biggest income increase--the highest increase in income--in recent years. Frankly, they do not pay anywhere near the kind of payroll taxes because their payroll taxes end at a certain level. The folks at the bottom pay a payroll tax on every dollar of income. Those are the taxes that increase. 
But here are some of the concerns that we have about the tax bill. Senator Durbin and I hope that when the legislation is finished by the Senate Finance Committee that it will come to the floor with a distribution table that is fair for the middle- and lower-income working families so they can get some real tax relief. 
But the child tax credit, which I think makes some sense, is not refundable. Therefore, the folks who do not make enough money but are still working and paying payroll taxes--incidentally paying higher payroll taxes--are not going to get the full benefit of the child tax credit. 
This chart shows that the child tax credit is not going to be available to 40 percent of American children. There was an adjustment in the last day that will decrease that to about 30 percent. That does not make any sense. 
Make that available so that the working people can get a child tax credit. Make that available to them, and that can be helpful to them with real tax relief. 
This is the distribution of the House tax bill proposal. It is the same old thing. There is no secret here. If you are fortunate enough to be in the top 1 percent of the income earners, you are going to get a whopping $12,000 tax cut. And if you are down at the bottom 15 percent, or so, of the income earners, you are going to get a $14 tax cut. 
It is the old cake and crumbs theory. If you are somewhere up near the top, you get the cake. If you are earning somewhere down near the bottom, you get the crumbs. 
Yet those who face higher taxes in this country are the ones who are paying the payroll taxes. That especially hurts those at the bottom of the income level. 
We hope that when the Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee in this case, brings a bill to the floor of the Senate that we will see a distribution table that allows us to say everybody in this country benefits from a tax cut. 
There is kind of a different theory in this country. Some feel this economy works because you pour something in the top and it trickles down to everybody at the bottom. Others of us think that it works because you have a lot of working families, and, if you give them something to work with, it percolates up, and that represents the economic strength and economic engine of this country. 
But when we give tax cuts as a Congress, let us do it fairly. Let us make sure that moderate-income and low-income families out there in the middle of the pack also get a reasonable tax cut, and not just the folks way at the upper end who get exemptions for their investments, but the rest of the folks as well. If we get to that point, I think the American people will say a job well done.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the city of Bismarck, ND, for recently being named an `All-America City.' 
This honor comes as no surprise to those of us who have been proud to call Bismarck home. But for many years, weather reports of blowing snow and subzero temperatures enabled us to keep what we call the good life in Bismarck a well-guarded secret. With this award and new national prominence, residents of Bismarck, ND, can no longer be modest. 
Bismarck is a place where the quality of life is good, the economy is growing, and the threat of crime is practically nonexistent. Our kids can go to good schools without worrying about carrying knives or guns and they can play outside on their streets after dark. It is a place where people still get to know their neighbors and where hard-working people can make a decent wage. Unemployment for the city is a mere 2.7 percent, well below the national average of 4.8 percent. 
But now our secret's out--and I'm pleased it has been done with such honor. Only 10 cities receive the All America City designation each year from the National Civic League. This year, 120 cities applied and only 30 were chosen as finalists. By surpassing the 20 other cities nationwide to win the award, Bismarck gained a title and prominence that will surely attract new businesses, increase population, and provide new opportunities for growth in our State. 
Bismarck currently has a population of close to 50,000 residents--most of whom are very hard-working, civic minded people who get involved in the decisions that affect their community--which is one of the main reasons the city was chosen for this award. While Bismarck received recognition from the judges for three of its projects, the city was singled out for its unique city sales tax allocation. In Bismarck, citizens have a share in the decision of where their city sales tax is spent. The judges applauded this unique approach to local government that gives taxpayers input for city projects. What a remarkable idea. 
Bismarck was also recognized for its Suicide Prevention Task Force and some local programs produced at the Anne Frank exhibit, including a 10-minute script that pokes fun of images that some people have of Bismarck and North Dakota. 
Again, I want to congratulate the city of Bismarck for receiving this prestigious All-America City Award. It is exemplary of the good people and good quality of life that we've always enjoyed in our State.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that I can finally tell the people of North Dakota that a disaster relief package has finally been passed by Congress and signed by the President. I am pleased that I can finally tell tens of thousands of individuals and business owners, who were devastated by the worst winter on record in North Dakota followed by a millennial flood, that help is on the way. 
Everyone who has watched the news over the past 2 months has been moved by both the devastation and the determination of the citizens of North Dakota. You watched our people working side by side, day and night to sandbag their homes, their schools, and their businesses. The dramatic photos on every TV station are a living legacy of what community is all about. It was neighbor helping neighbor. In the end, Mother Nature won the battle, but we fought the good fight and we did it together. 
Despite 9 blizzards which dropped more snow in North Dakota than in any other year on record; despite storms which killed more than 125,000 head of livestock and knocked out hundred of miles of power lines; despite a millennial flood which forced the evacuation of 50,000 people from Grand Forks; despite the fact that many North Dakotans have lost their homes and all their worldly possessions, we North Dakotans will continue to work together to rebuild our cities, our businesses, and our communities in order to preserve a way of life which we all cherish. 
We are a strong, proud, and resolute people. We will face the challenges ahead with courage and commitment. But with damages expected to be in the billions, we could not proceed without the Federal support provided in the disaster relief bill. 
With this bill and the assistance that flows with it, the disaster victims in North Dakota and the other flood ravaged States can begin the long and painful process of recovery. The money provided in the relief bill will allow them to make informed decisions about their lives, their homes, and their businesses. They have waited too long for this help. But the wait is over. Help is on the way, and rebuilding and healing can begin. 
I would like to thank all the Members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees for their help in working with me to ensure that sufficient assistance to address the incredible needs of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota was ultimately included in the disaster relief bill. Individually and collectively, we have suffered a disaster of catastrophic proportions which has required an exceptional response, and that is what the disaster relief bill provides. 
There are many people to thank as for their help on the disaster appropriations bill. At the top of the list are Senators Stevens and Byrd who were extremely helpful and supportive throughout every step of the process. Without their personal intervention and continuous support, many items and millions of dollars would not have been included in the final package. On behalf of all the people of North Dakota, I want to thank them for their generous assistance. 
Let me just list a few of the items in the disaster bill which will have a direct bearing on our ability to rebuild: 
$3.4 billion for FEMA, a significant portion of which will go to the Upper Midwest region. 
$500 million in community development block grants. This is the most flexible form of disaster assistance and the most crucial component to allow for buyouts. While all disaster States are eligible for this assistance, we anticipate that the 
majority will go to the Dakotas and Minnesota. 
$134 million in emergency agricultural assistance for the Upper Midwest, including 
$50 million for a new livestock indemnity program which will help North Dakota farmers and ranchers who have lost close to 125,000 head of livestock; 
$15 million in Department of Agriculture funds to purchase floodplain easements to reduce hazards to life and property due to the floods; and 
$5 million for the interest assistance program to provide additional funding for guaranteed, low-interest loans to farmers. 
$20 million to reimburse school districts who have had to educate additional children who were dislocated by the floods. 
$15 million for all preconstruction and design work for an outlet from Devils Lake to the Sheyenne River. 
$27.9 million in Corps of Engineers funding for North Dakota from the flood Control and Coastal Emergencies program. 
$600,000 for Ramsey County to mitigate damages to the sewer system from flooding, if necessary. 
About $20 million for the Corps of Engineers to raise the levees at Devils Lake. 
$210,000 for North Dakota's national parks. 
$3.9 million for the BIA in North Dakota. 
$265,000 for the Indian Health Service in North Dakota. 
$6.1 million for North Dakota to repair damaged freight rail lines. 
$9.3 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service in North Dakota. 
$840,000 for the U.S. Geological Service in North Dakota. 
Department of Education waiver authority language which will permit the Department to help students having difficulty meeting application and other statutory deadlines regarding Federal education funds. 
Language which allows States greater flexibility in using its child care and development block grant funds to help families in nonemployment related activities relating to the cleanup and recovery. 
A provision which directs the Office of Management and Budget to work with universities damaged by the floods in revising and extending their Federal grants, contracts, and cooperative agreement.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague, Senator Conrad, who has spent an enormous amount of time and effort dealing with the flooding issues that have afflicted our region of the country. It seems to me that there is some good news on the horizon, and it appears that finally the logjam may be broken. It appears finally, perhaps today, the Congress will pass a bill that contains much-needed disaster relief that the President will sign and that hope and help will be offered and restored to the people of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota who are victims of this disaster. Even as it appears there are these signs this may happen today, I want to, once again, describe a bit about why we have maintained that it is so urgent that disaster relief be provided for disaster victims. 
Senator Conrad and I represent the State of North Dakota in the U.S. Senate. We are a small State, in many ways. We are 10 times the size of the State of Massachusetts in landmass. It is a pretty big State geographically, but about 640,000 people live in our State. It is a wonderful place to live, and we have a lot of wonderful things to talk about with respect to North Dakota. 
Regrettably, the only thing people from the outside who don't come to North Dakota regularly see about our State is to tune in on the morning shows perhaps on a February morning or January morning, and they see that someone says that there is a blizzard or it is cold in our part of the country. It gets that way sometimes. Other times in January or February, it is quite nice. I don't suppose that we could really, in good faith, tell people that in January and February in North Dakota it is balmy and sunny and warm and an equivalent vacation spot to California or Florida. I don't suppose we could do that with great credibility. It does get a little cold sometimes. 
In fact, we had a fellow who was in jail in North Dakota, and from his jail cell, he petitioned a judge to extend his jail sentence for 90 days because he alleged that his rights would be violated if he were released from jail in December in North Dakota. He said it was too cold, didn't have clothing, so on and so forth. He asked the judge if the judge would extend his jail sentence for 90 days. The judge promptly told him, no, that he won't extend his jail sentence. 
I don't want the actions of one prisoner to allow people to think that it is so cold, you can't exist in our State. It is a wonderful State. But it is true that sometimes in the winter we have some snow, some cold weather, and some wind, and this winter particularly. 
Those who have watched what has happened in our State know that we were hit with a devastating winter. In North Dakota, we had the equivalent of 3 year's worth of snow dumped on our State in nearly 3 months. Nearly 10 feet of snow fell in the State of North Dakota. We suffered, as a result of that, a real disaster--blizzards, roads closed, lives lost because of white-out blizzards where no one could move, ambulances couldn't get through. 
And then we had, in addition to the blizzards, finally, a 50-year blizzard, the worst in 50 years, and then the melting of all of that snow and the flooding. 
While people in North Dakota are patient and tough and resilient and have a wonderful spirit, this winter has been tough for them. Most of what they can do for each other they have done for each other. But sometimes you cannot do it all by yourself. 
I have told my colleagues before of the kinds of individual acts of heroism that occurred every day this winter in North Dakota. I told of Don Halvorson, who is a hero of mine. I have not met him. I only talked to him by telephone. But he symbolizes the spirit of the people in North Dakota, saying to others who are in trouble, `Let me help you. You are a neighbor. Let me help.' 
Don Halvorson was at home one night sleeping at around 3 in the morning near Grafton, ND, out in the country in a farmhouse. Jan Novak was working in town in Grafton, ND. At about 10:30 at night, driving out to her home in the country, it was blizzarding, and the blizzard got worse, and it became a whiteout blizzard. You cannot see in a whiteout blizzard; you cannot see the hand in front of your face with heavy snowfall and winds of 40 miles per hour, temperatures with 60 and 80 degrees below zero windchills. 
Well, Jan Novak, on the way home, could not see and ran off the road and became stuck. Her husband became worried, in the middle of this blizzard, and could not find her and called the sheriff up in Grafton, ND. The sheriff sent out some people to look for her. They could not see to drive on the roads. 
Finally, they had to call off the search. So they began calling all of the homes along the roads where they thought Jan Novak might have driven. One of the homes they called at 3 in the morning was Don Halvorson's. They said, `A woman is missing. Have you seen a woman driving on your country road past your place?' Of course, he could not see the road anyway because of the whiteout blizzard, but Don said, `No,' and then he went back to bed. 
But then he said he could not sleep. So at 3:30 in the morning he got back up, got out of bed, in the middle of the blizzard, and put on his winter clothes and trudged out to his tractor. He had a cab on his tractor. He got in that tractor cab, started up the tractor, and with his tractor lights started driving. 
About 3 hours later Jan Novak--when I called her she said she had been in the car all of that night, starting the engine to try to keep warm, and finally it was not starting very well. And the temperature and the blizzard was such that she would freeze to death. She began to worry she might not survive through this. 
She prayed all night long, she said. At about 6:30 in the morning she had almost given up hope. Her head was bowed in her car, and she was saying a prayer, thinking she would not survive, when a tractor drove up to her car. The tractor lights, in the middle of that blizzard, were about 5 feet away when they became apparent to Jan Novak. It was Don Halvorson, 3 hours in the middle of a blizzard, not being able to see beyond the front fender of his tractor. He drove all around his part of the country looking for this woman who was lost and whose life was in danger. 
When I read about what Don had done, I called Don and said, `Tell me how you happened to do this.' He said, `When they called my home at 3 in the morning and said that this woman was missing--I didn't know her and obviously had not seen her--I went back to bed, but I couldn't go to sleep.' He said, `I just couldn't go to sleep knowing there was a woman out there missing, and I went to search for her.' Three hours later he found her. 
You talk about a hero. Don Halvorson likely saved Jan Novak's life. That is one story of hundreds and hundreds of stories across our State this winter--the ambulance drivers in Mandan and Flasher, ND, who punched through a huge blizzard-related snowbank that had blocked a road and made all traffic impassable. They, along with the road crews from both sides of this snowbank, punched through in whiteout conditions and no visibility to go out and save a young boy and get him to a hospital. They risked their lives, 
all of them, and that young boy survived because of them. 
All across our State those stories abound--individuals helping others because it is the spirit and the culture of what we do. We say, `Let's help each other.' 
Our country does that in a larger way. Sometimes one person cannot do enough to help another. Sometimes even a city or a State cannot do enough. Sometimes a flood or earthquake or fire or tornado it overwhelms the ability of one person to make the difference, so our country then makes the difference. 
What happened when all of this snow melted in North Dakota, was the Red River Valley suffered a 500-year flood. When the dikes broke in Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, and that water became a gusher running down the streets to inundate two entire cities and they evacuated two complete communities, it was not a case where one person could solve the problem for another person. It then became a case of us having to say, as people now tried to recover from this calamitous flood, `We want to help you. The rest of the people of the country want to help you.' 
That is what this fight has been about on this disaster bill. I know I have worn out my welcome for a number of Members of the Senate in recent weeks. They are flat out tired of seeing me on the floor. They think I put too much pressure on them. Some are angry at my presentations on the floor. 
But I have no choice. Thousands of people this morning in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, thousands and thousands of them this morning woke up not in their own homes, because their homes are destroyed. Their lives are on hold until we pass a disaster relief bill. 
That bill has been delayed. And now it appears that that bill may today finally be on the road to the President in a manner that will result in a signature, and in the bill becoming law, and in the disaster aid being available to those who so desperately need it. 
I want again to just read some of the messages of North Dakotans who describe why I am here on the floor and why I have been here for some weeks. 
First, simply a drawing by a grade schooler that came in a large packet of drawings. It is pretty simple. Someone in a canoe says, `Save our town.' Pretty simple expression that does not need much elaboration. `Save our town.' We have the capability to help do that. 
Mr. President, here is a Grand Forks resident who says:  
I'm calling on behalf of my grandmother. She's 99 years old. She lost her home and everything in it. She's in Bemidji, MN, now staying in a house with four children. She doesn't know if she's going to get home again. She's in good shape, but I'm really concerned about the trauma at her age, and I don't know what I'd be like in that circumstance. She's pretty strong and she talked about how she was married in World War I, and she went through the Depression and the Dust Bowl and World War II. She lost two out of her three kids. She lost her husband. She's been through it, and all of these milestones in her life, and now she is going through uncertainty of not knowing whether she's going to have a home. Her husband left her well set with a home she could live in for the rest of her life and she's done well until now. And now at age 99 she's homeless. 
Kari and Paul Kolstoe, who are from Grand Forks, ND, said: 
Our daughter's 12th birthday was April 18. That was the day the Red River destroyed our home. We lost most of our possessions, but more importantly, we lost the place and our ability to live together as a family. The last 5 weeks we've lived in four different places. Our home has too much damage to be restored. And we now live in limbo waiting for a decision and the money to go on with our lives. * * * 
We can deal somehow with the disaster that's happened to us in our town and we're trying to put our lives back together. * * * 
But we lost everything. And don't prolong this disaster bill. Allow us to go on with our lives. 
That is Kari and Paul Kolstoe from Grand Forks, ND. 
There are so many letters. 
Rodney and Judy Krause. I talked to Rodney and Judy a couple days ago, as a matter of fact. They are also from Grand Forks, ND.  
April 19 [Rod writes] we were evacuated from our home, and it sat under water for a period of 10 to 12 days, with 56 inches of sewage and floodwater on the main floor. Currently, the house is sitting empty and we're waiting for a bill to be passed in Congress dealing with flood relief. 
Rod Krause says: 
I'm a staff sergeant in the Air Force, and my wife and myself also happen to be from Grand Forks. We're proud of this community, and we hate to see it as wasted as it is from this flood. Right now, as a member of the Air Force, even through all this mess, I have my bags packed and ready to go at a moment's notice to fight, possibly die, for this country, basically at your calling. But what Congress is doing now really hurts. I still need to make a house payment for a home that sits empty. And it keeps getting worse as the days pass. I can't do anything but wait. All we want is an answer. Why is this taking so long? 
Arthur Bakken, who is a councilman in Grand Forks, says: 
People here have no homes, no jobs, no other homes to go to. They have no toys, no bikes, no clothes, or anything else for their children. 
Mr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes.

Mr. DORGAN. I mentioned yesterday a call from a man named Mark whose family has been separated, children living with the grandparents, his home damaged by the flood. His wife is in the hospital with a terminal illness, telling us that his wife has only a couple months to live perhaps, asking us to make the decisions that allow them to get on with their lives. 
Here is another little drawing from a schoolchild who sent it to me. It probably says it is as well as any can. It is two different scenes. One is a scene of flooding and devastation and trees down; and it says, `If you do nothing.' And the other side is a page with a scene with a park bench and grass and trees and sun and flowers; and underneath it says, `If you do something.' 
These are people who have voiced to say to us today, through my reading their letters, that they really need help. That is what this disaster legislation is about, reaching out and helping those who, through no fault of their own, have had to bear the burden of a natural disaster of enormous proportions. 
I came to Congress some many years ago, and I have on behalf of the constituents in North Dakota on every occasion--on every single occasion--said, when there was an earthquake in California, `Count me in, and count my constituents in, because on behalf of North Dakotans I want so vote yes to provide disaster aid for you.' 
For flood victims on the Mississippi, I have said, yes, because I think it is important to provide disaster aid for you. 
In every circumstance, every day and every way that we have been requested to provide disaster assistance, I have indicated that I felt North Dakotans would want to do that. 
North Dakotans now feel that people in the rest of this country will want to do that for us as well--North Dakotans, Minnesotans and South Dakotans--who have suffered through the disaster. 
Isn't every disaster unique and isn't every disaster difficult and traumatic? Yes, it is. There is no question about that. We have seen now through the new technology of television in the modern age the gripping scenes of devastation from disasters--death, and destruction. It breaks your heart to see that anywhere in our country. 
This disaster was unusual in a couple of respects. First, we were enormously fortunate that we did not suffer a major or massive loss of life. Some lost their lives, but we did not suffer the loss of life of hundreds of citizens. 
This combination of blizzards and floods and then fires in the middle of the flood that ripped the guts from a significant city in our State, this combination is a very unusual circumstance because a large city was completely abandoned and evacuated and completely inundated with water. The water came and stayed for a very long period of time. 
Now we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of homes that will never again be lived in. We have families from every single one of those homes whose possessions are now out on the berm, somewhere out on the boulevard, on the driveway being hauled away in dump trucks--the dolls, the baby carriages, the pictures, all of the belongings of those families. 
They do not know what will come next for them, what their lives will be like, where they will live, how they will make a house payment on a house that is destroyed. That is why this legislation is so critically important. 
Now, I have been very upset that we have not gotten this done. We are about 3 weeks late. I have said repeatedly that I appreciate enormously the cooperation on a bipartisan basis to put a disaster package in this bill that is very substantial and will be enormously helpful to these victims of this disaster. Most every Member of this institution deserves credit for what is in this bill, and I thank them for it. 
I am upset that it was delayed. But if today this gets dislodged, and if today this bill gets passed by the House and the Senate and goes to the President for his signature, then we will finally be able to provide the answers that are necessary for these people to understand what the rest of their lives will be like, what will happen to their home, will their job be restored, will their community be rebuilt, will their region recover? Those are the questions that will be answered by the hundreds of millions of dollars in the many categories in this piece of legislation. In fact, the disaster portion is something over $5 billion in this legislation dealing with many, many States. 
If and when this happens, and I hope it does today, it will be an enormous benefit to our region, and I will be forever grateful to the Members of the Senate who made it happen. 
Mr. President, as I finish, I say to my colleagues, while I have worn out my welcome in recent weeks on this subject, I do not apologize for it. I speak on behalf of people who need a voice in this debate. Let us hope, at the end of this day, we will have some wonderful news for people who have been victims of this disaster. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an occasion of some happiness for those of us who have spent a substantial amount of time in the Senate pushing very hard to try to get a disaster relief bill finished. 
I today compliment the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and other members of the Appropriations Committee. I have said repeatedly that when this legislation passes, it will contain a substantial amount of assistance for those who have been hit by natural disasters, especially for those in our region who were devastated by the circumstances of blizzards, floods, and then fires. 
There have been a substantial amount of impatience on my part and the part of many others in Congress in the recent 3 or so weeks. We have been impatient because we have constituents who have been impatient. We know that their lives have been on hold, decisions have not been able to be made on a timely basis. 
My colleague, Senator Conrad, my colleagues, Senator Wellstone, Senator Grams and others, Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson from South Dakota, we know from going home, our citizens who are victims of these disasters have, in many instances, been living in other communities with relatives, in tents, in camper trailers, in shelters, on cots, and they have been very concerned about the inability to put their lives back together. We have repeatedly pushed for a timely resolution for this matter. 
Today, it appears that we will see a piece of legislation through the Congress, and it is my hope to be invited to participate tomorrow morning in a bill-signing ceremony. I hope that President Clinton will have a brief ceremony to sign this legislation, after which a substantial amount of help will be available to people of our region. 
What kind of help is it? Well, it is a substantial amount of money to help people who lost their homes. In Grand Forks, ND, alone, 600 homes have been totally destroyed, another 600 to 800 homes have been severely damaged. Those families are not back in their homes and will not be back in their homes. Many of those homes will never again be inhabited, and those families need some help. This legislation reaches out to them to say we want to help you. 
The legislation includes some resources for people who have lost livestock in the blizzards this winter. A substantial number of blizzards paralyzed our State. The last blizzard was the worst blizzard in 50 years. We had cattle on their feet suffocating from snow, and white-out conditions where they could breathe nothing but snow. I mentioned the other day that a fellow was in a community and someone said, `Well, what are you going to be doing next?' He was a rancher. He said, `Well, I'm going home to shoot some calves.' He had to shoot calves because these are calves whose feet were frozen in the blizzard, cows whose udders were frozen in the blizzard, cows froze to death standing up, cows froze to death in stock ponds when ice gave way and the cattle died in the ice cold water. 
I don't need to describe in any greater detail the ravages of blizzard after blizzard after blizzard, the last being the worst blizzard in 50 years, and then the flood that resulted from 10 feet of snow, 3 years' worth of snow dumped on our State in 3 months. The result: a disaster of significant proportions that has upset the lives of so many thousands of families. 
The creation of this bill then was a response to that, and although we have gone through enormous angst as a result of delay, today, when this aid begins to flow, we say thanks to a lot of folks who joined hands in this Chamber, on the Appropriations Committee and off, in the leadership, who said we want to be part of a solution. 
I know, as I said earlier today, I have worn out my welcome on the floor of the Senate. I know there are some here who are tired of seeing me on the floor, tired of hearing my message and hope that they will not have to suffer much more--the constant drumbeat and the constant urgency that I express on behalf of my citizens, but I make no apology for that. I came here to represent a group of people who need help, and I am pleased that help will be in this legislation when it passes.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 additional minute. 
The point I was making was while we feel very strongly about these issues, because our constituents are involved--and they are not just constituents, they are people, families trying to put their lives back together--at the end of the day, when the day is done and the job is done, and this will at least complete this portion of the job for a Congress responding to this disaster, we must stop and say thank you for the help that others have given us. 
As we proceed to begin to rebuild and to recover and to have families put their lives together and to have communities rebuild, we will undoubtedly see things that need to be done in next year's appropriations bills, as well. 
Mr. President, today when this passes, on final passage, and tomorrow, when the President signs this legislation, I will be enormously pleased that finally disaster relief will be available to many Americans who desperately need it. 
I yield the floor.

He has been faithful and determined on this issue and all of us know that his family has had some medical challenges in recent hours. We very much appreciate what you have done for the country and for our region of the State. Much of the reason we are here at this moment on the edge of victory in having disaster relief approved is because of the efforts of the Senator from South Dakota.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, last evening a number of us were here, a good many Senators, as a matter of fact, were here almost all night holding a vigil on the issue of the disaster relief bill that seems ensnarled in, regrettably, politics as usual. We have done the only thing we can do, and that is to apply as much consistent pressure as is possible to the Congress to say, `Do the right thing.' And the right thing is to pass disaster relief for victims who have suffered natural disasters, especially the flood victims in the region of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and get them that aid as soon as is possible. 
I am not here to point fingers or to say that there is this side or that side. For me there is only one side and that is being on the side of victims of a natural disaster. I know there are a lot of things floating around here, back and forth, with extraneous amendments and so on. I am not interested in politics. I am only interested in progress, speaking on behalf of some people who were dealt a very serious blow, one they did not deserve but one that they now have to try to recover from, and one they will recover from when we reach out our hand of help to say, `You are not alone. The rest of the country wants to offer you some help.' 
During this vigil we held last night--my time was from midnight to 3 in the morning--I found myself at 2 in the morning talking on a nationwide radio talk show with `The Trucking Bozo,' I guess his show is called. I guess I didn't think, when I came to the Senate, that I would be, at 2 a.m., talking to the `Trucking Bozo' on a national radio program. But to the extent I had an opportunity to talk to truckers across this country who were hauling America's goods back and forth, I am glad I did. I hope they got the message as well, that most of us want what is right for this country, and what is right at this moment is for Congress to stop all the extraneous things that are going on and pass disaster relief. 
In the middle of all of these discussions, however, with the `Trucking Bozo' and a call-in radio station in New York and Denver and Boston and elsewhere across the country, we visited with many victims of the disaster. One of them last evening, among many who shed tears talking about their plight, was a man named Mark. Mark called from Grand Forks, ND. He has been out of his home now, I guess, for 5 or nearly 6 weeks. He has not seen his children, he said, for close to a month. They are with the grandparents. And his wife, he said, is in the hospital, dying of cancer, 
with a month or month and a half left to live. 
He, at 1 in the morning, was calling me to say, `Somehow it's unfair for us to be held hostage here. For me, for my family, for our community, we desperately need to get the help that is in this bill to put our lives back together.' 
For this person to come, with all of the burdens in his life, to call in and urge, once again, the responsible thing be done, it really almost breaks your heart to know that all of these families, many of whom are now separated, some of whom last night said they are living in tents in their front yard because their home was destroyed and is uninhabitable, others living in camper trailers, others living in shelters, others living in neighboring towns with families split, having lived like that for weeks and now wondering, what about tomorrow? What about my home that was destroyed? What about my job, it's not there. What about my future and asking us, `Can't you please do something?' 
I will not today and will not in the future say that one side is wrong and the other side is right. We are better and they are not. That is not what this is about. It is about Congress doing what it historically always has done on a disaster bill. The Congress is a unique institution. In a democracy, it is a wonderful institution, and I feel privileged every day to wake up and come and serve this country in the U.S. Senate. But we have rules, very few of which in the Senate prevent us from adding things to other bills. On almost any occasion, any day, any way, someone brings a bill to the floor of the Senate and someone adds an amendment that is totally extraneous--and they do it on all sides of the political aisle, and I understand that--but, generally speaking, on disaster bills, that has not been the case. Why? Because disaster relief bills are different. They represent an emergency response to people in need. 
This got caught up in some of those issues, and I say let's decide today to stop that. Let's take all of these extraneous issues off, pass this bill, get the President to sign it and get help to the people who desperately need it. I know, because I come from North Dakota and because that was perhaps the hardest hit area--North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota--in these disasters, that I have a very parochial interest in this. But I am telling you, if every Member of the Senate could visit with our constituents in our region and walk away not having a broken heart from what those people face and not have a feeling of enormous responsibility to help them in any way possible on an urgent basis, to help them right now to put their lives together, there isn't one Member of this body who can resist this. 
The Senators from Minnesota, Senator Grams and Senator Wellstone, the Senators from South Dakota, Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson, and the Senators from North Dakota, Senator Conrad and myself, all of us worked very hard to put the disaster package together. We had great cooperation from all sides of the political aisle in the Senate. 
I want to close with this point. While I am enormously gratified by the cooperation we have had and feel gratified with the work we did together, when those who now talk about scaling down this bill also talk about maybe diminishing the amount of disaster aid we have already agreed to and fought so hard to get, I say to them, that is not a way to solve that problem this afternoon or tomorrow, by scaling back the disaster aid those folks are waiting for. Let's instead scale back the extraneous provisions, scale back and eliminate the unrelated amendments, get rid of them and get on with the business of this Congress to pass a disaster bill, have the President sign it and say to Mark, whose wife is in the hospital and whose children are living with grandparents, that we care about you, we want to help you and we want to help you and thousands and thousands of others like you who this morning didn't wake up in their homes because they are destroyed; we want to help you make your lives whole again. 
That is part of the culture of this country. It is the best instincts of America to reach out and say, `You're not alone, the rest of the American people are with you and want to help you in this time of crisis.' 
Let's try to do that today. This Congress can pass this bill today, and I intend to make a unanimous-consent request again to do that, as I did yesterday and the day before. I shall not do that at this moment. If we do it today, the President could sign it tonight and the aid would begin flowing tomorrow, and we would have helped many Americans get back on their feet. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want Congress to act decisively to stop our estate tax laws from hindering the transfer of family businesses and family farms and ranches to the next generation. These family enterprises are the major creators of new wealth and new jobs in this country. Yet in far too many cases, our estate tax laws force the children and grandchildren who inherit a modestly sized family business to sell it, or a large part of it, to pay off huge estate taxes. I want our tax laws to assist the transfer of family enterprises so they can continue to generate jobs and new wealth. Instead our estate tax laws now hinder that transfer. 
I've authored legislation in several Congresses to allow family farms, ranches, and other small family businesses to be passed along to the next generation without being loaded up with massive estate tax debt. The legislation I've introduced in this Congress increases the unified estate and gift tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. In addition, it provides a new $1 million exclusion for family business assets. Together, my proposals would allow a family business, valued up to $2 million, to be passed to the children and grandchildren to operate without any estate tax liability. 
A number of my colleagues in the Senate share my concerns about estate taxes. In fact, I worked with a core group of Senators, including Senators Grassley, Lott, Nickles, and Baucus for several months this spring to develop a comprehensive, bipartisan estate tax relief bill. This effort led to the introduction of a bipartisan bill, called the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997 (S. 479), which includes a number of important provisions including proposals to increase the unified estate and gift tax exemption and to target additional support for family-owned and operated businesses. Most of the changes recommended in this legislation are long- overdue, and I will work with my colleagues to include them in revenue legislation this Congress. 
I have decided to add my name as a cosponsor of S. 479 because I support the primary thrust and goals of this initiative. I want to send a reminder to those calling for tax cuts that estate tax relief for family businesses is not a partisan issue. It is important for the survival of our Nation's family businesses, and it should be included in the balanced budget tax relief package now being drafted in Congress. 
Although I am adding my name as a cosponsor to signal a bipartisan desire to pass some estate tax relief, I do want to see one provision of this bill changed. The cut in the estate tax rate for estates in the $2.5 million to $11 million range is, I believe, excessive. I would prefer to use the money available for estate tax reduction for a larger exemption at the bottom rather than additional tax breaks at the top. 
But I hope that when estate tax relief is enacted that the work we have done together will contribute to helping family businesses and family farms and ranches to be passed on to the children who will continue to operate them.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me follow on his remarks just for a few minutes and read a couple of letters from some folks because, after all, this is not some theory or some debate about policy. It is a discussion about how this issue impacts the lives of citizens. I thought it would be useful to read a couple of the 
letters that we have received. 
This is a letter from a fellow in Grand Forks, ND, who writes, `The people here have no homes, no jobs, no other homes to go to. They have no toys, no bikes, no clothes, nor anything else, for that matter, for their children.' 
And he says, `You go home and take a break for Memorial Day recess,' addressing that to the Congress. He said, `I am very angry at the way people are playing with the disaster relief bill and the lives of the people who need help now. They have no right to delay this bill or add to this bill. They want to add things, add more money. We will not have enough money even with this bill to repair our lives.' 
This is a letter from someone named Tim, who is a disaster victim. `I am a victim of the flood of 1997, as well as my family and friends and businesses who are victims of the flood. As you know, we have suffered a great deal, and as long as you continue to stall on the legislation for disaster relief our pain and suffering is prolonged. Perhaps you should visit here and see and feel the pain and devastation. Spend 3 days here and you will soon understand why people are depressed and why the anxiety level is extreme.' He said, `We strive to help each other out in this country in times of need. Americans like to spread the burden of disaster among everyone. That is what it means and that is why it makes us a great country, and we need your help now. On behalf of my family, my wife, our two daughters, we need your support.' 
Rodney and Judy wrote this letter to the Congress and to the President. `We were evacuated from our homes on the 19th of April 1997. It sat under water for a period of 10 to 12 days with 56 inches of sewer and flood water on the main floor of our home. Currently the house is sitting empty because we are waiting on a bill to be passed by Congress providing flood relief. I am a staff sergeant in the Air Force. My wife and my child also happen to be from Grand Forks, North Dakota. We are proud of our community, and we hate to see it wasted as it is. Right now, even through all of the mess, I have my bags packed and am ready to go at a moment's notice to fight and possibly die for our country. That is our calling in the Air Force. But what Congress is doing to us really hurts. I still make a house payment for a home that sits empty.' He said, `The home is getting worse day after day. I can't do anything but wait. Do you think this is fair? How did you enjoy your vacation over the Memorial Day weekend? I spent mine fixing up, repairing, and helping my neighbors so that their homes can be lived in once again. I think you should come out here and spend a few days in the stink and the mud and the junk on the curbs and the streets. All we want is answers. Why is this taking so long? Stop playing games with the disaster bill and get it passed. We are tired of waiting for an issue that should have been taken care of long ago.' 
I mentioned earlier today of a call last evening when I was part of the vigil last night from midnight until 3 in the morning, a call from a man named Mark from Grand Forks, ND, whose wife is dying, whose home was flooded, whose family was separated, and who now, like thousands of others in Grand Forks, ND, waits for an answer. Mark is dealing with his wife's illness, with a family that is separated, with a natural disaster, and now he needs to deal with answers to the questions he has. `What about my future? What is going to happen to my community? How can I put my family and my life back together again?' And the answers are in this piece of legislation. 
We still have people here who, as of last night, are making the case that this doesn't matter. `Nothing is being held up. It doesn't matter.' FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, they say, has money in the pipeline. `Money is flowing. What are people complaining about?' 
Anyone who asks that question has a responsibility to go to Grand Forks, ND, and peek through the tent flap of a tent on the front of a yard of a home that is destroyed where the family is now living, or knock on the door of a camper trailer that is parked in 
the yard of a home that is destroyed where a family is now living, or go to a shelter where a family now still lives, and ask them, `What is the hurry? Why are you so anxious?' Anyone who believes that there is money in the pipeline to do that needs to go talk to those folks, has a responsibility to go to talk to those folks, and then come back and stand on the floor of the Senate or the House and say, `There is no emergency here.' And, if they do that, then they will not be telling the truth because they will have known better. They will have known differently. 
This is urgent. The thousands of people this morning who woke up not in their own bed, not in their own homes, know it is urgent. They woke up somewhere else--another town, another home, living with a relative, in a shelter, in a motel, in a camper trailer, and, yes, a tent. They know it is urgent. Yet, day after day we continue to hear people in and around this Capitol justifying the stalling on the disaster bill by saying, `Well, it is not urgent. There is nothing in this bill that will provide urgently needed relief. This is for long-term relief.' It is fundamentally false; wrong. 
Will Rogers said--I quoted him the other day--about someone, `You know, it is not what he knows that bothers me so much. It is what he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.' We have people who apparently say they know for sure this aid isn't urgent, and they ought to know it ain't so. If they do not know that, they have a responsibility to become informed. 
As long as I serve in this Congress I will never attach a controversial unrelated amendment to a disaster bill because it is unfair to do it. I will not do that. And I hope others will not do it in the future either. 
In fact, I think we ought to change the rules of the Senate, and I will intend to propose such a change. I expect it will be hard to get adopted. But I think we ought to change the rules of the Senate and say that on bills that are disaster bills, or emergency bills, you ought not be able to offer extraneous or unrelated or nongermane amendments. Will that be hard to get passed in this body? Of course, it will. But shouldn't there be some category of legislation that is an emergency that represents a response to a disaster that at least ought to be held aside and say, `All right, this is different. This is urgent, and you don't add extraneous controversial amendments to this'? 
I think we ought to have a rule change to require that with respect to those select categories of legislation that represent urgent disaster or urgent emergency disaster relief. 
I hope maybe today, after now nearly 3 additional weeks of delay, that we might be able to provide an answer to the victims of these disasters and that the answer would be that the generous amount of relief that has been worked on by both sides but now which has been locked up by the maneuvering of some, that generous amount of relief will now be made available to people to help them put their lives back together. If it is done now, if it is done in the next couple of hours, it can be signed into law this evening and the disaster aid will be available immediately. 
If it is not done today, will it be done tomorrow? If not tomorrow, will it be next week, or next month? How long do disaster victims have to wait? How long do they have to wait and how many letters do we have to read? How many phone calls do we have to recount about people's lives which are being interrupted, families split, homes destroyed and lives in chaos because Congress has not done its job? 
Let's hope this is resolved today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, those who are watching the activities of the Congress now understand that the Congress, after some delay, passed a disaster bill to provide disaster relief to victims, especially the victims of the blizzards and the floods in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota, but to provide disaster relief on a much broader scale to those who have been victims of disaster in many States around the country. 
The Congress did something different this time on disaster relief. In this circumstance, on this disaster relief bill, which is called a supplemental appropriations bill, the Congress decided to attach some very controversial provisions that don't have any relationship to the bill, that are totally extraneous, unrelated to the disaster bill. They attached these provisions that weeks ago the President said he would not accept. 
The result was the disaster bill became a political vehicle asking flood victims and disaster victims to wait: `Hold on over there, we're going to have a political exercise on the disaster bill.' And, in fact, this weekend, following the passage of the disaster bill by the Congress last Thursday night, instead of sending the disaster bill to the President then, this weekend it was held over in the House of Representatives, and then the Republican National Committee went on paid radio ads in North Dakota, for example, to make a political issue of this so that the bill could be sent down to the President on Monday, so that they would hope the President would pay a political price for vetoing the bill. 
I don't care about one or the other. I don't care about this side, that side, your side or my side. What I care about are disaster victims, and disaster bills ought not be the product of political games. In any event, I ask those who would construct a political strategy on the disaster bill, how on Earth could you construct a strategy by which everybody loses? What kind of a political game is that, a game in which you have constructed an approach so that everyone loses, most especially, the losers are the victims of a disaster? Thousands of them this morning who woke up not in their own homes, because their homes are destroyed, but woke up in neighbors' homes, in a neighboring city, relatives' homes, a shelter, a tent, a camper trailer. That is where they are living. They are the first victims of a strategy that plays politics with disaster relief, but there are others. 
The other losers are all the folks in the political system. There are no winners here, only losers, and the biggest losers are those who can least afford it: victims of this disaster. 
I intend, in just a moment, to ask unanimous consent to call up a bill that I introduced in the Senate yesterday. It is identical to the bill that Congress passed providing disaster relief, except for two things. It takes out the two major controversial provisions to which the President objects. I say, by doing this, let's pass a clean disaster bill, pass it now, get it to the President, get it signed and get disaster relief to the victims who so desperately need it.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me read an editorial from this morning's Fargo Forum, North Dakota's largest newspaper in the Red River Valley. It is, in most cases, a conservative voice. Here is what they say about what is going on, how they observe what is going on in Congress: 
The result [of all of this] is to aggravate the tragedy of the flood by extending uncertainty about relief. Last week, community leaders from Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, Minnesota--many of them longtime, loyal Republicans--urged Congress to quit fooling around with the lives of flood victims. Clean up the disaster bill, they said, so the president can sign it. 
Their words were ignored. Instead, Republican congressional leaders and the two governors tried to shift the blame for delays on the president. In a callous display of partisan arrogance, they said his veto would be the delay, not the amendments. 
It won't fly here in the Red River Valley-- 
The Fargo Forum says-- where people are trying to put their homes, businesses and lives back together. 
The president made it clear weeks ago: Unless the disaster aid bill was clean, he would veto it. Nevertheless, Republican leaders fouled up the legislation with unrelated riders, knowing the president's veto was certain. So instead of considering the crucial needs of valley flood victims, they opted for a purely partisan agenda. The onus is on them. 
Apologists for the GOP leadership insists adding unrelated matters to popular bills is routine. Maybe so. 
But the flood of this century in the valley is not routine. A disaster of such magnitude is not routine. The pain and destruction are not routine. The short construction season for rebuilding is not routine. Surely, the least flood victims can expect is for Congress to put aside its routine nonsense when circumstances are this extraordinary. 
This from the Fargo Forum, not a liberal newspaper, normally speaking for conservatives. 
Finally, this point. There are those here who say it doesn't matter that we have messed around with this bill because there is money in the pipeline; no one is being disadvantaged. I heard them spin that yarn for weeks. 
We kid people in our part of the country about whoppers. You know the whoppers: Yes, I won this belt buckle in a rodeo riding bulls; my pickup truck's paid for. Now I heard this other whopper: There's money in the pipeline. Tell that to the folks in Grand Forks. 
There is a woman living in a tent right now in Grand Forks with her family. There was a woman in the newspaper yesterday, she and her family are out of work and have been out of their home for 5 weeks living in a camper trailer, and they don't know when they are going to get back to their home and she doesn't know when she will have another job. Tell it to them, that there is money in the pipeline. 
Better yet, get on a plane and go out there and try to live on that money in the pipeline. The money doesn't exist except in this bill, and the bill must get passed and must be a clean bill so this aid goes to disaster victims, and it ought to be done now. It can be done simply. I introduced a bill yesterday, and I will call it up now by unanimous consent, and if there is objection, it means the Congress will not allow a clean disaster bill to pass. If not now, when? 
Let me call up a clean disaster bill where we take out the census issue and the Government shutdown issue and send this bill, as it was written by the Congress, to the President for signature. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to Calendar No. 18, H.R. 581, and that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 851, the clean disaster bill, be substituted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi yielding for a question. 
I ask the Senator if it is not unusual when very controversial amendments are added to disaster bills. I have been around here for some while, as well, and it is clear there have been on the other side of the aisle disaster bills, but not in my memory have very controversial measures been added to disaster bills that attract a Presidential veto and thereby delay or derail the bill. 
It seems there are two ways out of this. I ask the Senator from Mississippi about both of them. One approach to resolve this issue is an approach that I offered this morning on the floor by unanimous consent, and the Senator from Minnesota has also, I believe, suggested something similar, and that would be to simply take the two big controversial items out of this, pass the bill, get a Presidential signature and get disaster aid to the victims of disasters. 
The second approach is an approach that the Senator from Mississippi seemed to suggest a few moments ago, and I would like to ask a question about that. As the Senator from Mississippi will recall, about 2 1/2 weeks ago, just prior to the Congress breaking for the Memorial Day recess, there was some discussion that if the larger bill cannot go, at least extract the body of real disaster aid and allow that to happen quickly. Now, that could happen this afternoon if others around here believe----

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further for an additional question, we had someone on the other side of the Capitol suggest prior to the weekend break, if this does not get resolved the way we--that being them--want it, we may very well cut the amount of disaster aid that is available to victims of disaster. Over the weekend in North Dakota, we had a lot of folks reacting to that with some real quaking, wondering, what does this mean? I hope that cooler heads will prevail and some common sense will prevail. 
I assume there has not been that discussion here in the Senate. We had bipartisan cooperation putting together the disaster portion of the bill, and for that we are very thankful. The trick now, the goal now, is to get that aid to people who woke up this morning and who are homeless, not just dozens but thousands of them, and the Senator suggests an approach I would support, and that is to take those portions of the bill that represent the aid that is necessary to go to disasters to help get their life back in order and pass that. 
I ask the Senator----

Mr. DORGAN. Yes. I do not want something the Senator said a moment ago to stand here and be misinterpreted. The Senator indicated potential existed--in the past some kind of emergency provision--that it would not be $8.6 billion. I want to make clear--I assume you do not mean, as some have suggested on the other side, that, well, if we come back to disaster relief, the folks who are waiting for that relief are going to get a whole lot less relief because we are going to cut it. That has been the implication by some. 
Now, we have had agreement on the disaster package in this legislation. There has been no disagreement. Republicans and Democrats have agreed. We have put it in. It is done except it has not gotten through to the President for his signature. But I assume the Senator from Mississippi supports the full complement of disaster relief that is in the bill and is not in any way saying that he would at some point revisit and diminish the amount of disaster relief in the bill. Could you clear that up?

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question. I appreciate the majority leader's indulgence. 
I am more concerned than I was before I left my chair. 
My assumption has been that we negotiated a disaster relief package. It is significant. It is important. And it is vitally needed by the areas in my part of the country but many others around America as well, and I hope very much that there is no one here who seriously entertains backing away from that commitment. 
In any event, one of the reasons that I ask this question is the piece that the Senator from Mississippi provided as samples of nonemergency spending in the supplemental included, for example, $694 million for the highway trust fund. And let me just describe something. Maybe the Senator does not understand this, but we have, for example, in North Dakota right now a highway called Highway 57. It is a link to the Spirit Lake Indian Nation. It is now under water, incidentally. That Indian nation is virtually isolated out there, and there are young kids who need doctors' attention and medical help who at this point have to go far around in order to get it. Their lives are at risk. Commerce stops. Emergency medical assistance is not available. And so we need to deal with these emergency road needs, for example, in Devils Lake which has been flooded every year.

Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator that I have visited with the Department of Transportation Secretary and others, and they are awaiting this disaster bill in order to unlock the money necessary to deal with these critical road problems in the one area I have mentioned, which is Devils Lake, where an entire Indian tribe is isolated out there because the roads are inundated with water. But let me go back to the point I originally made today to the Senator from Mississippi. 
I urge you to consider this afternoon doing the following, which would very simply and quickly unlock this issue. There are two major stumbling blocks to having the President sign this disaster bill. One is the attachment of the anti-Government-shutdown provision and the second is the census issue. Let us, as the Senator from Minnesota and others have suggested, set them aside, debate them separately. We will not stand in the way of debating and voting on those issues. And let's take the other bill that has been crafted by a bipartisan majority, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the House, and I was on the conference committee, let us take that to the floor, vote it out, send it, and get it signed and get disaster relief. We could do that this afternoon. 
I just don't understand why that is not possible today. Maybe the Senator from Mississippi can tell me why that is practically impossible. I would think it would be the easiest and most immediate solution to getting disaster aid to disaster victims.

Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the right to object, and I ask the majority leader a question. On two occasions, on the two most recent business days, we were subject to a motion to adjourn and required to vote on that, even though many of us did not feel we should adjourn. We wanted to continue to discuss this issue and attempt to see if we couldn't get the Senate to do its business and pass a clean bill providing disaster relief. 
I would just like to understand what we might face later today. I certainly would object to any unanimous-consent request propounded by anyone under any circumstances unless there is some assurance we are not going to face another motion for adjournment and simply be voted down and told the disaster bill is not a subject they want us to visit about on the floor of the Senate for any extended length. Some of us feel very strongly we would like to spend some time on the Senate floor talking about the disaster relief bill and ways to solve this so we can get disaster relief to disaster victims. 
So, I guess, before I would agree to a unanimous-consent request, I would like to have some understanding whether we are going to face an adjournment request later.

Mr. DORGAN. I do, and of course the majority leader has the power of scheduling in the U.S. Senate. The objection that we raised was an objection based on the understanding that the unanimous-consent request propounded by the majority leader was that he would remain in control at the end of the period of whether we had an opportunity to speak again and when we had an opportunity to speak again. 
We have had, on two occasions now, a motion made to adjourn the Senate and a vote on that, and the majority leader has then adjourned the Senate twice last week and now apparently today, and some of us feel very strongly that we wish to continue to discuss and to push and prod to see if we cannot get a disaster bill passed without the extraneous or unrelated amendments attached to it that have caused a veto. 
Now, the reason I rise to ask a question, as I listened intently to the question asked by the Senator from Texas--and she indicated to the majority leader that this was, really, the only appropriations vehicle or the first appropriations vehicle that was available for her to exercise an option to deal with the continuing resolution or Government shutdown amendment. 
In fact, there is a House appropriations bill on the calendar, H.R. 581, that the Senator from Texas and others who wish to propose their amendment could offer to attach their amendment to. In addition to that, there are 13 additional appropriations bills that will follow that they can certainly attempt to attach their amendment to. 
But the title of this piece of legislation is an appropriations bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disaster and so on. I am assuming that those who decided to attach it to this piece of legislation did so because by its very title it is an emergency supplemental appropriations bill for recovery from natural disasters. 
The Senator from Texas makes the point, as the Senator from 
Mississippi, there are some things in here that are not an emergency. That is a quarrel I suspect the Senator would have with the Appropriations Committee heads and others. There may well be some things in here that are not an emergency. I have no objection to taking those things and moving them aside and passing the disaster portions of this bill. 
I say that it seems to me, at least viewing it, that those who have attached this amendment to this bill have done so believing that this bill is a must-pass piece of legislation because it is an emergency and, therefore, it is a way of moving their agenda along on this Government shutdown amendment. My point is there are 13 more bills. Do it on another bill. Do it on the House bill resting at the desk of the Senate, but do not do it in a way holding up disaster relief. 
I am happy to propound the question. It is now 2 1/2 weeks beyond the adjournment for the Memorial Day recess, which is the time when we should have passed this legislation, 2 1/2 weeks beyond that, and the fact is we are now in a circumstance where it does not appear we are any closer to passing a piece of legislation that the President will be able to sign. Will the majority leader, at least from the Senate side, indicate to us that he feels that we can get this thing passed this week in a manner that allows it to be signed?

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today again to speak of the disaster relief bill, the so-called supplemental appropriations bill. This bill provides substantial amounts of money for disaster relief, especially for people of the region of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, the region where victims of blizzards, fires and floods now await action by the U.S. Congress on a disaster appropriations bill. 
On Saturday, in the Bismarck Tribune, an associated press writer, John McDonald, was in Grand Forks, ND. The headline says, `Patience Short with Congress.' Here is what the story says: 
Ranee Steffan had strong words for Members of Congress who think flood victims can wait while the bickering continues in Washington over a disaster relief bill. 
`You are playing with our lives,' Mrs. Steffen warned Friday from the sweltering travel trailer that she and her family now call home. `This isn't some game. You should come here and walk in my shoes for a day.' 
Homeless for over a month, out of work and bounced from one temporary shelter to another, the wife and mother of two is fed up with lawmakers who seem to think that Grand Forks residents are `getting along just fine.' 
All she wants, she says, is to move back into a real home and to start working again. 
But that isn't likely to happen until Congress and President Clinton work out differences in the emergency spending bill that has $5.6 million of disaster relief for disaster victims. 
I noticed this weekend in the Washington Times, Saturday, June 7, Speaker Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, `vows not to yield on disaster aid,' according to the headline. He says that after a veto, the GOP will send the bill back with the same riders. And then it says, `Mr. Gingrich predicted voters will not remember this standoff over the supplemental appropriations bill at the ballot boxes next year,' suggesting, I suppose, that, well, it is just that region up there, North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota. They will not remember this. 
In this morning's Washington Post, we read that in a `contentious meeting of Republican leaders after adjournment Thursday, Majority Leader Lott of the Senate argued that this time--unlike 2 years ago--the GOP would win the PR battle. He claimed Americans did not care much about the supplemental appropriations bill providing help for the victims of Red River flooding in the Dakotas and Minnesota.' 
I do not know if that is an accurate quote. It is in Robert Novak's column in today's paper. But I worry about what all of this says. It says somehow that this is a game, it is politics, it is trying to claim a political advantage in the fighting over a disaster bill. 
It is interesting that if you take a look at other disaster bills in the Congress and what has happened in those disaster bills, the time line is really quite interesting. We had, as many Americans will recall, a terrible hurricane called Hurricane Andrew. When Hurricane Andrew hit the Florida coast, it decimated and devastated miles and miles of homes, and people were living in camps and trying to figure out what to do next. That was 1992. That hurricane hit August 24, 1992, killing 40 people and destroying more than 25,000 homes. Again, this was August 24, 1992 that the hurricane hit. On September 8, just 2 weeks later, President Bush called for a $7.7 billion relief package. That took place on September 8. On September 23, President Bush signed it 
into law. It took 1 month from the hurricane to signing the bill into law. 
What a difference compared to our experience this year. 
Madam President, on March 19 of this year, the President sent his first request to Congress for a disaster bill to provide supplemental appropriations for a range of disasters that had occurred in our country. March 19, April 19 went by, May 19, and we are headed toward June 19--nearly 3 full months--and the disaster bill is not yet law. 
Now, Congress passed a disaster bill, but some in Congress decided they wanted to make a political sideshow out of it and they put very controversial provisions in it, provisions they knew the President would be forced to veto, provisions that had no relationship to this bill at all, extraneous provisions having no business in this bill. The President told them long ago to pass a clean bill. If they put provisions that were controversial in this bill thinking he would sign it, they were wrong. 
So the Congress, attempting to provoke a fight, because some political leaders here decided it was in their advantage to do so, stuck a couple of very controversial items in this bill and sent it down to the President, knowing it would face a certain veto. They took a couple of weeks' vacation first, and broke for the Memorial Day recess. Now it is going to be nearly 3 weeks later than it should have been before a bill would get passed that the President might have an opportunity to sign. But, in any event, they finally did send a bill down to the President this morning containing provisions they knew the President would not sign. The President vetoed the bill, and it now has returned to the House of Representatives, just within the past several hours. 
At the end of my remarks, Madam President, I will introduce a bill that is a clean disaster supplemental bill. It strips the two extraneous provisions that are highly controversial out of the legislation. I will send it to the desk and ask it be considered by unanimous consent. If it is considered by unanimous consent, this will go to the House of Representatives. After all, the House passed this bill plus the two controversial provisions. The House could consider it, they could send it to the President, he could sign it, and tomorrow the disaster relief would be available to the people who are victims of this disaster. I have alerted the majority that I intend to do so, and at the end of my remarks I will ask this piece of legislation be considered. 
Now, Madam President, before I go further, I will go through once again what has happened to our region and why this is urgent and why some of us have had a bellyful of the politics around here on this bill. 
Let me describe, first of all, the blizzards in our part of the country, 3 years' worth of snow in 3 months, 10 feet of snow dropped on our region of the country. The last blizzard was the worst blizzard of 50 years, and the worst blizzard of 50 years dumped nearly 2 feet of snow on much of North Dakota, some of South Dakota, and some of Minnesota. Traffic was stalled, as it was many times this winter, with the nine blizzards that we had. All the roads were shut down. Power poles snapped like toothpicks. 
Here is the result of howling winds of 20 and 40 miles an hour and 80-below windchill temperatures and 2 feet of snow in the worst blizzard of 50 years. This is a snowbank on flat land and a farmer standing in front of it to show the size of the snowbank. The snowbank is nearly three times as tall as he is. 
The blizzard that hit had this impact: 80,000 people in our region out of power, power poles snapped like toothpicks, lying on the ground all across our region. Some people were out of power for a week and more, while power crews struggled 24 hours a day to try to get the poles up and the lines up and restore power to these communities. 
I was in Grafton, ND, when they were out of power for 5 days, and met a woman who was 89-years-old at a shelter. Yes, they went to shelters because they could not cook, did not have electricity, did not have heat in their homes, and it was bitterly cold. Madam President, this woman was 89 years of age, and she said, `I am getting along just fine. We sure appreciate all the folks here at the shelter.' What a great spirit and a great attitude. 
But all of those folks went through this kind of dilemma of blizzard after blizzard after blizzard, with shutdowns of virtually all the roads in the State, cattle freezing on their feet because the snow was suffocating them, and then power outages affecting tens of thousands of people. My colleague Senator Conrad showed this picture the other day. I had shown it previously, a picture similar to it, dead cattle lying on the range, 
cattle whose hooves were frozen, dairy cows whose udders were frozen. A fellow was in town a while back and he said someone asked a rancher, `What are you doing this afternoon?' He answered, `Going home to shoot some more calves.' These calves simply would not make it. Their hooves were frozen and they would not be able to walk any longer. Hundreds of thousands of head of livestock died in those winter blizzards. 
Then what happened is the Sun came out and it began to warm up in our part of the country. What was a farm--and this is a farm--now looks like an ocean. The Red River Valley became a flood that was 140 miles long by 20 to 30 miles wide. This is a farm in this photograph. But, of course, this year, it was a flood; 1.7 million acres of farm land were under water when this picture was taken. 
This picture shows what that flood looks like from the air. It looks like a huge lake that extends for the entire Red River Valley, with patches of ground in places where you could see some dikes that have been erected to try to protect some areas of the country. That flood inundated Watertown, SD. It was an enormous flood--in Watertown, MN, and Breckenridge and Fargo, ND. That flood water was channeled through Fargo, and for 24 hours a day they wondered whether the dikes would hold, and they did hold in Fargo. Some homes got wet and they had some flooding damage, but it could have been much worse. Then that Red River flooding came to Grand Forks, ND, as they tried to channel that through the city. The flood crest was predicted to be 49 feet, the highest flood crest in history. But it wasn't 49 feet, it was 54 feet. As the water rushed over the dikes down the streets of Grand Forks, people left their homes, running to their cars, running to National Guard trucks, to evacuate their city, in most cases with nothing but the clothes on their backs. 
In this photograph is Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN. It looks like a lake with buildings sticking out of the lake, a city completely inundated by a flood. A city of 50,000 people was on this side of the river, with 90 percent evacuated; 9,000 people were on this side of the river, 100 percent evacuated. I might say that this whole area in Grand Forks, ND, will never again be inhabitable. All of these business places are ruined and will be destroyed. 
More than that, during the flood when the waters broke the dike, the city of Grand Forks also suffered a major fire, as depicted in this photograph. In the middle of flooding, you can see the firefighters of Grand Forks, ND, standing in the ice-cold water up to their wastes, fighting a fire, a fire that destroyed 11 of the larger downtown business buildings in Grand Forks, ND, and then spread to three blocks. They had to bring this firefighting material in with huge airplanes, dropping flame retardant on these buildings because they couldn't fight the fire from here. The firefighters didn't have the equipment to fight a fire in a flood. These firefighters, suffering from hypothermia, were using fire extinguishers to fight a fire in downtown Grand Forks, ND. Of course, they finally put the fire out. 
I was on a Coast Guard boat in Grand Forks, and as we went up and down the streets of Grand Forks, ND, here is what you saw, streets that looked like rivers and lakes, as shown in this photograph. Occasionally, you would see a car top sticking up. The boat I was on ran into a car. We could not see it, but we knew we ran into a car because we saw about two inches of a radio antenna sticking above the water. When I told the pilot of the boat, `I think you ran into a car,' he said, `I guess so, but, you know, it wasn't there yesterday.' What happened is that river was running so fast that it was taking cars underneath, and you could not see them moving all around that town, as the river destroyed the central core of that city. When the fire was finally put out in downtown Grand Forks, ND, here is part of what it looked like. It skipped over three different blocks, but you could see what it did to downtown Grand Forks, ND. 
Some say, well, that is quite a tragedy, but it happens other 
places in the country. I don't know of any other place in the country where they have suffered a circumstance where a major city was almost totally and completely evacuated and a major part of the city permanently and totally destroyed. In the middle of all of this, I went to North Dakota, and I was in North Dakota on almost all weekends. I went there with President Clinton on Air Force One during the middle of a week, on a Tuesday. He flew into Grand Forks, ND. While this city was evacuated, thousands of them were sent to Grand Forks AFB. They were put in giant airplane hangars where thousands of cots were set up, and that is where many of them slept overnight until they could find some other shelter to move to or some other family to take them in or to get transportation to a relative who lived in another city. `Red Cross tops 1 million meals,' the Grand Forks Herald says. `How bad was our disaster? Let us count the meals.' 
People who one day had a home, had warmth, had shelter, had a stove and a refrigerator, a place for kids to come home to from school and a place to come to at the end of the work day, now had nothing. They were living on cots in an Air Force hangar and eating from the Red Cross shelter. And then, finally, the river went back into its bank. Here is what Grand Forks residents have come home to find: 600 homes totally destroyed that will never again be lived in. Another 600 to 800 homes were severely damaged. 
I don't know if many people know what a home looks like when it has been totally submerged in a flood. I was in a boat that was floating on top of the water at the rooftop level of most of these homes. These homes are totally destroyed and will never again be repaired. I have some more photographs here. Here is what a basement looks like. 
This is what happens out in the yard. They strip all the wallboard out of a home and all of the things that used to be their possessions and put them on the boulevard out in front. What used to be a nice street, where cars would drive up and down, is now on both sides of the street filled with trash, filled with the remnants of a home. You can only drive there one way, up and down. The garbage trucks come all day long, back and forth, trying to keep up to haul out this garbage. 
This home was totally submerged in water. When it came back to rest, it rested on top of an old Ford car. This picture shows a home sitting on top of a car. That is what floods do. 
This home was in the same neighborhood, and it just collapsed. It was brought up from its foundation and then collapsed. 
The Grand Forks Herald, in the midst of all of this, says, `Here is why the Federal Government needs to pass disaster relief now.' I have shown you the result of all of this. There is more. There is a problem that farmers and ranchers have--some are flat on their backs having lost their entire herds in the blizzard. But most urgent is the need to give the people who are trying to run these cities the resources so they can tell the people who are out of their homes, here is what your future is going to be. Regarding the 600 homes that are going to have to be bought out, the city needs to be able to say to those 600 families, `We are going to buy you out and create a new flood way.' Under any definition, all of those 600 homes are in the flood way. 
So those 600 families are on hold now. One is living in a tent, by the way, in their yard--a tent--a mother, a father, and children, because they need to know what their future is going to be. They don't have any money, or a home, and they don't have a job. In this disaster bill are the resources that allow the city to say to those people, `We are going to buy your home and establish a new flood plain and, with that commitment, you can now go and get another home.' Until that happens and this bill is passed, those families' lives are on hold--600 families just in that area, and the 800 homes that were severely damaged. Many of them will face a similar circumstance. All of their lives are on hold. 
We hear people around here say this, and I heard them last week and the week before saying that time doesn't matter, nothing 
is urgent, nothing can be done that isn't being done, there is money in the pipeline. You know, I have heard people like that before. They say, `My belt buckle was won in a rodeo,' and they say, `There is money in the pipeline.' What a bunch of nonsense. The fact is that the money in this bill is critical. It deals with housing. This funding is what is necessary to give these people hope and to give the city the resources to allow them to move back into either their homes or a different home and get on with their lives. 
Until this bill is signed, until the bill is done, all of these people's lives are on hold. `There is money in the pipeline,' we are told. Yes, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has some money, but that is short-term emergency money. It is not the kind of money that will finally unlock the housing questions and jobs questions that are in front of all of these families. Until this bill gets passed and signed, none of these families will know what their future can be or is going to be. So those who stand here and say that there is money in the pipeline and there is nothing that can be done that isn't now being done, I say to them, you are wrong and you know it. If you don't know it, buy a plane ticket and fly to Grand Forks and talk to the flood victims that you are holding hostage. If you don't have the decency to do that, then stop talking about it, because you don't know what you are talking about. 
There is not money in the pipeline to deal with the emergency needs of these people. Every one in this Chamber has a responsibility to understand that. If they don't understand it, they will not talk about it. If Congress doesn't decide this week--and there is some indication it won't--to pass a disaster bill without continuing to play politics, then all of these people's lives will continue to be on hold for another week and another week and another week. In the midst of all of this, we will have, I suppose, the prospect of front page stories like, `Gingrich Vows Not to Yield on Disaster Bill.' This says, `After veto, GOP will send back same riders.' 
We have people who, a couple of years ago, waltzed around this town and boasted--and I can get you the quotes and the names and the days, but I will not do that at the moment--that if they didn't get their way in this Congress or in the last Congress, they intended to shut down the Government. They boasted repeatedly, `Either we get our way or we will shut down the Government.' They said, `Frankly, nobody cares if we shut down the Government.' Well, they boasted about it and they kept their word; they shut down the Government and they paid an enormous price for it. 
Now, some of those same people are trying to portray themselves as being opposed to shutting down the Government, so they want to attach an amendment to this disaster bill saying, we want to tell people that we are opposed to shutting down the Government. The amendment has nothing to do with this bill--totally extraneous and unrelated. But they want to use this bill to say we are opposed to shutting down the Government. The amendment by which they do that is controversial, and I am not going to get into the merits of that. Frankly, I care less about the merits of that than do some other people. But as was demonstrated by my comments about the disaster relief when Hurricane Andrew hit Florida, a disaster bill that was passed in less than a month--in fact, in about 2 weeks after President Bush sent it up. As was shown by that, it is unusual for people around here to believe it is appropriate to play politics on a disaster bill. 
In most cases when you are talking about disaster aid, you are talking about victims. When you are talking about victims, in most cases, politics takes a back seat. Members of the House and the Senate--Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals--don't think much about politics in those cases. They say we have had people who were victims and had tough times through an act of nature, who have been dealt a bad blow, who are homeless, hopeless, helpless, and whose families are jobless and who need us to say, `You are not alone, let us help you.' And in almost all cases, the Congress has reached out a helping hand and said, `Here is a disaster bill we are going to pass and we are going to do it on a timely basis to try to give hope to those people who are victims.' 
In every case that I have recalled since I have been here, whether it was the earthquake victims of California, or the hurricanes in Florida, or tornadoes, or blizzards, or floods, I have felt that the taxpayers of North Dakota want us to say: Let us help. 
Let's reach out and provide the helping hand; extend the hand of friendship and the hand of help to say that the rest of the country wants to join you in helping you get back on your feet. 
For years we have had disaster bills move through the Congress without someone saying, `I have a new idea. Why don't I try to jam up the disaster bill with a very controversial issue and shove it down the President's throat? Why don't we try to do that? So what if the victims are hurt by that? So what? They are just from North Dakota.' Or, as this paper says, people will forget by the next election. `So what?' 
What a hard-headed, cold-hearted attitude for people to take on a disaster bill. I can't remember when I have been as disappointed in the behavior of Congress as on this bill. 
Last evening, after the basketball game, the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz promoted during the second half of that game a new television sitcom, I guess--I don't know. I have never seen it, probably never will, certainly don't intend to. If I do, it will be by accident. But the title was `Men Behaving Badly.' `Men Behaving Badly.' I thought, that could describe what I am going to face tomorrow in the Senate again. And someone said, `Well, but the Senate is more than just men.' That is true, and it is a better place because of it. But I don't see anyone other than some prominent leaders out here leading in a direction that is counterproductive, and it is behaving badly. 
There is an easy way for us to solve this problem. Today, Monday, thousands of people in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks woke up not in their homes--some in camper trailers, some in tents, some in motels, some in shelters, some in neighboring towns, some in acquaintances' homes, some in relatives' homes. They woke up not in their own homes and not in their own beds because they do not have a home. Most of them don't have a job. What they have is a wait on their hands waiting for the Congress and for their city to make a decision about their future. 
Why is it up to us to make a decision? Because we have in this bill the resources that will allow those two cities to describe a new floodplain and buy out some of these homes and give people an opportunity to create a new future. But today, on Monday, they woke up probably feeling as anxious and as angry about this as I did, wondering: What on Earth are people thinking about trying to create a major political issue over a disaster bill? 
Madam President, this weekend in the middle of this debate the Republican National Committee was on the radio in North Dakota with paid radio ads on this issue. Why would the Republican National Committee be doing paid radio ads about this issue? Because this is now, and has always been, according to leadership and the Republican National Committee, a political issue. From their point of view, the point seems to be to add extraneous and unrelated issues to this bill, and then try and shove it down the President's throat. 
You know. The shoe is going to be on the other foot someday. Someday somebody else is going to have a disaster. Somebody else is going to do to them what is now being done to the people of this region. And then they are going to complain about it, and say, `How can you do that?' I am not going to do it to them because I have not done that since I came to Congress, and I will not do it in the future. I will not play politics with the lives of people who have been victimized by national disasters. But someone will again in the future because the precedent is now established that it is just fine to do. It is OK. Get a disaster bill, and then get the national political committee of whichever party involved and start doing radio ads creating an advantage, and have the Speaker go to the Editorial Board and say, `We are not going to yield on this issue.' Besides, it is just a bunch of folks up there in that territory; and says, `Voters will not remember this standoff over the supplemental appropriations at the ballot box.' 
Well, I am appalled by what we are facing here. And I don't know what we expect this week. 
And I am not the only one who is appalled. I have here an 
article from the Sioux Falls, SD, paper. The headline reads, about the Governor of South Dakota, Governor Janklow, who is a Republican: `Janklow Slams GOP on disaster-aid bill.' The article goes on to say, `Misguided Republican strategy will make Congress look bad.' 
Governor Janklow has it right. 
This is not, and should not be, a bill on which the two parties play a game of political Ping-Pong. This ought to be a disaster bill that provides relief to victims. 
So, Madam President, in the remaining days of this week I urge Members of the leadership here in the Congress to give us an opportunity to pass a disaster bill that does not contain extraneous or unrelated issues that are controversial. Give us an opportunity to pass a piece of legislation like that, have the President sign it, and have those people who are now wondering about their future who suffered through significant disasters, blizzards, floods, and fires to be able to understand disaster aid is on the way with the President's signature, that aid begins to move, decisions will be able to be made, and people's lives will be able to begin to move on as if normal again. But that can only happen if Members of the House and the Senate decide that they will forgo the opportunity to play politics with the disaster bill. 
Madam President, the Fargo Forum, which is a newspaper in North Dakota, wrote an editorial. This is North Dakota's largest paper. `Act now on flood relief bill. More than 6 weeks ago the flood-ravaged Red River Valley just wanted to be left high and dry * * * [In] an ironic perversion of the wish, Congress acted or failed to act.' The `Red River Valley just wanted to be left high and dry.' Well, it is high and dry all right. 
The point of their editorial is that Congress needs to act now. This is not a case where a week from now, or a month from now it is just fine. This is urgent. This is an urgent need, and Congress needs to act now. 
The Grand Forks Herald is the newspaper of a city of 50,000 people. Every day since Congress took the Memorial Day recess at the front of their masthead they say, `10 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.' I suppose it is now 18 days since the House adjourned without passing the disaster bill. The editorial makes the point, and every citizen in Grand Forks makes the point, that Congress ought to move on this disaster bill and move now. 
On March 19 the President sent his request to Congress. When the flood occurred and the President went to Grand Forks, ND, and spoke to several thousand people in an airplane hangar at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, he made the point that he was seeking a significant disaster relief bill and that he hoped that Congress would not add extraneous or unrelated amendments to the bill. What he hoped would not happen has happened. The result has now been substantial delay--at least 3 weeks' delay, and probably more. 
Madam President, my desire would be that everyone call a political truce, that we simply recognize that the disaster bill is to respond to disasters, and that the way to provide hope and help to the victims of the disasters is to pass a bill without the major areas of controversy that have now been sent to the President.  
UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST 
Madam President, for all these reasons, I now send to the desk a clean supplemental appropriations bill for myself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Johnson. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 18, H.R. 581; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and that the text of the clean supplemental appropriations bill that I just sent to the desk be inserted in lieu thereof, that the bill be passed, and that the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me describe what it is I was just proposing. The major items of controversy that now exist in 
the legislation the President vetoed are the so-called anti-Government shutdown provision--the so-called continuing resolution provision--and the census issue. 
I know the President in his veto message was going to object to more than those two. The bill that I sent to the desk and asked unanimous consent be considered was the conference report that was agreed to in both the House and the Senate, with the anti-Government shutdown provision and the census provision removed. 
The shutdown provision has substantial amounts of controversy attached to it. I have no objection at all for that to be considered at any time. I just do not think it ought to be considered on a disaster bill. 
My bill removes the census portion of the disaster bill. I do not object that the Senate consider the census provision at some point. But there are plenty of other opportunities to consider it. As soon as the President signs the bill and disaster aid begins to flow, we will have other bills come to the floor of the Senate. My understanding is that there was a proposal to be brought to the floor of the Senate tomorrow. Both of these issues could be offered as amendments to that bill. I have no objection to that. If somebody wants to offer that, let's offer that and have a debate. I have no objection nor concern about that. 
I just do not want these provisions to be provisions that interminably delay a disaster bill which should have passed, now it is 3 weeks ago. 
If the newspaper reports are correct, it looks like this issue will not be resolved this week, nor probably next week. 
How long do victims of a disaster have to wait? When will Congress understand its obligation, and the historical approach of dealing with disaster bills, of not adding highly controversial issues to a bill that deals with disasters? 
It seems to me that this should be a time for cooler heads to prevail; a time for both sides to back away a bit and decide to pass the disaster bill without these provisions. 
I have taken the time again today simply to attempt to describe what our region of the country is faced with, to describe why we are upset and angry about what has happened to this piece of legislation. And I will no doubt be on the floor additional times today and during this week. 
I hope that in the coming couple of hours Members of Congress will decide this is not a strategy that does anything other than hurt victims of a disaster. 
Does it help the political party? I don't think so. I mean, I guess that is why a political party would run ads over this weekend in my State, because they think they are being helped by it. I don't think anybody is being helped by it. I think the net result is that victims of a disaster get hurt. 
I mean, if there are some who do not care who gets hurt as you march toward a political victory, that is one thing. But I don't think this is marching toward anything but chaos in any event, and I think it is clear who is getting hurt. Victims of the disaster are getting hurt. 
I started today with a description of Ranee Steffan, who is living in a camper trailer, has been for some while, perhaps will be for some while, with her kids. She does not want much. She, her family, and her children want a job because she doesn't have a job, because most of the businesses in this area have been closed--wants a job and a home. She wants decisions to be made that will allow that to happen in her city, and in her community. And until this piece of legislation passes that cannot happen. 
On behalf of Ranee Steffan, and so many other thousands of families whose lives are on hold, I hope very much that both sides of the aisle will decide to pass a disaster bill free from contentious unrelated political matters. We need to get aid to those who need it as quickly as is possible. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's statement. The bill that I asked unanimous consent to have considered was not a bill written by me. It was the exact conference report just reported out by Congress, minus the two contentious provisions. So I do not want people to think it was a bill written by me. It was exactly what the conference did, leaving out the two very controversial provisions.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today on the floor for about 30 minutes on this subject. I shall not extend much beyond that. But I did want to add my voice to the voice of Senator Byrd and express, as I indicated previously, two things. First, my gratitude for the resources that are in this bill that would be available and helpful to the victims of the flood in my State; and, second and also important, my concern about the unnecessary delay. 
I was looking for a copy of the conference report. It is not yet available here in the Senate. The conference report is a conference report to provide emergency appropriations. The emergency appropriations are necessary to respond to natural disasters. But, of course, there are issues in this conference report that determine that it will not become law. The conference report, if it were on my desk, I would hold it up and say, `This is not going to be law, and everyone in this Chamber knows it.' 
It is part of the process that is so frustrating from time to time in this Chamber. It is a process that goes on from time to time on a lot of legislation--and the Democrats do it, the Republicans do it: Put extraneous or unrelated amendments on a bill. That is not unusual. The rules of the Senate allow that. What is unusual is that a bill providing for disaster relief to thousands and thousands of people is now being used for that 
purpose. That's unusual. That's unprecedented. That didn't happen previously. A disaster bill, generally speaking, was a piece of legislation that most understood should not be used for the traditional kinds of political games that are played here in the U.S. Congress. That is what is different this time. 
This aid will come. The resources in this bill will be available. Recovery will take place, but after, now, 2 weeks' delay. Two weeks ago today, the Congress left for the Memorial Day recess without having enacted a conference report. Now, today, the conference report is before us and it will be undoubtedly approved. It will not be signed into law, and everyone in this Chamber knows it. 
Some say, and they make the case with great forcefulness, `It doesn't matter. Nothing that needs to be done is not now being done. There is money in the pipeline.' I have heard it a hundred times this week from people who don't have the foggiest idea about what the facts are. 
Will Rogers once said, `It's not what he knows that bothers me so much, it's what he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.' There is some money in the FEMA pipeline to deal with emergency immediate relief--food today, housing tonight in a motel. But there is no money in the pipeline from HUD to rehabilitate the housing, to begin the construction that is necessary--in a State, by the way, that has a very short construction season. Losing 3 weeks in North Dakota, in a construction season where we have to replace probably 1,000 to 1,500 homes, is devastating. It is a delay that is devastating to the region. 
That is the point that drives us and compels us to say, thanks for this aid. It will get there. We appreciate very much the cooperation of everyone. But we remain enormously disturbed by the fact that this conference report is not going to be law and everybody in this Chamber knows it, and the result will be another week of delay. There will be 1 more week with thousands of people who wake up in the morning not in their own beds, somewhere else--a shelter, a neighboring town, a hotel, a home of a stranger who took them in. There are thousands of them, thousands of them today without a home, waiting for the fundamental decisions that will be unlocked by this bill. And the strategy today, by some, is to include in this bill something that will certainly gain a veto, because it has no relationship to this bill and the President has said it is something he cannot support. The result will be 1 more week, 7 more nights, 14 more nights, for people who don't have a home. That's the dilemma. 
Mr. President, I have consumed my time. I thank the Chair and the ranking member of the committee. I hope, when all of this process is complete and the dust settles, that the quantity of 
resources involved in this bill finally, even if belatedly, will be there to provide some hope and help to those families who now feel hopeless and helpless. There is help on the way. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I sincerely regret that the bill before us today is not the one which will get relief to the flood victims of the Upper Midwest. Why, because it is laden with extraneous, highly political provisions which the President has told us for months that he could not and would not sign. 
What are those provisions? The first is an automatic continuing resolution which, if enacted, would put the Government on automatic pilot if Congress is unable to complete its work on appropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year. While that may sound like a good idea, it is not. It would serve as a disincentive for Congress to complete their work in a timely fashion, and it would remove any leverage the President would have on appropriations bills not enacted by the end of the fiscal year. 
The second extraneous provision prohibits the Bureau of the Census from using statistical sampling in preparing the 2000 census. Never mind that statistical sampling was proposed by the National Academy of Sciences after a lengthy study as the best way to ensure an accurate count. There is no question that this attempt to prohibit such sampling is politically motivated. While I oppose both provisions on their merits, neither, in any case, belongs on an emergency disaster appropriations bill. 
The sole purpose of the bill before us today is to try to embarrass the President, not to help disaster victims. This is a sad day in the annals of congressional history. It is political one-upmanship at its worst. It is not about helping the people we were elected to serve. It is not about helping thousands of people in Grand Forks who are trying to rebuild their homes and their lives. It is about raw politics, pure and simple. Never, to my knowledge, has a disaster bill been held up for purely political, partisan advantage. That is what we are doing today, and that is just plain wrong. 
A group of business and political leaders from Grand Forks were in Washington yesterday, including Mayor Pat Owens. They were here to meet with officials of the various agencies that will receive emergency funds in this bill. Our officials were discussing how the money contained in this measure could help their devastated community. A couple of them sat in on the appropriations conference. They were appalled at what they saw and heard. They heard about the census, the Ukraine, Uruguay, a continuing resolution, but they heard almost nothing about disaster funds. The people of Grand Forks are in dire straights. Their needs are urgent. Their lives are on hold, yet their problems were barely discussed in the conference. 
We North Dakotans are a strong, proud, and resolute people. We will face the challenges ahead with courage and commitment. But with damages expected to be in the billions, we can not fully recover without the Federal help provided in this bill. As I stated earlier today, I am enormously grateful for all the resources provided in this bill to help our disaster stricken region. I am particularly grateful to Senators Stevens and Byrd who were extremely helpful and supportive throughout every step of the process. Without their personal intervention and continuous support, many items and millions of dollars would not be in the bill we have before us today. 
I want to thank their staffs as well--Steve Cortese and Jim English--who gave me wise advice and counsel on my maiden voyage as a member of the Committee on Appropriations. On behalf of all the people of North Dakota, I want to thank them as well as all the members of the committee for their understanding and their generous assistance. I hope that by next week, we will be able to deliver the resources promised in this bill. 
Let me just list a few of the items in the bill that will have a direct bearing on our ability to recover, and for which there is currently no money available in the pipeline: 
$500 million in community development block grants. This is the most flexible funding and the most crucial component to allow for buyouts. While all disaster States are eligible for this assistance, we anticipate that the majority will go to the Dakotas and Minnesota; 
$50 million for a new Livestock Indemnity Program which will help North Dakota farmers and ranchers who have lost close to 125,000 head of livestock; 
$15 million in Department of Agriculture funds to purchase floodplain easements to reduce hazards to life and property due to the floods; 
$5 million for the Interest Assistance Program to provide additional funding for guaranteed, low-interest loans to farmers; 
$20 million to reimburse school districts who have had to educate additional children who were dislocated by the floods; 
$5 million for all preconstruction and design work for an outlet from Devils Lake to the Sheyenne River; 
$27.9 million in Corps of Engineers funding for North Dakota from the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies Program; 
$600,000 for Ramsey County to mitigate damages to the sewer system from flooding, if necessary; 
Up to $20 million for the Corps of Engineers to raise the levees at Devils Lake; 
$210,000 for North Dakota's National Parks; 
$3.9 million for the BIA in North Dakota; 
$265,000 for the Indian Health Service in North Dakota; 
$6.1 million for North Dakota to repair damaged freight rail lines; 
$9.3 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service in North Dakota; 
$840,000 for the U.S. Geological Survey in North Dakota; 
Department of Education waiver authority language which will permit the Department to help students having difficulty meeting application and other statutory deadlines regarding Federal education funds; and 
Language that allows disaster States greater flexibility in using child care and development block grant funds to help families in nonemployment-related activities relating to the cleanup and recovery. 
My purpose in providing this list is to illustrate the urgent need to pass a bill the President can sign. Those who argue that there is plenty of money in the pipeline to respond to our needs are just plain wrong, as the list above so aptly demonstrates. None of funds listed above will be available until the President signs a disaster bill. 
There are many people beyond the Congress to thank for their support in the wake of a series of historic and devastating disasters in North Dakota. Above all, I want to thank the people of North Dakota who, despite their losses, have refused to be overcome. They have displayed a remarkable sense of courage, caring, and conviction throughout the ordeal. Never have I been more proud to represent the State of North Dakota than I am now. They are wonderful people. They know the meaning of neighbor. Whenever and wherever they were able, they extended a hand to those less fortunate. 
The great spirit of our people is embodied in the mayor of Grand Forks, Pat Owens. While small in stature, she has the heart of a giant. She gave us the courage not to lose courage. Her indomitable spirit held the citizens of Grand Forks together during the worst days of the tragedy, and now is guiding us patiently and compassionately through the recovery. 
Finally, I want to thank all the Federal agencies for their long hours and hard work in bringing emergency assistance to relieve the immediate suffering of our citizens. They have done a magnificent job under extremely trying circumstances, and we are grateful for their superhuman efforts. James Lee Witt, the Director of FEMA, has been the guiding light in this endeavor. He came to North Dakota and personally witnessed the devastation, and then rushed personnel and resources into the State to assess damages and provide emergency assistance. He has also coordinated the activities of other Federal agencies in trying to get assistance to those in need as quickly as possible. That process is ongoing, and James Lee remains the stalwart in that endeavor. We thank him for all he has done and continues to do. 
I intend to support this bill even though I know it is headed for a veto because of the extraneous provisions contained in it. I am voting for it to keep faith with my constituents, and to give them hope that a very similar bill, absent the political riders, will be passed next week. That bill will provide us with the helping hand we need to rebuild our communities, reunite our families and restore our economic base. We will face the challenge ahead with courage and commitment. With our prairie faith to guide us, we will rebuild, we will recover, and we will be a stronger community.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the conference report on the budget resolution and to say that I am pleased that this year is shaping up to be a historic year in the fight to balance the budget. Democrats and Republicans have worked together to fashion a bipartisan agreement that is projected to balance the unified budget in 5 years, in the year 2002. 
I will support this budget plan because it will help maintain the superb economy we are now enjoying. The budget plan will build on the 1993 deficit reduction bill, which has cut the unified budget deficit by 77 percent. The budget plan also makes room for priorities that are important to the American people, such as middle-class tax relief, greater funding for education, more attention to our environment, and health care for the young and the elderly. 
We have been able to agree on a balanced, commonsense package--one that avoids extreme cuts to programs that Americans depend on and includes some tax cuts. This agreement is balanced because it builds on the economic gains that America has made since 1992.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I don't think I will use the entire 30 minutes. I wanted to come to the floor of the Senate today to speak again about a piece of legislation that we will take up in about an hour and 45 minutes. It is a supplemental appropriations bill to provide resources and money to help those who have been victims of a disaster in our country--especially, and most importantly, the disaster that has occurred in our region of the country, the Red River region, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. 
There are moneys in this bill for other regions as well, and there have indeed been other disasters, although none quite as substantial as the one that has occurred along the Red River; that is why this bill is so critically important to us. 
I was a conferee on the conference committee and, last evening, the conference committee reported out the bill, H.R. 1469, an act making emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters and for overseas peacekeeping, and so on. It is emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters. That is the purpose for this bill. Congress will consider that, as I indicated, in about an hour and 45 minutes. 
I want to make two points today. The first is short, and the second is a bit longer. The first is this: Inside this piece of legislation is a substantial amount of help, an enormous amount of additional resources that will go to a number of regions of the country, especially our region, to try to help the victims of the disaster that visited our region. We are enormously grateful for that. There are many Members of the U.S. Senate, on both sides of the political aisle here, who pulled together and rolled up their sleeves and said, `Let us help.' The help in this bill is substantial. It is very substantial, and it will help our region in a manner that I can hardly describe. So we are enormously grateful to every Member of this Senate and this Congress who helped us get to this point. That is the first point. Thanks to everyone who helped. 
The second point is this: The resources inside this legislation are only going to be available when the President signs the bill. Time is urgent to deal with the needs that exist in our part of the country and to respond to the victims of the massive flooding that occurred in the Red River Valley. The reason I mention that time is a serious problem is because, 14 days ago, the Congress left for the Memorial Day recess and left this bill unfinished, and so 14 days have elapsed since that time. Now it appears that Congress will pass this bill this afternoon, and it contains unrelated, controversial items that almost certainly will be vetoed by the President because he has said time and time again that if it contains especially the central item dealing with Government shutdowns, he will be constrained to veto the bill. 
I rode with President Clinton on Air Force One to Grand Forks Air Force Base one morning, and he visited with several thousand people who were then living and sleeping in an airplane hangar, a series of four hangars, sleeping on cots because they had been evacuated from their homes. Two cities, Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, were nearly totally evacuated due to the flood waters that destroyed the two communities. Thousands of people were in airplane hangars sleeping on cots, wondering what would come next. President Clinton came that day. One of the points he made was that the Congress and the President certainly will help. He said, `I hope very much that in the construction of a disaster relief bill, Congress will not add unrelated amendments, controversial, extraneous amendments that will slow down or derail 
the bill.' He made that point in the airplane hangar to the thousands of people who were there for good reason --because there is a tendency in Congress to add unrelated things to other pieces of legislation. I don't expect that that habit will discontinue. But it is unusual for that to happen on a disaster bill. It is not the usual course of events for someone to seize a disaster bill like this and say, oh, by the way, I have an unrelated issue that is very controversial and I think we can force the President to sign it by including it in a disaster bill. 
That is not the way most Members of Congress have treated disaster bills in the past. Disaster bills deal with disasters. They have resources that are needed by victims. The Congress, by and large, has decided that they will not toy with or play with or play political games with a disaster bill. Yet, today, despite my enormous gratitude for all of the wonderful resources that are in this bill, this bill contains a couple of--especially one--totally unrelated, very controversial items that the President certainly will veto. 
So what happens as a result of that? More delay. Probably another week's delay, at least. What happens to the victims of the flood along the Red River during that week? They will wait, they will wonder, and they will not have answers about their future. 
It is unfair to them to do this. Now, some say--and I read in the papers in the last few days--that delay doesn't matter; there is money in the pipeline. FEMA has money and they are helping the victims of this disaster. Why are you saying that delay is a problem here? 
To anyone who says that, they must be saying it without the facts. The facts are this. In Grand Forks, ND, a city with which I am well familiar because I have been there many, many times prior to, during, and since the flood, about 600 homes were totally and completely destroyed as a result of the flood and probably another 800 were severely damaged. The people who lived in those 600 homes are not ever moving back. The question is, what happens to them? They are going to have to describe a new flood plain up in Grand Forks, and those homes are going to have to be bought out, and the money will hopefully be used to build new homes somewhere else. But there isn't money in the pipeline to buy out those homes. The HUD money in this bill is not available until the bill is signed. The result is that the city can't make decisions until the money is there, and the result is that all of those citizens and families, many of whom are now split, wake up in a bed that is not theirs, in the home of a stranger that took them in, or in a motel, or in a shelter someplace, or in a city 100 miles away, all of those people will continue to wait because the city can't give an answer because they don't have the money. And the city doesn't have the money because this is delayed. 
Now, let me, if I might, go through a couple of charts to describe this point. The Grand Forks Herald runs this editorial every day. It is a city of 50,000 people, 90 percent of whom were evacuated. I have said that 600 homes were totally destroyed and another 800 were severely damaged. The Grand Forks Herald says in its editorials, `10 Days Since the Congress Let Us Down.' That was actually a few days ago. But, today, they will have had a different number. Every single day, the number of days `since the Congress let us down.' The Fargo Forum, 70 miles down the road, wrote `Act Now on Flood Relief Bill.' It is a long editorial saying `don't delay and add extraneous amendments to this kind of legislation.' The Grand Forks Herald, again, wrote: `11 Reasons to Pass Federal Disaster Bill Now.' It describes the urgency and the need for the legislation. 
Now, let me, just in case my colleagues don't recall--and I assume most of them do--review again how we got to where we are now. In our region of the country, we had nearly 10 feet of snow, 3 years worth of snow in 3 months. The last quantity of snow was nearly 2 feet--the worst blizzard in 50 years, we are told. This illustrates what happened during that blizzard. Telephone poles snapped like toothpicks and 80,000 people were out of power. In many cases, the power wasn't restored for some long while, despite the fact that day and night crews were working on poles. You can see these poles that were put in. These power poles were snapped off like toothpicks and 80,000 people were without power. In the middle of that, the Corps of Engineers is furiously building dikes because the Weather Service says we will now have a severe flood. 
So the snow begins to melt. We have a 500-year flood. 
This is farmland. It doesn't look like it. It looks like an ocean. All you can see is the barn and a silo, and water for as far as the eye can see. 
This is a poster that shows one of our communities along the Red River. All of this is farmland. It now looks like a lake. This is before all of the snow had melted. This little Red River became a lake nearly 150 miles long and anywhere from 20 to 30 miles wide. That is what the citizens of this region face. 
What did that look like? When that came through our town, it looked like this--a river that had no bank, a river that became part of the community in every home, in every business; Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, totally inundated. In East Grand Forks, 9,000 people evacuated, most of them with only the shirts on their backs, totally evacuated. In Grand Forks, ND, 90 percent of the 50,000 population had to evacuate, many of them with no notice at all. 
So here is what the Grand Forks neighborhoods looked like--all throughout the town with water reaching the tops of automobiles. 
In the downtown area we had severe flooding. Then we had a severe fire. In the middle of the flood a fire destroyed 11 buildings; parts of three blocks in downtown Grand Forks. 
These courageous firefighters fought that fire in some cases working only with fire extinguishers in ice cold water up to their waists and their chests, suffering hypothermia; and parts of three blocks of downtown Grand Forks burned down. 
Here is what it looks like. Here was a block. There is nothing left. In the middle of the flood it looks like Dresden. 
Here is another view of downtown Grand Forks flooded and destroyed and ravaged by fire; the fire skipped throughout the downtown. 
I might say to the Presiding Officer that this downtown is still uninhabited. If you go there today--and I have been there very recently--there is almost nothing going on here because there is almost nothing left. Every one of these buildings was severely destroyed, and the new floodplain in any event when it is drawn, will take a major part of the downtown and destroy it further because the buildings will be uninhabitable. 
The Grand Forks Herald in the middle of all of this says, What kind of flood is this? `Red Cross Tops 1 Million Meals.' How bad was that disaster: People in shelters, people evacuated all across the region, and the Red Cross serving 1 million meals. 
The water is gone. That water stayed a long, long time. The National Weather Service predicted a severe flood with a record 49 feet which would have been a record of all time on the Red River; 49 feet. But it wasn't 49 feet. It was 54 feet. And it inundated everything, and literally brought both of those communities to their knees; to a standstill. 
What has happened in Grand Forks now? These are some pictures that are not quite as clear. But Grand Forks now has streets. When you drive down the street, there is only a narrow path to drive down because in all of these homes that were destroyed or severely damaged by this flood homeowners are ripping all of the things out of these homes that need to be taken out; the streets are littered as far as you can see up and down the street with just this kind of scene. 
The citizens who go back and take a look at what they have see this. This is a home that I stopped at not too many days ago. This is a home that is sitting on top of a car. Incidentally, I was on a Coast Guard boat. And this is in an area called Lincoln Park. We were on a boat through this area. All of these homes were completely under water. It took those homes right off the foundation. And this home now comes back and sits on top of a car. It and 600 of the neighboring homes are destroyed and will never ever be inhabited again. 
In the same neighborhood, this is what happened when the flood inundated the home. 
The reason I am showing these pictures, Mr. President, is some say that there is not an urgency here at all. I don't know how many have seen what happens in a flood. But here is what Grand Forks residents, when they went back to homes that are now uninhabitable, see. They see personal belongings that are unrecognizable. They see all of the appliances that are destroyed. And they see the job of taking them out to the street and putting them on the sidewalk. 
Then we have people now in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks--thousands of them--who this morning didn't wake up in their homes because their homes aren't available to them. They are destroyed. They wake up in a neighbor's home, a friend's home, or a stranger's home who took them in; a motel, a shelter, in a town 10 miles or 20 miles or 50 miles away, and in some cases 100 miles away. And they are asking the city of Grand Forks, `What next?' The city leaders of Grand Forks say to them, `Well, what we are going to do is we are going to help you. The Federal Government is going to give us the resources to help you. We are going to buy out some of these homes. We are going to help some of those businesses restart. We will help some of those folks in rebuilding a new home.' 
I talked to a couple down at the Lincoln Park area. They lived in their home for 43 years, and had a half-hour notice as the flood waters coursed through the dikes and destroyed their entire neighborhood. Now they are living in travel trailers, wondering about their future. `What next?' 
Every one of those lives is on hold at this moment waiting and watching and wondering when Congress will pass the disaster relief bill. The answer is, this afternoon. 
That is the good news. 
The bad news is that what Congress passes this afternoon has in it unrelated, extraneous amendments put there, in my judgment, only for political purposes--only to bait the President; only to say to the President, `Sign this.' We are going to shove it right down that narrow alley and dare him to sign it. The President has already said that he won't sign this. This is an amendment that deals with Government shutdowns on October 1. It doesn't have merit. 
I don't know. Maybe we should debate that. It ought not be debated on a disaster bill. And Members of this Congress know it. If any other Member of this Senate was faced with the same circumstance with their constituents whose lives are on hold and who are waiting day after day after day--if anyone else were in the same situation, they would be here to do what I am doing to say this makes no sense. 
Those who have visited my State and the Northern States in our country know that we have a very short construction season. We don't have 12 months out of the year to rebuild. We have a very short construction season. Every single week you lose means that part of your community begins to bleed to death. That is why this week and last week was so important. It is why next week is so important. It is why I am so upset with those who insist on putting unrelated amendments that they know will require a veto of this bill. 
Mr. President, we are not the first region of the country to suffer a disaster--earthquakes, fires, flood, tornadoes all over this country. And in all of the years that I have been in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate I have been one who said my constituents in North Dakota want to be there to help. You are not alone when you suffer a disaster. We want to help you. I do not recall a time since I came to the Congress when in the middle of a disaster bill people said, `Oh, by the way, we are going to play this like a fiddle. We have an agenda here.' This isn't about victims. It is about politics. I do not recall a time when that has happened on a disaster bill. It has happened on other bills, and it has happened on both political sides of the aisle--both Republicans and Democrats. We will probably never change that because of the rules of the Senate probably are never going to 
change. But, generally speaking, in most cases Members of the Congress and the Senate have not done this with disaster bills. 
We are going to vote on this bill this afternoon. It contains critically needed aid for this region of the country. 
There are thousands and thousands of people who are not back in their homes. Seven-thousand apartments in Grand Forks, ND, are uninhabitable right now. So the 7,000 people in the apartment complexes aren't back and won't be back until they get some answer; until some moneys are available, until the construction begins, until the money is in the pipeline to get that done. And there are those who say, `Well, gee, nothing is being held up. FEMA has money.' They just do not understand it. They are plain flat wrong. Yes. FEMA has money. FEMA has money to deal with the day-to-day needs of someone who tomorrow needs money to buy a meal, or needs money to rent a hotel room. But FEMA does not have the money that gives a community the ability to make the decisions to buy out the neighborhoods, or to describe the new floodplain and help people rebuild homes and businesses. FEMA doesn't have that money. That money is not available. That money is only available when legislation of this type passes and is signed by the President of the United States. 
So, if I hear one more time anyone in this Senate say, `Well, gee, there is money in the pipeline, no one is disadvantaged,' I urge them to do this. Buy an airplane ticket, and I will go with you. And let's go to Grand Forks, ND. There is probably going to be a city council meeting the night that you get there, and there will probably be 500 or 1,000 people there. And every single one of them will ask you the question: `If there is money in the pipeline, show us where. Where is the money that will allow us to make the decisions to get on with our life? Where is it?' If anyone who alleges that, again, buy a ticket, and come to East Grand Forks, MN, or Grand Forks, ND, or Watertown, SD, and tell those citizens where the money is. They won't do that because they can't. This are dead flat wrong. 
They are playing a game on this bill, and they ought not play a game on this bill. They know it. 
I raised the question yesterday: `Why don't you pass this bill, and then extract the emergency portions of this bill; just the emergency portions alone?' Extract that, and pass it as a separately enrolled bill. And if the President vetoes it, then at least enact the emergency portions of it so people who have been victims of a flood and fire and blizzards are not going to be victimized again by delay. 
But it fell on deaf ears because that is not what people want. There are some--not all--who want something more than this. They want political points. They want a political issue. I guess they will get it. Not from me, but they will get it because they will have a veto in a day or two, I suppose. And then people will go home for the weekend having not passed the disaster relief, and then come back next week and start juggling all of this again. In the meantime, 3 weeks will have gone by at a time when it is critical for the people of North Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota to make decisions about their future. 
Mr. President, I regret taking so much time of the Senate today. I know other Members wish to speak on other issues. We will also have a chance to discuss for 2 hours the disaster bill itself in the middle of the afternoon. But I wanted those who watch these proceedings to know what the facts are. 
The facts are that there have been thousands--tens of thousands--of victims of a natural disaster. That disaster was visited on them through no fault of their own; jerked out of their school; pulled out of their homes. The homes destroyed; the schools are closed. 
The timing is urgent that this get done. 
Let me end the way I began with two points. 
One, we are enormously grateful for what is in this bill for disaster relief. We are enormously troubled by the time and the delay it has taken and will take to get this to the President for signature. My hope is that very soon all Members will understand the urgency of disaster relief for those victims who need it today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to stop on the Senate floor today on a mission to compliment my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator Strom Thurmond. He has achieved quite a remarkable record here in the U.S. Senate. I didn't know Senator Thurmond very well except by reputation before I came to the U.S. Senate. But, as I have come to know him and his service to our country, I wanted this morning to join all of my colleagues who will come this morning and tell him thank you for his service to our country. 
Senator Thurmond is serving in the U.S. Senate in 1997. He was born in the year 1902. That means that Senator Thurmond has spent a great deal of time in public service. He is a remarkable person by any measure. 
When I read a piece about Senator Strom Thurmond about 4 years ago, I went up to him on the floor of Senate, after I read the piece, and told him that I learned a great deal about him I did not know. 
One of the things that impressed me so much was to have read about his record in the Second World War. Senator Thurmond volunteered for service in the Second World War, I believe, when he was near 40 years of age. And when I read about what he did in the Second World War, I was really truly astounded. He received five battle stars and 18 decorations: the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star for valor, the Purple Heart, the Cross of Order of Crown Belgium, and so on. 
But what I read about Senator Thurmond was that somewhere near the age of 40, he volunteered to go into service in the Second World War and then further volunteered on a mission, a dangerous mission, to go aloft in a glider and crash-land behind enemy lines at night during the D-day invasion. 
I asked Senator Thurmond on the floor, having read about that, `Weren't you terribly afraid that evening as you boarded a glider to be sent aloft?' And we had a little visit about that. He said, no, he was not. He is a man of enormous courage. If you evaluate the record, not only his record during the Second World War, volunteering for dangerous missions and having received so many decorations for valor as a result of that, but also his record in public service following that, you cannot be anything but admiring of this remarkable and wonderful individual. 
We spend our time in the Senate here, and I suppose over the couple hundred years that the Senate has been in existence, debating each other and having the give-and-take of the competition of ideas, and sometimes I suppose there might be those who watch these proceedings who think that, gee, this is quite a vigorous debate and we do not have the greatest of respect for each other. I would say to those who watch and get that misimpression that, in almost all cases in this body, those of us who come here have enormous respect for others who have been here and who have come under other circumstances. 
Senator Thurmond came to the U.S. Senate, I believe, in 1954, and he has served here with great distinction and great honor. There might be times where he and I would disagree on an issue, but when we disagree we do that without being disagreeable. There have been other times when Senator Thurmond and I have worked together on amendments on the floor of the Senate, and I have been honored to do so. 
No matter the circumstance, I feel privileged to have been able to serve at a time in this Senate when someone with as distinguished a record as Senator Thurmond has compiled has been here. I have said on other occasions, for example, that same feeling exists with Senator Byrd of West Virginia, who, I am sure Senator Thurmond would agree, is one of the great Senators of all times. 
I, as a young boy, watching and listening and paying some attention to American politics, read about and heard about and studied the works of U.S. Senators. Most of those who I knew about when I was going to school I never had the opportunity to meet and certainly did not have the opportunity to serve with. But because of longevity and because of the length of public service given this country by the likes of Senator Byrd, and especially Senator Thurmond, I feel pleased that I have come to the Senate and had the opportunity to serve during my term with some really wonderful Senators who have contributed a great deal to this country and left this a richer place because of their public service. 
Today, I simply wanted to come and say to Senator Thurmond on behalf of the constituents I represent in North Dakota, thank you for your service to this country. This is a better country and a better place because you have served. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested in listening to the debate of my colleagues, and this is, indeed, an important issue and it is very important to understand what are the facts, what precisely is being proposed and how exactly will it affect workers in our country. I expect in the coming days that we will hear a great deal more about this, see amendments and have votes. We already had one cloture vote on this issue as the Presiding Officer knows. I came to the floor, however, just to visit a few moments about the disaster relief bill, the supplemental appropriations bill that we will be dealing with this week in Congress. 
As my colleagues know, the Congress left for a Memorial Day recess, which was all of last week, without having passed the supplemental appropriations bill or the disaster bill, as we refer to it, because the legislation contains a substantial amount of money to respond to the disasters that occurred in our part of the country; namely, the blizzards and the flooding and the fires that occurred in North and South Dakota and Minnesota. 
Mr. President, I spent all of last week in North Dakota. Most Americans, having watched for a couple of weeks the disaster that occurred, especially along the Red River Valley and most especially in Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, remember the images of the massive flooding that occurred that caused the evacuation of a city of 50,000 people on the North Dakota side of the border and the evacuation of 9,000 people from East Grand Forks on the Minnesota side of the border. 
The American people saw this flood that consumed the Red River Valley, a small red river which flows north became a lake 150 miles long by nearly 20 and 30 miles wide in parts of it. Of course, channeling it through the communities of Wahpeton, Fargo, and eventually Grand Forks was successful until it got to Grand Forks, and then the dikes breached and the town of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks became almost totally flooded and both communities were totally evacuated. 
In the middle of that evacuation, a fire broke out in downtown Grand Forks and destroyed 11 of the larger buildings in downtown Grand Forks, ND. Firefighters were fighting fire in water that was terribly cold, water up to their chest, standing in the streets, trying to fight fires in nearly three city blocks in downtown Grand Forks, ND. 
The story is well known that the folks in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks left town, many of them with only the shirts on their backs. They were housed in aircraft hangars at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, 4,000 people originally sleeping on cots and hangars at the Air Force base, and people all around the region taking families in, living with relatives, doing all the things necessary because they have lost their homes and had to find somewhere to go. 
That occurred weeks ago, and the Congress began working on a disaster relief bill. President Clinton went to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks in the middle of the flooding. I went with President Clinton on that visit. He proposed $100 million in community development block grants and other substantial aid through FEMA and other Federal agencies. 
We added to that. 
And my colleagues here in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, constructed a disaster relief bill that was very significant and very important for the recovery of that region. Regrettably, the Congress was not able to agree on the bill and left for the Memorial Day recess. 
Among the areas in this legislation that caused some difficulty is an amendment dealing with a Government shutdown issue that has nothing to do with this bill but nonetheless will engender a Presidential veto. The President has already indicated he could not sign a bill even a disaster bill if it included a controversial amendment like this. So, that is where we left it as we left town about a week and a half ago. 
I was in Grand Forks, ND, last week. And here is an editorial from the Minot Daily News that describes what I saw as well. It talks about the biggest mess in history in North Dakota. 
Garbage is almost everywhere--talking about Grand Forks--thousands of piles several feet high--crumbled drywall and brickwork, water-damaged appliances and furniture and anything else that could be hauled out to the curb and beyond. Streets that were once wide enough to accommodate two-way traffic and a row of parked cars are now so narrow as to permit only one vehicle at a time. 
What I saw in Grand Forks, which is a very pretty city, was every single street of that community lined with garbage, having been pulled out of all of these homes that were inundated, basements, first floors, and in some cases the entire homes inundated by flood water. And now it is all taken out to the curb as they are starting to try to clean up. 
I was down in one part of Grand Forks where I had previously traveled by Coast Guard boat where the homes were totally submerged in water. And our boat was going at the top of the home level on water. I was back there last week, and the water is gone and these homes are totally destroyed--600 of them in this area, 600 homes totally destroyed having been totally under water and the homes were picked up off their foundation and set back. I saw a home sitting on top of a car, a home taken completely off its foundation by the flood water, and then put back down on top of an old Ford car. 
But you go up and down the street, and what you saw was carnage, homes completely destroyed. And the folks who lived there are folks who, in many cases, have lived there many years and are now wondering what to do. 
There was a man and his wife in their seventies standing in the front yard surveying this home they lived in. And I walked across the street and visited with them a bit and asked, `How long had you lived in this home?' `Forty-three years,' they told me. And the woman said, `In 43 years we never even had a drop of water in our basement.' And now of course the home is totally destroyed. `What will you do?' I asked her. `We are living in a little recreation vehicle, one of these little travel trailers that has been provided, but we have no idea what we will do next--no idea. No idea where we will live.' 
They have no idea when their house will be bought out to be part of the flood line, the new floodway that is being created in Grand Forks; they have no idea what will be paid for this house in order to create the floodway. `We don't know what our future is going to be.' But interestingly enough, these folks still had that spirit I guess that exists up in the Scandinavian areas of North Dakota. 
I put my arm around the shoulders of this wonderful woman and finally said at the end, `How are you doing?' She said, `Oh, pretty good, pretty good.' They lost their home of 43 years, but she said she's doing `pretty good'. Well, I know they are going through a lot of difficulty, as are most families, thousands and thousands of families in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks. 
Alice Hoglo owned a home on Dike Street in East Grand Forks for 56 years. She is now living with relatives waiting to see what is going to happen to her home. And her home is nearly completely destroyed. 
And 90-year-old Ann Sticklemyer, she has said she is now going to be a renter. She has not rented for decades, but of course now she has lost her home and is going to have to find a place to rent. But there is nowhere to rent. There are no homes available to rent, no apartments to rent, nothing available for housing in Grand Forks. 
The list goes on, and it is endless of the families and the people who are struggling now to try to figure out: What do you do after the flood has come and gone? Where do we live? What do we do? I mean, when I was there on a boat in downtown Grand Forks surveying the damage in Grand Forks, that was one thing because the water then was so high that you could not possibly walk in it, but now the water is gone and all you have is this wreckage--hundreds and hundreds of homes totally and completely destroyed and families who previously lived in those homes now have nowhere to live. Oh, some are living with relatives, some are 100 miles or 200 miles away living in a motel. Some are living with strangers who invited them in. But they have nowhere to live. 
And so the city of Grand Forks and the city of East Grand Forks struggle now to try to figure out, how do you put all this back together? How do you restart a business community that is shut down? How do you build a new downtown when the new floodway will probably take several critical blocks of your downtown area? How do you do all of that? 
Well, you do it with the resources that were in this disaster bill, the hundreds of millions of dollars of community development block grants and other things that will allow people to get back on their feet and allow cities to begin planning to buy out homes in the floodway, to help provide some grants, yes, to homeowners to fix up their homes and to restart their business. 
When Congress left without passing the disaster bill, some said it did not matter. But the folks in Grand Forks were very upset. And here is a Grand Forks editorial. Every day the top of their editorial page has this: `8 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.' How much longer will it be before Congress gets to work and passes a disaster bill? The next day: `9 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.' 
Congress is not going to let Grand Forks and East Grand Forks down. These resources are going to be made available. But it is urgent they be made available now. It is urgent that Wednesday, when we go to conference, that we strip out the controversial provisions of this legislation and that we pass the legislation, pass the emergency portion of the legislation, at least, clean and get it to the President for signature so the help can be flowing to people who need it. 
Another headline in the Grand Forks Herald, `Along the Dikes Lives are Still on Hold.' And it talks about these folks who have no idea what their tomorrow is going to be because the resources that are needed in order to make the buyouts and to develop the new floodways and so on are not available at this point because the legislation has not yet been passed. 
I just hope that on Wednesday when the conference committee convenes, that the conference committee and all of the conferees will decide that we ought not in any way impede, delay, or derail the disaster bill. We have not in the past, and we should not now. 
I wish the disaster bill had been enacted by Congress before Congress broke for the Memorial Day weekend and the week that we took off. That was not possible regrettably. I think the decision to go home without passing the disaster portion of that bill was a mistake. But those who made that decision apparently felt comfortable with it. I do hope now that this Wednesday when the conference committee reconvenes that it will decide to enact this legislation, do it cleanly, do it without adding additional burdens to it that would engender a Presidential veto, and then make that critically needed relief available to the people who so desperately need it. 
While I am on this subject, let me end with one other point. 
In the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, we have had enormously helpful support from Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, on a bipartisan basis. We have had strong support and unwavering support from virtually all of the subcommittee chairs and the ranking members of the Appropriations Committee. And for that we are most appreciative. We know that we cannot do in alone. 
North Dakotans, who were dealt a very severe blow by having nearly 3 years worth of snow fall in 3 months on North Dakota, causing a massive amount of flooding, a 500-year flood on the Red River, and causing the complete evacuation of very large cities, we know that we cannot solve these problems alone. And we are very thankful for the bipartisan support we have had in the Senate to address these issues. 
I again urge all of those who come to conference in the middle of this week to join us in and pass this bill and do it cleanly and quickly so that the people of Grand Forks are able to rely on the resources in this legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make one additional comment on another matter. I notice the Senator from Idaho is waiting for the floor. I will not be lengthy, but I do want to make a comment on another unrelated issue. 
I and the American people have learned this afternoon that the trial in Denver, CO, the Oklahoma City bombing trial, has concluded apparently with a guilty verdict on all counts, having been brought against Timothy McVeigh. There are many in this country, myself included, who from time to time have been critical of the judicial process feeling that in one case or another or in one circumstance or another the judicial system has let us down. 
In fact, I think most Americans probably felt that way following the O.J. Simpson trial, that somehow the judicial system did not work quite right, and understand why people feel that way and, as I said, I have from time to time joined them thinking that some things just do not seem right in the judicial system. 
But it seems to me that the decision in the Denver courtroom today should say to all of us that the judicial system in this country does work, the message today in that courtroom was a message that seems to me that those who commit heinous acts of terror will be brought to justice in this country. And I wanted to simply say, having heard of this verdict as most Americans have today, that I would credit and compliment the men and women who most Americans will never know who undoubtedly spent a lot of time and energy and effort and hours working on this case, to bring this case to a courtroom that results in a guilty verdict. 
I can recall the day that I heard of this bombing. I was walking into a school in Minot, ND, to speak to a convocation at the school, and I have heard the reports of the bulletins on the radio that there had been this bombing at the courthouse in Oklahoma City. And I did not know until later the full consequence of it. But I will never, I suspect, in my lifetime, forget the picture of the fireman cradling the lifeless body of that young child, a victim of that disaster, that heinous act of terror, a disaster, but also obviously a deliberate heinous act committed against innocent civilians. And I felt the same rage I suppose most Americans do and did about that kind of senseless killing. 
I hope that the verdict today in that courtroom in Denver is a verdict that says to all those in this country who believe they are above the law, who believe that acts of terror somehow will work, that this country will not countenance terror, this country will hunt down and prosecute vigorously those who commit terror against Americans and against all citizens. 
I did want to simply take this moment to say that I suspect that there was an enormous amount of effort and work expended by a lot of folks to bring this trial to a successful conclusion and I, as one Senator, say thank you to the law enforcement community, and thank you to all of those who participated in restoring the faith of the American people in the justice system. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to my colleagues describe Jonna Lynne Cullen, and while I did not and do not know her, the description given by my two colleagues makes me, and I am sure other colleagues here in the Congress, wish we knew her. She is undoubtedly like friends that all of us have around this country, who represent the very small part of our population that gets involved and makes things happen, and truly demonstrate what good citizenship is all about. 
So, while I don't know Jonna Lynne Cullen, I commend my two colleagues from Mississippi. I also wish her well because she represents what is best of America.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak just for a moment about what is happening in North Dakota, my home State, the disaster that occurred there and my disappointment, my profound disappointment that it appears that Congress will leave for the Memorial Day recess without having addressed that issue. 
First, a number of us think there are important things we do from time to time. Today was important for a couple of reasons. My daughter Haley, age 7, last evening, when I arrived home at 10 o'clock, because the Congress is going late every day, asked me if I was going to be able to come to her second grade puppet show this morning. And I said of course, I wouldn't miss her second grade puppet show, because she has been talking about it for a month. So I missed the first votes this morning to go to my daughter's puppet show. While I regret I missed votes, I think I did what was most important. 
Some of these choices that we make about what we must do to meet certain obligations sometimes are difficult--that is not a difficult one--because the schedule here in the Senate is kind of a difficult schedule. As the presiding officer knows, the difficulty in balancing our obligations sometimes presents significant obstacles for us. Almost every night this week we have worked very late. I have been a conferee on the supplemental appropriations bill as a Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We have been working day after day on that piece of legislation. We have also been working on the budget agreement. 
While one of the important things I did this morning was to attend a second grade puppet show for a young girl I am enormously proud of, another important thing I did today was to cast a vote in support of a budget proposal that I think is important for this country. I have cast previous votes just like that. In 1993 I cast a vote for a budget agreement that was a tough vote. It only prevailed by one vote; one vote. The Vice President had to come to this Chamber and cast the tie-breaking vote, the deciding vote. It cut spending, increased some taxes, and people said, `If you do it, you are going to cause a depression in this country and put this country in a tailspin.' 
We said, I said, the President said, and those of us who voted for it said: It is important for us to do what's necessary to get this Federal deficit under control, and if the medicine is tough medicine, so be it. We are willing to support it. I voted for it and I am glad I did. 
Since that time, since 1993, we have had steady economic growth. We have had lower inflation--down, down, and down for 4 years; unemployment has dropped, down, down, and down for 4 years. We have an economy that is in good shape--low unemployment, low inflation, good economic growth, and the Federal deficits have come down 75-percent since 1993. There has been a 75-percent reduction in the Federal deficit because, in 1993, we did what was the right thing to do. 
My political party paid an awful price for that, as a matter of fact. Some of my colleagues who were willing to vote for that are not in this Chamber any longer. But it was the right thing to do. And now the Congress takes the second step. This one, I am pleased to say, is bipartisan. The previous one, we did not get any votes from that side of the aisle--not one. And we prevailed 
by one vote. Today, I am pleased to say--and I hope the American people feel some comfort--that it is a bipartisan effort. The second step is bipartisan and that makes a great deal more sense in our country, for us to be working together. Instead of trying to figure out how do you get the worst of each, maybe we ought to spend time trying to figure out how to get the best of both: How do you work together, not how do you fight each other. And this budget agreement is an agreement hammered out by the White House and by Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress. 
Is it perfect? No. Would I have done it differently, had I written it myself? Yes. Is there more to do? Sure. But is it the right thing for this country, to be saying to the American people on a bipartisan basis that fiscal responsibility is important; that your comfort about the future of this country can increase because the Congress is not going to continue to spend money it doesn't have on things it doesn't need; is not going to continue to charge what it now consumes to our kids and grandkids? That is important. And that is the second thing I did today that was important. And I am pleased I cast that vote and I expect I will remain satisfied over the years that I was a part of that effort. 
But not every day has moments that are satisfying. We each make of our individual days what we choose to make of them. You can get up and have a bad attitude and be in a bad mood all day long, if you like. The one thing we are in charge of is our attitude. You can decide you are going to make something of yourself, do something good for the country; you are going to do something worthwhile for your families. Well, all of us have different ways of dealing with the days. I mentioned a couple of ways that satisfy me today, a second grade puppet show and a budget deal that I think makes sense for this country. 
Let me also, if I might, describe something that causes me enormous heartache today. I have worked for weeks with colleagues here in the Senate on a disaster appropriations bill. My colleagues in the Senate, from Senator Stevens, the chairman of that committee, to Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the committee, and so many others on the Senate Appropriations Committee have done a remarkable job, a wonderful job of creating a disaster bill that says to the people who suffer in our region of the country: We want to help you. You are not alone. 
We worked day and night and one would have hoped that a bill providing disaster relief would have been enacted before the Congress takes a recess for Memorial Day. But, guess what, last evening we were told that the other body had decided it cannot provide a disaster relief bill. All of the provisions of the disaster relief in the supplemental appropriations bill are largely agreed to. They are not in controversy. There is no disagreement. So the money is agreed to. Yet, this bill that contains other issues, some of them totally unrelated to the disaster, and some of them very controversial--those are the provisions, incidentally, that have held up the bill and derailed the bill--we are told, because of those other provisions, it cannot be done. The House of Representatives, the other body, says it just will not do it. 
Let me tell you why this is important and why I think it is an enormous setback for the people who are out there, waiting for disaster aid. If some do not now know, and I expect all Americans do, having watched television, about what my constituents have faced, and the constituents in Minnesota and South Dakota have faced, let me describe it again briefly: 3 years worth of snow in 3 months in North Dakota, seven to eight major blizzards closing down virtually all of the roads in the State. The last blizzard put nearly 2 feet of snow across the State of North Dakota; tens of thousands, over 100,000 head of livestock dead, 1.7 million acres of farmland inundated by water; a river not 100 yards wide becomes a lake 150 miles by 20 and 30 miles. 
As that river is channeled through our cities, it reaches Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, and it reaches a record level never before reached on the Red River in those two cities. And then the dike breaks in the middle of the night and the dike begins failing all across the town and the residents of East Grand Forks, MN, and Grand Forks, ND, had to flee for their lives. Many of them rushed down the street to get on a National Guard truck, with only the clothes on their back, having left everything behind in their homes. They have left their vehicles. They have left all their personal goods, 
and they get on a truck, or some other device, and they flee the community. In East Grand Forks, MN, 9,000 people were evacuated. The entire town was evacuated. In Grand Forks, ND, 50,000 population, 90 percent of the town evacuated. 
When you tour the town next, a day or two after the dike broke, you tour it with a Coast Guard boat and the cars that were on Main Street could not be seen because the water was well above the level of those automobiles. There was nobody in town of a town of 50,000 people or a town of 9,000 people--totally evacuated. 
Then a fire starts and destroys parts of several downtown blocks. One entire block is devastated, 11 major buildings in the historic district of downtown Grand Forks are destroyed and firefighters, fighting a fire chest-deep in ice cold water, suffering hypothermia, were fighting a fire in a flood, trying to get in front of a fire that destroyed part of the downtown of a city. Meantime, 4,000 people are out in an aircraft hangar at the Grand Forks Air Force Base leaving their homes now to sleep on a cot. 
So we went to the Air Force base. Vice President Gore came to North Dakota. President Clinton came to North Dakota. And you see men and women and families, children out in these airplane hangars sleeping on cots, living in hangars because there was nowhere to go. 
Today, weeks later, there are somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people in Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, who are not yet back in their homes. So this morning, they woke up in a strange place. Tonight, they will go to bed in a strange place, and what of Members of Congress? They recessed for Memorial Day. It was time to go home. Oh, they had some unfinished business. One piece of unfinished business was to say to the people in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and people in South Dakota and Minnesota that `you are not alone; here is a helping hand.' We just passed a disaster bill, but the people in the other body didn't have time for that. Do you know why they didn't have time for it? They said to us yesterday, `If we had taken the disaster portions out of the supplemental appropriations bill and passed them alone, we would have lost our leverage.' 
What kind of leverage is it that they are talking about, do you think? The leverage to pass an amendment that they have stuck on that bill which has nothing to do with the disaster. It has to do with Government shutdowns--very controversial amendment--and has no relationship to a disaster bill. But they stuck it on there knowing they could hold hostage thousands of victims of these floods, and that is exactly what happened. 
We have come to the end of this week, and the other body decided it doesn't have time; they were unwilling to pass a disaster bill. 
I have been around this institution for some long while, first in the House of Representatives and now in the Senate. There is not a precedent for this. Nowhere that I know of is there a precedent for a disaster bill, when people have suffered in a region of this country, for someone else to say, `Oh, by the way, I know this is a disaster, so I am going to stick this on my agenda, and either you pass it that way or it doesn't get passed.' At no time that I know of has someone in Congress said to those who suffered earthquakes in California or floods along the Mississippi in 1993 or tornadoes or fires, never have I heard the Congress say, `And, by the way, yes, we're in the business of disaster relief, but we want to stick extraneous amendments on which are controversial, and we are willing to play with the threat of a veto by a President because we're not so concerned about the victims of a disaster.' 
Some have said, `Well, it's not urgent; it can wait a couple of weeks.' Let me describe for my colleagues why it is urgent and why what the House has done, if it continues to do it--and it looks like it will--why it is significant to the people of our region. 
The money in this bill, $500 million for Community Development 
Block Grants, which is the most flexible money available to help rebuild and recover, cannot be made available, cannot be obligated and cannot be committed by these cities to say to those folks who lost everything, and lost their homes especially, that `here is our new floodplain, here is where we are going to buy out the homes, here is a commitment we will buy out your home, and now you can start building anew.' This delays that. It delays recovery. It delays rebuilding. It delays repair. And delay is critical in our part of the country. 
We have a very short construction season. This 2-week delay, 4-week delay, or 6-week delay, whatever it turns out to be, is a devastating delay to people who are not in their homes and who are awaiting answers from local officials about what will happen to the home that is already destroyed. 
So, Mr. President, there is no excuse for what has happened. I want to make it clear that the Senate Appropriations Committee created a disaster portion of this bill that is a wonderful, wonderful response to the people of our region. 
I commend Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd and all of the people who worked together to do that. That is not where the problem is. They are to be complimented. The problem exists because we had some folks on the other side of the Capitol who said, `We don't care. We're leaving. We've got a plane ticket and a ride out of town.' 
I ask those who are now on their way, if they have the time in the next week when the Congress is on recess, to stop by Grand Forks, ND. I just finished talking to the mayor. There is a line of people outside the civic center, and every single one of them is asking, `What is happening to the funding? Do you have the ability to commit so we know if there is going to be a buyout of our house? Do you have some commitment to rebuild?' Every one of them is asking, `When will we know?' 
To those who believe it is important to go on recess and ignore the needs of people in a disaster, I say, `Stop by Grand Forks and explain to those folks why that was their priority.' 
This disaster portion of this bill is a good portion of the bill. The Senator from Washington is here. He serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee with me. All of it with respect to disaster is now agreed to--all of it. I compliment every member of that committee because they have done a wonderful job. It simply could have been lifted out and passed so at least the disaster portion is available, because we did it and did it right. Republicans and Democrats working together did it right. 
But what happened was, last evening, some folks on the other side said, `We're sorry, we're just not going to do that, we're going home.' And if I sound a little angry--I guess that is probably an appropriate word to describe it. I don't think that I ought to stand here and say, `Well, that's the way the system works.' I represent thousands of people who don't have a home, thousands of people who don't have much hope, thousands of people who are asking for help. And I think it is unconscionable that anyone on that side of the Capitol believes it is appropriate to leave those people high and dry without an answer, without hope, and without help. 
Oh, yes, it is going to come, and when it comes, I am going to be thankful that it is there. But, between now and then, it is delayed--delay of recovery, delay of rebuilding and delay of providing hope that we should well provide to the people of that region. There hasn't been one instance since I have been in Congress that I have not been the first to say, `Sign me up' when there is an earthquake in California that devastates that region. I say it is our job, yes, our job as North Dakota taxpayers to say to them, `We want to help you.' 
The same is true of every region of the country that has suffered disaster. It is important for us to reach out and help, and it is especially important now when we need help for the rest of the country to do that. The Senate Appropriations Committee was prepared to do it and had written a piece to do it. Regrettably, it is Friday afternoon, and it now looks like there will be a recess without disaster aid going to people who will not be sleeping in their bed--not a hundred of them, not a thousand of them, but thousands and thousands--who the mayors of these cities say await word of when this help is coming. 
I don't know if there is going to be other news today on this subject, but I hope some way is found and that this will not be the final message as this Congress leaves for the Memorial Day recess. If it is, I pledge to be on the floor the first time this Congress reconvenes to say to my colleagues that now is the time to at least pass the disaster portion of this bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today we are considering Senate Resolution 57, a resolution commemorating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 
The resolution asks public officials and other citizens to support, promote, and participate in the many bicentennial activities celebrating the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The resolution also expresses its support for the events to be held in observance of the expedition at St. Louis, MO, in 2004, at Bismarck, ND, in 2005, in Hohenwald, TN, at the Meriwether Lewis National Monument, and in many cities during the bicentennial celebration. It further commends the work of the National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council, Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, public and private groups, and individuals that are preparing bicentennial activities to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during the years 2004 through 2006. 
Senate Resolution 57 notes that the Lewis and Clark Expedition was one of the most remarkable and productive scientific and military expeditions in American history. President Thomas Jefferson directed that scientific, biological, geographic, and ethnographic information about the territory west of the Mississippi be gathered and reported. In `Undaunted Courage,' Stephan E. Ambrose wrote that President Jefferson directed that the first purpose of the expedition was `to find the shortest & most convenient route of communication between the U.S. and the Pacific ocean, within the temperate latitudes.' 
After months of preparing for the journey into unknown territory, including learning celestial navigation, gathering equipment, and choosing men for the expedition, Meriwether Lewis and and his co-captain William Clark began their journey west of the Mississippi at Wood River, IL, on May 14, 1804. The 40-person expedition wintered near Fort Mandan, ND, reached Fort Clatsop on the Pacific Ocean near present day Astoria, OR, and returned to St. Louis, MO, on September 23, 1806. Their 28-month journey covered 8,000 miles and traversed 11 future States: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. 
The maps prepared on the expedition and the journals kept by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark carefully document their discoveries. The Lewis and Clark Expedition encountered and documented diverse American Indian people, languages, customs, religious beliefs, and ceremonies. The native 
American Indian tribes of the Northern Plains and the Pacific Northwest played an essential role in the survival and success of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 
On their safe return to St. Louis, Lewis and Clark reported to Jefferson: 
In obedience to your orders we have penetrated the Continent of North America to the Pacific Ocean, and sufficiently explored the interior of the country to affirm with confidence that we have discovered the most practicable rout (sic) which does exist across the continent by means of the navigable branches of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers. 
The National Park Service [NPS] also observes that: 
The Lewis and Clark Expedition was one of the most dramatic and significant episodes in the history of the United States. It stands, incomparably, as our Nation's epic in documented exploration of the American West. During 1804-06, it carried the destiny, as well as the flag, of our young Nation westward from the Mississippi across thousands of miles of uncharted lands to the Pacific Ocean. 
NPS goes on to say that: 
In its scope and achievements, the Expedition towers among the major explorations in the history of the world. Its findings contributed vital new knowledge concerning the resources and inhabitants of the lands west of the Mississippi River. The resulting geopolitical impact of the mission had far-reaching effects upon international boundaries and relations. 
The President and the Congress have previously recognized the importance of the Lewis and Clark Expedition by establishing a 5-year commission in 1964 to study the history and route of the expedition, and again in 1978 by designating the route as the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the National Park Service. 
Also, this resolution, which recognizes American heroes of the past, will help to bring history alive and enhance tourism along the Lewis and Clark trail. In North Dakota, the Lewis and Clark Visitor Center will celebrate its grand opening and dedication with activities June 6-8, 1997, in Washburn, so I appreciate that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has advanced this resolution in a timely way. 
I appreciate the support of the National Park Service and my colleagues in celebrating the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. I particularly appreciate as cosponsors Senators Murkowski, Bumpers, Thomas, Craig, Akaka, Smith of Oregon, Gorton, Johnson, Conrad, Burns, Reid, Thompson, Daschle, Frist, Kerrey, Bond, Murray, Cochran, Moseley-Braun, Ashcroft, and Coverdell. 
Mr. President, I urge all members of the Senate to vote in favor of Senate Resolution 57.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his courtesy. I wanted to speak for a couple of minutes on the resolution itself that is brought to the floor of the Senate. I want to talk just for a moment about what it is and what it is not. 
This piece of legislation is a budget agreement that I intend to vote for on final passage. I think a substantial amount of work has been done by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the ranking member, and many others in the House and the Senate and in the White House. They have negotiated in very difficult circumstances the terms of a budget agreement. But, as I said, I want to talk about what this is and what it is not. 
This is a budget agreement that provides a balanced budget of the unified budget. Is that something that has merit? Yes, it is. Is that something that moves in the right direction? Yes, it does. But it is not a balanced budget amendment that balances the budget without the use of trust funds, such as the Social Security fund. I want everybody to be clear about that. 
On page 4 of this budget resolution, which is on the desks of all Senators, it says `deficit.' On line 24, it says `deficit' in the year 2002, `$108 billion.' Why does it say that? 
It says that because this piece of legislation balances what is called the unified budget. Many of us believe there is another step to be taken after that. That is to balance the budget without the use of trust funds, especially without the use of Social Security trust funds. 
For that reason, I voted for the initiative offered yesterday by the Senator from South Carolina. It got very few votes, I might say. But he said, let us balance the budget and not do tax cuts and not do added investments at the start so that we balance the budget completely without using the trust fund, and then, as the economy strengthens and as we have extra money, let us provide for the tax cuts and let us provide for the added investments. Obviously, that proposal failed. 
I will vote for this budget agreement. But it is not truly a balanced budget. It moves in the direction, and it moves the right way. But it will leave this country, still, with a deficit. That must be the next step following action on this document. 
There are several steps here in climbing a flight of stairs to get to the point where we make real progress. One step we took in 1993. I was one who voted for the budget in 1993. I am glad I did. I said at the time it was a very controversial vote. It passed by one vote in the U.S. Senate--a budget agreement to substantially reduce the Federal budget deficit. It passed by one vote, the vote of the Vice President of the United States. 
Some paid a very heavy price for that vote because it was controversial. It cut spending. And, yes, it raised some taxes. But what was the result of that vote in 1993? The result was a dramatically reduced budget deficit. 
In that year, the unified budget deficit was close to $290 billion. Again, using the unified budget, the Congressional Budget Office now says the unified budget deficit is going to be, at the end of year, $67 billion. 
What has caused all of that? Well, a good economy and a 1993 budget act that a lot of people here had the courage to vote for, that passed by one vote, that says, let's put us moving in the right direction; let's move us in the right direction to substantially reduce the budget deficit. And only with that vote, and only with the progress that came from that vote, are we now able to take another very large step in moving toward a balanced budget. 
What was the result of that vote? It was interesting. We had people in 1993 on the floor of the Senate who said, if you cast a `yes' vote and pass this budget, the economy will collapse; the country will go into a recession; it means higher deficits and a higher debt; it means the economy goes into a tailspin. 
It passed with my vote--and, yes, the votes of some of my colleagues who decided to say to this country that we are serious, that we are going to move this country in the right direction even if the choice is painful for us to cast this vote. 
What happened? What happened was 4 years of sustained economic growth, inflation coming down, down, down, and down, and unemployment coming down and down for 4 years in a row. We have more people working. This country now has 12 million more people on the payrolls that we did in 1993. We have an economy that is moving ahead, a deficit that is moving down, and inflation that is at a 30-year low. 
I wonder if those who predicted doom from that vote now won't join us and say, `You did the right thing. It wasn't easy to do. But because you did it, we stand here today now able to take the next step.' The next step is a step in which we now try to choose priorities. 
What do we make investments on in our country, and where do we cut real levels of spending? 
That is what this document is about. It is a compromise between Republicans and Democrats, between a President and Congress, that tries to establish priorities. Frankly, while it reduces spending in some areas, it cuts out entire classes of spending in others. It also increases some investment in spending in yet other areas. 
What are those? Education: It makes a lot of sense for us even as we attempt to move toward solving this country's fiscal problems to say that we don't solve the problems of the future by retreating on things like educating our kids. 
So this piece of legislation says education is a priority--more Pell grants, more Head Start, more investing in education, from young kids to college age and beyond. It says we are going to invest in education. 
Then it says the environment and health care. It says these areas are priorities. They are areas that make this country strong, and we will continue to invest in those areas even as we move to reconcile our books so that we are not spending more than we take in. 
That is why this is important, and it is why it is successful. I am pleased, frankly, after all of these years, to be on the floor of the Senate saying this is something that is bipartisan. Finally, Republicans and Democrats, rather than exerting all of their energy to fight each other and beat each other, are deciding there are ways that we can join each other and pass a piece of legislation that moves this country in the right direction. I think the American people probably think it is a pretty good thing that bipartisanship comes to the floor of the Senate in the form of this budget resolution. 
I started by saying I would talk about what this is and what it isn't. I am going to vote for this. It moves this country in the right direction. It preserves priorities that are important to preserve, and investment in this country's future. It represents a compromise. Many of us would have written it differently. We didn't get all we wanted. But it moves this country in the right direction while preserving the kinds of things most of us think are important as investments in our country's future. 
This is not a balanced budget, not truly a balanced budget. It balances something called the unified budget. But it is a major step in the right direction. I hope we will take the next step beyond this to say that, on page 4 of the next budget resolution, line 24, we will say `zero' in a future year. That is when we will truly have completed the job. 
But the choices here are not always choices we would like. The choice that we now ask ourselves is, does this move us in the right direction with respect to the things I care a great deal about--one, fiscal discipline; a more deficit reduction; investment in education, health care, the environment--things that make this country a better place? The answer, unequivocally, is yes. This moves America in the right direction. 
Is it an exercise between the President and Congress, between Democrats and Republicans, that will give this country some confidence that the past is over, that the reckless, the irresponsible fiscal policy of saying let's spend money we don't have on things we don't need and run up trillions and trillions of dollars of debt for our kids and our grandkids to assume? Is it a message to the American people that we are beyond that period and have moved on to a new day of bipartisanship to decide together we can plot a better course and move this country toward a brighter future? The answer to that is yes. 
If the past is any experience, since 1993, the vote we took then to put us on the road to balancing this budget is a proud vote and one that I am glad I cast. I will be glad I cast this vote as well, because this is the next major segment of the journey to do what the American people want us to do on their behalf and on behalf of so many children who will inherit this country. They will inherit a better country because of what we will have done in this Chamber this week. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the fact we are on a very important amendment the Senator from Minnesota is offering. I am increasingly concerned this afternoon. It is now 5:30 in the afternoon. As the Senator from Minnesota knows, a number of us in this Chamber have been working on a disaster supplemental bill providing disaster relief in an appropriations bill for people who have been involved in disasters, and we are nearing a point in time when time will run out on the passage of the bill. And some say, well, maybe the disaster bill will not be passed before the Senate goes out for the Memorial Day recess. Some others say, well, maybe not only will we not pass the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that we have been working on for weeks, but we will not pass the emergency portion of it. 
I ask the Senator from Minnesota, is it not the case that in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks we have 10,000, 15,000 people who are waking up not in their own beds because they are homeless and a disaster bill must be passed? We cannot adjourn this session of Congress and take a recess unless a disaster bill is passed that deals with these critically needed funds. We have victims of floods and fires and blizzards out there who are waiting for a disaster bill to be passed. I am not suggesting here anyone is to blame for anything. I am just saying in the waning hours, we need to find a way to bring a disaster bill to the floor of the Senate. 
Is it not the case we have thousands of people homeless in your area, East Grand Forks, and in Grand Forks who are awaiting some word about whether a disaster bill is going to be passed?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the disasters that have occurred in our country that now result in a requirement to pass a disaster bill have been the most significant disasters that occurred in North Dakota statehood: 3 years worth of snow in 3 months; a 500-year flood in the Red River; thousands and thousands of people homeless, still homeless. 
I appreciate very much the cooperation that we have seen here in the U.S. Senate in trying to write a disaster bill. We got one out of committee and got into conference. I am a conferee. I know a lot of Members of the Senate--the chairman of the committee, the ranking member, and others--have been working hard to get this done. 
I do not know what is happening on the other side, but I know this: If the result of the coming hours will be that there are those who want to adjourn the Congress and go on a Memorial Day recess and decide that it is all right later to pass some kind of disaster relief bill, I will say to them, it is not all right with this Senator and not all right with a number of others, because people awaiting disaster relief are going to understand that this Senate has an obligation to do it. 
We must not and cannot take a Memorial Day recess until we have addressed the disaster needs of victims who have suffered now for weeks. 
In Grand Forks alone, nearly 15,000 of whom are still homeless, we do not need those folks to be looking at the Congress and saying `Why? Why on Earth were we not able to get the help we were promised and help that was needed?' I want them at the end of this session to be able to say thanks to Members of Congress who worked hard to say to them, `You're not alone. Here's some help. Here's some help to reconstruct and recover.' I want them to say thanks for that. 
But I just say to my colleagues, I do not quite know where we are. I worry about some of the things I am hearing in the last hour or so. At the end of this process, we must have passed some kind of disaster relief bill. This Congress cannot--cannot--possibly adjourn for the Memorial Day recess and leave the victims of those disasters wanting and needing help that will not come. 
So I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota yielding.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Minnesota, I appreciate your yielding to me. 
The flood that occurred--let me take Grand Forks and East Grand Forks to discuss why we have the need for an emergency response here. 
The Red River flood was a flood that became 150 miles by 40 miles nearly. You could not see a river; it became a huge lake in the Red River Valley. But the point of it all is this. When this flood came--let me just use Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, represented by Senator Grams and Senator Wellstone who worked so hard on this. Nine thousand people--when those dams broke and that water came rushing down the streets, the people got out of their houses, in most cases with only the clothes on their backs. They rushed to the end of the streets, were pulled up by National Guard trucks and by other devices, and they lost their homes, lost their vehicles. 
Then we saw them at a hangar, big aircraft hangar out at the Grand Forks Air Force base sleeping on cots--4,000 of them from every other small town for 100 miles around. 
In Grand Forks, 50,000 people, 90 percent of the town was flooded. I was in a boat of the Coast Guard in the main street of Grand Forks, ND. You would hit a car. You could not see the car. All you could see was 2 inches of the top of the radio antenna. 
In the downtown, a major fire destroyed 11 of the huge buildings in downtown Grand Forks in the historic district. 
In the middle of all of this, with two cities evacuated, we had the head of FEMA come to our region, James Lee Witt, and say, `We're going to help you.' We had the Vice President come to our region and say, `You're not alone.' We had President Clinton in Air Force One fly into Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and put his arm around some of those victims living in that aircraft hangar, and he said, `We're with you. The rest of the country wants to extend a helping hand and say you're not alone.' 
We have had enormous cooperation from everybody. In this Chamber, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the ranking member and the subcommittees have done a remarkable job of saying to us, `We want to help you.' And they put in the disaster supplemental bill the resources that were needed. Congratulations to them. Every single one of them have come to us and said, `We want to help you.' And they provided the resources in this bill here in the Senate that we then sent to conference. 
What a remarkable effort by the Members of the Senate on a bipartisan basis. Then we went to conference. In fact, all of the disaster issues that are important to us to provide the necessary resources in conference are now agreed to. We do not have any outstanding issues. They are agreed to. 
Why is it important that this get done? Because in the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks--the Red River runs in the middle of those two cities--they have to establish a new floodway. When they establish a new floodway, it means 
there will be hundreds and hundreds of homes that will no longer be able to be located there. Most of them are now destroyed anyway. In order to describe the new floodway and have a buyout of those homes, those mayors need to have the resources to begin that process now. 
Today, they do not have the resources, so those hundreds of families--well over 1,000, incidentally, are near and in that floodway--they now cannot be told by anyone, will their home be there or will it not be there? Will it be bought out or not? No one knows and no one can know until the resources are available to have that buyout. That is why this is urgent. If it waits 1 week or 2 weeks, they cannot make those decisions. Those folks can never move back into their homes. They cannot move back into their homes. 
So anybody who says, `This is not urgent. It can wait. It can wait 1 week or 2 weeks,' let me give them the names of the young boys and the young girls who will sleep on cots, sleep in shelters, sleep in strange homes during those 2 weeks, part of which Congress will have been in recess. And then have them send them a letter to say, you know, we just could not get this done. 
Not getting it done is not acceptable. We have done our work. The disaster supplemental is largely agreed to in all of these areas. We must at a minimum take that out of the disaster supplemental, those resources that are necessary to help those people, and pass that on an emergency basis. The failure to do that--a decision, for example, by the other body to say we will not do that, we are going to take a recess, will be a devastating blow to people who do not deserve that, having been victimized by these disasters. 
So the Senator from Minnesota has been generous in yielding for a question. I just make the point that this Congress cannot adjourn without addressing the emergency needs of this disaster. 
Do I feel passionate about this? You're darn right I do. I am not going to let 15,000 people who are not yet back into their homes be told that Congress took a break for Memorial Day and the people who are homeless can wait a couple of weeks for a solution to this problem. I will not be a part of that kind of decision. 
So if there are those who think that any adjournment resolution will pass by this Congress failing to pass an emergency bill dealing with this disaster, it is going to be a long, long few days. 
I ask for the cooperation of everyone. We have had wonderful cooperation of Republicans and Democrats, and I might say in the Senate I cannot feel prouder of all the people I have worked with on the Appropriations Committee. I will just encourage and urge everyone involved in this process to decide and determine that we must get this done. 
I appreciate very much the Senator yielding. I understand that you have an important amendment and I apologize for intervening on that, but I think this message must be understood. This is not an option. We must pass a disaster relief bill.

<TEXT>
Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday I voted for an amendment offered by Senator Hollings. I would like to take a brief moment to explain my vote. 
Senator Hollings is absolutely right in his contention about this budget agreement. The so-called balanced budget agreement that has been hammered out by the White House and the Congress does not, in fact, balance the budget. 
While the agreement purports to balance the budget, I would urge my colleagues to look at page 4 of the budget resolution, which will put the agreement into effect. It says, in section 101(4) of the resolution, that the budget will be $108 billion in deficit in the year 2002. Why is that the case? Because they are claiming a balanced budget using a `unified budget,' which means they can count the Social Security surpluses to offset other deficits. 
However, as I have said in previous debates, using the Social Security surplus creates a deficit for our future. The surplus that is accrued in the year 2002 in the Social Security accounts is needed in the following decades to fund the retirement needs of the baby boom generation. If that money is now used as an offset against other spending to balance the budget, it will not be there when it is needed to meet Social Security needs in future years. 
The way to balance the budget in a real and honest way is to do as Senator Hollings suggests. We must make spending cuts that are necessary and delay both the tax cuts and the spending increases in specific accounts until there is room in the budget to accomplish them while still balancing the budget in a real way. 
Robust economic growth is driving the budget deficit down substantially. I think there will ultimately be room for some tax cuts and for some targeted investment increases in certain areas, such as education, health care and the environment. But the priority ought to be to balance the budget first and do it fully and completely by reaching a budget deficit of zero in 2002 without using the Social Security trust funds. Then, as the economy continues to grow, added revenue will allow us to both provide needed tax cuts as well as targeted investments in critical accounts. Not many Members of the Senate voted for the Hollings amendment, because most want to rush to provide tax cuts now and to provide spending increases in certain accounts now. But if we do that there is no guarantee that we will truly reach an honest balanced budget in the near term. 
Unfortunately, the Hollings amendment failed. It failed by a large margin. However, as the budget process continues, I intend to work as best I can to advance deficit reduction. The resolution we are debating does move in the right direction. While it is not a balanced budget plan, it is a deficit reduction plan. It does achieve $204 billion of deficit reduction. And for that reason, I think it's better to support this negotiated agreement. At least this agreement makes some progress. 
To sum up, I would have felt better if this agreement had delayed both the tax cuts and spending increases until the budget is truly balanced. While this agreement provides hope for those of us who want the deficit cut, and who want the budget balanced, it also serves up the dessert before the main course. It requires less discipline than we need. I still believe that we should continue to work to do more than just balance the unified budget. Balancing the unified budget will still leave this country with a budget deficit.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I supported passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it was considered during the 104th Congress and I supported overriding the President's veto of that measure. Today, I again voted in favor of this legislation. 
My position on abortion issues is clear. I have consistently stated that I would not support overturning the Supreme Court's decision in Roe versus Wade. I support a women's right to have an abortion. I do not think we should turn back the clock and make abortion illegal, but we should work in every way to reduce the number of abortions that are performed. 
I have also cast votes in Congress in opposition to using Federal funds to pay for abortions except in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest. 
Today, the Senate again voted on legislation which would prohibit a physician from performing partial-birth abortions, a procedure in which a fetus is delivered into the birth canal before its skull is collapsed and delivery is completed. This legislation contains a provision which would make an exception for partial-birth abortions that are necessary to save the life of the mother in cases in which no other medical procedure would suffice. 
After careful thought about this issue, I have concluded that I simply cannot justify the use of this specific procedure to terminate pregnancies in which the mother's life is not at stake. For this reason, I voted to support the ban on partial-birth abortions, and I hope that the President will reconsider his decision to veto this measure and sign it into law.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the description of the bill by my colleague from Minnesota. I think it is safe to say there is no one in the Chamber who really 
doesn't subscribe to the notion that there ought to be greater flexibility in the workplace, and that there is merit to giving an employee the opportunity to decide whether they want comptime as opposed to overtime. I don't think there is much disagreement about that issue. 
But I ask the Senator from Minnesota, is it the case that, when we talk about overtime pay for American workers, 80 percent of the workers in this country that are getting overtime pay are workers earning less than $28,000 a year? Then therefore, by definition, these are workers somewhere toward the lower end of the economic scale who get less than $28,000 a year, and many of them rely on overtime pay. They need it. It is very important to them. 
To the extent that anybody opposes a bill that says let's provide flexibility in the workplace in a manner that might threaten the opportunity for those who want and need the overtime pay, especially those at the bottom of the pay scale, boy, that is not moving in the right direction in terms of providing flexibility. 
Is it the case that the preponderance of people getting overtime in the workplace are people below $28,000 a year?

Mr. DORGAN. Isn't it the case that the bill that was brought to the floor says to you, if you are an employer and you have somebody working for you making $14,000 a year, working hard, working two 40-hour weeks, `By the way, we will give you some flexibility; you can tell that worker next week that they are going to work 60 hours, and that you can let them work fewer hours the week after, so as long as it adds up to 80 hours, whatever the requirement of work for the first time?'

Mr. DORGAN. One additional question: There is a way to do what people have said needs doing, and what, I think, needs doing; that is, honestly provide greater flexibility. If people want to take comptime instead of overtime, there certainly is a way to do that without potentially hurting people at the lower end of the economic ladder. Isn't that the case?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor, and was interested in the comments offered by my colleague from Minnesota. I agree with his comments. That has been the issue on the floor of the Senate for the last couple of weeks. I expect we will have more debate on it. But I came to talk about several other issues, and I would like to take the time to make some points to my colleagues that are important to me, to my home State of North Dakota, and to others. 
So let me begin talking about the first of the three issues.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first is the disaster appropriations bill. 
Last week the Senate passed an appropriations bill to provide supplemental appropriations for the disasters that have occurred in our country, and it is especially important to me and to our region. 
This bill would provide substantial amounts of resources and money for people who have been victims of the disaster in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. 
I am enormously impressed that the House of Representatives last evening passed a disaster bill that contains almost identical amounts of money for the disaster relief that we put in here in the Senate. We added $500 million to the bill--$100 million that the President requested be added, and $400 million above that for what is called community development block grants. That represents the most flexible of Federal spending that goes to State and local governments. It provides great flexibility for them. It is packaged in a way that helps them resolve their problems and help their people who are victims of the disaster. 
While I am very pleased of the actions of the House last evening, we now go to conference. I will be a conferee because I am on the Senate Appropriations Committee. But we go to conference with a bill that has awfully good news in it for victims of the disaster in our region of the country. But the bill also contains a very controversial amendment that has nothing to do with this bill. This is an amendment that has to do with ending Government shutdowns at the end of the fiscal year if the appropriations bills are not passed on time. They are called continuing resolutions. CR's, they are called. 
This disaster appropriations bill contains an amendment, dealing with the continuing resolution which is very controversial. The President said long ago would this amendment require him to veto the bill, if it is in the bill. And, nonetheless, the Senate has passed the bill and the House has passed a bill that constrains this very controversial amendment. 
I hope very much that this weekend, and in the early days of next week, as we work through this conference, that we can convince all of the people who are interested in this bill that the best interest of the people of the region who are victims of the disaster will be served by removing from this bill these amendments that have nothing to do with the disaster appropriations bill. 
We should not in any way attempt to delay or derail a disaster bill with extraneous amendments. It just shouldn't be done. I have not done it in the past. I have voted for disaster funds to help people who have been victims of floods, fires, tornadoes, blizzards, earthquakes, and I have been pleased to vote for those because I think it is important for people all over this country to extend a helping hand to those who are victims of a disaster. But I don't think it is appropriate for Members of Congress to decide this is a bill which is critical and important, that provides needed help to victims, and, therefore, because it is a bill that 
the President somehow must sign, they should put a controversial amendment on it that has nothing to do with the bill. That is exactly what has happened. 
I ask, with great respect to all of those involved in that effort to decide to do something different, to withdraw that amendment from this bill. Let's pass this bill out of conference, send it back to the House and to the Senate, and then to the President in a manner so that he can sign it. 
Why on Earth would the Congress include something in a bill that they know the President is going to veto, and thereby just create a delay in the aid to victims? 
There are thousands of North Dakotans and Minnesotans who woke up this morning not in their own beds and not in their own homes. They are homeless. It has been weeks since this flood of a 500-year level hit the Red River and evacuated 95 percent of the people in the city of 50,000, Grand Forks, ND. On the other side of the river, 100 percent of the city of East Grand Forks, MN, some 9,000 people were evacuated from their homes. 
In Grand Forks, ND, alone, somewhere between 600 and 800 homes are destroyed. No one will move back into those homes. They are destroyed. Another perhaps 1,000 homes are severely damaged. Where are those families today? They are not home today. They are victims living with relatives, some in shelters, many in other towns struggling to try to figure out what they do and how they put together the pieces. Many people live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to try to figure out how they pay the bills. 
Many businesses are not open in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks because much of the town is still uninhabited. People do not have jobs. People do not know how they are going to pay their bills. Yes, FEMA is helping. FEMA is writing checks and helping people with their immediate needs. But these are victims of a disaster. They need help, and they don't need people to play a game with a disaster appropriations bill by adding an extraneous amendment that has nothing to do with the bill in a way that will delay and jeopardize the bill. 
I ask all of those who are involved in that, don't do that. Bring your proposal up next week or the week after. It doesn't matter to me. Let's debate it. You have every right to bring any idea to the floor of the Senate and have a debate on it. But don't delay or jeopardize the disaster bill. It is fundamentally unfair to people this morning who still woke up without a home and without a job wondering what their future holds and looking to us for some hope. 
I have shown the pictures before. But I think it is important to do it again. Let me explain how we got where we are so that you understand the dimensions of it. 
We had 3 years' worth of snow in 3 months in my State. This is a snowbank. This happens to be flat ground. There is a farmer in front of a snowbank. It gives you a little idea of how high those snowbanks became in the middle of our blizzards in North Dakota. That is about an 18-foot snowbank. 
There were anywhere from six to nine serious blizzards, most of which closed down most of the roads in North Dakota. Some of them closed down every road in North Dakota. We had whiteout conditions. You could not see your hand in front of your face. The last blizzard, incidentally, was anywhere from 18 to 24 inches of snow dumped in about 48 hours on top of the record snowfall we had previously. So we had about 9 to 10 feet of snow in North Dakota during this winter. Then what we had was a rapid spring melt in which all of this snowpack melted down. The Red River on the eastern side of our State is one of the few rivers that runs north. This river ran right into an ice pack up in Canada. We had this massive melt that created not a river but created a lake out of the Red River. And, this lake was 150 miles long by about 20 to 30 miles wide. 
The result was that a massive quantity of water became a giant, coursing stream through Wahpeton, Breckenridge, Fargo, Moorhead, Grand Forks, and East Grand Forks. They were fighting floods in 80 locations in our region. The head of the Corps of Engineers said that he has never seen that kind of effort by local people to fight a flood. It was the most extraordinary effort he had ever seen. 
Down in Wahpeton and Breckenridge, they won some and lost some battles. Up in Fargo, they largely won the battle after very tense nights and days. In Grand Forks, the flood prediction was set at 49 feet, the highest flood in the history of the Red River in Grand Forks. But the flood that came was 54 feet. It broke the dike and inundated the town. 
I traveled throughout Grand Forks. I viewed Main Street, downtown Grand Forks, and all of the neighborhoods in a Coast Guard boat. 
Take a look at the farms in the Red River Valley. This is a picture of a farm. It does not look like it. It looks like a building surrounded by a lake but it is farmland. We had 1.7 million acres under water. 
Then there were dead cattle. We lost somewhere around 150,000 head of cattle. A fellow who had just come from North Dakota told me yesterday. He was in town the day before and visiting with a fellow rancher, and the rancher said he had to go home and shoot some more calves. These young calves were born during calving season. Now their hooves were falling off. Their feet were falling off because they had been frozen. Farmers and ranchers lost some 150,000 head of cattle that were killed as a result of these storms. 
We had farmers calling radio stations saying they had lost their entire herd of cattle. They asked if anybody had seen their herd of cattle. There were dairy cows with udders frozen. In the last storm, which was the worst storm in 50 years, came in the middle of calving season. The Senator from Kansas knows very well about weather problems during calving season. 
So that is what people were confronted with. When the flood came, it inundated Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, and the towns were evacuated. In the midst of the flood, the downtown section of Grand Forks caught on fire. We had fire fighters in Grand Forks, as you can see from this picture, waist deep in ice cold water, some suffering hypothermia, fighting a fire. In the early stages they were fighting with fire extinguishers because they could not get pumper trucks in because of the flood. These are heroes. These folks who fought that fire are true heroes. We lost parts of three blocks of downtown Grand Forks, including 11 of the wonderful old historic buildings. That part of the historic city of Grand Forks burned to the ground. 
That is what was faced in this set of disasters. These are the victims up and down the Red River Valley who today wait for a message of hope from the Congress. They wait for the disaster bill that both the House and the Senate have now enacted that will go to conference. They wait for the President's signature on a bill that provides much-needed help to these victims. 
It is critically important that those who have now added an 
amendment, which has nothing to do with this bill and that is very controversial, decide to withdraw it. 
Mr. President, all of us are proud of our States, all of us are proud of where we come from. I am enormously proud to be a North Dakotan, and I feel privileged every day I get up and come to work to represent North Dakota in the Senate. The most important thing I have done in my life, I guess, is representing North Dakotans in the Senate. It will undoubtedly be one of the most wonderful privileges I will have had in my lifetime when my service here is through. 
I do not, and have not in my years in both the House and Senate come to the Chambers of Congress asking for special help for our region. But, if ever a region needed help, our region does now. It is almost unprecedented that major communities in our country had to be evacuated. Now weeks after the evacuation, the communities are still not very functional. People are still homeless. People are still jobless. 
None of us quite knows the menu of exactly how you put all this back together. How do you restart an economy that was stopped dead still? How do you give hope to men and women who had a small business somewhere and have now lost all their inventory, and lost their building? Their business is gone and they have no money. How do you restore their hopes and dreams? 
How about a rancher or a farmer whose land is totally under water and who lost their entire herd of cows and calves? They wonder what will they do next? This is a case where our region needs help. 
We are a generous people in North Dakota, and we have always been the first to help. Just as America is a generous nation, and been the first almost anywhere in the world to offer help to people who need help. We have done the same in North Dakota to offer help to victims of hurricanes and earthquakes and floods elsewhere. 
This is a time that I am proud of Members of Congress for standing up in the Senate and in the House saying that we want to offer a package of help that in the bill passed by the Senate totaled somewhere close to $1.2-$1.3 billion of help for that region. It included $500 million of community development block grants which are the most flexible kind of resources available. I am enormously proud that Members of the House and Senate have done that. Now if we can do one more thing that will make me proud, it will be for those who have offered the controversial amendment that will attract a veto to this bill to decide it is not the right thing to do. This is not the right bill to do it on. It is not fair for the people of this region to do it now. It is time for them to decide to withdraw this amendment. Then we can have the conference, and get a bill we can send to the President and have the President sign it. Then this critically needed assistance can flow to people of our region. It will be, I think, a very proud moment for all of Congress. I hope that will be the case in the coming days.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to mention quickly two other subjects. The first is a letter that I have sent to the President with my colleague from Maine, Senator Olympia Snowe, about the issue of fast-track trade authority, and then, second, I would like to offer a comment about the budget agreement. 
First, on the issue of fast-track trade authority, Mr. President, Senator Olympia Snowe and I have sent a letter to President Clinton indicating to him that we do not believe it is appropriate to extend fast-track trade authority and that we would oppose the extension of fast-track trade authority. 
This may not mean much to a lot of folks. Fast-track trade authority is a kind of inside baseball term, I suppose, for Members of Congress. What is fast-track authority? Fast track is a trade procedure by which the Congress says to an administration, any administration, you go out and negotiate a trade agreement with some other country or group of countries, and then the trade agreement is brought back to the Senate or the House and must be 
considered on something called fast track. This means the Senate and House must vote on it up or down with no opportunity to amend it. Fast track means no opportunity to amend it. You bring it to the Senate. The Senate votes yes or no, and that is the end of it. 
We do not use fast-track authority on the arms control agreements. We did not have fast-track authority on the chemical weapons treaty that this Senate passed a couple of weeks ago. Only on trade agreements do we have what is called fast track. It is fundamentally undemocratic, in my judgment. 
The reason I do not support fast track and the extension of fast-track authority is fast track has been the wrong track for this country. I urge my colleagues to take a look at our trade deficit. We talk about eliminating the budget deficit, and there is great merit in that, and I am going to be supportive of that. 
What about the other deficit? What about the trade deficit, which is the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country right now? This is the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country, and you do not hear a word about it, not a word. We have had trade agreement after trade agreement, and guess what. After every trade agreement, we have greater hemorrhaging of red ink and greater trade deficits. 
This is a chart that shows those trade deficits. We had the Tokyo round in 1981. That year we had a $28 billion merchandise trade deficit. Then we went out and we added the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, and that year we had a $115 billion trade deficit. Then there was NAFTA. Then it was the Uruguay round. Every time we have a new trade agreement, our trade deficit increases. 
I would like to get the names and pictures of those folks who are negotiating these things and ask them, by what standard do you view success? Is it successful to have successive trade agreements that mean this country goes deeper into merchandise trade debt? I do not think so. That is not how I would define success. 
This is a chart which shows what has happened with our two neighbors. First we had the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Then we had the North American Free-Trade Agreement, called NAFTA, with Canada and Mexico, and the Mexico Free Trade Agreement. 
Guess what has happened. Before we had the trade agreement with our neighbors, we had a trade surplus with Mexico. Then we go off and negotiate a trade agreement with the Mexicans and the Canadians. Now we have a combined deficit that totals nearly $40 billion. 
Look what has happened to the trade deficit with Mexico and Canada. We had a $2 billion surplus with Mexico in 1993. Now we have a $16 billion deficit. We had all these economists who said, if we would just do this, we would get 250,000 new jobs. Well, guess what. In fact, the major economist who pledged the 250,000 new jobs said, `Whoops, I was wrong. I guess there are no 250,000 new jobs; there is more trade debt.' 
Harry Truman once said: I want to get a one-armed economist. I am getting tired of economists saying `on this hand' and `on the other hand.' We do not need economists who give us this kind of advice. 
What about the trade deficit? Where is this trade deficit? Well, 92 percent of the trade deficit is with six countries. First there is Japan. Then there is China, and this one is growing to beat the band, by the way. Then we have Canada and Mexico where the deficits have been growing substantially. Finally, there are Germany and Taiwan. 
I want to remind those who want to extend fast track about the Constitution. The Constitution of the United States, article I, section 8, says `The Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.' It does not say anything about fast track. It does not say anything about handcuffs or straitjackets. It does not say anything about having some nameless negotiator run off to foreign shores someplace and negotiate a bad agreement and then come back to the Congress and say, by the way, vote on this, and you have no opportunity to amend it. 
I wonder how many in this Chamber know what kind of tariff exists on a T-bone steak you send to Tokyo. I bet not many. Not too many years ago we negotiated with Japan, with whom we have a very large, abiding continual trade deficit. We negotiated a beef agreement. We wanted to get more United States beef into Japan. So our negotiators went out on behalf of our beef producers and others and negotiated with Japan. 
All of a sudden one day in the newspapers we see in a big headline that we have reached agreement with Japan on a beef agreement. They were having a day of feasting and rejoicing. You would have thought all these negotiators just won the gold medal in the Olympics. Then we find out that, yes, we have a new agreement with Japan and, yes, we are getting more American beef into Japan. But, guess what? Try sending a T-bone steak to Tokyo. What is the tariff to get T-bone into Tokyo? It's up to a 50-percent tariff on beef to Japan. 
Would that be considered successful in any area of the world in international trade? No. That would be defined as a colossal failure in every set of circumstances except when our negotiators are negotiating an agreement with Japan. They define that as success. They line up to get their blue ribbons. 
It's like they had a steer at the county fair and had just won blue ribbons and want to get congratulated for it. Yes, we got more beef in Japan. Just think what we take into our marketplace from Japan in exchange for that. And we hit a 50-percent tariff. 
I could talk about potatoes from Mexico, I could talk about Durum wheat flooding our markets from Canada. I could talk forever about these trade problems. I don't want to do that today. I only want to say this to the President, to the administration, and to the Members of Congress: Don't talk about fast track until we have straightened out the trade agreements that we have had in recent years that have put our producers and our workers at a disadvantage. Don't talk about fast track until you have negotiated the problems dealing with Canada and grain. 
I was in a little orange truck going up to the Canadian border one day with 200 bushels of Durum wheat. That little orange truck couldn't get over the border into Canada. Do you know why? They stopped us at the border and said you couldn't take Durum wheat into Canada. All the way up to the border we found truck after truck, semi-loads, dozens of them, hauling Canadian grain south, but we couldn't get a harmless little orange truck north. 
In fact, one North Dakotan couldn't get a grocery sack of wheat into Canada. She married a Canadian and was back home visiting, and wanted to take a grocery sack of wheat into Canada to grind it and make whole wheat bread, and guess what, they wouldn't let her take a grocery sack of wheat north. All the while, hundreds of semi-trucks full of Canadian wheat come south. 
That is just one example. I say, Mr. President, and others, if you want fast-track authority? Then straighten out the trade problems that now exist. Yes, straighten out the problems with Canada and Mexico and Japan and others and I will be the first to line up and say let's talk about new trade authority. But until we solve the vexing and difficult problems of trade agreements that have now resulted in the largest trade deficit in the history of this country, we ought not be moving towards fast-track trade authority. 
Before I finish that subject, let me put in a word about Charlene Barshefsky, our new Trade Ambassador. I like Charlene Barshefsky. She has some spunk and she has some life. She is out there, trying to say to our trading partners that we expect reciprocal trading policies. If we open our market to your goods you have a responsibility to open your market to ours. She has been in Canada, telling the Canadians what you are doing with Canadian grain is wrong and it abrogates the treaty. 
In fact--just one more point about the Canadian grain--when the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement passed the House Ways and Means Committee, and I was on the committee, the vote was 34 to 1. That `1' was me. I said at the time I felt that treaty was going to result in a serious problem for us. And it has. 
Clayton Yeutter, the Trade Ambassador at that point, said, `No, no, no. Your concerns about an avalanche of Canadian grain flooding the United States market and undercutting American farmers, that is nonsense. That will not happen.' 
I'll tell you what he said. Mr. Yeutter said, `I'll tell you what, I will give it to you in writing. I will make the promise in writing.' And he wrote it down. He said that his agreement with the Canadians was with the understanding that good faith would be subscribed to by both sides by not dramatically changing the quantity of grain coming across the border. That was his agreement. So he wrote it down. That was good faith. That was his understanding. That is what he negotiated. However, it was not worth the paper it was written on. 
The second the ink was dry and the minute the treaty was done, what we saw was an avalanche of grain come south. At the same time 
you couldn't take a grocery sack full north. It undercut our markets in Durum wheat especially, and cost our farmers massive amounts of lost income. 
So, why am I a little sore about some of those things? I am angry because we have negotiated trade agreements that have undercut our producers and we ought not do that. I am for free trade. I am for expanded trade. But I am for fair trade. If it is not fair, than the agreement is not right. 
Charlene Barshefsky is a breath of fresh air and she is trying. She can only do what any administration allows her to do. I urge the President and others to understand that in order to have trade negotiating authority of anything resembling fast track, they first must address the serious problems in the previous agreements that have been negotiated. Until that happens, at least a number of us, including Senator Snowe and I, based on the letter we have sent to the President, do not support the extension of fast track for all the reasons I have mentioned previously.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk about one other topic today. It is a subject that is in the paper this morning--the balanced budget agreement. 
Mr. President, I do not know all of the details of the agreement. I know the outline and the skeleton of the balanced budget agreement that has been reached through a substantial amount of negotiation. I expect, were I to negotiate a balanced budget agreement, it might be different than that which was negotiated and that which I read about this morning. I have been party to many briefings, including the most substantial briefing yet on what has been negotiated, but I confess, like most Members of the Senate who have not been in the room during all the negotiations, I may not know all the provisions of this agreement. 
However, I have said repeatedly during the debates that we have had on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and in many other circumstances, that I support balancing the budget. I think there is merit in fiscal discipline. I think we should balance the budget. And I think we should work together to do that. 
In 1993 I voted for a deficit reduction act that was a very controversial piece of legislation. And we passed that by one vote. It happened to be the Vice President's vote. My party voted for it, the other party didn't. I am not going to make judgments about that today. I suppose that's the time for a political discussion. 
We paid, in my party, a significant price for that vote in 1993, because it was not popular. I said at the time, and I have said repeatedly since, I am glad I voted the way I did. It wasn't easy. It cut some spending. It raised some taxes. It wasn't a very easy vote, but I am glad I voted the way I did because I believe that it was the first significant step in deciding we are going to do the tough thing to reduce the budget deficit. 
What happened since that time? We have had year after year of declining budget deficits. The unified deficit has come down, way down--not just down a bit, but way down, by 75 percent. But the job is not yet done. And that is why there have been negotiations between the President and Members of Congress about how to finish the job. 
I think we will find that the agreement that has been negotiated will receive fairly substantial support in the Senate and the House. I want to vote to finish the job. I voted to start the job and I want to vote to finish it. I think we ought to tell the American people there is fiscal discipline in this place. There is merit in a balanced budget. And there is no difference in desire on either side of the aisle about wanting to live within our means. That is not a political question between the two parties. I think that is demonstrated by what we did in 1993. I hope it will be demonstrated by what we all do this year. 
Now, is part of this agreement smoke? I think so. I mean, I can describe certain areas of it where I think it is a fair amount 
of smoke, or fog. 
But is some of it real? Is it moving us in a bipartisan way in the right direction? I think so. Importantly, it does it the right way. What we have said for a long time is there is a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things. I have said on the floor there is a big difference between deciding to invest in star wars or star schools. I am not saying one is all right and one is all wrong, but I am saying they are very different. Because it suggests one believes education is critically important and the other says no, the priority is over here in defense. 
My point is what we have done, I think, in these negotiations is to decide, yes, let us balance the budget, but let us preserve the priorities that are important. Let us as a nation decide that education is still at top of the national agenda and there is not anything much more important in our country than making sure all our kids in this country, every young boy, every young girl, have the opportunity to be everything they can be. And that we will invest in their lives, starting, yes, at Head Start, and going all the way through college. We will invest in their lives, to decide that all of our children should become whatever their talents will allow them to become; whatever hard work and opportunity will allow them to be, as Americans. A major part of that is our decision to make a significant investment and attachment to education as a priority. And this budget agreement does that. 
This President said I will not be a part of the budget agreement and I won't sign a budget bill unless it retains the priority of education. And this budget agreement contains room for new investments in education, which is critically important. 
The agreement also has room for new investments in health care. It says that 5 million kids, about half of the population of kids without health care, 5 million can be insured. There is room here so we can insure you, provide insurance for health care for 5 million kids. 
There is room here to continue to make progress on issues in the environment. The President said, `I won't sign a bill unless it meets these priorities.' And he negotiated and negotiated, and we negotiated, and we have a piece of legislation that is going to balance the budget but does preserve those priorities. 
On the environment, just as an aside, I'll bet there is not a person serving in the Congress today who, 20 years ago, would have said this: We can double the use of energy in America in the next 20 years and we will end up with cleaner air and cleaner water. I'll bet there is not one person who would have predicted that, because all the experts predicted we would increase dramatically our use of energy and have dirtier air and dirtier water as a result. 
But it did not happen. We doubled our use of energy as a nation, and our air is cleaner and our water is cleaner. Why? Because the Government said those who continue to pollute our air and water are going to be penalized. Congress said it will no longer be business as usual. The environment is important. We are going to insist that those who are polluters in our country are going to stop polluting. 
We don't have a perfect situation, but I am saying we are moving in the right direction, we have cleaner air and cleaner water, even as we have doubled the use of energy. 
So, what the President was saying is, on education, on health care, on the environment, there are certain things that must be in this legislation. Even as we balance the budget we must make room to invest and continue to make progress in those areas. This piece of legislation does that. 
I know there are some who have heartburn because it does it. But I think it is the right impulse, for us to decide what is important for all of us, Republicans and Democrats, to do in this country to advance the interests of America. 
One of them is to help to invest in our future by investing in our kids' education. 
One of those is to say to those in this country who do not 
have the opportunity and do not have the resources to have health care coverage, especially for kids, that we want to help get health care coverage. This agreement will provide it for 5 million kids. 
And one of those is to say the environment is important. We should not back up or retreat on the environment. What we should do is continue to move forward and make progress to clean up our Earth and clean our water and say to polluters it is not appropriate to pollute this country. Part of the cost of production is to clean up as you produce. Fortunately, that is not so controversial anymore, because we have made so much progress and the American people so value living in a clean environment that now, most all politicians, I think, understand the value of that. 
But I wanted to simply come today to say that we have made a lot of progress. In 1993 we took the first flight of stairs, and I am pleased I made that vote. It was a long flight of stairs. It was a tough vote to make. Now we are climbing the second flight of stairs. I think this is going to be a bipartisan effort and I am pleased that is the case. 
No, this bill is probably not perfect. But I would say this. We are moving in the right direction in this country. The fact is, our economy is better than it was. Unemployment is down. Inflation is down. More people are working. We are moving in the right direction, largely because, I think, going from a period when we had Federal deficits of $300 billion a year, everyone in this country now sees that the President is serious and the Congress is serious about getting our fiscal house in order. That gives people more confidence about the future. 
If people, yes, even the market--especially the market, I suppose--if they have confidence about the future and about the fiscal discipline that can come from a President and a Congress working together, we will see them making the investments in the future because they have more confidence in the future. That is what this is all about. 
So, I wanted to say, when I got up this morning and read the newspaper, I was pleased to see that we are taking another step toward agreement. 
I don't happen to view bipartisanship as something that is bad for this country. I think it is something that is good for this country. There are some, incidentally, who think being bipartisan is inherently bad, because both sides ought to fight like the devil for whatever it is they believe and whatever is the outcome is the outcome. 
I do not believe that. That is not the way we did most things in this country. We have an interstate highway that goes from Fargo, ND, to Beach, ND. It was not one group of people out there who said, `Let's have a big fight about an interstate highway.' It was a bipartisan approach in the 1950's, to say, `Let's create an interstate highway in this country.' 
The interesting part about it is I don't suppose, when Dwight Eisenhower, then President, and Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House, sat down at the White House and reminisced about what they were going to do here, I don't suppose they actually stopped to think how do we justify to the American people the cost of building a 4-lane interstate highway from Beach, ND, to Fargo, ND, where 600,000 people live? 
I suppose Citizens Against Government Waste and the National Taxpayers Union, or some other group these days--if someone were to try to do that--would say, `What on Earth are you doing?' How on Earth can you justify that expenditure, going across sparsely populated states? 
Of course we now know it was one of the great achievements in the middle of this century, building an interstate highway system that opened up vistas of commerce and opportunity. 
My point is, I think bipartisanship is a wonderful thing. I think there ought to be more opportunities for us to work together. And I hope, if this budget agreement is as we are to understand it to be and is a bipartisan effort, that in the coming weeks, we can demonstrate to the American people we do care about fiscal responsibility, we do want to abolish the Federal budget deficit, and we do want to provide greater hope and opportunity to the American people by doing so. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Grasslands Management Act. I introduced this bill in the 104th Congress as well. This bill applies primarily to the grasslands in the Dakotas and half a dozen other States. I want to explain briefly what the objective of this bill is and how it came about. North Dakota has been particularly concerned about management reform because it embraces over 25 percent and 1.2 million acres of all national grasslands. Many North Dakota ranching families have earned their livelihood on these lands for several generations. 
For several years, however, the ranchers in western North Dakota have been asking for a less cumbersome approach to management of the grasslands and both chambers of the 1995 legislature passed a resolution unanimously asking for management reform on the grasslands as well. Here is why. 
The current regulatory regime is cumbersome mainly because the Forest Service must manage the grasslands under the same framework as it does the rest of the National Forest System. It doesn't handle efficiently the day-to-day problems of the ranchers and grazing associations. For example, ranchers have had to wait for as long as 2 to 3 years to get approval for a stock tank because of the labyrinth of regulations that the Forest Service overlays on the management of the grasslands. This legislation will change that by removing the national grasslands from the National Forest System and creating a new structure of rules specifically suited to the ecology of the grasslands. 
However, it is not only the rancher's needs that my bill addresses. It will also protect a broad range of uses on the public lands. All hunting, fishing, and recreational activities will continue as before and environmental protections will continue actually be strengthened. Further, it is my intention that the public must be involved in the decisionmaking process as these new rules are implemented. Only by working together can we solve the problems on the grasslands. 
Let me reassure the conservation community that this bill, which was originally incorporated as part of a larger grazing package during the 104th Congress, will not make grazing the dominant use of the public lands at the expense of other uses. This bill includes specific provisions to protect hunting and fishing, and preserves the multiple uses of the national grasslands, preserves public participation in the management of the grasslands and keeps the link between the Grasslands and major environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act. 
I have worked diligently with the ranchers, environmentalists, and other recreational users of the grasslands to ensure a balanced approach to grasslands management. The result of that work is the National Grasslands Management Act that I am introducing today. 
The legislation explicitly states that there will be no diminished hunting or fishing opportunities, that all applicable environmental laws will apply to those lands, and that the grasslands will be managed under a multiple use policy. The bill directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations which both promote the efficient administration of livestock agriculture and provide environmental protection equivalent to that of the National Forest System. 
In short, I believe that the National Grasslands Management Act is a solid piece of legislation that will make the administration of the grasslands more responsive to the people who live there, without diminishing the rights and opportunities of other multiple users of this public land. It will help to preserve the historic ranching economy and lifestyle of western North Dakota and other areas in the West will be protecting the environment. I urge my colleagues to support this initiative.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will facilitate a mineral exchange in western North Dakota. I introduced this bill at the end of the last Congress and hope to move forward in this Congress with a proposal based on that effort. The purpose of this mineral exchange is to consolidate certain mineral estates of both the U.S. Forest Service and Burlington Resources, formerly known as Meridian Oil. This consolidation will produce tangible benefits to an economically distressed region in North Dakota and also protect environmentally-sensitive areas. 
For years, the land and mineral ownership pattern in Western North Dakota has been extremely fragmented. In many cases the Forest Service owns and manages the surface land while private parties, such as Burlington Resources, own the subsurface mineral estates. This fragmentation has not only frustrated the management objectives of the Forest Service, it has also inhibited mineral exploration and development. 
The bill will definitely promote environmental protection. By consolidating the mineral estates, the Forest Service will have the opportunity to protect the view-shed along the wonderfully scenic Little Missouri River, creating a more attractive hunting, fishing, and hiking area. Further, the mineral exchange will protect certain bighorn sheep lambing areas. The area protected by the mineral exchange is one of the last places that provides adequate habitat and escape cover for bighorn sheep. The Forest Service and Burlington have already 
signed a memorandum of understanding which will bolster the protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat after the exchange is concluded. The exchange is also supported by all major environmental groups in the state, the Governor of North Dakota, and the Bureau of Land Management's Dakotas Resource Advisory Council. 
The bill will also strengthen the regional economy. Burlington Resources supports this legislation. Burlington will have better opportunities for mineral exploration and development within its consolidated mineral estates. This increased development will benefit not only Burlington, but also Billings County and the State of North Dakota through increased tax revenues. 
One point that I would like to make clear is that this mineral exchange should in no way be seen as affecting the multiple uses of the land. Current multiple uses, such as recreation, livestock grazing, watershed protection or fish, and wildlife purposes, will continue as before. This is not a wilderness bill, but a proposal to swap mineral rights in order to enhance the environment and to stimulate economic activity in a depressed area. I do not favor the designation of wilderness within Billings County. 
May I further underscore that this mineral exchange costs the U.S. taxpayer nothing. The bill provides for an exchange of about the same number of acres with equivalent monetary values. Yet, this no-cost transaction will yield substantial economic, environmental, and management dividends. 
Further, the bill does not rely on the government imposing a solution. Rather, this voluntary agreement embodies a consensus reached between the affected parties, the mineral holders, the state and its citizens, the environmental organizations, and the U.S. Forest Service. 
Finally, may I stress that there is an urgent need for action on the exchange. I would ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, letters of support from the Governor of North Dakota, the Bureau of Land Management's Dakotas Resource Council, and the Sierra Club, and the memorandum of understanding signed by the Forest Service and Burlington Resources be entered into the Record in order to aid my colleagues in their deliberations on the bill. In turn, I urge my colleagues to support timely passage of this bill.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday we completed a disaster supplemental appropriations bill that addresses some of the needs of the serious disaster that occurred in my State of North Dakota and the three-State region of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota. I am pleased to say at the end of the day Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, and so many others, on a bipartisan basis, in this Chamber were willing to add sufficient resources so that people who lost their homes, people who lost their businesses, who feel helpless and hopeless, will now have some hope that there will be recovery in our region of the country. 
Mr. President, 25,000 people in Grand Forks, ND, woke up this morning, not in their own bed, not in their own home, some in a shelter, many with friends, some in other towns, because much of that town is still evacuated. In East Grand Forks, across the river, 9,000 people have left the town. The entire community was evacuated, and the mayor indicates nearly none of them are back. 
The blizzards, the floods, and the fires were the worst we have ever seen. The need for the rest of the country to extend a helping hand, to say we want you to recover and rebuild and get back on your feet, is welcome news. I appreciate very much the resources, some $500 million of community development block grant funds, that resulted, finally, in this legislation enacted yesterday by the U.S. Senate. 
I thank all my colleagues for that help, on behalf of all North Dakotans.

Mr. DORGAN. On another subject, Mr. President, I want to encourage those who are negotiating on a budget deal. I happen to think there is great merit in reaching a bipartisan agreement on a balanced budget deal, and when I use the term `deal,' I am talking about the negotiations between the principals about how to get to a balanced budget. 
I am inclined, based on what I know, to support it. I have observed and asked those involved in the negotiations to consider that the Social Security surpluses are still not dealt with appropriately, and they need to do more in order to make certain that we have not claimed to have balanced the budget, when, in fact, we have done so by using Social Security surpluses. That will not complete the job. I hope those who are negotiating that will not stop short of the goal. We need a balanced budget and we need to preserve the Social Security surpluses above that to save for the baby boom generation when it retires.

Mr. DORGAN. Finally, Mr. President, on a subject I came to the floor to speak about for a couple of minutes, I have been to the floor of the Senate repeatedly to talk about our justice system. Our judicial system, in many respects, is a remarkable and interesting system. In some respects, it is broken. 
I have talked on this floor of case after case of violent crimes, committed by violent criminals, who we knew were violent, but yet were turned out of prison, and in many cases turned them out of prison or jail early because they earned good time for early release. 
Parole, probation, early release for good time means that the young boy I have spoken about on the floor of the Senate, Jonathan Hall, murdered, stabbed over 50 times, by a man who had kidnapped and murdered twice before and was out early on good time, living in young Jonathan Hall's neighborhood, killed that young boy and threw him down a pond. The young boy, when they found him, had dirt and grass between his fingers, because he obviously had not been dead, despite being stabbed 50 times, and tried to climb out of the pond before he died. 
Why was he dead? Because someone was let out of jail early to live in that neighborhood and kill young Jonathan. 
Bettina Pruckmayr, a young woman who came to Washington, excited about a wonderful future, stabbed many, many times by someone at an ATM machine, someone who had been in jail and let out of jail early, who should never have been let out on the streets. I will come again to talk about that. 
It is disgraceful that the average sentence served for committing murder in this country is 7 1/2 years. The average sentence served in jail or prison is 7 1/2 years--that is a broken system. 
There is more to the broken system that I want to mention today. That is the trial that is now going on in Denver, CO, about the Oklahoma City bombing case. I will not talk about the merits or what I think about the case, but I want to talk about something that is haywire in the public defender system. 
The 6th amendment to the Constitution offers a right to every American to a fair trial. Therefore, an indigent defendant has a right to a public defender. We have an alleged murderer on trial in Denver who drove a truck up in front of a courthouse and killed many, many people. No one will forget the memory of the fireman holding that young child from the day care center in his arms, dead as a result of some murderous coward who decided to kill innocent people with a truck bomb. 
Now, what happens when someone who is indigent is arrested and goes on trial for committing a crime of that type? Let me tell you what happens. 
The public defender system in this country today offers that defendant, on trial now in Denver, 14 attorneys. Yes, Mr. McVeigh has 14 lawyers working for him, paid for by us, and 6 investigators on top of the 14 lawyers. We are also paying 25 expert witnesses, and we paid for 9 foreign trips by his lawyers and his investigators to Israel, trips to Italy, Great Britain, Syria, Jordan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and all these trips were paid for by the American taxpayer under the public defender system, which offers someone who allegedly committed murder by a truck bomb at the Oklahoma City courthouse offers him 14 lawyers, 6 investigators, 25 witnesses, and 9 foreign trips to 8 foreign countries. It is estimated to cost $10 million of taxpayers' money for a defense. 
I support the sixth amendment. I support public defenders being offered to indigent people accused of crimes. But, Mr. President, the Administrative Office of the Courts estimates that there is a 68-percent jump in the cost of court-appointed attorneys in Federal capital cases. In 1 year alone, there is a 68-percent jump in the cost. The Administrative Office of the Courts will overrun 1997 appropriations for these expenditures. The appropriation was $308 million. It will overrun by $25 million. 
Now, I am not a lawyer. I suppose some will say, well, you need to understand this. I do not understand this. The sixth amendment guarantees the right to a fair trial. I believe it guarantees the right for an indigent defendant to be given a defense, and for that defense to be paid for by the American taxpayer. I do not believe any twisted interpretation of that should persuade us, the American taxpayer, to pay for 14 lawyers, 6 investigators, 25 expert witnesses, and trips to foreign countries in a case like the Oklahoma City bombing case. 
Now, I don't know what the answer is. But I know this is broken. I am hoping, as I sift through this with some of my colleagues, that we can find a way, yes, to preserve the rights under the sixth amendment to every defendant, but to stop this sort of nonsense. The records, incidentally, in this case are sealed, so we don't know exactly what has been spent. It has been estimated that from $3 million to $10 million, in early April, was spent in this circumstance. But when I see this sort of thing happening, I get angry again about a judicial system that seems broken. I am tired of people being let out of jail early to kill again. We have over 3,000 people in prison in this country right now who were in for having committed a murder and, while they were out early, have committed another capital crime. At least 3,000 families ought to feel that someone is an accomplice when they let out a known violent criminal early only to commit murder again. 
That system is broken, and one more evidence of a broken system is the lack, somehow, of restraint in a circumstance where we take a public defender requirement under the sixth amendment and decide this is a pot of money that has no bottom, hire as many lawyers as you want, and somebody will say, yes, dig as deep as you like and some will say, yes, because the old taxpayer pays for that. There ought to be a limit, and we ought to start talking about it when we see this kind of twisted logic resulting in this kind of waste. I think it is time for Congress to act. 
Do I know the specific answer? No, I don't. But I think we need to define, decide, and discuss limits in this area, so we tell those folks involved in the public defender system that there is a limit. No, there is not a limit on sixth amendment rights, but there is a limit on the use of taxpayer funds to hire 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 lawyers. It is time that we use a little common sense. I hope when we come around on the appropriations side--and I am on the Appropriations Committee--and look at appropriating again in this account, we can start thinking about how this money ought to be used. Is there a sensible limit? I sure hope to be one of those who helps to find that out in the future. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, spoke a few moments ago about what is in this supplemental bill to provide appropriations for the disaster that has occurred in our region of the country. 
I rise today to support the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. He is trying to strike a provision in this disaster relief bill that has been included that has no relationship to the need for this bill to provide some help to folks around the country who need help. I really believe that we need to move without delay to get this bill enacted and get the help to those who need it in our country. 
I am not critical of anyone else's efforts on the floor of the Senate. I only am here to urge that we not include this provision, which does not belong in this bill. It is included in this bill in a way that delays the bill and, quite likely, will provoke a Presidential veto. I implore those who feel strongly about this proposal to bring it up another time, bring it another day, bring it next week on another bill, but do not delay this piece of legislation. 
I have a lot of people who have come to me, as they have, I am sure, to my colleague from North Dakota, and they said, `Did you see the movie `Fargo'?' Especially around the Academy Award time, `Did you see the movie `Fargo'?' A lot of people apparently saw the movie `Fargo.' It was a Hollywood caricature of our region of the country, set with some drama on the movie screen. 
But a real-life drama has occurred in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota that is the most significant tragedy, in my judgment, that has occurred in our State. Short of massive loss of life, it is the most significant tragedy that has occurred in the history of our State. It is a drama full of tragedy, heartbreak, broken dreams and, at the same time, full of strength, courage, and hope. 
What has occurred? My colleague from North Dakota described it: 3 years worth of snow dropped in 3 months on our State, the last storm bringing nearly 2 feet of snow in about 36 hours, with 50-mile-an-hour winds. When the combination of all that snowfall, 3 years worth of snow, began to melt in the Red River Valley, it flooded the valley, and the Red River exceeded its banks quickly and dramatically and was higher than at any other time in history. 
The city of Grand Forks, ND, for example, was 95 percent evacuated, a city of 50,000 people that was virtually a ghost town and under water. In the city of East Grand Forks across the river, 9,000 people are out of their homes. The entire city was evacuated. 
And if you could go to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks today, what you would find at Grand Forks is 25,000 people still homeless. In East Grand Forks, not one of the 9,000 people is back in town, according to the mayor. You have a city empty and a city across the river that is half empty. 
Where are those 25,000 people? They woke up in a bed or cot that was not in their homes. They are displaced. Many of them have lost their homes. Hundreds of them will never go back to their homes because their homes are destroyed. 
We are told, well, we want to help, and I very much appreciate the help that has been offered in the Senate. Our colleagues, Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd and so many others have said, Let us help. I have been willing to do that on every occasion I have been in Congress, to extend a helping hand to offer hope to people who have suffered through floods, fires, tornadoes, 
hurricanes, earthquakes, and more. Now the rest of this country through this Congress is extending a helping hand to the folks in our region, to give them cause for hope, to allow them to believe they can rebuild their dreams. 
Is it urgent we get this done soon? Yes, it is. As I said, 25,000 people in Grand Forks alone woke up this morning not in their own homes, but someplace else--a shelter, a cot, a friend's home, a different city. 
Is it urgent that we finish this bill? Is it urgent that the badly needed appropriations in this bill can be used to offer hope to those folks, to help rebuild, to recover? It is urgent that this be done and be done now. 
Adding controversial amendments to this bill delays the bill. Adding controversial amendments, as was done in the committee, especially with respect to the provision that is now the subject of the motion to strike, delays this bill. For the sake of those thousands of North Dakotans, Minnesotans, and South Dakotans who have suffered this terrible tragedy, and for the sake of many others in this country for whom disaster relief appropriations are in this bill to meet their needs, for their sake we should not seek to further delay this bill. 
Let us support the motion to strike. Let us take this provision out of this legislation, pass the legislation, have the President sign the legislation and deliver this message of hope, and deliver these appropriations that offer real hope, to the people of a region who so desperately need it. 
There are some who say, Well, we are doing the right thing. I would say to them that they need to understand that it is not urgent that this provision be done now; it can be done later, we can add it to something else. As for the disaster relief aid in this bill, it is urgent that it be done now. Having controversial amendments in this bill, amendments that will provoke a veto, will delay this urgently needed help. 
Let me end as I began. I do not come here to be critical of others. I greatly respect every Member of this body. I thank so much the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and all of the others with whom I have worked to address these real human needs. Now I simply ask that the Senate decide, as it has so often in the past, that on an appropriations bill that is designed to reach out and help victims of disaster, that we should not do anything to impede or delay that help. 
So, for that reason, I am happy to rise today to support the motion to strike offered by Senator Byrd. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I share the concerns of my colleague from South Dakota. Our States have witnessed the most devastating series of winter storms and spring flooding in memory. Our producers need help in rebuilding their farming and ranching operations. However, I am afraid the credit needs of many farm and ranch families are not being met. 
For example, some producers cannot access USDA's Emergency Disaster Loan Program, even though they have a qualifying disaster loss. Others, Native American tribes, do not have a loan program available to them to replace livestock lost during the disaster. I believe it is important that we give them an opportunity to rebuild their lives and livelihoods, by giving serious consideration to updating the programs. 
These are the reasons I filed amendments cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Conrad and Johnson.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief, for a question. 
Senator Conrad talks about the disasters that have precipitated the need for a disaster bill. As a member of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, I participated yesterday in writing the bill that would come to the floor of the Senate next week. 
Included in that legislation are amendments that have really nothing to do with the legislation at all, that are very controversial and could delay or impede the progress of this bill. 
I join with my colleague to urge those who I know have other agendas and amendments, which I am sure are important to them, to decide not to offer them to this legislation. 
I encourage those who have offered them in the Senate Appropriations Committee to take those amendments out of this bill and allow us to do what we need to do for the victims of these disasters--to extend a helping hand and say to those who have suffered so much that this country understands that you need help, that you are not alone, and this legislation and this Congress, by enacting this legislation, wants to do that and do it quickly. 
The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, makes a very important point. I associate myself with that point--that between now and next Tuesday, or Wednesday, when we take that legislation to the floor of the Senate, I hope very much that we will see those who have been adding and probably those who might want to add additional amendments to decide not to do that on this very important bill.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that the amendment you described a few moments ago--I understand that there is some controversy about it, but it is perfectly appropriate. Your amendment deals with the disaster. I read it last evening at home, and I certainly would not intend to be critical of somebody who is offering amendments that deal with the bill. I want you to understand that. My concern is amendments that really don't have any relationship to this bill but which people want to get passed. I heard you describe it and use my name. I have no problem with that amendment being offered because it relates to this bill.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator for yielding. One of the reasons for the discussion about the other subjects is especially the gravity of the disaster that has occurred in the States of Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota. A number of us wanted to address the issue. We face a markup this afternoon, and hope very much that can occur without extraneous amendments and we wanted to discuss that a bit. I appreciate very much the courtesy. 
I wonder if the Senator might indicate to me when we might be able to get some time?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know there is discussion this morning, again, about a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, now scheduled for 2 o'clock, to deal with the disaster supplemental appropriations bill. I come to the floor only to urge, as I did yesterday, that the committee consider the disaster appropriations bill and the issues in that bill without adding additional extraneous amendments or matters that are unrelated to the bill. 
I do not want to or intend to debate other issues. There are people who have amendments, I am sure, that they feel strongly about--amendments on various bills. But I encourage them very strongly to find other places to offer amendments if they feel they need to offer amendments. 
We have several amendments that I understand have been noticed that have nothing at all to do with the disaster supplemental bill. They are extraneous, unrelated issues that people want to put on this piece of legislation because, I suppose, they believe this kind of legislation will ultimately be signed by the President. But, to add extraneous or unrelated matters to this supplemental appropriations bill that is to be passed to respond to a disaster, only will increase the amount of time it takes to enact this bill. It will jeopardize the passage, I suspect, if they are very controversial amendments. And, in my judgment, that is not what we should do on this disaster bill. 
So, I encourage my colleagues today, as we go to a markup, to join all of us in working to pass a bill that is free of extraneous or unrelated amendments that would cause problems for the bill. 
I want, as I did yesterday, to commend Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd and all of the others on the committee who, in a bipartisan way, have worked very hard with us to respond to a disaster that occurred in our part of the country. 
In many ways, facing the kind of disaster that was faced in North and South Dakota and Minnesota brings out the best in people. It was really heartwarming to have seen during this disaster the thousands and thousands of people, many of them young people--high school and college students--and folks in their senior years, show up at sandbag lines to stack sandbags to build dikes to fight the river. 
It is an extraordinary thing to see what people have done, the acts of heroism that have occurred so frequently, especially up in the Red River Valley, in this flood fight and the fight against the fire and the fight to overcome the effects of the massive blizzards. 
The victims of all of this are the tens of thousands of people who were displaced. The city of Grand Forks is a city of nearly 50,000 people with no one living there, streets inundated with water. The only traffic in Grand Forks was by three or four Coast Guard boats taking people up and down and some law enforcement people on the outside of the city trying to make certain that there was order. But other than that, this was a city inundated and a city evacuated. 
Of all the wonderful things people have done--and there are so many--I noticed last evening that an unidentified woman from California decided that she wanted to make a personal donation of $2,000 per household in Grand Forks, ND, to those men and women who have suffered damages to their homes. What a wonderful thing for someone to do. That will cost millions of dollars. An anonymous donor says, `I want to step up here and help.' What a wonderful thing to do. 
Part of what is needed to be done, as well, is the Federal Government to understand that that region cannot recover by itself. It needs a helping hand by the Government to say to our region, `You're not alone. The rest of the people in this country want to help,' as we have done so often in other parts of the country in floods, fires, tornadoes, and earthquakes. 
In order for the Federal Government to provide that assistance, we must pass a disaster supplemental appropriations bill. We should, in my judgment, do that without any extraneous amendments that are unrelated to the bill. I encourage all those who are inclined to want to add amendments to try to find a way to bring those issues to the floor at a different time. I am not here to suggest that the ideas that will be offered have no merit, that they are inappropriate ideas to be discussing or debating. I am not suggesting that at all. I just ask that we stick with what we should be doing; that is, understanding the people who have had such a heavy burden placed on them, in many cases losing everything they have, being evacuated from their homes, the people who I saw in shelters with tears in their eyes, worried about tomorrow, about whether there will be hope, whether there will be opportunity again, whether there will be help for them and their families, their children, and their parents. I just hope we can pass a piece of legislation that is without extraneous amendments that offers that kind of help. 
The Senator from Arizona is on the floor. I want to say to him that I don't judge ideas that others are attempting to offer anywhere. They may have merit. I just urge everyone to take a look at the importance of this bill and see if we can't find other places to debate these ideas. I think the men and women of the Senate are men and women of enormous good will. We always try to do the right thing. 
I said yesterday and want to say again, Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, and others have done a remarkable job in working with us to try to develop a package of assistance to that region that will be enormously helpful and enormously beneficial. I hope at the end of the day, at the end of this week, we will have moved something through this committee to the floor of the Senate to be scheduled early next week that can then be accepted by the House and be signed by the President and will extend the helping hand of the Federal Government to a lot of folks who have been hit very, very hard. 
I do not intend to have a debate with anybody about the merits of this or that issue. I only come to say that this is very important, vitally important, to our region of the country, and I urge in the strongest possible terms that the Congress be allowed to pass this supplemental disaster appropriations bill without extraneous amendments attached to it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield to myself the 10 minutes allocated previously. 
Mr. President, the only thing that matters to me at the end of the day is, has the Congress proceeded to enact the disaster supplemental bill? And will the disaster supplemental, as enacted, be free of provisions that would otherwise engender a Presidential veto? Will the Congress get its work done on the disaster supplemental bill? That is all I came to talk about and all I intend to talk about. 
There was a demonstration here on the floor by those who say, well, if you do not support our amendment, whatever our amendment is, you do not care about Government shutdowns. What a load of nonsense. I will not respond to all of this, but just to say this: I did not come to the floor to criticize anybody and I will not respond as I am tempted to do. I came here asking only one thing: That when the Senate Committee marks up its bill at 2 o'clock, that we mark up a supplemental disaster appropriations bill without attaching amendments that are unrelated to the bill. 
One Member came and took great offense to that and ranted 
about the fact that I or others do not support efforts to stop Government shutdowns, and so on. I have no idea how people learn these techniques--the technique of misstating your opponent's position and going on and debating them. That is an old debating technique that some memorize. It does not serve a particular interest to me. 
I am very happy to work with all Members of the Senate in finding ways to avoid any Government shutdown, at any time. I have never supported a Government shutdown. I am happy to work with anybody at any time to avoid a Government shutdown. I do not want someone coming to the floor to ascribe motives I do not have. My motive was for one purpose today, and that is to encourage all Members of the Senate to understand this disaster supplemental has the word `disaster' attached to it because some parts of the country are suffering a disaster. We want, at the end of the day, to pass a bill that extends a helping hand to those folks. 
Now, I understand everybody else has 800 objections to it, and they have different agendas. We have in our caucus, people who have agendas, they want to bring things to attach to this bill. They are saying, `This is the first appropriations bill. We want to attach something to it.' My position to them was exactly the same. It does not matter what party you are in. I have told members of our caucus, `I do not want you to attach things to this bill.' I will tell them that today if somebody says they want to do it. 
Leave this bill alone. This bill affects 22 States. It affects people who have been driven from their homes who need help. We do not need people to come to the floor pointing and shouting about who supports Government shutdowns in September or October. Who is willing to help pass a disaster bill in April and May? That is the question. 
I get sorely tempted some days to come and respond in kind to some of the things I hear. But my Scandinavian heritage overcomes that urge from time to time, and it will again today. My response would be in a more personal way to those with whom I take offense when they suggest somehow that those of us who want to see a disaster bill passed without interference have an agenda that does not care about the rest of the country and Government shutdowns. People know better than that. We should have reasonable and thoughtful debates here in the Senate. We should not do that sort of thing. 
The agenda of the Senate, it seems to me, in the Appropriations Committee this afternoon, is how does this country respond to a series of disasters. That is what I care about. There are other issues that others care about. That is fine. We should talk about the issues. But I would feel the same way, I guess, if it was your disaster. I would want your people to get the help they deserve. And I have done that on earthquakes, fires, floods, and tornadoes all around the country in all the years I have been here. 
My hope is, without ascribing ill motives to anyone in the Senate, that we can just decide to work together. I have said three times, and let me say again, Senator Stevens is a wonderful chairman of that committee and he has been enormously helpful, I think doing a terrific job, as are other members of that Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd and others, in difficult circumstances, putting together a disaster relief bill that extends a helping hand to people who desperately need help in this time. 
Mr. President, my hope is that when we convene at 2 o'clock, we will proceed through this bill and probably be able to talk some people out of offering amendments that might load this bill down and not allow it to get passed on an expeditious basis. My hope is perhaps at the end of next week all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike who care about this, can join the President in a bill-signing ceremony that says we did what we were supposed to do. We did what was necessary. This Government extended a helping hand to people who were down and out, flat on their back, who needed help, and that there were not intramural political games being played here, there and everywhere that would delay and do the things that people so often and too often now expect of the Congress. 
I understand sometimes why the American people look at this process and become profoundly disappointed--profoundly disappointed--because almost everything that happens is someone thumping their chest saying, `I am the one that will save the Republic.' The fact is, what saves the Republic is the good will of men and women working together on common problems in this country in a sensible, thoughtful way. I hope that we will begin doing that and continue to do that not just on this bill but on bills that affect all of America and all of Americans. That is my hope. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Well, if the Senator from Minnesota would yield for a question. Mr. President, I spoke earlier this morning, and it is not my intention to upset anybody who might have another agenda, except to say that the most significant agenda at the moment is to deal with a lot of folks who have been put flat on their backs by an act of God they didn't expect or request--by floods, fires, and blizzards. In the State of North Dakota, for example, in Grand Forks, ND, an entire city evacuated. I was in the middle of a town in a boat, a town of 50,000 people in which nobody lived. Water was up to the eaves trough in some of the houses. You could barely see the tip of the roof. It was the most remarkable thing I have ever seen. It was a most devastating circumstance--except for loss of life. Thank God, we didn't have much loss of life. 
Family after family are losing their homes, their personal property. Many of them lost everything they had. But they haven't lost hope. Part of the hope is that we will do what is necessary to extend a helping hand to folks, to say that you are not alone, the rest of the country cares about you. As we have done with others around this country, in fires, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other disasters, we have said here is some significant help to get you on your feet and help rebuild and recover and give you some hope. 
To the Senator from Minnesota, I ask this: We have had tens of thousands of people in North Dakota displaced as a result of the floods, and the resulting fires as well. I assume that the similar circumstance exists--in East Grand Forks, the entire city was evacuated. I know the Senator has some numbers on evacuations. But is it not the case that Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota probably suffered the most significant natural disaster we have had in the history of our three States?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today once again to talk about the disaster that has occurred in the northern Great Plains, specifically South Dakota, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and to talk just a bit about the need for us to proceed with a disaster appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, this poster is of a North Dakota farmer standing in front of a 20-foot snowbank. This happens to be level ground. You could not tell that much by what the poster looks like. Three years of snow falling in 3 months in North Dakota, capped by the worst blizzard in 50 years, which in many parts of the State added 2 more feet of snow. That created a set of conditions that resulted in the disastrous flooding that now occurs. 
This is a farmer standing in his yard, backgrounded by a 20-foot snowbank. Unless you are there and have seen it, have seen the 40- and 50-mile-an-hour winds with 60 and 80 below windchills that have created this kind of situation, you really do not understand how it results in this. This is the Wahpeton-Breckenridge area, right on the border of the Red River. You will see the downtown area, and you will see that the downtown is completely under water. 
This is a picture just north of Fargo, ND, which gives a sense that in an area as flat as a table top, the Red River Valley, the flood waters expanded to cover virtually everything. This little city of Harwood built a ring dike, and you will see that this tiny town of Harwood is not inundated, but you will see the rest of the Red River Valley is flooded. As the rivers course through Fargo, first Wahpeton, then Fargo, and on up to Grand Forks, you see now a picture of downtown Grand Forks, ND, with a fireman up to his waist in water. This is a downtown street. He is fighting a fire that consumed an entire city block. Firefighters, experiencing hypothermia, in ice-cold sewage-infested water--because the sewers backed up throughout the city, and the system collapsed--were trying to fight a fire without equipment. A firemen named Randy said, `Normally, when we fight a fire, water is our ally. In this case, we did not have water to pump.' They tried to fight fires in multistory buildings, standing up to their waist in water in some cases, with fire extinguishers. What a valiant and heroric effort they made. But of course this city was inundated. 
I and some others have been in the downtown area of this city in a boat. One boat I was in, operated by the Coast Guard, ran into a car--ran over the hood of the car. The only thing you could see of the car was 2 inches of the radio antenna sticking above the water. That is how we knew the boat hit a car on a downtown street so deep with the water. 
The reason I come to the floor to show you these pictures and to tell you about the people of my region is that it is important, as we have done in every other disaster--earthquakes, floods, fire, and tornadoes--to extend a helping hand by the American people to this region to say we know what is happening to you and we want to help you. You are not alone. The rest of the country extends a helping hand to try to help you through this crisis. 
It is not about buildings and snowbanks. It is about little boys, about grandpas and grandmas, about wage earners, working couples. A little boy, 7 years old, sitting in front of an airplane hangar at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, lost his home, and was looking at the ground dejected when I came to him and visited the shelter where thousands of people had been evacuated. The little boy knew his home was under water and he had nowhere to go. Not much hope. Eyes filled with tears. An older woman named Vi, a wonderful woman, a wonderful woman, on the phone when I met her, calling FEMA for help. Her eyes were filled with tears talking about what she had lost. So many others who have lost so much. Everything they have built, everything they have invested in, everything they have saved, inundated and devastated by a flood that came and stayed. 
This region is just now finally beginning to start thinking about rebuilding. I was on the phone half an hour ago with a fellow who just got into his home and is pumping out his basement and trying to assess the damage. 
Now, we have an opportunity in this Congress to pass a bill called a disaster supplemental appropriations bill. We have done that in the past. I, from North Dakota, have been pleased to vote for and support disaster supplemental appropriations for people who have been victims of earthquakes, floods, fires and tornadoes across this country because I think we need to say to them, `We offer hope, we want to help.' 
Let me say, as the Appropriations Committee begins this process, I am enormously grateful for the chairman and the ranking member of that committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, and so many other members of the committee who have worked diligently on this issue and worked with us and cooperated in a manner that one can only hope for. Thanks to them, thanks for the wonderful work they have done in order to put together a supplemental appropriations bill. We need to do much more because we do not know the entire extent of the damages. In the coming days, we will continue to work to do much more, to add money for the community development block grants, EDA and others, so we continue to appreciate very much the cooperation of the chairman and the ranking members and others on a bipartisan basis. 
Mr. President, I am worried now because we were told this morning that there are some who want to add four very controversial amendments having nothing at all to do with floods, fires, winter storms, and disaster. They want to add four very controversial amendments to this disaster supplemental bill. When President Clinton came to North Dakota last week, one of the things he said is, `Let us pass a disaster supplemental bill, let the Federal Government extend a helping hand, and let us make sure that no one in Congress is tempted to add extraneous or unrelated amendments that would hold it up.' Well, I worry now, because what we were told this morning is that there are those who want to add four amendments, all very controversial, all of them or any of which could trip up this bill. Those people, with tears in their eyes but hope in their hearts because they feel that we are going to extend a helping hand, do not, do not, do not deserve to have anyone meddle with this kind of legislation. 
Let us, all of us, decide when disaster strikes, when 
tragedy visits any region of this country, any group of Americans, that we must rise as one to say, `Let us help. You are not alone. Let us be there with you.' That is what this bill is. 
Again, I started by saying I so much appreciate the cooperation of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, the ranking member, Senator Byrd, and so many others, especially the staff and others, who worked so hard on this kind of legislation. Our job now is to get it up, out, and moving and get it to the President and get it signed and get the help moving to these folks in this region of the country to say to them, `We want to help you rebuild. We want to help in your recovery. We want to help you rebuild your dreams, your hopes. We want to help your family recover.' That is our responsibility. That is our requirement. Let us not, any of us, let us not be tempted to decide that this is an opportunity to meddle with some kind of amendment that has nothing to do, at all, with disaster and tragedy. 
I, today, call on all of my colleagues, each and every one of my colleagues, to decide this disaster supplemental bill ought to be passed, we ought to pass it soon, and we ought to get it signed into law to offer help and hope to those people who have suffered so much. If there are those who have other agendas, there is time, plenty of time, to address those agendas--the next day, next week, the next month. There is plenty of opportunity to bring any idea, any amendment, any agenda they have, to the floor of the Senate. But do not load this supplemental appropriations bill with extraneous and unrelated controversial amendments that will either stop or slow down the help that we intend to send on the way to the victims of this disaster. 
I hope in these coming hours, as we talk through the issues that were discussed this morning, proposed amendments to the supplemental appropriations bill, I hope that all of us in this Chamber will come to the same result: Passing a disaster appropriations bill, a supplemental bill, to respond to this disaster is critically important. It ought to be done and done now, without anyone in this Chamber using it as an opportunity to advance an agenda that has nothing to do with the disaster supplemental bill. I call on my colleagues for that level of cooperation. I thank all of them for their help. The people I represent in this region of the country will be enormously grateful for what this Congress will do in extending a helping hand to people who have suffered so much. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just returned from my home State of North Dakota. And I know my colleague has spoken as well about the challenges that we are facing in North Dakota and in our region as a result of the disasters that have occurred. I wanted to visit with my colleagues and explain to those who watch these proceedings what is happening in this State, and in this region. 
North Dakota, as everyone knows who has watched the news in the last couple of weeks, has been dealt about as tough a blow as you can deal a State or region with a series of tough storms, floods, and fires. 
It is normally, for those who visit and especially those of us who live there, a State blessed with enormous beauty and with sturdy, determined, and wonderful people. But for much of the past 6 months our State has been hit with some of the worst weather known to man. We have been hit with five to seven major blizzards, and additional minor blizzards, during this winter. 
This photograph is of a farmer in North Dakota who stands on flat ground. But as you can see, the snowdrift is somewhere around 15 to 18 feet high on his farm. He sent me the picture just to demonstrate what kind of snow has come to his farm, and what these blizzards and winds have done to him. These nine blizzards that we have seen have dropped 3 years' worth of snow in North Dakota, and in 3 months. Anyone who knows about North Dakota winters knows that we have some pretty difficult days in the winter from time to time. 
But when you give us 3 years' worth of snow, over 10 feet of snow in a several-month period, that is an enormous quantity of moisture, and if that was not bad enough, that 3 years' worth of snow this winter arrived after 4 straight years of rainfall that was far above normal. So that snow fell on a ground that was already saturated. So when the spring thaw came, there was nowhere for melting snow to go. 
Most Americans have now seen on the front pages of their newspapers and on their television sets and heard on radio news programs the result of all this. Today I want to report to you on some of the things that you may not have seen. 
This is an aerial view of Harwood, ND. This is just a few miles north of Fargo, ND. This is land that is in the Red River Valley, some of the most fertile land in our entire country. It is flat as a table top. There is not a hill that you can see anywhere. And you can see what has happened. This city of Harwood, incidentally, is one of the only cities that built a little ring dike and you can see that this city is dry. It is a very small community but the flood is all around it. It gives you some dimension of this flood. I have flown over the flood about three or four times in the last week or so and all you see are miles and miles and miles of water. And you cannot see any evidence of a river. The tiny river, which is the Red River, normally not very substantial at all, has now become a 200-mile lake. 
I want to talk to you about the scope of the disaster. There isn't anything that I have seen, and I have seen a fair number of disasters, both in North Dakota and around the country, that compares with it. It is deeper, it is wider and it is longer reaching with longer-term implications than any I have ever seen, and it touches almost everybody and everything. The people who keep statistics on these things tell me that about 20 percent of North Dakotans have been severely affected by this ongoing disaster. The damage to property alone will likely exceed $1 billion and probably run into the several billions of dollars if you include all of the other ancillary problems that will result from this including preventing planting for agricultural crops and more. 
Property damage is just one part of the story, and one of the reasons I have come to the Senate Chamber today is to say that even though we have lost a staggering amount of property in these floods, much more than property has been and is being destroyed. This is a challenge to our State and our region's economy that is unlike any other challenge I have ever seen. 
It is really a significant blow to an economy of a region in our country. The disaster is, of course, in our cities but it is also on our farms. You have seen the pictures of the cities and you perhaps know that Grand Forks, ND, the second-largest city with 50,000 people, is now virtually a ghost town. 
Two days ago, in the City of Grand Forks--and this picture, by the way, is a picture of one of the bridges. None of the bridges are usable in Grand Forks. All of the bridges are closed and most of them are underwater. This is just before this bridge went underwater. But you will see the Red River inundates all of the buildings on all sides of the river. 
Two days ago I was in a boat on the main street of Grand Forks, ND, with the water, I would guess, up to a person's neck. I was not out standing in it. I was in a Coast Guard boat. We ran over a car, as a matter of fact, ran over the top of a car and did not know what we hit. We knew we hit something with this Coast Guard boat, and we looked back and saw there was an antenna, a radio antenna of a car sticking out of the water about 2 inches. That is how we knew we hit a car in this boat. Cars are under the water, submerged under the water on the main street of this town. And it demonstrates what this town faces. It is a community of 50,000 people where there is no water, no sewer system, and no electricity in most of the town. Virtually all of the people were evacuated during this flood. 
So when you go through this community, you discover a town of 50,000 people with no one home and most of the houses and businesses submerged or with water up to their windows, in some cases up to the eves troughs. Most people have seen pictures of the destruction of this city. And it is only one city, as you know. 
We have seen the destruction of the downtown area of Grand Forks, with a fire in the buildings which destroyed nearly a city block. This is a picture of the firemen in Grand Forks who were fighting the fire in waist-deep floods. I talked to the fire chief and to some firemen and almost nowhere will firefighters be confronted with standing in ice-cold water, water up to their waist and their chest, water filled with sewage, water filled with fuel, standing their trying to fight a fire, incidentally, without water in their fire hoses. Some of these valiant firefighters were trying to fight a fire that was destroying an entire city block with fire extinguishers because that was all the tools they had at their disposal. 
Well, you have seen the pictures of what occurred in downtown Grand Forks. That is only part of the story. The other part of the story is a picture of North Dakota farms. This is a picture of a North Dakota farm and, of course, it looks like a picture of the Great Lakes. There is, indeed, a barn and a silo, but all of the rest of what is farmland now appears for all other purposes like a lake because it is all underwater. 
We have a substantial disaster on our farms. During all of these massive blizzards and the flooding, farmers and ranchers in North Dakota alone have lost over 150,000 head of cattle--150,000 head of livestock dead from these storms. 
By itself, that would categorize this winter as a pretty tough winter, but there is much more. The damage to farm buildings, farm homes, barns, and granaries from the most recent blizzard alone is estimated to be about $21 million, according to early estimates. 
As you know, about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks ago, just as the spring thaw began to occur and just as calving season began in North Dakota on our farms and ranches, we were hit with a blizzard that dumped up to 20 and in some cases 24 inches of snow on our State, with 50 and 60 mile an hour winds and another whiteout blizzard where people could not see. Of course, now all of that is beginning to melt and it has caused, along with all of the other moisture, the catastrophic flooding in our State. 
This is another picture of what is farmland, probably land on which either wheat or sugar beets or potatoes are grown in the Red River Valley. Now, we are at a time of the year when people should be in the fields with tractors and seeders, planting. Instead, their fields are flooded. We have 1.7 million acres under water at this point and much of those 1.7 million acres of flooded farmland will probably not be planted this year at all. That is a very difficult blow to our agricultural economy. 
Where oceans of wheat would wave in the wind, we now have oceans of water this spring in the Red River Valley. And when the water does recede, it is still going to take weeks to get into those fields. It is going to be touch and go as to whether much of them will be planted this year. 
Those are some statistics and images of the disaster with respect to dead cattle, inundated farm land, ravaged cities. 
Much of the disaster is also taking place in our small towns. Towns like Pembina and Drayton, and Harwood and scores like them in North Dakota, all have had to fight these floods in 1997. In fact, in Pembina and Drayton right now as I speak the crest is just beginning. Up in the Pembina area, they are fighting like the devil to try to save their homes. They have been evacuated. They have had to abandon most of the sandbag lines, and it appears that this entire city will have to be completely evacuated, and whatever the flood does to Pembina it does to Pembina. All of us are hoping and praying that that small community is able to get through this, but because of the evacuation we will not know what the fate of Pembina, ND, is until the water is gone. 
There is a meeting this weekend that President Clinton is hosting with President Ford and President Bush and Colin Powell and others on the issue of voluntarism. That meeting could probably learn a lot from the last several weeks in North Dakota. The general who heads the Corps of Engineers told me that up and down the Red River Valley, in Wahpeton, Breckenridge, Fargo-Moorhead, and on, he said he has never seen a more aggressive flood fight by people than he has in the Red River Valley this year. Thousands and thousands of people have decided to volunteer their time to be on sandbag lines and to do all of the things that are necessary to help build dikes and try to fight this flood. So what I want to do is talk a little about the people in North Dakota as well, and some of the real heroes in our State that we do not hear quite as much about. 
I have described a little about all of these volunteers. I want to talk a little about some of them as well. 
I spoke in this Chamber one day some while ago after we had another one of those whiteout blizzards in North Dakota, the kind that came raging in and no one could see their hand in front of their face. That is called a whiteout blizzard, the wind blowing 50 miles an hour and snowing. You cannot see a thing. It is dangerous and takes lives and kills livestock. 
I told them about a fellow named Don Halvorson, who is a farmer near Grafton, ND, and a woman named Jan Novak, who was going home from work at 10 in the evening. She drove into this whiteout blizzard outside of Grafton, ND, could not see, and pulled off the road and became stuck. There she was at 10 or 11 at night in a desperate blizzard, temperatures were way below zero with massive winds. And she told me that she prayed and prayed and she worried very much that she may not survive this. 
The county sheriff got a call from Jan Novak's husband who said that his wife had not returned home and he was very worried about her being lost in the blizzard. The county sheriff began a search with members of law enforcement and they discovered that they could not search because they could not see anything either. They could not be on the roads because there was no visibility. They began to call the farms up and down the line where she might have driven, and they called a farm that was operated by Don Halvorson and his wife. Don was in bed; it was 3 a.m. They woke him up and asked him if he had seen Jan Novak. He did not know her, of course. But they said she was out in this blizzard and had not been heard from. And he, of course, said, no, he had not seen her, and he went back to bed. 
He told me that he laid there but could not sleep, and so at 3:30 a.m. he got back up. He bundled himself up, went out in this whiteout blizzard, got on his tractor that had a cab over it. And in his tractor without visibility beyond his front wheels he went up and down the roads looking for Jan Novak, for 3 hours. And at 6:30 in the morning Jan Novak said she thought at that point she may not get out of this. And her head was bowed and she was praying in her car in the middle of this raging blizzard, and this Don Halvorson drove up in his tractor. She saw the tractor and this fellow who did not know her but could not sleep at 3:30 in the morning because someone was out there, rescued her, saved her life. And she said if you ever think prayers don't matter, when I saw this fellow I didn't know driving this tractor, risking his life in this blizzard to save mine, I now understand about the power of prayer. 
You do not hear so much about heroes these days, I suppose, but people like Don Halvorson really deserve to be mentioned because they do things for each other that save lives and make life better. And the only way you can really survive in these tough times is to have people like Don Halvorson and Jan Novak and others who care about each other. 
Another hero is Jeff Differdin. He is a Valley City snow plow operator. During the blizzard just 3 weeks ago, Jeff drove his snow plow up and down interstate 94--the interstate had long been closed; nobody could see anything--searching for a car that had been stranded for more than 6 hours. They were worried about the safety of the people in that car. 
The visibility was so poor, he learned later that he once had driven within 8 feet of that car but couldn't see it in a whiteout blizzard. He kept looking, kept looking, risked his life and finally found that car and saved all of the occupants. 
I was in Mandan, ND, and met the fellows who went out and saved a little boy in the middle of a raging blizzard, with a snowbank 15 feet high over a road. A little boy was suffering a severe and acute medical problem and would have died from it had he not gotten to a hospital, except the problem was he was miles and miles and miles away from the hospital. And between him and the hospital, in a whiteout blizzard, was a 15-foot snowdrift. Two ambulance crews and two road crews of volunteers went looking for that boy. They plowed through from both sides of this 15-foot drift and got him out and got him to a hospital and saved his life. I talked about those folks a while ago on the floor of the Senate as well. 
I would also like to talk just for a moment about the 27 members of the Grand Forks Fire Department. I mean, they are real-life, big-size heroes of the last few weeks. That blaze that raged through downtown Grand Forks Saturday and Sunday, a lot of people don't know--they know they fought a blaze, this fire department, under heroic conditions. A lot of people do not know, in those buildings, in the downtown that was destroyed--and here is a picture of the firemen, you can see, fighting the fire in water up to their waists, sewage-infested water, ice cold water. An entire city block burned. I saw that block the other day from a boat, sitting right in front of it. It looks like the pictures of Dresden in World War II. These firemen saved the lives of 20 people, pulled them out of those buildings and fought that fire for 16 hours in contaminated, freezing water, so cold it was causing hypothermia. 
They did not have, as some fire departments do, waterproof hip-waders. That is not what they were standing in that water in. They did not have, necessarily, all the right equipment. And they did not have water to fight the fire with. One of those young firemen said to me, `You know, normally water is our ally. When we see a fire, as firefighters, we know what we are going to do. Water is our ally. We were standing in waist deep water and had no water to use.' So they improvised. A portable water gun was brought in and mounted on a nearby parking garage, and they fought it with that for a while and with their fire extinguishers. They had to hook up the water gun, groping around in the dark to find a fire hydrant. They plugged it in, and then the water main failed, so they fought the fire with fire extinguishers. 
Then they got big crash trucks in from the Grand Forks airport and from the Grand Forks Air Force Base on a flatbed trailer. It was raised up so they could bring it in through the water. One of the Grand Forks Fire Department's own pumper trucks was brought in, hauled by a 5-ton National Guard truck. At that point the firefighters finally began to make some headway, after an entire block of downtown Grand Forks was destroyed. 
These folks fought that fire as beams were falling and bricks were falling and crashing into the surging flood water that was raging around them. This flood water that they are in, I must tell you, the current is so incredibly strong that when they go down an intersection and face the current, they have to crab a boat deeply into the intersection, just to get across the intersection. That describes the current, and these folks were standing in that current fighting this fire. Even as they fought this fire by getting some helicopters to come in and dump some fire retardant chemicals on those burning buildings, those firefighters were still there, underneath those helicopters, fighting that fire. 
I cannot think of a more difficult set of circumstances in which someone would ever have to fight a fire, but they did, for 16 hours. They limited the loss. Yes, they lost a city block and they lost some other buildings and they have had to fight other fires since, home fires in a city of 50,000 where no one lives and 
where homes had to be evacuated. 
The Grand Forks Fire Chief, Richard Aulich, and 27 members of his department, are people, I think, who an entire nation would say represent the finest in public service and heroism. 
The more than 100 workers from the Corps of Engineers, public servants, Federal employees--more than 100 workers from the Corps of Engineers were waging flood fights in 80 locations up and down the Red River Valley. 
There were also 11 people in the basement of a building in Grand Forks who kept a telephone service working, a building that was flooded like the rest of town. These 11 people stayed in that building 5 days to keep telephone service working. It was critical for public safety. They are heroes, employees of U.S. West, who kept telephone service for the FAA, for FEMA, for all the emergency workers. They kept it up and operating during that entire flood. 
In Fargo, ND, in the middle of the night, Sylvia Hove's son-in-law discovered that the dike in her backyard was leaking and he put in a call to the police department. He flagged down, actually, Fargo Police Officer Lt. John Sanderson, and then Lt. Sanderson radioed for help. At 4 in the morning, Sgt. Wayne Jorgenson and a number others showed up. They had just completed working an exhausting shift. But rather than going home, they rushed to Mrs. Hove's home and they sandbagged furiously at 4:30 in the morning on this ruptured dike and prevented the dike from breaking. Eventually that dike broke and Sylvia lost her home. I know Sylvia Hove. They fought a valiant fight. The point is, at 4:30 in the morning when a leak developed, they put out a call and police officers just finishing their shift rushed to that scene to help sandbag. 
There are legions of heroes in North Dakota, fighting this battle even today, whose names we will not know and I cannot give here because they are ordinary people who, in extraordinary times, demonstrated uncommon courage. 
I want to mention the men and women at the Grand Forks Air Force Base. I have talked about how much a part they are of the community in Grand Forks. There is no better example of that than what they have done. I was at the Air Force base where they have three hangars where evacuees from the city are living on cots, 1,000 people in each hangar. But more than that, the people who live on the Air Force base have actually gone to the hangers and said, `Come live in our homes,' and taken people into their homes. The day before yesterday there was a farmer and his wife from Thompson, ND, 15 miles away, who were standing outside of the hangar. They said, we have come because we know there are evacuees. We have taken one family in and we have room in our home for a second family and we have come to get them and offer them our home. That's the kind of thing that was happening on the Grand Forks Air Force Base. 
There are boys and girls from our high schools, junior high schools, senior high schools and colleges, from all over the Red River Valley who have worked their hearts out sandbagging, helping save their towns. There is an 8-year-old girl and her 7-year-old brother who squatted on the ground for 2 hours at `Sandbag Central' in Fargo, holding empty sandbags open as the men and women filled those sandbags. 
Two men from back East here, who were going to Montana to take new jobs, heard the radio reports and diverted in North Dakota and showed up in Fargo and said they were there to help fight the floods, and they spent their days sandbagging rather than driving to the next job. There were the women who baby-sat for free and caregivers and others, men and women, who helped other moms and dads with child care to fight the flood; employers who gave workers time off. The North Dakota colleges and universities--incidentally, who have dismissed for the year--made their facilities available for the flood fight. 
What is happening here is North Dakotans and others who have come to our State have reached out and responded in this crisis. They have helped sandbag. They have donated money and canned goods 
and clothes. All of these efforts in their own way are heroic. 
As I finish, again, 2 days ago, when I was in Grand Forks, ND, and I took a boat tour of the downtown, a fellow who--President Clinton came to North Dakota on Tuesday. I appreciated it. It was a wonderful thing for him to do and was a real morale booster for people who were terribly tired and fatigued but still facing this crisis. As I came out of this boat the day before yesterday, there was a fellow laying on the grass in Grand Forks. The Coast Guard had just pulled him out. He had been in his home all of these days. When the evacuation order came, he was stubborn. He said, `I am not leaving my home.' He was up there in the second floor and would not leave. So for days he was there with no electricity, no water, stuck in his home. He said, `I saw this current going down the street. My home is flooded. I saw this current.' He said, `I saw dead cows come past my home. I saw telephone poles. I saw ice jams the size of semi trucks come past my home.' 
Then he said, `You know, you really need to tell the President what is happening up here.' 
I said, `Sir, the President was just here yesterday.' 
He said, `You're kidding me.' 
Of course, he had been out of radio contact with anybody and had no idea what was happening in his city, because he had been living in the middle of that flood. 
The extraordinary spirit, I think, and the steady strength of North Dakotans as they endure and persevere to meet this crisis is something that all Americans will remember. 
I want to close just with two requests. 
Those who have written to my office and my colleagues' offices asking how they can help--there are many ways they can help. Yesterday, someone sent a letter to my office with a check for $1,000 made out to North Dakota. What he said was 60 years ago, as a young man, this fellow had been helped by a North Dakotan. He said, `I have never forgotten it, so I just want to pay North Dakota. I want to help North Dakota. Please send this to the right place.' 
This morning as I just left my office, a couple of other envelopes showed up from people around the country saying, `Can you get these to the right place to help North Dakotans?' What a wonderful thing it is. 
I will just tell people, the Red Cross is doing wonderful work in our State, and the director of the Red Cross indicates they need help. The Salvation Army is, as always, doing wonderful work. And other charitable organizations that do this kind of relief work do a great deal of work in this kind of crisis. They just do a wonderful job. I encourage people to be supportive of them. 
I ask, as the north part of North Dakota now and the Canadian provinces who are, even this morning, evacuating, I believe 15,000 people in Winnipeg, I ask the American people to offer their prayers of strength and hope to the people who are continuing to fight this flood. This region of the country will suffer the consequences of these disasters for some long while. We have met with the President. We visited again yesterday with President Clinton. We have been meeting with appropriators. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, is working on a disaster relief bill we will mark up on Tuesday in the Senate Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member. I think this Congress will do what it has done in all previous disasters, extend the helping hand of our country to say to a region, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, `You have been dealt a tough blow, but you are not alone. The rest of the country understands and is prepared to help, is prepared to help you recover and get back on your feet.' That is part of the generous spirit of our country, to reach out and help others in times of need. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. President Reagan began the negotiations on this treaty. President Bush signed it. And President Clinton sent it to the Senate for our advice and consent. 
We do a lot of things in this Chamber. Some of them are small and rather insignificant. But we also do some very big and important things and make some big and important decisions. The vote this evening on this treaty is a very significant decision for the people of America and also people around the world. 
There are some who have opposed virtually all efforts in all cases to limit arms. They vote against all of the arms control treaties, believing that they are not in our country's best interests. I think they were wrong, and I think they have been proven wrong in a number of areas. 
In previous arms control agreements, we have achieved significant success in reducing the nuclear threat against this country. I held up in this Chamber--in fact, somewhere right near this spot--not too many months ago a large piece of 
metal that I held up from that missile is metal that comes from the scrap heap because the missile does not exist any longer. 
In the missile silo that existed, in the hole in the ground in the Ukraine, that hole in the ground which contained a missile with a warhead ensconced in that silo, there is now simply dirt. And in that dirt are planted sunflowers--no missile, no silo--sunflowers. 
Now, why are sunflowers planted where a missile was once planted, a missile with a nuclear warhead aimed at the United States of America? Because of an arms control agreement which required that that missile be destroyed. So sunflowers exist where a missile once stood poised, aimed at our country. 
Arms control agreements have worked. This particular convention which we will vote to ratify today would eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. 
One could come to the floor of the Senate today and hold up a vial of sarin gas, and if one should drop that vial of gas on this desk and it would break, those in this room might not be leaving the room; they might not survive. If someone came here with a vial and a gas mask and wore the mask and appropriate protective clothing, then they would suffer no consequences. 
My point is, who are the most vulnerable in our world when there is a poison gas or chemical weapon attack? The population of ordinary citizens is the most vulnerable. There are armies, if forewarned, that can defend themselves against it, but the mass population of citizens in our countries is extraordinarily vulnerable to the most aggressive poison gas and chemical weapons known to mankind. 
There are a lot of arguments that have been raised against this convention, but none of them make much sense. Our country has already decided to destroy our stockpile of poison gas and chemical weapons. We have already made that decision. President Reagan made that decision. We are in the process of finishing that job. The question before the Senate is whether we will join in a treaty ratified already by over 70 other countries, whether we will decide to work to eliminate chemical weapons and poison gas from the rest of the world, to decide that if ever American men and women who wear a uniform in service of our country go abroad or go somewhere to defend our country, they will not be facing an attack by chemical weapons or poison gas. 
That is what this debate is about. This is not a small or an insignificant issue. This is an attempt by our country and others to join together to ban an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. 
Mr. President, I have spoken several times in this Chamber about the vote that we are to take today. This vote is late. This debate should have taken place long ago, but it did not. We pushed and agitated and pushed and pushed some more to get it to the floor of the Senate because we face a critical end date of April 29. 
I commend those who finally decided to join with us and bring this to the floor for a debate, but now as we proceed through several amendments and then final passage, it is important for the future of this country, for my children and the children of the world, that this Senate cast a favorable vote to ratify the treaty that comes from this convention. It will be a better world and a safer world if we do that. 
I want to commend those who have worked on this in Republican and Democratic administrations, those whose view of foreign policy is that it is a safer world if we together, jointly, reduce the threats that exist in our world. Yes, the threat from nuclear weapons. We have done that in arms control treaties. Those treaties are not perfect, but we have made huge progress. And now, also, the threat of chemical weapons and poison gas. 
I am proud today to cast a vote for a treaty that is very significant, and I hope sufficient numbers of my colleagues will do the same. I hope that the news tomorrow in our country will be that the United States of America has joined 74 other countries in ratifying this critically important treaty for our future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to ask if someone at the Federal Reserve Board might be willing to spend a quarter and buy the Washington Post and read the article on the front page above the fold on the left side. If they are unwilling to do that, I will at least read the headline for them: `Consumer Prices Nearly Flat in March.' 
Why is this headline important? Because the most recent tax increase imposed in Washington, DC, was imposed by Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and his Board of Governors, who, meeting weeks ago, in a frenzy decided that the problem in our country is that our economy is growing too rapidly, there are too many people working and too few people unemployed and our economy is moving too rapidly. Their solution: Increase interest rates, impose a higher interest rate charge on every single American for every purpose. Of course, that is, in effect, imposing a tax on everybody, isn't it? The difference is, if somebody were to propose a new tax, it would have to be done here in the open, in debate. But in this dinosaur we call the Federal Reserve Board, it is done behind closed doors, in secret, outside of the view of the public, by a bunch of folks in gray suits, coming from their banking backgrounds, or as economists, peer through their glasses and try and see what the future holds. The future is no clearer to them than it was to the augurs in Roman times when practicing the rites called augury. These high priests would read the entrails of birds, the entrails of cattle, observe the flights of foul in order to portend the future. 
Well, we now have economists who, of course, practice the study of economics. I sometimes refer to it as `psychology pumped up with a little helium.' The economists now tell us what the future will hold. What does the future hold for us? The economists at the Federal Reserve Board, believed by the Board of Governors, say that our country is moving too fast. It is like that Simon and Garfunkel tune, `Feeling Groovy,' although I doubt that they would play that there. It says, `Slow down, you're moving too fast * * *' The country is moving too fast, they say --2 1/2 , 3 percent economic growth. Lord, what is going to happen if we have 3 percent sustainable economic growth? You can't do that because the Fed wants to put the brakes on. They want people to pay higher interest rates to slow our country down. 
You know, the Federal Reserve Board had told us forever that if unemployment dropped below 6 percent, what would happen? A new wave of inflation would come. Unemployment has been below 6 percent for 30 months; inflation is going down. The Consumer Price Index is nearly flat. In fact, Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says to us, `I think the Consumer Price Index overstates the rate of inflation by probably 1 full percent and maybe a percent and a half.' If that's the case, there is no inflation in our country. If there is no inflation in our country, why did those folks go behind the closed doors, lock it up, do their banking business in secret, and come out and announce to us that they were imposing a new tax on every American in the form of a higher interest rate? 
I ask the Fed today to buy a paper, read the story, convene a meeting and put interest rates where they ought to be. Your Federal funds rate is a full one-half of 1 percent, and now, after your last action, nearly three-quarters of 1 percent above where it ought to be, given the rate of inflation. What does that mean? It 
is a premium imposed on the American people--a tax in the form of higher interest. It is imposed on every American, without public debate. 
I urge the Federal Reserve Board to meet again with the new information and understand what some of us have been talking about for some long while: Your models are wrong. The world has changed. We don't have upward pressures on wages in our country; we have downward pressures on wages in our country. That is why you don't see consumer prices spiking up. We now exist in a global economy in which American workers are asked to compete against workers elsewhere around the world. It is not unusual for American workers to produce a product, to go into a department store to compete against a product produced in a foreign country by a 14-year-old child being paid 14 cents an hour, working 14 hours a day in an unsafe factory. It is a global economy. Unfair? Yes. But it is a global economy that now puts downward pressure on American wages. That is why consumer prices are not spiking up. That is why the Federal Reserve Board is wrong. 
The Federal Reserve Board ought to countenance more economic growth in this country. It can be done without reigniting the fires of inflation. It should be done by a Federal Reserve Board that cares more about all of the American people and economic growth and opportunity all across this country than it does about the interest of its constituents, the big money center banks. 
I did not intend to speak about this today, but when I bought the paper and saw the story, it occurred to me that someone ought to stand up and say to the Federal Reserve Board: You were wrong a couple of weeks ago. You ought to admit it. We don't accept your remedy. The American people know you are wrong because they understand what is happening in our economy. Our economy isn't growing too fast. If anything, the economic growth is too slow. We need fewer people unemployed and more people employed. We need more economic growth and more opportunity. I hope one day the Federal Reserve Board will adopt policies that will understand that. 
Now, we have a couple of vacancies coming at the Federal Reserve Board, and I expect that the Federal Reserve Board will fill the positions with people who essentially look the same, act the same, talk the same, and behave the same as all the other folks there. Take a look at who is at the Fed. In fact, I have brought for my colleagues to the floor a giant chart with pictures of the Board of Governors and regional Federal bank presidents, indicating where they are from, where they were educated, their salaries. I don't want them to be anonymous. I want the people to see who is making the decisions that affect all of their lives. 
Now we will have a couple of new people appointed to the Fed. Congress will have a little something to say about that. But the fact is, the nominations will be sent to us. I have said, and I say again, that I would recommend my Uncle Joe. The reason I recommend Uncle Joe is the Federal Reserve Board doesn't have anybody serving on the board like my Uncle Joe. My Uncle Joe actually has made a lot of things in his life. He fixed generators and starters on cars. He has a lot of common sense, understands what it is to start a business, borrow some money, make a product, sell a product. So I recommended my Uncle Joe. I have been doing that for a number of years and Joe hasn't gotten a call yet. So I expect that the Federal Reserve Board will not be blessed by the membership of my Uncle Joe. 
I say this because I would like to see some new blood at the Fed, some new energy and new direction that doesn't just buy into this mantra that what we need is more unemployment and slower economic growth, and somehow that represents the future of our country. The Fed is wrong. The numbers demonstrate that the Fed is wrong. I hope as we go down the road talking about this, as well as filling the positions at the Fed that are going to be open, we can have a broader discussion. I wanted to at least acknowledge today that this new information exists. I encourage the Fed to buy the morning paper. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Ashcroft has just outlined a provision that was included in the legislation enacted by the House of Representatives. Frankly, I think this addition improves the legislation that we introduced here in the Senate. The amendment that was accepted by the House and is in this legislation provides for the prevention of suicide, including assisted suicide. It provides authorization for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund research and demonstration projects using existing Public Health Service dollars to prevent suicide among people with disabilities or terminal or chronic illnesses. That amendment addresses an issue that is very significant and serious, and I think it adds to this legislation. 
With this legislation, we are not only saying that we want to prevent Federal funding of assisted suicide, but also that we want to improve the availability of compassionate end-of-life care so that terminally or chronically ill individuals do not feel that assisted suicide is their only option for relief. 
So I think this amendment is a good amendment, and I support it. 
Mr. President, I hope we can move along to final passage on this legislation. 
I don't know whether there are those who intend to offer amendments. I see Senator Wellstone from Minnesota is on the floor. My hope is that we can proceed on this noncontroversial piece of legislation and finish it today.

But I do want to follow, in the first 5 minutes or so, the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, on the issue of flooding. 
We intend, during this hour, to talk about the chemical weapons treaty and the critical vote that will be coming up on that in the Senate next week on that issue. I will get to that.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, let me respond to the issue of flooding. The Senator from Minnesota said it very well. I was with him as we toured part of the Red River Valley last week. 
The Red River, which is one of the only rivers that I know of that flows north, flows into a watershed up north that is still frozen. The Red River often has problems with flooding. We often cope with the challenges of dealing with a flood in the Red River. But this is a flood of historic proportions, a century flood, on the heels of a winter in which we had five to seven blizzards, the last of which a week and a half ago put, in many cases, up to 20 inches of snow in our region. 
A massive flood, the worst blizzard in 50 years, massive power outages all around the region, and then you understand a little about the challenges faced by people in the Northern Great Plains. 
This has been very, very difficult. The Red River today has turned into a lake that is now 200 miles long. If you fly over it, it is almost inappropriate to characterize it as a river. It is a 200-mile lake that is held in by the heroic efforts of some people to fill bags with sand and stack them on top of each other and hope that that sandbagging will keep water from their homesteads, their farms or their houses. 
Also, there are the heroic efforts of the Corps of Engineers, contracting with wonderful contractors to build emergency dikes. It is some effort in North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota to watch the fight to stem the tide of this difficult flood. 
Last weekend, I was in a shelter in Grafton, ND, where people had gone in order to seek refuge. They had been for days without any electricity in their homes. An 89-year-old woman living alone in her home had finally decided, `I must go to a shelter.' I talked to her, and typical of the tough, gritty Norwegian and German stock in North Dakota, she said, well, it was not so bad, that, you know, she was getting through it--89 years old, no complaints, fighting the flood, fighting the elements, living in a shelter, but she knew that we would get through this. And that is the spirit that exists in our part of the country. 
There was a woman in north Fargo named Sylvia Hove. Just before I left, to come back to the Senate here in DC for votes this week, I stopped by Sylvia's house. The amount of diking they had to do to keep the wall of water out from the back of her house and her backyard is truly extraordinary. Then, at 4 o'clock in the morning, with this very tall dike that they had built--and I helped pile some of the sandbags on that dike the week previous--the dike springs a leak. 
Sylvia's son, who is there from out of State, hailed down a policeman. The policeman put out the alert on the radio. And at 4 o'clock in the morning there were four policemen there, just like that. The policemen routed their cars, stacking sandbags, dealing with the leak in the dike until others came. 
It is the way that neighbors have helped neighbors, and, yes, in Minnesota, in Breckenridge, the North Dakota side, all up and down, especially the valley, the Red River Valley in North Dakota and Minnesota. 
Unfortunately, this is a flood that comes and stays. Most floods we see on television are some raging river, completely out of control, taking houses with it down the middle of the stream. That is not the way the flood on the Red River occurs. It is a river that runs north; it runs very, very slow. It has a very insignificant grade, and the result is the crest comes but the flood will stay for a long, long while. 
They will be fighting the flood in North Dakota and Minnesota yet for some weeks. It is truly a very significant challenge and a heroic effort on the part of mayors and city councils and young people and old folks and just ordinary folks who are doing extraordinary things to try to deal with this calamity. 
I was at a sandbagging operation in Grand Forks. They put out a call for volunteers. I went into this giant area where they have two big sandbagging operations. There must have been 200 volunteers there ranging from 15 years old, I think, probably to 80 years old, all of them working hard piling sandbags on trucks. It really is quite an extraordinary thing to see. 
There are a couple of outstanding issues. The head of the Corps of Engineers, Colonel Wonsik, called me last evening at home and gave me a description of where we are with respect to Wahpeton and Breckenridge, Fargo, Grand Forks, Grafton, Drayton, Pembina, all the way up and down the valley. He feels that they are making some progress, but it is an enormous challenge. 
The mayor of Fargo called me about an hour ago. Again, it is an enormous challenge, but they are fighting a significant battle. All of the preparation they are doing is preventing the enormous damage that could have been done had we not had the diking that is now in place. 
Some have asked the question about the emergency help that is going to be available on a 75 percent/25 percent ratio, 75 percent Federal, 25 percent State and local. The Governor had asked for a 90-10 ratio. I will just observe on that point the folks in FEMA and the administration have a formula: If the damage in a region goes above $40 million, then they go to a 90-10 formula. That will almost certainly occur in our region, probably has already occurred. That will be retroactive. So it is almost certain that our region will have this 90-10 formula in which the rest of the country reaches out in a disaster to say, we are here to help you, just as we have reached out on earthquakes and tornadoes and floods in other regions of our country. So that is something that is important. 
Second, the Internal Revenue Service has been very helpful. As you know, there was a traffic jam in the District of Columbia last night; people at midnight trying to post their income tax returns on time. The Internal Revenue Service extended the date for filing to May 30 in the Dakotas and Minnesota where disaster has been declared. That is going to be helpful. They indicated they did not have authority to waive the interest charge during that 45-day extension. 
I introduced a piece of legislation last evening in the Senate to waive that interest charge. It seems to me if the IRS says--and I appreciate the fact they have said it--that a tax return will be timely filed if it is filed by May 30, you ought not charge the interest on something you consider timely filed. So I would like to see that interest charge waived. 
But we very much appreciate the cooperation of the Internal Revenue Service. People out there trying to man dikes and fill sandbags and so on are not able to get back to find their records to file a tax return if they had not already done it. They have been working on this flood and responding to it now for several weeks, so we appreciate the cooperation of the Internal Revenue Service. 
I especially, as I conclude, want to echo the words of the Senator from Minnesota. The men and women in our region of the country have had about as tough a time as you can have this winter and now this spring. I am enormously proud of what they are doing. I have been privileged to be there the last two weekends and most of 
the week previous to be a part of that. We will get through it. North Dakotans and Minnesotans and South Dakotans are tough people who have faced tough challenges in the past. We will get through it and rebuild and have better days ahead of us.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, next week we will have an enormously important vote in the U.S. Senate. 
There are days when people come to the floor of the Senate and debate almost nothing or find almost nothing to debate about. But, of course, almost nothing can provoke a debate in the Senate. We tend to get involved in discussions back and forth and find reasons to dispute each other over the smallest word or the smallest nuance in a piece of legislation. Sometimes that is a little frustrating, especially if you came here wanting to do some important things and some big things. 
Next week we will do something important and tackle a big issue. It's the chemical weapons treaty. It is an attempt by a group of countries, hopefully including our country, to ban an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. 
The negotiation on a Chemical Weapons Convention to ban chemical weapons was begun by President Ronald Reagan. President Bush was active as Vice President and as President in supporting the treaty. The treaty was the great achievement of the last month of his administration. Today, he very strongly supports ratification. President Clinton back in 1993 submitted the treaty to the Senate for ratification. 
This treaty is the result of decades of negotiation and leadership by our country. The treaty which came from those negotiations needs to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, and it has been hanging around for some long while. It was supposed to be voted on last year, but it got caught up in Presidential politics. We need to ratify it by April 29 if we, as a country, are to be involved in the regime that sets up the monitoring and the processes by which this treaty is implemented. 
We are told that next week we will vote on this treaty. We also understand that it is going to be a close vote. I want to tell you why I think this is important. We will have several other Members of the Senate here in the next hour to describe why it is important from their standpoint. 
What are chemical weapons? Well, simply, they are poison gases, horrible weapons of war, highly toxic gases or liquids that can be used in bombs, rockets, missiles, artillery shells, mines, or grenades. This treaty says let us ban entirely poison gases, let us outlaw this class of weapons completely. 
Some do not like any treaties on arms. Some in this Senate will stand up and say we should not have arms treaties. Some have opposed START I, START II, the nuclear arms treaties. They are inappropriate, they say. 
Well, I held up on the floor of the Senate about a year ago a piece of metal about the size of my fist. The piece of metal came from a missile silo, a silo that housed a missile in Pervomaisk, Ukraine, a silo that held a missile with a nuclear warhead that was aimed at the United States of America. 
I held up a piece of that silo in my hand because the silo has been destroyed, the missile has been destroyed, the warhead is gone, and where a missile once sat, aimed at the United States of America, is now a patch of dirt planted with sunflowers. 
Why was a missile taken out, a silo destroyed, and sunflowers planted where there once was a missile aimed at the United States? Because the arms control treaties required it--required it--required that missiles be destroyed. We are destroying missiles on nuclear weapons. So is the former Soviet Union. The Ukraine is now nuclear free. The fact is, we have had success with arms control agreements. Are they perfect? No. 
Do they work? Yes. We have had success with arms control agreements. This is a treaty on arms control. We need to ratify it. We will vote on that next week. 
Let me describe, again, what this is about. It is a treaty to try to ban a class of weapons of mass destruction. Not many people probably know what chemical weapons are. I really don't. I have obviously not seen chemical weapons used. Very few people have. 
Let me read from a poet, Wilfred Owen, a famous poet from World War I, and the lines he wrote about a gas attack. Germany was the first nation in modern times to use chemical weapons, in the World War I battle at Ypres, a town in Belgium, April 22, 1915. It is said that a hissing sound came from German trenches as 6,000 cylinders spewed chlorine gas aimed at the allied lines. That is a gas that attacks the lungs, causes severe coughing and choking and death. It had a devastating effect on the allied soldiers, who were unprepared. Soldiers breathing that gas began to cough up blood, their faces turning purple, their bodies writhing in the trenches. There were 15,000 casualties that day, we are told. Chlorine gas, mustard gas, and blister gas caused a million casualties in World War I. 
Wilfred Owen, the poet, wrote a description of a gas attack in the First World War. A company of exhausted soldiers is marching back from the front lines, when suddenly someone shouts: 
`Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!' 
An ecstasy of fumbling, 
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling; 
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime. . . . 
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 
Behind the wagon we flung him in, 
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 
Of incurable sores on innocent tongues. . . . 
That is Wilfred Owen describing a gas attack, an attack using chemical weapons. 
Modern armies have the capability of protecting themselves in many circumstances against chemical weapons with protective devices and protective gear. 
But of course civilians are the most vulnerable to chemical weapons. Perhaps the example that most of us remember was the attack at the Tokyo subway by a terrorist group, a cult headquartered in Japan but active in America. They used the nerve gas sarin in a terrorist attack. The cult released the gas on March 20, 1995, during the morning rush hour at a busy Tokyo subway station. In that attack, 12 were killed, over 5,000 were injured. We are told that it was very close to a circumstance in which thousands would have been killed from that attack. We all remember the frightening television images of people staggering up out of the subway with their handkerchiefs over their mouths and collapsing on the street. Not surprisingly, the Japanese Diet, or parliament, ratified the chemical weapons treaty within a month of the Tokyo subway attack. 
This raises the question of why the Senate has yet to do the same. 
Why would people come to the floor of the Senate and say this is an inappropriate treaty and they intend to oppose it with every fiber of their being? Let me go through some of the myths we will hear about the chemical weapons treaty. 
Myth one: by ratifying the chemical weapons treaty the United 
States will surrender a vital deterrent to chemical attack. That is not true at all. This is not about our weapons. It is about other countries' weapons. President Reagan already made a decision back in the 1980's that we were going to get rid of our stock of chemical weapons. The question now is whether other countries will similarly abandon their stock of chemical weapons and join us in an approach that will verify that other countries in the world are not producing chemical weapons. 
Myth two: rogue states will refuse to join the treaty, so it will only tie our hands, not theirs. As I just indicated, we are not producing chemical weapons, we are destroying the stock of chemical weapons we now have. So it will not tie our hands. But the Chemical Weapons Convention will shrink the chemical weapon problem down to a few rogue states and help curb their ability to get the materials necessary to make chemical weapons. 
Some say if you cannot prevent murder why should you have a law against murder. Common sense says murder is wrong, you have a law that provides penalties for murder. The production of chemical gasses ought to be wrong and we ought to have a convention that says we intend as a country to be part of an effort to ban it from the world. The fact we might have a few rogue nations wanting to produce them does not mean we ought not decide to ratify this treaty. What we ought to do is join all of our friends around the world who feel similarly and go after the rogue nations to demand and make certain that they are not producing chemical weapons. 
The treaty is unverifiable, people say. Well, no treaty is perfectly verifiable. We should not be making the perfect the enemy of the good. We will be able to adequately verify this treaty. 
The military use of chemical weapons requires significant testing and equipping or training of forces that will be difficult to hide in the face of the kind of investigation that will occur if this treaty is approved. 
I will intend to proceed further with the myths that we will hear on the floor of the Senate about the Chemical Weapons Convention, but let me do that at another time, because I intend to come to the floor on a number of additional occasions and talk about this subject. But other Senators are joining me on the floor to speak about this. Senator Levin from the State of Michigan is here. He has been one of the most eloquent spokesman on this issue in the U.S. Senate and feels passionately about it. I am pleased he has joined me. Senator Bingaman is also coming to the floor, as are a couple of others. 
I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to rise to join my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, in support of this legislation. This piece of legislation was passed by our colleagues in the U.S. House with overwhelming and bipartisan support last Thursday, April 10. The Senate version of this legislation was introduced on February 12 by Senator Ashcroft and myself, and we had 33 bipartisan cosponsors for that version. 
This is not the first time this bill has been introduced in the Senate. Senator Ashcroft and I also introduced this legislation in the last Congress, but that Congress was not able to take up this legislation, so we reintroduced it earlier this year. I am pleased the Senate is today considering this legislation as it has been passed by the House of Representatives. 
This legislation is very, very simple. It will ensure that Federal tax dollars are not used to pay for the costs associated with assisted suicides. Mr. President, I do not know about all of the anguish, the torment and difficulties that are faced by terminally ill individuals toward the end of life who must make critical decisions. I recall before my father's death sitting in the hospital one evening in North Dakota and hearing the cries of pain suffered by someone in a room down the hall, someone who mercifully died the next morning. 
I thought that evening about some of these issues, and I do not know what I or others might do in a similar circumstance. I am not here to make judgments about those types of decisions. The decision about whether assisted suicide is protected by the Constitution will be made across the street by the Supreme Court. We do not attempt in this legislation to address the question of whether someone has a right to end one's life. This bill does not address that at all, and I do not stand here today making judgments about it. 
Rather, the decision we are faced with today in the Senate, about whether Federal funding should pay for this practice, is a decision that was really presented to us by an action one State has taken. The State of Oregon has decided it will sanction and pay for physician-assisted suicides through its Medicaid program, which is paid for with matching Federal dollars. As a result of these decisions by the State of Oregon, Federal health care dollars may soon be used to pay for those physician-assisted suicides without Congress ever having made an affirmative decision to allow that. 
When Oregon's referendum to legalize assisted suicide passed by a narrow margin, it was contested in the courts, and its implementation has been held in abeyance since then. However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the challenge to Oregon's law on a technicality in late February. That decision is being challenged by opponents of Oregon's law, but this action means that Federal funding for assisted suicide in Oregon could soon be a reality. 
What Senator Ashcroft and I and others are saying is that we do not want Federal tax dollars, through the Medicaid Program or any other program, to ever be used to help pay for physician-assisted suicides. We do not believe that is what American taxpayers ever intended should be done with their tax dollars that come to Washington, DC. Tax dollars used for health care purposes ought to be used to enhance life, not end life. So again, our legislation very simply says that we will prohibit the use of Federal funding to assist in suicides. 
I have told you what this legislation does. Now let me tell you what it does not do. First of all, this legislation says that the ability of terminally ill patients to decide to withhold or withdraw medical treatment or nutrition or hydration is not limited for those who have decided they do not want their life sustained by medical technology. In other words, this legislation does not address this issue at all. The withdrawal of medical treatment or 
services, which is already legal in our country and which patients in conjunction with their families and doctors decide they want to do, is not prohibited at all by our legislation. Our legislation does not speak to this issue. Our legislation speaks to the narrow, but important, issue of Federal funding for physician-assisted suicides. 
Our legislation also does not put limits on using Federal funding for health care or services that are intended to alleviate a patient's pain or discomfort, even if the use of this pain control ultimately hastens the patient's death. 
Finally, our legislation does not prohibit a State or other entity from using its own dollars to assist a suicide. We are not saying what a State may or may not do. We are only saying that a State may not use Federal money to pay for assisted suicide. We have raised and appropriated money at the Federal level to do certain things in our Federal system. One of these important purposes is to help pay for health care, and I am convinced that our constituents want this funding to be used to extend life, not to end life. This legislation is important because it reaffirms the principle that Federal health care dollars should be used to improve and prolong life. This bill will reaffirm that all people are equal and deserving of protection, no matter how ill or disabled or elderly or depressed a person may be. 
Some might say, `Well, you have come to the Congress with a bill that is premature, because there is not now Federal funding for assisted suicide.' That is correct for now but that situation may soon change. The law already exists in one State that forms the basis for requiring Federal funding of assisted suicides if Congress does not act. Therefore, the Congress must intervene to say that is not our intention that Federal money be used for that purpose. So this is not premature at all. 
Those who say, `Federal funding of assisted suicide is not happening, therefore, you need do nothing,' do not understand that if we do not act, we effectively allow the use of Federal funds for use in assisted suicides. I think we speak for the vast majority of the American people when we say that tax money should not be used to facilitate assisted suicides. 
Let me end where I began by saying that this is not legislation that intends to make legal of moral judgments about assisted suicide. For States and citizens around our country, this is a very difficult and wrenching issue, and it has gotten a lot of press because of one doctor who facilitates assisted suicides. 
I expect behind all of those news reports are patients and families who are faced with these very difficult decisions about pain they believe cannot be controlled, life they think is not worth living. I have seen too many circumstances in which I feel really unqualified to pass judgment on the decisions of others. But I do stand here with a great deal of certainty about what uses we ought to be sanctioning for limited tax dollars. When we raise precious tax dollars to spend in pursuit of public health care, I am convinced that the vast majority of the American people do not believe those dollars ought to be spent in the pursuit of assisted suicides. And that is what our legislation reaffirms simply and plainly. 
I am pleased to have worked with the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, who has done a substantial amount of work in this area. I hope and expect we will enact our legislation here today in the Senate and send this bill to the President. When we pass this bill later this afternoon, we will have done something that is worthy and has great merit.  
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. That is an important question, and one I want to clarify. H.R. 1003 would not create any new restrictions in those areas. 
In fact, section 3(b) of the bill explicitly states that none of those practices or services would be affected by the bill. This means that we do not create any new limitations, and none of the practices and services you described would be prohibited or further restricted by this bill. I also want to make clear that this bill would not place any new restrictions on the provision of hospice care, which I strongly support.

Mr. DORGAN. H.R. 1003 prohibits the use of Federal funds for legal or other assistance for the purpose of causing an assisted suicide; compelling any other person or institution from providing or funding services to cause an assisted suicide, or advocating a legal right to cause or assist in causing an assisted suicide. 
However, the bill does not impose any kind of gag rule on legal services or other attorneys receiving Federal funding to provide legal services. An advocacy program could provide factual answers to a client's questions about a State law on assisting suicide, since that alone would not be providing assistance to facilitate an assisted suicide. Similarly, the bill does not prohibit such programs from counseling clients about alternatives to assisted suicide, such as pain management, mental health care, and community-based services for people with disabilities. 
In addition, the bill is not intended to have the effect of defunding an entire program, such as a legal services program or other legal or advocacy program, simply because some State or privately funded portion of that program may advocate for or file suit to compel funding of services for assisted suicide. The bill is intended only to restrict Federal Funds from being used for such activities. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. One of the reasons we do not have a budget brought to the Senate on time--and today is the date it is supposed to be here--is because, frankly, the proposal they would offer does not add up, and they know it. They are proposing very substantial tax cuts, the majority of which will 
go to the upper-income folks in this country, and you cannot balance the budget with the kind of tax cuts they propose, especially the kind of tax cuts that will go to upper-income folks. 
This morning, on NPR, a Republican commentator said something. I would like to read it to my friend from Illinois and my friend from California, because I think it is important. He is talking specifically about the capital gains tax cut, and the Citizens For Tax Justice provide a chart to show who gets what from the tax cuts offered by the majority party. The top 20 percent get nearly 80 percent of the tax cuts, the bottom 60 percent get about 8 percent of the tax cuts. 
But here is what Kevin Phillips had to say this morning. He said:  
It's time to put [this issue] on the table--the argument that because Congressmen and Senators want capital gains tax cuts as a payoff to their big contributors, that's a good reason to block it as a powerful beginning for reforming campaign finance. 
This is a Republican, Kevin Phillips, who says this morning: 
Think about it. The experts say that two-thirds of the benefit from the Senate Republican leadership's cap-gain cut proposal would go to the top 1% of Americans income-wise. That's exactly the same crowd that gives big [campaign] contributions. Anybody who believes that linkage is a coincidence probably believes in the tooth fairy, too. 
It is not me speaking. This is Kevin Phillips, a Republic commentator. Let me continue. 
Let me stipulate. The deficit-cutter case against the cap-gain cut is overwhelming, too, because it's such a huge boondoggle. Over the next ten years, the Senate's proposed reduction would cost the government some somewhere between 133 billion dollars and 237 billion dollars [in lost income]. The 133 billion dollar estimate comes from the conservative-run Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation and the 237 billion dollar estimate comes from the liberal-run Citizens For Tax Justice. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, which would be about 185 billion dollars over ten years, which would have to be paid for--literally--with massive cuts in programs for ordinary Americans or with deficit spending. 
Again, Kevin Phillips, a Republican commentator, says this morning on NPR: 
Worse still, it's not a worthy outlay. It's just pork for fat-cat political donors. The rate reduction [from capital gains] obviously isn't needed to encourage more investment. The last six or eight years have seen enormous amounts of money invested under the present tax rate. And experts have scoffed at claims in which hired economists say the cuts are badly needed for capital formation. Even Herbert Stein, a former Republican Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, argues that only economic activity that could be counted on from a cap gains cut would be more activity by accountants and lawyers in converting other income into capital gains. 
Again, Kevin Phillips continuing. He says: 
Cutting the capital gains rate across the board, for every kind of quick-buck tax ploy, isn't policy, it's pandering. It isn't serious legislation, and Congress knows that; it's a payback to big contributors. Relief for small businessmen, like for homeowners, may justify giving every household a one or two hundred thousand dollar lifetime capital gains exemption. But tens of billions of dollars worth of cap gains cuts for the people who've just flooded the Republican and Democratic parties with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of record-level 1995-96 campaign contributions would be the political equivalent of bribery. Blocking that pork feast, by contrast, would send an important message: a message that reform of campaign finance is already underway. 
Again, this is a Republican commentator. Incidentally, his last suggestion is one that I authored as a piece of legislation. I said, let us take, for every American--every American--let us give them an opportunity for a $250,000 capital gains income, if they have held the asset for 10 years, to be taken with zero tax liability; a quarter of a million dollars during one's lifetime, zero tax liability if you hold the asset 10 years. But let's not go back to the full-blown capital gains approach, where you hold a share of stock for 6 months and 1 day and sell it and pay half the tax someone who works all day pays. It's the same old approach by those in this Congress, and there are plenty of them, who say: Let us have a tax system that deals with different groups in different ways. Let us decide that those who invest shall pay no tax and those who work shall pay a significant tax. In other words, let us have a tax on work but not a tax on investment. 
What kind of sense does that make? Let us tax work but not tax investment? There are a lot of streams of income in this country. Guess who has most of the investment income? Most of the folks at the upper level, the same folks who are giving the campaign contributions. 
That is why these plans that say, `Let's go ahead and tax work and we will exempt investment,' and when they exempt the tax on investment, what they do is propose plans that give the bulk of the tax benefits to a very small group of upper income taxpayers, and the result of that is, of course, the budgets do not add up. 
If the budget does not add up to a balanced budget, then you cannot meet the budget deadline of April 15 and bring a budget to the floor that completes what you said you were going to do, and that is balance the Federal budget. The only people in the Senate who have done what is necessary to take this country on a road to a balanced budget are those who, in 1993, stood up here in the face of opposition and in the face of criticism and said, `Count me in, this is a deficit reduction package. I am willing to vote for it and it is tough medicine because it cuts spending and does increase some revenue, but count me in, because I am for reducing the budget deficit.' 
I was one of those who voted for that. The easiest vote by far would have been to say, `I'm AWOL, I'm out of here, don't count on me for a vote. All I want to do is talk about balancing the budget, and when it is time to do something about it, I am gone.' 
I did not do that, nor did the majority of my colleagues. We passed that bill by one vote. We did not get one vote from the other side of the aisle. Those who talked the loudest about balancing the budget did not offer one vote to reduce the budget deficit. It has been reduced well over 60 percent. Now we need to do the rest of the job. 
Today is the day by which the budget is supposed to come to the Senate to do the rest of the job. Why is it not here? It is not here because the majority party cannot bring a budget to the floor of the Senate that adds up that reaches balance. Why can they not do that? Because they are proposing very large tax cuts that go, in most cases, to the largest income earners in this country. 
The Washington Times had a piece the other day from which I want to read a couple of paragraphs: 
Major donors told the national committee chairman, Jim Nicholson, they are fed up with the party's congressional leadership and the party can forget about more money from them unless the GOP lawmakers enact tax cuts. 
Shorthand for that: Give us our tax breaks, and we will give you more money. This comes from something called `Eagles,' corporate eagles who give $20,000 a year and individual eagles who give $15,000 a year. What they are saying is, `Give us our tax cuts, we'll give you some money. Withhold the tax cuts, we'll withhold the political contributions.' 
It is kind of an interesting and dismaying piece, it seems to me. But the fact is, a budget cannot be put together that proposes the kind of tax cuts the majority wants and, at the same time, shows that we are balancing the budget. That is the dilemma. 
Job one in this country, in my judgment, is to balance the budget. I do not happen to think one side is all right and the other side is all wrong; they have no answers, we have all the answers. That is not the case at all. But we spent a month and a half in this Chamber talking about amending the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced budget. I pointed out then if the Constitution were altered 1 minute from now, 2 minutes from now there would be no difference in the Federal deficit, because changing the Constitution does not change the deficit. The only way you change the deficit and reach a balanced budget is the individual taxing-and-spending decisions. That is why asking the majority party who controls Congress and controls our agenda to bring a balanced budget to the floor today on April 15, which is the deadline in law for them to do so, is an important and right thing for them to do. 
Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, Senator Conrad, who has comments on this same subject. I yield him as much time as he may consume.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from North Dakota a question. Senator Conrad is on the Senate Budget Committee and, as he indicated, the legal date for the completion of work on a budget by Congress is April 15. In fact, a couple of years ago, we heard some folks here on the floor of the Senate and in the House say, `The President is irrelevant. We control the Congress. We will write a budget and we will ram this thing home. It does not matter what the President thinks.' 
Now we hear the story, `What the President thinks matters to us. We will not do a budget unless the President comes to the table.' The President submitted a budget, but my understanding is that the Budget Committee in both the House and Senate have not moved forward to say, `Here is what we in Congress think ought to comprise a budget.' 
Again, my notion is that it was not done because there is not any way to add this up. If you want to give giant tax reductions, most of which will go to the upper income folks, and say that is what we promised, but we also promised a balanced budget, the best way to avoid the conflict of a budget that does not add up is to not submit one, do not show your hand. 
Is that what is happening in the Budget Committee?

Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator, did the Senator hear my reading of the Washington Times story in which the Eagles from the Republican Party said to the party chairman, look, we are not going to contribute more money if you do not give us some of these tax breaks. We are tired of contributing money and getting nothing for it. That is not quite the way they said it, but it is how it reads. 
It reminds me of the movie `Jerry McGuire,' toward the end of the movie the fellow is knocked out of the end zone, laying there holding the football, and gets up and rushes around the stadium. If you remember his chant during the entire movie `Show me the money, show me the money.' That is what that message was in the Washington Times report from the Eagles, `Show us the money.' 
The dilemma here is you cannot cut $500 billion or $550 billion in taxes and promise everything to everybody and then come to the floor of the Senate and say, `By the way, here is our plan to balance the budget.' Cut your revenue by half a trillion dollars and then balance the budget? No, what you do is create a giant hole and increase the Federal deficit. 
We had a fellow named Laffer who constructed the Laffer curve, used in the early 1980's. It turns out to be a `laugher.' He said, `You can cut the taxes, especially for those at the top, because we believe in trickle down, where you pour in at the top and it all trickles down to help everybody else.' Some of us believe in the `percolate up,' give something to the bottom and it percolates up. Nonetheless, the Laffer curve would have substantial cuts, and somehow you balance the budget. 
What happened was the largest deficits in the history of this country. Double the defense budget--that was the Reagan recipe, double the defense budget--cut taxes, and you end up with very large deficits. That does not come from me. That comes from David Stockman, who did it, who wrote a book afterward and said what a terrible thing to have done, and then we bear the results of that. 
But those of us who in 1993 cast tough votes for a plan that said do what is necessary to march down the road to really balance the budget, we have taken tough steps to do this. We have marched in the right direction, but we are not there. We get there when we have balanced the budget. Senator Conrad is talking about the requirement to do that. 
I personally would like to see us essentially say, balance the budget first, and then talk about the Tax Code. There is plenty wrong in the Tax Code to the extent the upper income folks do not pay what they should or to the extent $30 billion that corporations ought to be paying, they are not. That means working people are paying higher taxes than they should. We ought to relieve them of that burden. 
What I would like to do is balance the budget and then turn to the Tax Code and make the right decisions about the Tax Code. The right decision is not to say those who invest shall be tax-exempt and those who work shall be taxed. In effect, saying as they do every day, tax work and exempt investors. Gee, that sounds pretty good for those folks, because guess who supports them? The 
investors. They are saying exempt the folks who support us, and tax all the working folks. What about exempting workers? Capital gains cut--what about a workers' gains cut? Is there not a workers' gain when you have a circumstance where you have an increase in productivity but you have inflation that devalues some of their earnings? What about a workers' gains cut? Why is it always capital? They say no, tax work and exempt investors. What a wrongheaded approach. Yes, help investors, but you do not help investors by saying, `By the way, you are a privileged group of people. You get to be tax-exempt,' because they are so intending to do that in such a significant way there is not any way to add this up. 
There is only one arithmetic book, and you start when you are young. Adding is simple. One plus one equals two, two plus two equals four, and I can go further than that because I went to a pretty good school, but it does not add up. 
Today is April 15. The budget is supposed to be here by law. Tonight, every newscast will show there is a traffic jam at the post office because people are pushing to file their return for April 15, but the deadline to bring a budget to this floor of the Senate is not going to be met. 
Guess what? The folks that run this place will be sleeping at midnight. They will not be in the post office or driving around looking for a mail drop. They will be sleeping. Why? Because their plan does not add up.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to--before I propound the unanimous-consent request, let me explain my objection to the resolution offered by the Senate majority leader and then indicate that I would intend to offer a resolution of my own. 
Some of the provisions that are in the resolution offered by the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, are not troublesome, but there are some provisions and some language that are very troublesome to some of us in this resolution. 
It is clearly a partisan resolution written in a manner that suggests that one side is no good, the other side is all bad, and for that reason I object to it. 
In the spirit of discussing the taxes, tax burden on the American citizens and the ability to address meaningful tax reform for American families and to do so in a budget process that has a requirement that the Congress bring to the floor of the Senate and pass a budget today on April 15, I would offer a unanimous-consent request and will do so, and the resolution that I will offer is a resolution that talks some about the tax burden that we face in this country and our desire to offer meaningful tax relief to American families but to do so in the context of a budget that reaches balance, and that we do it in a process as described by law in this country, that a budget be brought to the Congress, be passed by April 15. 
It is unusual that we have not even started a budget process at this point. April 15 is two deadlines. One, people will line up at the post office this evening in a traffic jam trying to file their income tax return and get an April 15 postmark because people at the post office want to meet their obligation. 
There is a second obligation today, and that is the obligation of the Congress to pass a budget resolution, by law, on April 15. Obviously, we are far from that position of being able to pass a budget resolution. No budget resolution has come from the Budget Committee. There is not an indication that such a budget resolution will be forthcoming. 
In the resolution that I will ask unanimous consent to offer we ask that the majority party take up without delay a budget resolution that balances the budget by the year 2002 and targets its tax relief to working and middle-class families to the same degree as the proposal offered by the President and, at the same time, protects important domestic priorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. 
I might say there is a difference with respect to our interest in tax relief. There are those who propose tax relief but do it in a way that says what they would like to do is especially exempt income from investment, which means there is more of a burden on income from work. It is an approach that says let us tax work but let us exempt investment. Guess who has all the investment income in the country. The upper-income folks. 
And so you have a proposal that essentially says let us exempt the folks at the upper-income scale, and then we will shift the burden, and what we will end up doing is taxing work. 
Some of us think that is the wrong way to offer tax relief, that overburdened working families deserve some tax relief in this country, and we believe a responsible budget that allows for some tax relief to working families but still protects important priorities, and, importantly, balances the budget in 2002, is a responsibility of this Congress. And it so happens that today is the day by which that is supposed to be done.

Mr. DORGAN. Without belaboring this at great length, the Senator from Mississippi said we will not go through `you said, they said, we said,' having already done that. The fact is I would not have objected, nor would other Members on this side of the aisle have objected to this resolution except this is not a resolution you bring to the floor and say, by the way, let us be bipartisan. 
Let me give you an example. This is a resolution that says page 1, sub 5, `President proposed and Democratic-controlled Congress enacted a $241 billion tax increase on the American people in 1993, the largest in history,' and on and on and on. It was not the largest in history. The largest in history came during the Reagan administration in 1982, the largest tax increase in history documented by the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax Committee, but that is beside the point. 
In 1993, a provision that I voted for was a deficit reduction provision, and guess what happened as a result of that? Yes, the deficit was reduced. Contest that? Well, even Alan Greenspan says it was reduced as a result of that action. The deficit was reduced because we had the courage to reduce spending and increase some revenue. The deficit has been reduced over 60 percent since 1993. We have had economic growth. We have had job creation. We have had lower interest rates. And the fact is this country was put back on track because the deficits were being reduced and we were moving in the right direction. 
Now, was it controversial to do that? Yes, of course, it was. Why was it controversial? Because it lends itself to this sort of nonsense, someone coming to the floor of the Senate and saying, well, gee, look at the Democrats over on the other side of the aisle. This resolution says, well, the Democrats did it. The Democrats passed the largest tax increase in history. 
Some of what the majority leader said I agree with, and we can draft a bipartisan resolution that talks about the common interests here. Should we try to do some tax relief for working families? Of course, we should. Let us do that in the context of a balanced budget. Can we do something that allows people to pass businesses and family farms from one generation to the other without inheriting the business and the farm and the estate tax obligation? Yes, let us do that. Should we, however, agree to some of the other proposals on the other side that say let's have a zero tax on estates, exempt all estates and have no estate tax, and, by the way, let us decide there be a zero tax for the capital gains that someone has? 
Kevin Phillips, a Republican commentator, today on NPR talked about that issue, and I will read it again in the Chamber tomorrow. I read it today. It makes no sense to decide we are going to have a tax system, and there are four streams of income in this country and we decide to treat a couple streams of income by exempting them and the other streams will bear a tax burden. So we will create a situation where someone would propose, let's tax those people who are recipients of income from investments and decide then, all right, we have taxed them at half the rate they used to be taxed. Now we will exempt them altogether. Let us just have a total tax exemption for people who have their income from investments, but people who get their income by working, let's go ahead and keep taxing those folks. 
Guess what. It is like squeezing a balloon. When you exempt a class of income over here from any tax obligation, the people who are over here remaining to pay the tax are going to pay a higher burden. It is saying let's exempt people who are investors and we will ask people who work to pay a higher tax. 
Does that make any sense? Tax work but exempt investment? Capital gains tax--I proposed a capital gains tax proposal that says if you hold a capital asset for 10 years, maybe you should be able to take $250,000 with a zero tax rate during your lifetime; tax free $250,000 during your lifetime. But should we go back to the good old days where you have a tax shelter industry with tens of thousands of people doing nothing but help people convert ordinary income to capital gains so they end up paying no tax so the people who go to work every day end up paying a certain tax. I do not think so. It does not make sense to me. 
If the Senator from Mississippi wants to pass a bipartisan resolution and takes these kinds of things, especially, out of it, write a resolution and we will pass it. I have no problem with that. But you cannot call this bipartisan, bringing this to the floor and throwing out sort of an in-your-face admonition about what Democrats did in 1993. Most of us feel good about what we did in 1993. We turned this country around, and passed a piece of legislation that substantially reduced the Federal deficit, substantially reduced the Federal budget deficit, helped create new jobs, put us on a course to economic growth and reduced interest rates. That is what we did, and we did not get one vote to help us. All we got was criticism then and now, 4 years later, we slip papers under the doors and over the transom, to say, `Here is what they did, here is what they did back in 1993.' 
That is not the way to do business. If you want to do a resolution, let us do one. Let us just take all this backbiting out of it and do a resolution that reaches the consensus that I think we could reach on some of the things that we think should be done with respect to our Tax Code. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senators Daschle, Wellstone, and Johnson in introducing legislation to provide much-needed income tax relief for North and South Dakotans and others pummeled by the severe blizzards and flooding this spring in the Upper Midwest. This legislation builds upon the good work started by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] last week. 
About a week ago, the Internal Revenue Service announced that taxpayers living in counties recently declared a disaster area by the President will be able to delay filing their Federal income tax returns until May 30, 1997, without facing a late filing or payment penalty. Clearly this is significant relief for those who may be prevented from filing their tax returns by the April 15, 1997 due date because of the recent blizzard and flooding in our part of the country. 
In its announcement, however, the IRS stated that it did not have the authority to waive any interest charges accruing on delayed payments made between April 15, 1997 and May 30, 1997. It makes no sense to impose interest charges for payments occurring after the original due date, when the IRS itself says--and I think properly so--that it will extend the time for filing income tax returns and payments by taxpayers located in a Presidentially-declared disaster area. In my opinion, the IRS's action properly suggests that income tax return filing and payments made before the new date should not be treated as late. It is just that simple, and our legislation reflects this point. 
Specifically, our legislation requires the IRS to abate the assessment of interest on underpayment by taxpayers in Presidentially-declared disaster areas if the IRS acts to extend the period of time for filing income tax returns and paying income tax by taxpayers in such areas. The legislation would apply to all Presidentially-declared disasters announced after December 31, 1996. 
Once again, the IRS wisely and promptly granted an extension for North Dakotans and others to file their income tax returns due to flood-and snow-related emergencies without facing late filing and payment penalties. But the IRS has been prevented from doing more by statute. Our legislation remedies this problem in the case of IRS extensions due to Presidential disaster declarations. 
We intend to advance this proposal at the first available opportunity in the U.S. Senate. We urge our colleagues to support this important initiative to provide income tax relief for those affected by this year's weather-related disasters and for those living in disaster areas in the future.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a couple of my colleagues this morning have spoken, as I did yesterday, about the devastating blizzards and floods that have confronted people in North and South Dakota and the Minnesota region in recent days. I suppose only those who have been there can fully understand the dimension of the tragedy. It is, indeed, a tragedy. 
North Dakota has had the toughest winter that it has ever had, with five and six major blizzards, closing down virtually all roads, including the interstate highways, causing serious problems. On top of that, with the expected floods that would come as a result of the record amount of snowfall from these previous blizzards, last week something called the grandfather of all blizzards came to North Dakota. 
Leon Osborne, who works at the University of North Dakota and is someone who runs a weather service that I think is tops in our region, described this blizzard as the worst in 50 years in our State. This blizzard came on top of all of the other blizzards and on top of the flooding that was already beginning in our State. The snowfall last weekend ranged anywhere from 12 inches to over 20 inches of snowfall with winds 40 and 50 miles an hour in some parts of North Dakota. The picture of North Dakotans trying to fill sandbags in the middle of a snow blizzard is quite extraordinary. 
The Dakotans have had a very, very difficult time coping with these problems. Last Tuesday we had a meeting with President Clinton and the head of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the President signed a disaster declaration for North and South Dakota. 
My understanding is that he probably signed a disaster declaration for some of the Minnesota counties today. There are teams of folks from FEMA now on the ground in our region, and there will be a visit to North Dakota by the head of FEMA and by the Secretary of Transportation and other senior officials. My understanding is that the Vice President will also visit North and South Dakota and Minnesota the day after tomorrow. 
I intend to travel with the senior officials as they go to North Dakota, as do my colleagues, and we will be a part of a group that attempts to make certain that all of the resources of the Federal Government are made available at this time when it is needed in North Dakota and in our region to help people who are trying to dig out from this blizzard and trying to cope with massive flooding. 
The newspaper headlines tell it better than I can. This one describes it pretty well: `Down, But Not Out.' North Dakotans are a tough people. They have suffered through a good many weather-related events in years past, but this was about as tough as it gets. `State Paralyzed by Blizzard.' The newspaper headlines describe all of the myriad events that have occurred. `Area Residents Hang Tough Despite Flooding.' `Search for Heat and Power Endangers Lives: With Power Lines Down, Crews Struggle To Restore Power to Thousands of Homes.' It has been a very, very tough time. 
The stories of the folks who have had to endure this are really quite remarkable. We have men and women who are trying to restore power to a State in which up to 100,000 citizens were without power. Some are still without power. Men and women, linemen and others working for utility companies, electric co-ops and others are out in tough circumstances trying to restore power to North Dakota. They are doing an extraordinary job for our State. 
Livestock losses are going to be very substantial in North Dakota. The threat to human life has been substantial. Fortunately, we have not had many deaths in North Dakota, but it has been a very challenging time. We are told that in some areas, one half of the young calves being born--and this is calving season for ranchers--one half of the calves are dying as they are born. 
They are being found on the ground in circumstances where the ranchers simply could not save them. One rancher, I believe, brought five or seven of his calves into the home to try to save their lives. All of them died. Also, 300 milk cows were killed when a dairy barn collapsed under the weight of the snow. There are stories about cows and calves with a full 1-inch thick coat of ice on them as a result of the blizzard, rain, and the snow. 
Farmers and ranchers have attempted, especially for the young and the vulnerable calves, to use air dryers to try to remove that ice from the coats of those calves. Then the power fails, so you cannot use air dryers, and the calves die. Those are just some of the stories of people who have been confronted with this challenge. 
There was a story, in fact, yesterday about two fellows who were leaving a North Dakota community and were caught by this blizzard with whiteout conditions and they became stuck, could not move, could not see. They saw a building just faintly, just a few yards away, so they went to the building, which turned out to be a small bar on the edge of this town. So they broke into the bar and then used the telephone to call the wife of one of the two men who had broken into the bar and had the wife call the bar owner. 
Remember, this is a whiteout blizzard, with no traffic available to move, and they are stuck and caught. The bar owner called the bar where the two fellows had broken in to seek shelter and said, `Well, help yourself to whatever is there. There is frozen chili in the freezer.' The folks were stuck there, I guess for a day and a half in the place. I suppose there are worse places to be stuck if you are in the middle of a blizzard, but it is a story that is replicated all across our State of neighbors helping neighbors, especially now confronting digging out from a blizzard and confronting the raging flood that will come. 
The flood is going to be a very significant problem. Part of it has already hit. I want to tell my colleagues about the Red River--which, incidentally, is the only river in America that runs north, I believe. Because it runs north, it is running into an area up north that has not yet thawed, and the result is the water cannot flow easily because it is flowing toward ice. So it starts down south in our State and floods there first and then the flood exacerbates as it goes north. 
In Wahpeton, flood stage is 10 feet, the current height of the river is 16 feet and is predicted to go to 18 1/2 feet. In Fargo, ND, the flood stage on the Red River is 17 feet, the river is at 33 feet and expected to go to 37 1/2 feet. In Grand Forks, flood stage is 28 feet, and it is expected to crest at 49 feet. That is the Red River. The Sheyenne River is the same story. At West Fargo, the Sheyenne flood stage is 16 feet, and the current height is 23 feet. In Abercrombie, the Wild Rice River flood stage is 10 feet and the current height is 24 feet. 
So we face enormous challenges now as we confront digging out from a blizzard that represented the worst blizzard in 50 years and as we anticipate the continuation of a flood. This will be the worst flood that we will have had in a century. 
Now, Mr. President, today is Wednesday, and I indicated we met with the President on Tuesday. President Clinton indicated to us that the head of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would come to North Dakota. He indicated he would invite a Cabinet Secretary, too, to come, and a senior team of administration officials will visit our region. I am also told that Vice President Gore will visit North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota on Friday, the day after tomorrow, and I expect that the congressional delegation, myself included, will join him in that visit. 
I appreciate very much the attention of the agencies and the administration in understanding the difficulty we face, understanding the gravity of the situation that yet exists in North Dakota with power lines down, with thousands of North Dakotans still without power after many, many days. I believe that we will appreciate very much in North Dakota the visit from the Vice 
President and from the head of FEMA and Cabinet officials who come to view firsthand what could be done on behalf of the Federal Government to make all of the resources of the Federal Government available to North Dakotans as they work together and fight together to confront these challenges. 
Mr. President, my colleagues and I will be working in the coming days on the supplemental appropriations bill, which we hope will include the kind of resources that are necessary for all of the agencies to respond to this problem. Mr. President, there are not many States in our country in which interstate highways are closed or will be closed. Yet this morning Interstate 29 has one lane closed, and it is expected that Interstate 29 will be closed completely in North Dakota. In fact, a dike will be built across the interstate when it is closed, and it will be closed for some time. Interstate 94, a major artery east and west in our State, is now surrounded by lakes of water on both sides, 
and some predict that we will probably not escape having that interstate closed as well. But it is a very difficult circumstance, with road crews and others struggling in a crisis situation to meet the needs of people who have been confronted by this blizzard and these floods. 
Many are finding that just the infrastructure things we normally take for granted are now shut off, and it makes dealing with all of this much, much more difficult. I suppose electricity is the thing that most of us almost always take for granted every day. I have talked to several North Dakotans in the last hours, and they reiterate that it is something we take for granted, but the loss of electricity, especially in the circumstance in North Dakota, with record low temperatures this morning, dating back to the 1890's, has been a very difficult circumstance for families struggling to keep warm and struggling to confront these elements. 
So, Mr. President, Senator Conrad, myself, and Senator Wellstone, who spoke earlier, and others, intend to go to North Dakota with the senior Federal team, either tomorrow or Friday, and do everything we possibly can to try to bring some help to some folks who are now trying to help themselves dig out and prepare for floods. We hope that when all of this is done--and it is going to be some while--that the record will show that everybody rushed to the folks in this region who have been hurt, the North Dakotans and South Dakotans and Minnesotans, and everybody did everything humanly possible to make life better, and extended a helping hand to try to get them through these challenges. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my home State of North Dakota has been making the national news lately because of the recordbreaking snowfalls and flooding we have been suffering. This will surely be a winter that North Dakotans will remember for a long time to come. However, we North Dakotans will also be able to look back on this winter with fond memories because of the two national championships captured by the University of North Dakota in women's basketball and men's hockey. 
First of all, I want to pay special tribute to the 1997 National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division II women's national basketball champions, the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux. This championship is made more special because it is the first ever for women's basketball at UND, and it keeps the national championship trophy in North Dakota for the fifth straight year. 
I am sure that this championship is made even sweeter for Head Coach Gene Roebuck and his team because it comes after playing in the shadow of North Dakota State University's women's basketball team for the last several years. The fact is that two of the best division II basketball teams in the country year in and year out play right in the Red River Valley of North Dakota, and it was just a matter of time before the UND women would get their share of the limelight. 
To win the national championship, the UND women handily defeated the Southern Indiana Lady Screaming Eagles 94-78 after closing out the game on a 20-4 run. Winning the national championship was truly a team effort with six players scoring in double figures. The Fighting Sioux finished the season 28-4, which ties the school record for most wins in a season. 
The outstanding team accomplishments were aided by some notable individual accomplishments. Freshman point guard Jaime Pudenz was named the most outstanding player of the tournament. Jaime was joined on the Elite Eight All-Tournament team by senior Kelli Britz and sophomore Jenny Crouse. Kelli also has the additional distinction of finishing her career at UND as the school's leader in the 3-point fieldgoals made and attempted and second all time in total points scored. Tiffany Pudenz led the Fighting Sioux in scoring in the championship game with 23 points. 
But a basketball team needs hard work and contributions from all of its players if it is to reach the pinnacle of a national championship. The Fighting Sioux certainly got that from senior Allison Derck, junior Elisha Kabanuk, sophomores Casey Carroll and Kami Winger, and freshmen Anna Feit, Pernilla Jonsson, Elisabeth Melin, and Katie Richards. 
Finally, I want to honor the coaches who have turned the Fighting Sioux into one of the dominant forces in the North Central Conference and all of division II women's basketball. Coach Roebuck is one of the most successful active coaches in basketball with a record of 246-50 over the last 10 seasons. He is assisted on the bench by Darcy Deutsch, Chris Gardner, and Doug Reiten. 
I've always known that North Dakota has some of the best people you can find, and I'm told that the visitors to Grand Forks for the national championship came away with the same impression. Now all of America can understand that some of the finest people and finest women's basketball both come from the Red River Valley.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my home State of North Dakota has been making the national news lately because of the record-breaking snowfalls and flooding we have been suffering. This will surely be a winter that North Dakotans will remember for a long time to come. However, we North Dakotans will also be able to look back on this winter with fond memories because of the two national championships captured by the University of North Dakota in women's basketball and men's hockey. 
I want to pay special tribute to the 1997 National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I national hockey champions, the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux. This is the sixth national championship in the long and storied 50-year history of the UND hockey team. In fact, only one other college, Michigan, has more national hockey titles to its credit than UND. 
But perhaps this championship is among the most meaningful because of its improbability. Consistently throughout this season, the hockey program has defied the odds-makers with win after win. This team was predicted to finish no better than fifth in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association at the beginning of the season, but I guess someone forgot to tell that to the team and its coaches for not only did they win the WCHA but also the national championship. They closed out the season with a 31-10-2 record, becoming just the sixth team in UND history to win at least 30 games. 
To win the national championship, the Fighting Sioux fought back from a 2 to 0 deficit after the first period to score five goals in the second period against Boston University. In the third period, the Sioux's smothering defense took over and the Sioux won by a final score of 6 to 4. 
The team's outstanding team accomplishments throughout the year were aided by some notable individual accomplishments. Junior wing player Matt Henderson was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He was joined on the all-tournament team by freshman goalie Aaron Schweitzer, junior defenseman Curtis Murphy, and the team's leading scorer, sophomore wing David Hoogsteen. Sophomore Jason Blake was 1 of 10 finalists for college hockey's top individual player award, the Hobey Baker Award. 
But a team needs hard work and contributions from all of its players if it is to reach the pinnacle of a national championship. The Fighting Sioux certainly got that from seniors Kevin Hoogsteen, Toby Kvalevog, Dane Litke, and Mark Pivetz, junior Mitch Vig, sophomores Jesse Bull, Adam Calder, Ian Kallay, Jay Panzer, Tom Philion, Tyler Rice, Jeff Ulmer, Aaron Vickar, and Brad Williamson, and freshmen Peter Armbrust, Joe Blake, Brad DeFauw, Tim O'Connell, and Jason Ulmer. 
Finally, I want to honor the coaches who have led the Fighting Sioux to these levels. Head Coach Dean Blais was named `WCHA Coach of the Year.' He is assisted by Scott Sandelin and Mark Osiecki. 
Since 13 of the team's 20 members are freshmen or sophomores this year, I am sure we can all look forward to another excellent season. But for now it is more than enough for North Dakotans to bask in the glow of winning yet another national championship in a 10-day period. And hopefully some of the warm feelings will help to melt the snow and dry up the floods.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to visit about a very important issue, the issue of the chemical weapons treaty and the requirement the Senate vote on that treaty. But before I do that, I want to tell my colleagues of a circumstance that exists in our part of the country that they have no doubt seen and heard on the television and radio and that is the worst blizzard we have seen in some 50 years in North Dakota on top of a flooding condition that was already existing that looks to be a 100-year flood. 
Last evening, I and my colleagues from North and South Dakota went to see President Clinton in the White House along with the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to discuss the emergency that exists in our part of the country. 
The President has made a disaster declaration. He has signed it. There is now a team of people from FEMA in the Dakotas beginning to work, beginning to marshal equipment from around the country--generators, snow removal equipment, and a whole range of things that will be necessary to deal with this crisis. 
I want to tell my colleagues of the kind of crisis that exists. Again, we had a blizzard that in many parts of North Dakota gave us 15, 18, and 20 inches of snowfall on top of a circumstance that already existed that would have provided us and will provide us with a flood that is a 100-year event. So this is an enormously difficult time for North Dakotans. We have had the spectacle of people actually sandbagging in the middle of a blizzard, which is a very unusual event. Normally you fight a flood or normally you fight to survive a blizzard, but we have had the confluence of two events that is enormously difficult. We have substantial livestock death. We have reports of people missing entire livestock herds. The stories of people helping one another in coping this past weekend are compelling and gripping, of courage, neighbor helping neighbor. It is a very tough time in the Dakotas. 
My colleagues and I will likely be going back out--we just came back--with the senior team which the President will send. He intends James Lee Witt and I believe at least one other Cabinet Secretary and some others as part of a senior team from the administration to go out and to survey the damage and to begin the active work of supervising the people who are already on the ground. 
This is as tough a time as anything I have ever seen in the Dakotas. Most North Dakotans tell me it is the toughest winter they have ever seen. The blizzard this weekend, as I indicated, is the toughest we have had in 50 years in North Dakota, and it came on top of five or six successive blizzards in North Dakota that essentially shut down our State on five or six occasions previously. As of Saturday evening, this past Saturday evening, in North Dakota traffic was stopped in virtually every direction on every road. It was a very difficult time and remains a very difficult time with thousands of North Dakotans still without electricity after many days. This is a crisis which will continue to exist because of the flooding which has not yet crested in many parts, especially of the Red River. 
I thank President Clinton; I thank James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA; I thank our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who join together in times like this to extend a helping hand to people who need help and who are fighting their way through a crisis that is very difficult to deal with.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to mention two additional items very quickly. One is an issue that has just been discussed at some length on the floor about a budget and tax relief. My hope is that we will find a way to have a bipartisan compromise on a budget. The law requires that by April 15 a budget be enacted by this Congress. It is clear now that the Congress will miss that date. But the date is less important than the result. The result ought to be a budget that achieves balance so we are not spending our children's money, often on things we do not need. 
We ought to decide that there is as much energy in this Chamber to balance the budget as there was to change the Constitution of the United States. I said during the debate on the constitutional provision that was offered here that you could change the Constitution now, and 2 minutes from now you would not have altered the deficit by one penny. What will alter the budget deficit and eventually eliminate the budget deficit will be individual spending and taxing decisions inside the budget by Members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House. I think it is past the time in which the President and Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, join together to say here is where we ought to head and here is the road map by which we get there, to establish balance. 
I have cast hard votes and tough votes. In 1993 I cast an awfully tough vote. We have reduced the budget deficit by 60 percent in the last 4 years. If we continue down that road, we can eliminate the Federal budget deficit, and we should. I am willing to cast more tough votes, and I hope very much we can decide this is not a partisan issue but rather a shared issue for Republicans and Democrats who decide that there is merit and virtue in balancing this Federal budget and not charging what we are now spending to our kids and grandkids.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about another issue that is very important this week as well. This week the Senate comes back from a 2-week break and turns to the question of nuclear waste. That is an important issue and one I hope this Congress and the President will address seriously and solve. But there is another issue that is very important that has a deadline that we must address, and that is the issue of the chemical weapons treaty. 
We now have a circumstance in which this country, with 160 other countries, has signed a convention in which a chemical weapons treaty to the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1994 was negotiated and completed. It was initiated by President Bush, supported by President Reagan, it was continued under President Clinton and submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification. 
The chemical weapons treaty will restrain the proliferation and will reduce the threat of the use of chemical weapons in our lifetime. It is the first ever treaty to try to ban an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. Never again should men and women in our lifetime face a weapon of mass destruction called a chemical weapon or poison gas. We have a treaty that has now been signed by 70 nations, more than the 65 that is needed to ratify the treaty, so it will go into effect on April 29 of this year. This country has not yet ratified it. Our key allies, Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and others, have already ratified this treaty, and we need to do so and we need to do so by April 29. 
There are opponents of this who say, `No, this is not a perfect treaty.' And it is not. Opponents say, `If we adopt this treaty, Saddam Hussein is not going to adopt the treaty, so what are we doing here?' Because some will commit murder, do we not want to make murder a crime in America? We understand there are some who may not want to abide by this treaty. This country has already made a decision, in the mid-1980's, that we are going to destroy our stockpile of chemical weapons. We have already made that decision. We made a decision under President Bush and continued it under President Clinton to negotiate a chemical weapons treaty. That treaty was negotiated. Seventy nations have now ratified it, and we have not yet done so, and we should. Ratifying it will strengthen this country, not weaken this country. Those who allege that ratifying the chemical weapons treaty will somehow weaken this country's hand, in my judgment, are wrong. I respect their opinion, but they are wrong. It is urgent and necessary that we, by April 29, ratify this treaty. We are able, with our allies, to provide leadership to destroy an entire class of weapons of mass destruction in our society. If we do not take this opportunity to do it, we will have made a very grave mistake. 
I was not here when we were testing nuclear weapons in massive quantity, but I know when it was proposed that we cease testing nuclear weapons and have a test ban on nuclear weapons, there were some who stood up and said we cannot do that because it will weaken our country. Yet we had a ban on testing nuclear weapons, and it was the right thing to do. History tells us it was the right thing to do. 
This is the right thing to do as well. It is very important that we understand this must be part of the Senate's business this month. If we do not take the opportunity to provide leadership in banning the use of chemical weapons, a weapon of mass destruction in our society, if we do not take the opportunity to establish that leadership, we will have made a very grave error. 
This is not a case of one side of a debate being soft headed and fuzzy and the other side being the real prodefense folks. The people who support this--former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Secretaries of State James Baker, Larry Eagleburger, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency head Ron Lehman--all urge the Senate to ratify the chemical weapons treaty, none of whom can be alleged to have been soft on defense issues. These are people very prodefense, people who are very concerned about making certain that we do not lose advantage, that we are a strong country, that we can defend ourselves. But these are people who also believe, as did President Bush, that this treaty makes sense for our country, to provide leadership on the abolition of chemical weapons. Leadership on the abolition of poison gas as a weapon in war makes great sense for our country and great sense for humanity. 
The reason I raise the question today is this. We have a limited time, and a deadline of April 29, to ratify this treaty in order for us to be part of the regime that begins to develop the methods by which this treaty is enforced. Yet, we have no agreement even to bring the treaty to the floor of the Senate for a vote or discussion. Some of us believe very strongly that, with the exception of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, for example, or with the exception, perhaps, of a budget bill to balance the Federal budget--which we should do--with the exception of those things we ought to make sure this is first in line. Until we have assurance this is first in line, we ought not be doing other business. This ought to be brought to the floor of the Senate, and we ought to 
have agreement to do that soon. 
I hope we will have an aggressive and significant discussion about this treaty. My understanding is the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma may intend to speak some about this treaty and some of his concerns about it. But my hope is, perhaps this afternoon--I intend to come back to the floor--some of us can have a discussion back and forth. I have great respect for people who take an opposite view on this and on other issues. We do not have to call each other names because we disagree with each other. Debate ought to be to evaluate what are the merits of a position, what are the facts, and what conclusions can one develop from those facts. 
My position is to say I think we ought to do this. It is an easier position, I must say, to oppose it. It is an easier position. That is not to say opposing it is necessarily wrong, and there are cases where the opposition might be the right position on some issues. But Mark Twain once said, when he was asked to debate, `Of course, but I need to take the opposing side.' They said, `But we have not even told you what the topic is.' He said, `That doesn't mean anything to me. That doesn't matter. I only need to take the opposing side because that doesn't require any preparation.' 
The point he was making is it is always easier to take the opposing side. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, that doesn't mean the opposing side in every debate is wrong. But in this case, the need to ratify the chemical weapons treaty, the affirmative side is the right side for this country. It is urgent and has a time deadline, and we ought to do it. I hope this afternoon, perhaps, we can have some thoughtful discussion about what are the merits of this, why do we have such a large group of Republicans and Democrats from the Bush administration and the Clinton administration and many others who believe this is a priority for this country and believe it is something that this country ought to take a lead on. 
My hope is that at end of the day today, or this week, we will have an agreement by which we can at least bring this to the floor, even though some might want to vote against it. I think those who want to do that should give us the opportunity to have a debate and a vote on the chemical weapons treaty. We very much owe that to this country. If and when we get to the decision to give us a debate and a vote on the chemical weapons treaty, I will be happy with that. We have to make our best case and we have to make an affirmative case for this treaty. We have that responsibility. But we cannot do that if we are prevented from seeing it brought to the floor of the Senate for a debate and a vote. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor. 
Does the Senator from Oklahoma intend to speak?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise also to support the unanimous-consent request that will be propounded by the Senator from Illinois. 
Almost the first question from our constituents that all of us, I suppose, when we reach the airport going back to our States, confront is, `Well, what are you working on?' I know what I would like to be working on. A moment ago we talked about the need for this Senate to work on the chemical weapons treaty, a treaty that has been in the works for a number of years, has been signed by many countries, and would end the spread of poisonous gas around our world and make this a safer world. I would like to be working on that, but we cannot get it to the floor of the Senate. I hope it will get here soon. The power of scheduling, of course, is not on this side of the aisle. 
The Senator from Illinois raises the other issue that I would like for us to be working on, and that is the issue of campaign finance reform. No one who has been paying attention in this country can fail to understand the need for us to consider campaign finance reform. The Senator from Illinois is simply raising the question, and a recommendation is implicit, to say we would like, by a date certain, to have a commitment to consider campaign finance reform on the floor of the Senate. That is what the Senator from the State of Illinois is saying to the Senate with his resolution, a resolution that I think is timely, one that I support and one that I hope will allow us to reach an agreement with the majority party on a date certain to bring campaign finance reform to the floor of the Senate. 
The Senator from Illinois held up a chart that shows the number of hearings that have been held, the number of pages of testimony, the number of witnesses. There doesn't need to be a great deal more discussion about whether we should be considering campaign finance reform. The system is broken, it ought to be fixed, and there isn't just one answer to fix it. There are a number of ideas, probably from both sides of the aisle, that can contribute to an approach that will address this in a way the American people believe we ought to address this issue. 
So, this issue is not one that will simply go away. This is not an issue you can bury in the backyard somewhere and forget about it. Every day when you read the newspapers, you see stories, again, about this campaign or that campaign, about this administration or that Member of Congress. The American people, I think soon, will insist to know who in the Congress, in the House and the Senate, contributed to making campaign finance reform a reality and who stood in the way. 
I guess the message here is for those who do not want to see any reform of our campaign financing system, our message is to them: Get out of the way, let us at least have a shot on the floor of the Senate in crafting, hopefully, a bipartisan approach, if we can craft it, a campaign finance reform proposal that gives the American people some confidence that the abuses we have read about, the excesses, the exponential growth in campaign spending in this country can come to an end. 
I happen to feel very strongly that one of the ingredients that is necessary is spending limits. The Supreme Court had a decision in Buckley versus Valeo--it was a 5 to 4 decision, I believe --in which they said it is perfectly constitutional to limit political contributions, but it is unconstitutional to limit political expenditures. Far be it for me to speak over the shoulder of the Supreme Court, but, by the same token, I don't understand that logic. 
It seems to me, and we have had debate on this on a constitutional amendment just in the last days, it seems to me that part of the answer to this problem is to reasonably limit campaign expenditures for all politicians running for all offices in a fair 
and thoughtful way. We do not deserve the kind of campaigns that the American people are now getting. 
There are other models around the world. I kind of like the British system, where they apparently sound a starting gun, or whatever it is, and for 30 or 45 days, they scramble and wrestle and debate and do whatever you do in campaigns, and the fur flies and the dust is all over, and then the bell goes off and it is over. It is over. Then they vote. 
In this country, my Lord, what happens is years in advance of an election now, we have campaign activities cranking up for President and the Senate and Congress, and it never ends. It bores the American people to death, first of all, and second, they have become so long and so expensive, is it any wonder that 50 percent of the American people said when it comes time to casting a vote, they say, `Count me out, I'm not going to participate'? 
There are a lot of things we need to do to reform our political system and make it better. It seems to me job one is this issue of reforming the campaign finance system, the method by which all campaigns are financed in this country. The Senator from Illinois is simply saying today, let us have an opportunity, a commitment, a date by which the Senate will consider campaign finance reform. I am pleased to support him, and I hope others in the Senate will do the same. I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. 
To the majority leader I would say the power of the majority in the Congress is a power to schedule. There are a number of us on our side of the aisle who have been patient to the edge of our abilities on this issue. And the question that is being asked is, Will we have an opportunity to consider the chemical weapons treaty on the floor of the Senate? What I heard the Senator from Mississippi say is that he hoped that would be the case. I very much would like to hear a commitment at some point today or tomorrow, before we leave, that we will when we return have an opportunity at a time certain to continue the chemical weapons treaty.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate today with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. There is no one in the Senate for whom I have greater respect. I am pleased today to join him in introducing a piece of legislation dealing with a very important issue for this country, the trade deficit. Most especially, the merchandise trade deficit. 
On behalf of myself, Senator Byrd, and Senator Sarbanes, we are introducing legislation today which will establish a commission that will meet and make recommendations on how to end the crippling and growing merchandise trade deficit in our country. 
We have had a great deal of discussion about the budget deficit in the U.S. Senate, and in Congress in recent months. In fact, it was not too long ago we had a stack of books, I venture to say 5-foot high, stacked on a desk that was, I think, to demonstrate deficits in various budgets for many years. That was one deficit. 
That deficit is a difficult and a serious issue and one we must address. The question was whether it should be addressed through an attempt to alter the Constitution of the United States. There was great controversy about that. Yet, there was no disagreement about whether we had a responsibility to address the fiscal policy deficits. We have addressed them. We need to do more. They are coming down. They have been decreased by over 60 percent. The budget deficit has been coming down substantially for 4 years in a row. We have made progress, but we have a ways to go. 
But there is another deficit in this country that is not even whispered about in this town or on the floor of Senate save for a couple of Members who care about it and come to speak about it. That is the merchandise trade deficit. That is a deficit that has not been reduced each of the last 4 years, as has the budget deficit. 
This is a deficit that has been growing each of the last 4 years. This is a deficit that last year was the largest in our country's history. This is a deficit that, added on top of other trade deficits which have occurred for 21 consecutive years, now stacks up to a pile of $2 trillion. We have nearly $2 trillion of accumulated merchandise trade deficits that this country must repay some day with a lower standard of living here in the United States. 
This is the third straight year of record trade deficits. It is the third straight year of new record levels in a string of 21 consecutive years of trade deficits. The last trade surplus in this country was in the year 1975. 
Now, I have a chart I will show that demonstrates the fact that the United States has moved from a net creditor position to a net debtor position. 
We are the largest debtor nation in the world. This has happened in a very short period of time. This shows what has happened to our position. We used to export more than we imported. We now import far, far more than we export. The question is, what do we import in this country? 
This describes, of course, the yearly merchandise trade deficits, and this chart has enough red on it to demonstrate where we have been and where we are going. This is a very sad picture. It cries out for a remedy. This is not the picture of a strong economy. This is not a road map to a strong economic future. 
The next chart shows that the U.S. imports that are coming into this country consist particularly of manufactured goods, and they make up 85 percent of our Nation's imports. These manufactured goods are mostly high-value goods that come from skilled labor. In fact, 75 percent of our trade deficit consists of high-value manufactured goods, such as automobiles, auto equipment, electronics goods and telecommunications equipment. 
I have another chart that shows the U.S. imports of manufactured goods. You will see that we now import goods sufficient to match slightly over half of all that we make here. That is quite a statistic. You can see the growth of it. It is almost exponential growth. Imported manufactured goods as a percentage of the U.S. manufacturing gross domestic product have increased from 11 percent in 1970 to 56 percent this past year. As I showed from the previous chart, most of it is high-value manufactured goods. 
If I might make a point with respect to our neighbor to the south, Mexico. Mexico now sends us more automobiles than we ship to the rest of the world. Let me repeat that. Today, the United States imports more automobiles from Mexico than we send to the rest of the world. 
The next chart shows that the trade deficit we have is principally with six other countries. With Japan, we have had a $50 billion to $60 billion-a-year trade deficit for a long period. We now have a substantial deficit with China, amounting to nearly $40 billion. With Canada and Mexico, our two nearest neighbors, we have a combined deficit of nearly $40 billion. 
You can see the dilemma in this country, where we have growing trade deficits with respect to Canada and Mexico and substantially growing trade deficit with respect to China and long-abiding deficits with respect to Japan. You can see what is happening. It is sapping the economic strength of our manufacturing sector in this country. 
Yesterday, on a radio program, the talk radio announcer said, `I don't understand, Senator Dorgan. Unemployment has come down, and our economy seems strong.' I said, `Yes, all that seems to be the case.' I know that there are neighbors, no doubt, who seem to have great-looking homes, a shiny new car, maybe newly poured cement for a new driveway, and they have all the latest gadgets. But you don't see their credit statement. They may well be deep in debt with all that shiny new equipment in their garage. 
The question is not how things appear, but what are the fundamentals of our economy? What does the foundation look like? The foundation of an economy that works and one that will grow and provide jobs in the future has a strong manufacturing sector. No country will long remain a world economic power if it does not retain a strong manufacturing base. 
I have said often--and people probably get tired of hearing it from me--that you cannot measure this country's economic strength, as the economists so often do, by measuring what we consume every month or quarter. That is not a measurement of economic strength. Our economic strength is measured by what we produce, not what we consume. 
What we produce from our manufacturing sector is all too often now moving. Our productive sector is moving out from our country to other countries. Jobs are moving from here to there. It weakens our country internally and weakens our manufacturing sector. 
The next chart talks about trade and jobs. There has been an old formula--in fact, they used this formula to sell the NAFTA trade package to us. They said every billion dollars in trade is the equivalent of 20,000 jobs. What would that mean? In 1996, our trade deficit meant we had a loss of 3.8 million good jobs; 3.8 million good jobs were lost. Just the increase in the deficit from 1995 to 1996--means another 300,000 jobs are gone. They have gone across the border, offshore, overseas. That is the dilemma. 
Now, what do people say will happen to the trade deficit? We have the largest trade deficit in this country's history. You can see what has happened to it. It has been a steady, growing deficit. It continues to be a serious problem, and now it is at record levels. Some forecasters say that this deficit is going to continue to reach new record levels. In fact, one expert is predicting a deficit of $354 billion by 2007. 
You know, we must think about what these trends mean. What is this all about? If I might simplify it for people, let us look at Japan. This is an ally of ours, a good country, a country that, by all accounts, has citizens who work hard and strive to compete aggressively in the world marketplace and do very, very well. We have become a sponge for much of their manufactured goods, and they make pretty good manufactured goods. They are tough, shrewd international competitors. 
But when we send a pound of T-bone steak to Tokyo, guess what? A North Dakota rancher is often out during calving time in some pretty tough weather. He works really hard to deal with the tasks of everyday life on the ranch to care for maybe a 300-cow herd. That rancher raises some beef and then markets the beef. Eventually the beef finds a market, some in this country and some we want to export. When that North Dakota rancher wants to export beef to Japan, guess what happens to that beef? Japan regularly slaps a 50-percent tariff on every pound of beef going into Japan. 
Does anybody think that is reasonable? And this is after our negotiations. It is after we have supposedly succeeded in negotiating down the tariffs on beef going into Japan. We have a celebration, but there still is a 50-percent tariff on T-bone steak going to Tokyo. 
Guess what? Under any other standards of measurement, that would be considered a failure in international trade negotiations. Only because we have such low expectations from those with whom we trade are we willing to say that is a success. It is not a success, as far as I am concerned. 
Why did we get to this position? Well, briefly, after the Second World War, our trade policy was foreign policy. Our trade policy was structured on the premise that we were the biggest, the best, the most, the strongest country on the face of the Earth, and we could compete with almost anybody in this world with one hand tied behind our back and win the competition. So our trade policy with Japan and European countries and others was largely foreign policy. 
What we needed to do to at that time was to construct a trade relationship with our allies that helped them? We could certainly afford to help them, and we felt we must help them. That was our trade policy. For a quarter century it was necessary, and it worked, and guess what? We helped grow and nurture the restoration of post-Second-World-War economies, sufficient so that, I am pleased to say and I think others would be as well, that we now have very tough, shrewd competitors in the world marketplace. They are allies, friends and, yes, in the market system they are competitors. 
It is time that we understand that this country can no longer win with one hand tied behind its back. It is time to understand that trade policy must be more than foreign policy, and we must insist on reciprocal trade treatment from our allies and trading partners. We must insist on not only free and open and expanded trade, but especially fair trade. 
It upsets me to discover what we negotiated in a trade agreement with our neighbor to the north, a wonderful country with good people in it, Canada. We discover what is inside. It is like peeling an onion. You get the layers off and figure out what is in the middle of the treaty. 
You discover that literally hundreds of semi-trucks come south from Canada into our country with durum wheat and barley. These are crops that we already grow in substantial surplus. Then I get in a little truck--a little, 12-year-old, 2-ton orange truck--with a North Dakota farmer with 220 bushels of wheat, and we go up to the Canadian border near Portal, ND. And we are stopped. 
They say, `What do you have in the truck?' `We have 220 bushels of wheat.' `You can't go into Canada with wheat.' `Gee. We just passed 20 semitrucks coming south into our marketplace with wheat.' `Well, that may be but you can't take American wheat into Canada.' 
That is the sort of thing that is fundamentally wrong with our trade agreements. We need fully reciprocal trade with all of our trade allies. 
Let me finally in the last chart talk about what we are here to propose: An emergency commission to end the trade deficit. We need to respond to and deal with the growing, burgeoning problem in this country. That is the record merchandise trade deficits that we face and that our children and their children must repay with a lower standard of living. We must stop it. How do we stop it? 
Senator Byrd, myself, and Senator Sarbanes propose that a commission be impaneled that addresses the wide range of concerns: The manner in which the Government establishes and administers our trade policies and objectives; the causes and consequences of the persistence and growth of the overall trade deficit, as well as the specific bilateral trade deficits I mentioned; the relationship of United States trade deficits to both comparative and competitive advantages; the relationship between investment flows, both in and out of the U.S.; and, the development of policies and alternative strategies to end the trade deficit by 2007 and improve the economic well-being of our citizens. 
Mr. President, I am delighted that Senator Byrd is on the floor today. I want to make one additional comment. 
Those who talk about trade in public discourse here in the U.S. Congress and about town are generally divided into two groups. There is the group that is in favor of free trade and has been for a couple of decades. They are called the free traders, and they are described as those with world vision, those who can see over the horizon, who have the creative ability to think expansively about what our obligations are and what the future will be. And then there are others. They are classified as the xenophobic isolationist stooges who simply don't get it. 
The minute you speak about the trade problem and the trade deficit, they say you are a `protectionist,' a `xenophobic isolationist. That is who that is.' 
I come from a State in which about half of what we produce must find a foreign home. I am the last person that would want to create walls around our border. I want expanded trade. I want open trade. I want free trade. But I demand that trade be fair. 
American businesses and American workers ought to be able to expect that they are going to compete in a marketplace that is a fair marketplace. They should not be expected to compete against a 14-year-old that works 14 hours a day and is paid 14 cents an hour in some foreign factory producing a good that is then shipped to Fargo, Pittsburgh, or Denver. That is not fair trade, and American workers ought not to expect that. 
We simply say there is a chronic and growing problem that ought to be addressed. We propose that an emergency commission be impaneled to end the trade deficit and make recommendations on how to do it.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss a piece of legislation that I and a couple of my colleagues intend to introduce, but I did want to comment first on the remarks that have been offered previously on the floor of the Senate, including the just-completed remarks by the majority whip. 
It is certainly the case that a number of allegations about fundraising abuses are serious and ought to be investigated. The current campaign financing system in this country is in desperate need of revision and reform. The range of abuses that need investigation goes all the way around the spectrum. These include abuses by the major campaign committees, both the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee, congressional campaigns, and the White House. There are a wide range of allegations surfacing almost daily now for several months about abuses in campaign financing. All of them deserve to be fully investigated. The American people deserve no less than that. 
Last week, there was an attempt to do a congressional investigation resolution on the floor of the Senate. That resolution was attempting to put blinders on the investigation sufficient so that it would only investigate a little corner of the problem, and it was the majority party saying only investigate the opposition. It turned out that sufficient members of the Senate would not agree with that. So, finally it had to be broadened to say investigation of campaign finance abuses ought to be across the board, no matter which party is involved with those abuses. As a result the charter given last week to the Senate Committee that will investigate these abuses, is a broader charter rather than a narrower charter. 
The same should hold true with the discussion about the resolution now before the Senate. This resolution, once again, attempts to narrow it. The resolution that will be offered by the Senator from Michigan, a substitute offered by Senator Levin, is what I will choose to support, largely because that resolution contemplates that abuses shall be investigated with respect to either party or any party in which there is an allegation of fundraising abuse. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee already has petitioned the Attorney General on the question of an independent counsel. The law provides for that. The law does not provide for the Senate to intervene on a political basis to petition for an independent counsel. What is happening here is unprecedented. It has not happened previously. 
Part of this debate is whether this is politics or substance. We already have a congressional investigation that will now be organized and will be very well funded. We already have a letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Attorney General. The question of whether this legislation now brought to the floor is a political missive, I suppose, is up to those who are looking at it and would make judgments about its narrow scope. I prefer that we consider the resolution and vote for the resolution offered by the Senator from Michigan. 
I make one additional point. What is not on the floor of the Senate is campaign finance reform. It ought to be. Campaign finance reform ought to be brought to the Senate. We ought to debate it. We ought to reform the campaign finance system. 
What is not on the floor of the Senate, and it must be, is the Chemical Weapons Treaty. That is very important business that is before the body. We must bring it to the floor and have a vote on it and have a debate on the Chemical Weapons Treaty. The attempt to end the spread of poison gases for warfare in this world is a noble attempt initiated first by President Reagan and then by President Bush, sent to us by President Clinton. Many countries have already signed the initiative. It is being held up in this body. Very soon we will have to take aggressive action to try to wedge that to the floor of the Senate and insist on a vote on the important Chemical Weapons Treaty.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the majority is bringing to a vote a resolution that urges the Attorney General to begin the process of appointing an independent counsel to investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign. I will oppose this resolution, if it remains unchanged, because it urges an overly narrow, one-sided investigation. Instead, I will support the alternative to be proposed by Senator Leahy. 
Let us remember that the independent counsel law places the authority to seek an independent counsel in the hands of the Attorney General, and her hands are tied unless certain thresholds are met. I have great faith in the independence and integrity of Janet Reno. She has already invoked the independent counsel process several times during this administration. If and when she believes that the law should be triggered, she will, I am confident, take appropriate action. Yet the majority seeks with this unfortunate resolution to tell her what to do. 
I hope that the majority will instead accept the alternative resolution being proposed by Senator Leahy. The Leahy amendment would change the majority's resolution in several ways, all for the better. 
The Leahy amendment suggests that the Attorney General use her best professional judgment to determine whether to invoke the independent counsel process. It asks that she make her decision without regard to political pressures. It urges her to do so in accordance with the standards of the law and the established procedures of the Department of Justice. And it makes no distinction between presidential and congressional campaigns; it urges that potential illegalities by covered persons be investigated, regardless of which branch of government is involved. 
In short, the Leahy alternative attempts to observe both the letter and the spirit of the law in this matter. It avoids prejudging the issue. Most importantly, it attempts to prevent the further politicization of the independent counsel process, a process that Congress established in order to take politics out of the investigation or prosecution of high government officials. 
Fundamentally, that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the majority's resolution and support the Leahy alternative. Let us not attempt to politically influence our Justice Department and Federal judiciary in this matter. Let us not make a bad situation worse. Let us repeat the bipartisanship that we showed last week. Let us respect the independent counsel law and the independence of the judiciary. And let us also proceed with a diligent and thorough congressional investigation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that will preserve quality care in rural nursing homes by ensuring that they can continue to conduct nurse aide training programs in their facilities. 
This bill enjoys bipartisan support, and I am joined in introducing this bill by Senators Grassley, Rockefeller, Baucus, Roberts, Harkin, Faircloth, Hutchinson, Inouye, and Conrad. The bill, which also has the support of the Clinton administration, will prevent the termination of nurse aide training programs where the reason for the termination is unrelated to the quality of the program and where no training alternative exists within a reasonable distance. 
I have long believed that the Federal Government has an important role to play in ensuring against the kinds of abuses that sometimes occurred prior to enactment of Federal nursing home standards. I do not believe that those abuses were the norm in nursing homes. Nursing homes in my State of North Dakota have a strong record of providing quality care, and I believe that this was the case in most nursing homes. 
But it is clear that some nursing homes did not meet that high standard, and many States were slow to respond. To address that critical problem, I supported and continue to support minimum Federal quality standards. Our first priority in nursing home legislation must be the quality of care provided to residents, and we should not pass any laws that would compromise that goal. 
However, I believe that some of our efforts to regulate nursing homes have not resulted in greater quality of care for residents. In some cases, by imposing unnecessary 
burdens and severe penalties that are not focused on quality, some laws and regulations can actually hinder the delivery of quality care. The legislation I am offering today will address one such instance. 
In rural areas all over the country, nursing facilities offer potential caretakers an opportunity to learn the basic nursing and personal care skills needed to become a certified nurse aide. In return, those who participate in a nurse aide training program help nursing facilities meet their staffing needs and allow the nursing staff to focus more on administering quality nursing care. 
Nurse aide training programs are especially important in rural areas like my State of North Dakota, where potential nurse aides might have to travel hundreds of miles for training if it is not available at the nursing facility in their community. These nurse aide training programs comply with strict guidelines related to the amount of training necessary and determination of competency for certification. 
Despite these safeguards, current law allows programs to be terminated for up to 2 years if a facility has been cited for a deficiency or assessed a civil money penalty for reasons completely unrelated to the quality of the nurse aide training program. In North Dakota, this could result in real hardship not just for the nursing facility and potential nurse aides, but for the nursing home residents who rely on nurse aides for their day-to-day care. 
Under my bill, rural areas would be exempt from termination of nurse aide training programs in these specific instances only if: First, no other program is offered within a reasonable distance of the facility; second, the State assures that an adequate environment exists for operating the program; and third, the State provides notice of the determination and assurances to the State long-term care ombudsman. 
The President has included this proposal in the last two budgets he has presented to Congress. In addition, Congress included this proposal in the Balanced Budget Act passed in December 1995. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Energy Committee voted to approve the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, S. 104, which would establish the construction of an interim facility to store spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste produced by the electric industry and by the military. 
As a member of the Energy Committee, I voted against S. 104 for two reasons. First, I think today's markup of this legislation was premature. Only 2 days ago the Senate voted to confirm the new head of the Energy Department, Secretary Federico PenAE6a. Clearly Mr. PenAE6a hasn't had an opportunity to fully examine this complex issue. He will need some additional time to study S. 104 and offer his views and recommendations about it. Second, I still have some concerns about whether this bill will facilitate or frustrate getting approval for a permanent disposal site of our Nation's spent nuclear fuel. 
Having said this, I want my colleagues to understand that I think that this is an issue that needs immediate attention. The administration and Congress must sit down to negotiate a final solution to this problem as soon as possible. I hope some compromise can be reached that will allow me to vote for this legislation on the Senate floor.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Regent, North Dakota basketball team is going to the State basketball tournament for the first time ever. 
Well, technically, it's the Regent-New England basketball team, but it's all the same to me. These young boys from Hettinger County who play on the Regent-New England basketball team have made this Regent High School graduate enormously proud. 
You don't have to come from a big school to have big talent or a big heart and that's what these young men are proving. 
I don't know who will win the North Dakota State class B tournament but I did want to share my excitement about the achievements of Curt Honeyman and his team of outstanding young men. 
There are no mountains in Hettinger County, but these young men found a goal and have climbed their personal mountain to reach their pinnacle of success. It is a thrill they and everyone around the county will never forget, and I wanted to share that thrill with my colleagues in the Senate.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the National Character Counts Week resolution. Senator Domenici has introduced this resolution, which declares October 19 through 25, 1997, as National Character Counts Week, on behalf of myself and the bipartisan membership of the Senate Character Counts Group. I especially want to thank Senator Domenici for his continuing good leadership on Character Counts. 
The national Character Counts Coalition, an alliance of hundreds of groups, communities, and individuals, was born out of a meeting of some of our country's best thinkers and doers in Colorado less than 5 years ago. These folks had many of the concerns that I know a lot of us here in the Senate share about the wrong direction that many of our young people seem to be headed. 
Character Counts calls on all of us, educators, church and youth leaders, community and business leaders, and most importantly parents, to reinforce six basic values, or pillars of character. These values are so important and basic that I do not think anyone could question them. They are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. 
I have two young children, so I know firsthand how difficult it is for kids to make the right choices when they are constantly being bombarded by messages from our popular culture that it is cool to drink alcohol or smoke or use vulgar language. To counteract these messages, it is more important than ever that we instill in our young people the integrity and good character to stand up for what is right. Children are not born with good character. They learn by example, and if they have good role models all around them, I am confident they will make correct choices for themselves. 
As evidence that children are eager, even hungry, to do the right thing if given the proper reinforcement, I want to hold up the story of 11-year-old Herbert Tarvin. Many of you may remember hearing on the news about the Brinks armored car that crashed in January of this year in one of Miami, Florida's poorest neighborhoods. Herbert was walking to school that day when he passed the wrecked truck, and like many of the adults all around him, he gave into the temptation to grab some of the money from the truck. Herbert's newfound riches totaled 85 cents. In all, some $300,000 in cash and coins was stolen from the truck. 
Fortunately, when Herbert got to school, he had a teacher who cared enough to urge her students to turn over any money they had taken. Herbert's conscience prompted him to turn his 85-cent windfall over to his teacher, who returned it to the Brinks Co. Herbert says he knows he should not have taken the money to begin with because his mom and teacher have taught him better than that, but I am proud of him for ultimately returning the money. 
Many of the adults around Herbert did not act so honorably. After weeks of public pleas and investigations, only about $300 of the $300,000 taken from the truck has been returned. Even so, this story is heartening to me because I think it shows that children want to do the right thing when faced with difficult situations. As Herbert's mom and teacher have done, we all have a role in ensuring that all children are given the ethical tools they need to make difficult choices in today's world. Quite simply, that is what the Character Counts Program is all about. 
I have found that young people in North Dakota are excited about Character Counts. Nearly a year ago, I brought together a group of about three dozen North Dakotans, including several young people, to introduce them to the Character Counts Program. Out of that meeting was born a Character Counts initiative in North Dakota, under the leadership of 4-H youth specialist Geri Bosch. 
In the year since then, Geri and her army of college- and high school-aged 4-H youth ambassadors have been traveling throughout North Dakota to share the Character Counts concept with children, youth, and adults alike, and Character Counts is spreading like wildfire in my State. In December alone, nearly 200 concerned adults participated in Character Counts training so that they could take Character Counts back to their communities. Even more exciting, more than 1,000 young people in North Dakota have participated in the Character Counts Program directly in some way throughout the last year, and countless other kids have been indirectly influenced for the better through the teachers, youth leaders, clergy members, and other concerned citizens who touch their lives daily. 
I have been proud to play some small role in supporting Character Counts in North Dakota and our country. Through these kinds of efforts, we can build a better future for our kids, and I want to again pledge my continued help and support for teaching the pillars of good character.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a good many issues that come to the floor of the Senate that cause debate between Republicans and Democrats. Some are partisan, some cause great rancor, but there is one issue that ought not ever be a partisan debate. That is the issue of crime and how we in our country address it. 
I come to the floor today to speak about legislation I will formally introduce on Monday on behalf of myself and a Republican colleague, Senator Craig, from Idaho. We have joined together to offer a piece of legislation that we introduced in the last Congress. I think this bill makes a great deal of sense, and I hope the Congress will consider it favorably in this session. As a way of describing the legislation, I want to address why I think legislation in this area is necessary to deal with the issue of crime. 
There are a lot of things in this country we can point to that suggest our country is headed in the right direction. Our economy is growing. Some would like it to grow faster, but it is growing. We are not in a recession. You can point to some pretty good things in our education system. Not many people are getting on airplanes and leaving our country to go to college somewhere else. If you want to go to a world class university, largely you would want to be in the United States to do that. If you want to get good health care, you do not get on an airplane to go elsewhere. The best health care available in the world is available in most cases in this county. After doubling our use of energy in the last 20 years, America has cleaner air and cleaner water than we had 20 years ago. 
So you can point to a number of things in this country that give cause for great optimism. But in the area of crime, I at least, and I think a lot of my colleagues and the American people, have a nagging feeling about the lack of safety and security in our country, that something we are doing is not working, that we seem to be on the wrong path. I know that some people point to crime statistics and say violent crime has declined. But when violent crime spikes way up and then drops marginally, violent crime is far too high in this country. 
Here is a crime clock. One major criminal offense occurs every 2 seconds in our country, one violent crime every 18 seconds, one murder in America every 24 minutes, one forcible rape every 5 minutes in our country, one robbery every 54 seconds, one aggravated assault every 29 seconds. You cannot as a citizen of this country review what is happening on our streets and in our neighborhoods and believe we are on the right track with respect to crime. 
This morning I read a piece in the Washington Post that described some of the concerns I have expressed before in this Chamber. It says, `Inmates' Early Freedom Rankles Many in Florida.' 
This article says: `Frank O'Neal got the news that his brother's murderer was being given an early release from prison when his son read it in the Tuesday edition of the local newspaper. All around the State of Florida, O'Neal's experience was repeated as corrections officials unexpectedly granted early release to 300 murderers, rapists, robbers, and other violent inmates.' 
Florida required prison officials to grant inmates 20 days off for good behavior, 20 days off for every 30 days that they served without regard to their crimes on the outside or their behavior on the inside. As a result, 200 additional inmates will be released next Monday, and 2,700 prisoners will eventually be set free early under this approach. 
The fellow that Mr. O'Neal heard about yesterday was a man named Garcia. He stabbed William O'Neal, the brother of Frank O'Neal, 36 times. William O'Neal was a grocery store manager--stabbed 36 times before this fellow then stole a TV set and VCR and left him dead. Now, Garcia has been granted early release. 
I have talked about early release previously. Some of the things I have talked about have convinced me that the system itself is a system which just does not work. 
A couple of weeks ago there was a District of Columbia police officer who was murdered in Prince Georges County, MD. His name was Oliver Wendell Smith, Jr. He was shot three times in the back of the head outside of his apartment. His wallet, pistol, and badge were stolen. 
All three men now charged with this murder have long criminal records. One of them was free on bond on drugs and weapons charges and another was on pretrial release for burglary and assaulting another police officer. I have their records in this paper given to me by the police department at my request. These are people who should not have been on the streets to murder a policeman. These are people who should have been in prison. We knew who they were, but our country said go ahead to the streets. In Florida, 2,700 criminals will go to the streets. 
I talked last year about the Jonathan Hall case. A man named James `Buck' Murray was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the murder of Jonathan Hall. Jonathan Hall was a 13-year-old boy from this area who was stabbed about 58 times and then left for dead in an icy pond. But when they found his body, he had grass and dirt between his fingers because he obviously had not immediately died from all those stab wounds. He, laying in that icy pond, had tried to pull himself out of the pond but died before he could. 
Now, let me tell you about the guy who murdered him. James `Buck' Murray, in 1970, was sent to 20 years in prison for slashing the throat of a cab driver, stealing a cab and leaving the driver for dead. While in a Virginia prison, 3 years later, he abducted a young woman while on work release. He was then convicted of kidnaping and sentenced to 5 more years in prison. In 1991, he was convicted of murdering a fellow prisoner and sentenced to another 10 years behind bars, and in 1994, he was set free on mandatory parole with accumulated good time credits. A 13-year-old boy is dead because James `Buck' Murray, whom we knew to be a murderer, was put back on the street to live in Jonathan's neighborhood. 
I also have talked about Bettina Pruckmayr in this Chamber. Bettina was 26 years old, by all accounts a wonderful, bright young woman, an attorney who came to the Washington, DC, area to work. On December 16, a year and a half ago, she was abducted in a carjacking and driven to an ATM machine in Washington, DC, and then fatally stabbed. Authorities charged 38-year-old Leo Gonzalez Wright with the murder. He was linked to that crime through a bank security photo taken at the ATM machine. He was stopped apparently in a stolen Mustang some days afterward. Mr. Wright should not have been on the streets. He was previously sentenced to 5 to 15 years for armed robbery, sentenced to 15 to 45 years to life for murder, released on parole, then served 16 years on a 20-year minimum sentence even though his actual sentence was 20 to 60 years. 
I want to show my colleagues a chart about why these criminals are getting out of prison. It does not take Sherlock Holmes or Dick Tracy to figure out who is going to murder the next victim in our country. The average time spent in prison for committing a murder in America is just over 7 years. The average murderer spends 34 percent of their sentence in prison, and then is released early. 
Kidnaping? The average kidnaper spends only 40 percent of his or her time behind bars and is released early. Robbery? It is 39 percent. 
There is not a Member of the Senate whose life has not been touched by violent crime. My mother was killed in a manslaughter incident. I suspect that those of us who have personally been touched by violent crime never quite view violent crime the same way. For a family to receive a call, as have the families of those I have just described, to be told that their loved one is now dead in circumstances where you know that death should have been and could have been prevented, leaves an understanding something must change. 
I want to show my colleagues something that I hope will shock the daylights out of everybody. We have, right now in prisons in America, 4,820 people serving in prison in our country for murders they committed while they were on parole, having been released early for another offense. In other words, our Government released murderers early, to say, `You are done with your sentence because we give you time off for good behavior, so go back to the streets. We need to give you `good time' for good behavior because if we do not give you that we cannot manage you in prison.' So the prison authorities give a carrot of getting out early to violent offenders so they can better manage them in prison, and then the question is: Who manages them when they hit the sidewalk? Who manages them when they are in the neighborhood? Who manages them on a dark block when they are prepared to commit another murder? These 4,820 families of murder victims have every right to ask this Government, to ask every State government, every judge, every State legislator, and, yes, the U.S. Congress, how dare you do this? By what right do you have the opportunity to turn out murderers and rapists and robbers back to our streets? 
The question is, what do we do about it? Can we, should we, will we do something about it? I hope so. Mr. President, 4,820 people are in prison for having committed murders when they should have been in prison, 3,890 rapists committed rapes when they should have been in prison, and the list goes on. 
What do we do? My proposal is very simple. By far, most of criminal justice is handled at the State and we do not control it. I understand that these decisions are made by State governments and by State criminal justice systems. But we have a connection to it by virtue of a wide range of resources that we provide to State criminal justice systems. 
I propose that we say to State that we want you to do the following, and the amount of resources that we provide to your criminal justice system depends on your doing it. We want you to decide that there is a difference in the requirement to incarcerate violent versus nonviolent offenders. We want you to separate offenders, nonviolent and violent, and for violent offenders we want everyone in this country to get a very simple message: If you commit a violent offense and you are sentenced to prison, prison is your address until the end of your term. No parole, no good time, no nothing. Your prison cell is your address until the end of your sentence. That is what I hope will happen across this country. 
Until we get to that point, we are going to have stories as appeared in the Washington Post this morning--2,700 murderers, rapists, robbers, and other violent criminals will be released early because they have earned good time while in prison. Our country must decide to send a message to all Americans: If you commit a violent crime, you are going to serve your time in prison, and there is no excuse and there is no way out and there is no early out. You are going to serve your time in prison. 
I have previously introduced legislation that also says to every State government in our country that if they had a violent prisoner behind bars and then decided that, because it is too costly to keep the violent prisoner there, he or she will be released early to Main Street, to the sidewalk, to the side street--if that particular prisoner then commits another crime while out on early release, that State government has no immunity from lawsuits from the victims. That State government has a responsibility to keep that violent criminal off the streets. If it chooses to put that violent criminal back on the streets early, and that violent criminal commits a crime, the State who put the violent criminal back on the streets should have responsibility to the victims. 
I must say, while I feel passionate about this issue because my family has experienced the tragedy of violent crime, I am blessed to come from a State that does not have as much violent crime as many. North Dakota is a wonderful State in which to live. Oh, it is a little cold sometimes in the winter. Yes, it snowed yesterday, it is blowing a little today. But it is a wonderful State with wonderful people and it is blessed with a lower crime rate than some areas of the country. But we are not immune. There is no State geographical border or boundary that says violent crime stops here. 
There used to be a wonderful woman named Donna Martz who would bring bus tours to Washington, DC. The tours would come here and come to the front steps of the Capitol and they would always ask us, because they were from North Dakota, to take a picture with them on the steps, and our congressional delegation would be delighted to do that. Donna was a wonderful and remarkable woman. On a Sunday morning, in a motel parking lot in Bismarck, ND, a quiet Sunday morning in a relatively crime free city, Donna Martz was abducted, kidnaped, put in the trunk of a car and driven through five or six States for a good number of days. She was later discovered, dead, shot to death in the desert in the southwest part of our country. 
From a motel parking lot on a quiet Sunday morning as Donna prepared to drive to her home north of Bismarck, she was instead kidnaped, put in the trunk of a car, taken on a ride of terror and brutally murdered. 
By whom? By a couple of folks from Pennsylvania. Strangers to the criminal justice system? Oh, no. People we knew were violent and just couldn't keep in jail. Time after time after time, you look at these statistics and understand that this is not some mysterious disease for which there is not a cure. We understand what is happening and we ought to understand how to respond to it. If we cannot send a message across this country that those who commit violent crimes need to spend their entire sentence in prison--and I might say to judges around this country, I am also a little tired of the sentences that are handed out. I am a little tired of the slap on the wrist. I want violent criminals to be treated appropriately by judges. People who are inherently violent and commit violent crimes ought to go to jail and spend a long time in jail with a sentence that is appropriate to that. 
It is unforgivable in this country that the average murderer, the average person convicted of murder, is spending only 7 years in prison. That is unforgivable that our criminal justice system allows that to happen. 
Again, we know what to do about that if we have the will. My friend, Senator Craig from Idaho, and I will introduce on Monday this legislation, and I hope very much that my colleagues will join us in saying this very simple message to all the States and all the people involved in the criminal justice system: Distinguish between violent and nonviolent offenders in our criminal justice system and say to every American, if you commit a violent crime, understand that you are going to spend all of your time in jail until the day that your sentence ends, and you are not going to get an hour off early. There is no good time, no parole, no help, no hope. 
How do we do that? We do that through the resources we send to State and local governments that reward those States that adopt that provision, and, hopefully, State by State by State, we can develop a national policy that says to all Americans that we have begun to draw the line on violent crime, that we have sent a message to everyone who commits a violent crime that things have changed. 
Mr. President, I hope, having given this long presentation, that some in the Congress will cosponsor, perhaps even the Presiding Officer, having listened at length, will cosponsor legislation of this type, and, one by one by one, we will achieve enough cosponsors on a bipartisan basis to this bill offered by a Democrat and a Republican. One by one by one, we will cosponsor, vote, and create a new law that does something good for this country. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the initiative offered today by the Senator from South Carolina. I do not very often come to the floor supporting constitutional amendments. I think we ought to change the Constitution very rarely. 
I think the Supreme Court has made an error here in the Buckley versus Valeo decision. It was a decision by one vote in the Supreme Court, and the decision stands logic on its head. The Supreme Court said it is perfectly constitutional to limit campaign contributions but it is not constitutional to limit campaign spending. Limiting campaign spending, they say, is an abridgement of free speech. I have no idea how the Supreme Court can conceive a logic like that that says it is fine to limit campaign contributions, but you cannot limit spending. We ought to be able to have reasonable spending limits in campaigns. 
The Senator from South Carolina brings an initiative to the floor that is the first initiative, in my judgment, in this Congress that says let's reform our campaign finance system in this country. If you need evidence that that needs doing, pick up any paper and go to any page in the last 6 weeks. If you still need evidence, it means you cannot read. All around us there is evidence that we must reform this campaign finance system. 
Will Rogers once said something that is probably appropriate to quote in this Chamber, a Chamber that used to have spittoons between every desk, he said, `When there is no place left to spit, you either have to swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times.' We either have people willing to vote for this and change with the times, understanding this is necessary and it is necessary now, or I hope they will sit around here and swallow their tobacco juice, because if you still believe campaign finance reform is not necessary, if you still believe, as some do, that there is not enough spending in campaigns and we ought to spend more, and there are people here who believe that, then you are sadly off track with what the American people know about American politics. 
I want to refer to a chart. The chart shows spending since 1992. Wages have gone up 13 percent since 1992. Spending on education has increased 17 percent since 1992. So in 4 years, 1992 to 1996, wages in America went up 13 percent, spending on education went up 17 percent, and spending on politics in our country went up 73 percent, 73 percent. 
There are people still in this Congress who say and have said repeatedly there is not enough spending in American politics. I have no idea what part of the world you would look in order to find their head. How on Earth can you decide with the kind of political inflation we have seen, where the spending on politics in America outstrips by multiples the spending on other things, how on Earth 
can you conclude there is not enough spending in politics? The fact is there is too much spending in politics. 
Now, we could change that by ourselves. We do not need changes to the Constitution. In 1992, the election that Senator Hollings was speaking of, I was running for the Senate in 1992. I said to my opponent, let us provide in North Dakota the most unusual campaign in America. I was already an incumbent, a Member of the House of Representatives, so I said I am better known than you are, but let me make you a deal. I said I will propose this. Let us decide between the two of us not to do any advertising--no television, no newspapers, no radio, no advertising at all, neither of us. We pledge to do that, and instead pool our money, and from September 1, Labor Day, to the election day in November, let us, once a week, buy prime time television statewide in North Dakota, pool our money, pay half the costs, each of us. We come to this, 1 hour, each week, prime time, with no notes, no handlers, just us, and no moderator, and we spend an hour a week on prime time television, the two of us, telling North Dakotans why we are running for public office, what we believe in, what our passion is, what we believe is necessary for the future of this country. At the end of those 8 weeks you will be as well-known as I am, because I am an incumbent, I am already well-known, you will be as well-known as I am. Prime time, an hour a week, 8 weeks, we could simulcast throughout the State, and at the end of the 8 weeks, North Dakota would have the most unique campaign in the country. No slash and burn 30-second ads, none. There would only have been 8 hours of debate between two people who desired to hold public office and who told the people why they aspire to be able to be given this public trust, why they wanted to hold public office, what their dreams were for the future of this country, what their vision was in public policy changes for America's future. 
It would have been the most unique campaign in the country. I regret my opponent said no. I do not know why he said no. He said no. It was a mistake on his part. I am here, so I can say it was a mistake on his part. I think it would have been a better campaign for him and for me had he accepted it, and certainly a better campaign for North Dakotans. But he chose to run the kind of campaign that I had to respond to with 30-second ads here and 30-second ads there, and those are not very informative. 
Despite the fact that we have these techniques in the 30-second ads, I might say to my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, I introduced a bill dealing with that in the Congress, the 30-second ads. Do you know that in political spending, a substantial amount of the money in all campaigns goes to television. The law requires that the television stations provide the lowest rate that they provide for their commercial advertisers, the lowest rate for political advertising. So I suggested that we require that the law say that the lowest rate for political advertising will only apply to commercials that are at least 1 minute in length, and only commercials in which the candidate appears on the commercial--75 percent of the commercial. Get rid of the slash and burn 30-second ads, no more of the anonymous voices with slash and burn negatives. I think that is the right incentive, but that is a different subject for a different date. 
My point is, there is no one I think who can credibly argue that we are not spending enough in politics. Clearly, political spending is mushrooming in this country. What shall we or could we do about it? The Senator from South Carolina offers a solution. His solution is one that says let us provide that with the right approach we could reasonably limit campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court has said that is unconstitutional. The Senator from South Carolina says, well, change the Constitution. We should never approach that easily or quickly, but I am with him. Frankly, I guess I would like to see us go to the Supreme Court a second time, and say will you not correct the error you made the first time? 
I think there might be a chance of getting that done because it was a decision by one vote. 
In any event, I think that one of the solutions for campaign finance reform is to limit campaign spending. Is that an inhibition of free speech? Is it an inhibition of free speech to tell somebody who has $100 million, `You can't spend $30 million buying a seat someplace'? Is that what the Framers of the Constitution decided democracy was about--to make some money, ante up to the trough, and plunk down $30 million and buy a seat? I don't think so. I don't think that's what the method of selecting people who serve in representative government was envisioned to be by the Framers of our Constitution. 
This is the first effort to say to my colleagues: Do you believe in campaign finance reform, or don't you? Campaign finance reform. Boy, if we need more discussion about that, then this must be an empty well; this must be a pit without a bottom. 
I want to describe what we have had on campaign finance reform in a decade. We have had 6,700 pages of hearings, 3,300 floor speeches, 2,700 pages of Congressional Research Service reports, 113 Senate votes, 522 witnesses, 49 days of testimony, 29 different sets of hearings by 8 different congressional committees, 17 filibusters, 8 cloture votes on one bill alone, and one Senator arrested and dragged to the floor of the Senate. I wasn't here at that point, but I assume Senator Hollings was and could describe in remarkable detail whoever was dragged to the floor. And there were 15 reports issued by 6 different congressional committees. 
Now, given that history, can we find some Senators who say we are not ready and it is not time for campaign finance reform? The honest answer, by some, is: Let's not have any reform. Some would say: Let's decide there ought to be more money spent. Let's make campaigning a commercial product. Let's have campaigns compete with Rolaids, dog food, gasoline, and automobiles, in terms of consumer preference. Whoever has the most money can advertise the most. 
But the Senator from South Carolina has raised, for most of this afternoon, the right questions. We can spend forever now, talking about what happened in the past. We will and we should. There isn't anything about campaign finance abuses that ought not be investigated if there are reasonable and credible claims of abuses. The FBI is investigating some questions. The Justice Department is investigating some questions. Yesterday, we decided--and I voted for it, as did the Senator from South Carolina--that a committee ought to investigate some of these questions. 
There are some serious questions about foreign countries intending to influence American elections that ought to be investigated, and they will be. The American people deserve to know that is the case. But the American people deserve more than just a look back. The American people deserve a Congress that is going to look ahead and say, how do we respond to this question of galloping inflation in campaign finance spending? The galloping inflation of a campaign system that seems almost out of control--spending more and more and more money in State after State, in district after district. There are a hundred reasons to prevent something, and it is easy to do. 
The Senator from South Carolina had the job this afternoon of coming and supporting an affirmative proposition, the first proposition on the floor of the Senate to respond to campaign finance reform. I think it was Mark Twain who was asked once to be a participant in a debate. He said, `Of course, I will be happy to debate, provided I get to take the negative side.' He was told, `But you have not asked what the subject was.' And he said, `The subject doesn't matter. You don't need any preparation to be on the negative side.' 
That is pretty much true with any debate. The easiest proposition in the world is to be on the negative side. Senator Hollings brings to the floor a proposition that is very simple. This proposition is that what is wrong with campaigns in American politics today is too much money is spent. There is too much money 
around. This is not a democracy that was on the auction block, for sale. 
The framers of our Constitution did not envision that representative government was part of a bidding process. We have tried, in a number of different ways, to propose that we have reasonable limits that competitors in this political system would agree to, and we have discovered that the Supreme Court says those limits are unconstitutional. As much as I disagree with the Supreme Court, their decision stands. The Senator from South Carolina now says, let us alter that by making the change he proposes. Does it infringe on free speech? I don't think so. Would it hurt our political system? No, it would help our political system. Would it restore the confidence of the American people in this system? I think so. Would it do the right thing in trying to propose some sensible spending limits that are enforceable? Sure. 
Now, we can turn this down, and there may be the votes to do that. But the question everyone ought to ask for those who turn this down is, what next? If you decide this is not the way, then what is the way? Or do you like things just as they are? Do you find recreational reading about campaigns, about the political system in our country, up to its neck in money, do you find that interesting and fun to read about? Or do you really believe that there are ways for us to make some sense out of campaign finance reform in a way that would improve this system? 
We had campaign finance reform over 20 years ago, in the 1970's, and it worked for awhile. I think there are people on all sides of the political spectrum who have stretched that and distorted it and discolored it in dozens of ways and found loopholes and hired the best minds to figure out how you jump the fence and get under the fence and through the fence, and the 1970's reforms don't work anymore. So the question will be, should we reform this system now? Or should we just let this roll along and decide it is just fine? 
The American people know the answer to that. The American people understand that things are not just fine. The American people support campaign finance reform. This is the first bill and the first opportunity Members of the Senate will have to say: I want to stand up for campaign finance reform. 
I ask those who say `no' to this, then what? Do you believe the current system works? If you do, you can fit in a mighty small phone booth with all the rest of the American people who believe as you do. If you believe this system is broken and needs to be repaired, if you believe this ought to be fixed, that we ought to stand up for our political system and for its future health, then I think this is a reasonable approach to decide that spending limits make sense. I intend to vote for it. I was pleased to cosponsor the initiative offered by the Senator from South Carolina. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we wanted to come to the floor today because we have watched for a number of weeks a discussion on the floor of the Senate about changing the United States Constitution to require a balanced budget. In fact, for a good many weeks we had a stack almost 5-foot tall of books. Apparently they represented budget books and budgets that were submitted by Presidents to Congress and described various budget deficits over many years. And that 5-foot stack of books resided on the desk over there for I think 3 or 4 weeks in the Chamber. The discussion was: `Let us change the Constitution to require a balanced budget.' We had that vote. Those books are now gone. Now, of course, comes the real work. Altering the Constitution of the United States is one thing. Balancing the budget by writing a yearly budget, which the Congress is required to do following the submission of a budget by the President, is quite another thing. I made the point during the debate on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget that we could alter the Constitution at 12 o'clock noon that requires a balanced budget and at 12:01 there would be no difference in either Federal debt or Federal deficit. Why? Because that is required to be done in the individual yearly choices of taxing and spending decisions here in the Congress. 
I do not see anybody out here on the floor on the other side with nearly as much energy on the proposition of writing a budget that will really balance the budget. In fact, no one is here now, and there hasn't been for some long while anyone here to address the question of will there be a budget brought to the floor of the Senate? The deadline for the Budget Committee to act on a budget is April 1. That is not very many days away. The deadline for the adoption of a budget resolution by the Congress is April 15, about a month away. That leaves only 7 working days here in the Senate between now and the deadline by which the Budget Committee shall have acted to comply with its responsibilities. And it is only 14 working days in the Congress to actually pass a conference report on the floor of the Senate and the House to comply with the requirements of the budget act. But, contrary to 5 feet of documents when we discussed altering the Constitution, you can't find a single page scavenging anywhere in this Chamber. Not in the darkest recesses of the deepest drawer in these Senate desks will you find a page that explains what the plan is for actually balancing the budget--not altering the Constitution; the plan for actually balancing the budget. 
We say we are ready. We want a plan to balance the budget. The President has submitted a plan. Now let's see the alternatives, and talk about them and describe the choices and what are the priorities. 
Why do we not see a plan? And why do we see so little energy on this issue of actually dealing with the budget on the floor of the Senate? 
I want to hold up a chart that describes why I think we are in this situation. The Joint Tax Committee disclosed to us that in the first 5 years of the coming budget the cost of the proposed tax cuts by the Republicans here in Congress will mean $200 billion in lost revenue but that in the first 10 years the lost revenue will be $525 billion. In other words, you lose a couple hundred billion dollars in the first 5 years, and then much, much more than that in the second 5 years; in 10 years, nearly half a trillion dollars. 
What does that mean? It means, if you have that much less revenue--and, incidentally, most all of this tax cut will be borrowed and will be added to the Federal debt--every dollar of tax cut proposed before the budget is balanced is going to be borrowed. But the point is when you are proposing very deep cuts in your revenue, then what happens? You have to make deeper and deeper and deeper cuts in some of the programs that people rely on. Then you have to answer the question that people in this Chamber ask and people around the country ask. What does this mean in terms of the programs that affect me, such as the Medicare Program? What does it mean in terms of the investments in education? What does it mean in terms of building and repairing highways and roads? What does it mean in terms of funding of the National Institutes of Health? 
Those are the questions that you have to ask in order to construct a budget that will balance the budget, and those are the questions that are not being asked. I guess the reason is there are not answers. 
So we come to the floor of the Senate today to say we are 7 
working days in the Senate away from the requirement in law that the Budget Committee act on a budget resolution. It appears no such action will take place. The majority leader on the other side of this Capitol said they may act on some kind of a plan in May. He was unclear about that. That is not what the law requires. The law doesn't require anything other than that on April 1 a budget resolution be adopted by the Budget Committees and by April 15 adopted by the Congress. 
As I said previously, it is easy enough to come to the floor of the Senate and breeze on about altering the Constitution of the United States, apparently allowing some people to believe that, if you can alter the Constitution, you would have balanced the budget. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Altering the Constitution will not alter the deficit by 1 cent. That will be done by making individual tough choices in taxing and spending decisions. Why are those choices not now being made? Why does there appear that there is no preparation on the part of those who anguished so hard to change the Constitution? Why does there seem to be no preparation on their part to anguish as hard and toil as long to create a budget that will actually balance the budget? Because I think that they have with their cans and brushes painted themselves into a corner promising tax cuts to the tune of $200 billion in 5 years, and $500 billion in 10 years; tax cuts undoubtedly that are popular but tax cuts that they know will require them to make enormously deep cuts in a wide range of programs that are very important in this country. 
I believe they simply don't want to describe what those cuts will be and which programs those cuts will come from. 
Mr. President, I would be happy to yield such time as may be consumed to the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my question was on the procedure with respect to subpoenas. I listened to the Senator from Tennessee--I have great respect for the Senator from Tennessee --and the discussions on the work of this committee dealing with very serious questions and sensitive issues. I trust that that work will be carried out in a way that will make the American people confident and proud that Congress did its job. 
On the question of subpoenas, the question that I was wanting to ask was about procedure. The select committee on the Watergate issue, for example, had a procedure which seems to me to make a lot of sense. And the procedure was, if the chairman or the vice chairman of a committee were proposing a subpoena, for example, a vice chairman of that committee, the procedure was if that vice chairman proposed a subpoena that the chair might have objected to, the vice chair had a right to go to the committee to get a vote of the committee on that subpoena question. 
It seems to me to be the right kind of procedure in order to protect both the chairman and also the ranking member of a committee like this, especially with respect to the subpoena power. And I was wanting to understand whether there has been 
any agreement on that kind of procedure as between the chairman of the committee and the ranking member.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might, I had noticed an amendment that I would have intended to offer on this. The unanimous consent precludes me from doing that. I accepted that judgment on the basis of the discussion I had had previously with Senator Levin, Senator Glenn, Senator Thompson, and others. 
I am heartened by the Senator's answer. My expectation would be then that when you have had an opportunity to present this to the committee, the committee would probably want to adopt this procedure. 
This procedure seems to me to be sound and fair and the right kind of approach to deal with these very difficult issues. And certainly subpoena powers represent one of the most difficult issues.

It seemed to me this represented a procedure that made a great deal of sense.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Health Insurance Cost Tax Equity Act of 1997, which is legislation to finally put our Nation's sole proprietors on par with their larger corporate competitors with respect to the tax treatment of health insurance costs. 
Last summer in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Congress took a great stride in addressing one of urgent tax matters facing our family farmers and ranchers. This act, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by the President, included a proposal to increase the amount that farmers, ranchers and other sole proprietors may deduct for their health insurance costs to 80 percent by the year 2006, a significant improvement from its current level of 40 percent. 
But we cannot stop at this point. It is indefensible that our tax laws tell some of our biggest corporations that they still can deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs, while others, mostly smaller businesses, are told they can deduct only a smaller share of their health insurance costs. 
This provision is absolutely critical to the health care concerns of farmers, ranchers and small business owners who conduct their businesses as sole proprietors. That is why I'm reintroducing legislation this year to ensure complete fairness in the Tax Code for sole proprietors who acquire health insurance coverage for themselves and their families. My bill will increase the deduction for the health insurance costs of the self-employed to 60 percent and 80 percent in 1998 and 1999, respectively. After that, Americans who work for themselves could deduct 100 percent of their insurance costs, just as large corporations do. 
The health of a farm family or small business owner is no less important than the health of the president of a large corporation, and the Internal Revenue Code should reflect this simple fact. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. It promotes tax justice and the well-being of our independent producers and the entire country.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise to commend Kay S. Dowhower. After more than 9 years of committed service, Kay is leaving her role as director of the Evangelical Lutheran Church's governmental affairs office in the Nation's capital to pursue other advocacy efforts within the church. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is a church with a membership of over 5.2 million people and 11,000 congregations. 
During those 9 years, she has worked tirelessly for social justice in the formulation of public policy. She has been a committed spokesperson for the poor and the powerless in this Nation and abroad. Her competent work has provided her church, her colleagues, and those in Government with encouragement and a model of excellence. 
Kay Dowhower, you will be missed. We have been the better because of your unwavering efforts to challenge us to do what is just for the least of these in our Nation and in the world.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer some reflections to express some concerns about the direction of the implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
It has been over a year since this landmark legislation was enacted. To my dismay, and I think to the dismay of some others, some of the concerns that I and others expressed a year ago are now concerns that are more real than when we expressed them. 
As the dust begins to settle after the major titans in the telecommunications industry battled for advantage under this act, the consumers, unfortunately, appear perhaps to be the losers. I hope that will not be the case in the long run, but I am concerned it shapes up to be the case now unless the course is altered. 
Some of this is directly related to the deregulation of the cable television and the media ownership rules under the act. Cable rates, for example, have risen almost three times faster than the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Consumers are also now getting hit by some preemptive rate increases on local telephone rates. 
Finally, the concerns about the direction being taken by the Federal Communications Commission raise the prospect of future increases in telephone rates if the FCC in its universal service proceeding does not implement the Telecommunications Act as we wrote it a year ago. 
When the Senate, Mr. President, passed its version of the Telecommunications Act in June 1996, I voted against it for a couple of reasons. First, I feared that the Senate measure would do more to promote concentration in media and telecommunications markets than it would to break up monopolies and to instill competitive markets. Second, in my judgment, the bill put the cart before the horse by deregulating monopoly carriers before the presence of competition. 
Despite the fact that it was sold widely on the floor of the Senate as a bill to promote competition in the telecommunications industry, I believed that it would do more to foster and facilitate concentration in the telecommunications industry, producing exactly the opposite of what competition would deliver to consumers. 
The Senate version deregulated broadcast ownership rules, and it would have prohibited the Justice Department from evaluating the competitive consequences of the entry into long-distance services by the Bell companies. The conference report then came back and made some improvements in these areas, and I voted for the conference report on final passage with some reservations. 
But I remained concerned enough about the issue of media concentration as a result of this act that I introduced legislation to repeal the changes made in the new law on the very same day that the conference report was approved. 
I also cited some concerns about increases in rates in the telecommunications services, especially cable services, as a potential problem that Congress is going to have to be concerned about and have to deal with. 
Under the Telecommunications Act, the rate regulations of some cable companies were immediately deregulated before the emergence of competition. As a consequence, I am told that some 20 percent of all cable subscribers were left to the mercy of whatever a monopoly might want to do with them upon the date of that enactment. 
Now that the new law has been enacted for over a year, let us look at what has happened and see what it means and what might lie ahead. Looking back, at least it seems to me the road ahead may be troublesome. 
Let me first talk about local phone rates. 
While the local competition rules are currently in abeyance, stayed by a Federal circuit court because of a lawsuit filed by local exchange telephone carriers and by the States, many of the Telecommunications Act's most important provisions have yet to be implemented. But before local competition emerges in any significant way, some local phone companies are already jumping the gun and saying that they want to raise local rates. Last April, most local phone companies filed comments at the FCC indicating that to them deregulation of the local price caps would allow something they called rebalancing of local telephone rates. 
Now, the FCC did not follow their recommendations, but several local phone companies have taken their rebalancing efforts to the States, seeking permission to increase local residential telephone rates. 
A number of regional Bell operating companies, for instance, are seeking legislation before State legislative assemblies to repeal price cap regulations, which most say will lead to an increase in local phone rates on residential customers. That was not what was contemplated by the Telecommunications Act. 
This deregulation they now seek is unnecessary. They say that they want to be deregulated to balance rates with cost. They say that is a necessity for a competitive environment. `Rebalancing' means doubling residential phone rates over the next 4 years for some local phone service customers in my State of North Dakota. North Dakotans are being told that local phone rate increases are necessary `in order to implement the Federal law in a competitively fair manner,' in the words of the company seeking deregulation. 
I was a hesitant supporter of the final version of the Telecommunications Act that came out of the conference. I did not vote for that legislation nor do I think did my colleagues vote for that legislation to allow an increase in residential telephone rates in this country. Any suggestion by an incumbent local telephone monopoly that the Federal law requires or even contemplates deregulation of local phone rates before there is any real competition for local phone service is, in my judgment, a gross misrepresentation of both the letter of the law as well as the intent of Congress. I simply do not understand the rationale that local rates must go up because of competition when, in fact, most consumers have not seen the benefits of competition. Local competition, in my State and in most States, does not yet exist. 
In the 1 year since the Telecommunications Act was enacted, there has been little change in the actual presence of local competition for telephone service. It seems that the prospect of future competition, not actual competition today, is driving up prices. That is not a derivative of this act, that is an aberration of this act. I do not believe there is one person who would have stood up on the floor of this Senate and said, `We want to pass a Telecommunications Act because we want local phone service charges to go up.' This makes no sense and has no justification in law or in the act that we passed. 
In fact, the conference committee specifically rejected language that would have mandated that we deregulate price caps under the Telecommunications Act. Instead, the Federal legislation correctly focused on promoting competition and establishing adequate universal service support systems that would prevent the necessity of any dramatic local phone rate increases. 
When the Telecommunications Act was being developed, a number of us from rural States who sat on the Senate Commerce Committee created something called the `Farm Team.' We went to great lengths to strengthen the bill's universal service provisions. Beginning with the Hollings-Danforth legislation of the 103d Congress, which was S. 1822, and through the entire legislative process in the 104th Congress, a number of us labored very, very hard to structure the legislation to make sure that consumers would not experience significant rate increases for telephone rates. Under the act, Congress mandated that universal service support mechanisms be sufficient and that rates be affordable. 
To the extent that competition, actual competition, imposes changes in the traditional revenue streams that have historically been available under regulated environments for local phone companies, this act provides that universal service support mechanisms must be in place to ensure that rates remain affordable. 
The Telecommunications Act once again does not sanction dramatic rate increases. There is no relationship between this Federal law that was passed last year and legislation before my home State legislature and others that seek to deregulate local monopoly phone service before there is any real price competition. It seems to me if there are circumstances in which local phone 
monopolies are being pinched on revenues, the debate should be about how to address that problem through the universal service support mechanisms, not through rate increases on captive customers. 
I happen to think that the Bell system that serves our State of North Dakota, U S West, is an excellent company. They do a good job. They are a good strong company. I understand that their mission is to their stockholders. But where there is not effective competition, where a local provider has monopoly service, then there must be good and effective regulation by Government regulators and oversight by State authorities. That is what this issue is, not just to North Dakota, but to many other States, as well. 
The Telecommunications Act anticipated a strong role for State legislatures and regulators, but the act does not anticipate that the States would exercise their authority in a manner that would leave consumers unprotected in the face of monopoly service. The objective of the Telecommunications Act is to foster competition and to encourage infrastructure investment. But as we know in rural States like North Dakota and others, competition can be a double-edged sword. In densely populated urban areas, competition can drive down consumer prices to create greater access to advanced telecommunications services. But in rural, less-populated areas, they may never see the benefits of competition, and we do not want to see monopolies extracting higher prices from captive consumers to subsidize services in markets where the carrier faces competition. 
We do not want to see the same result in telecommunication services that we see in deregulation of the airlines, or for that matter, deregulation of railroads. We are served in my State with one jet service and one railroad, and in both cases we are paying higher rates than are justified. We pay higher rates in airline service following deregulation despite its promise of benefits for everyone. In our part of the country, we pay anywhere from 20 to 30 to 40 percent more for airline tickets because we do not have competition for jet service. In fact, I can get on a jet in Washington, DC, and fly twice as far and pay half of the cost. If I get on a jet here in Washington, DC, to fly to a city in North Dakota as opposed to flying all the way to the west coast, Los Angeles, I will pay twice as much to fly half as far. Why does it cost that much to fly to a State like North Dakota? Because there is no effective real competition. That is the experience we have had in deregulation of the airline industry. 
The railroads, if you put a cargo of wheat on a railroad train in Bismarck and ship it to Minneapolis you pay $2,300 to ship the carload. Put the same carload of wheat on a hopper car in Minneapolis and ship it to Chicago, you do not pay $2,300, you pay $1,000. Why do we get more than double the price in North Dakota? Because between Minneapolis and Chicago there are several railroads competing to haul the wheat, and in North Dakota to Minneapolis there is one. We have long suffered as a result of deregulation, with less service and higher prices. 
No one anticipated passing a Telecommunications Act in which the Congress, the regulatory authority, or States would decide that they will deregulate and provide new pricing authority from monopolies to provide local telephone service. Everyone in this room, everyone in this room who played a role in the Telecommunications Act, if this continues, will be required to respond to constituents who are going to ask them, why did you pass a piece of legislation that resulted in increasing local phone service telephone rates all across this country? 
In North Dakota, the dominant local service carrier says that they need to rebalance, which means changing rates and means residential rate increases because they are not otherwise going to be able to invest in States in which they provide local phone services. But this company, like most others, has plenty of capital to invest in other things. This particular company purchased a cable company for about $11 billion--the largest 
cable acquisition in 1996. They also bought a couple of other cable companies for over $1 billion, and they will spend up to $300 million this year alone to upgrade those cable systems outside their local phone company region. That company in North Dakota, which is a dominant local service carrier, has 15 million access lines in its local phone region, and 250,000 of those are in North Dakota. But, it has more cable subscribers in their foreign and domestic systems than it has in local phone subscribers. 
The point I am making is that there is nothing wrong with a dominant local phone service carrier having investments outside their region. There is nothing wrong with them asking for the authority to extract more revenue. But there is something wrong with deregulating prices for a monopoly providing telephone service in a region. 
As I said, every Member of the Senate will have to answer to that if local telephone rates go up, and we are told that local phone rates have increased throughout most of this country because Congress passed a Telecommunications Act. Every Member of Congress will have to respond to that. The response today is for me to say that there is nothing in this act that would allow the implementation of this act in a manner now described by some of the monopoly carriers and now described by some of the State authorities. The Telecommunication Act was not passed or was not enacted in order to provide 50 percent increases or double the price of local telephone service around this country. 
Now, one other point about this. The Federal Communications Commission is in the process of developing final rules to implement a portion of the Telecommunications Act on universal service. Some of this is very dull and boring and hard to understand. But it will play a very important role in determining how much you pay for local telephone service. If the FCC makes the wrong decision--and I am concerned that they are about to do that--they will guarantee that the universal service fund doesn't work to protect consumers and phone rate users in rural areas. 
I come from a county with 3,000 people. My hometown is 300 people. The county seat is 1,200 people. I saw a cost model that described what it would cost to build an infrastructure to serve Fargo, ND, with 80,000 to 100,000 people, versus Mott, ND, with 1,200 people. If you are to build an infrastructure to service phones in Mott, a small town, versus Fargo, a fairly large town, the estimate was $210 per phone for the infrastructure to provide phone service in Mott, ND, and $19 per phone to provide service to Fargo, ND. Why don't we price telephone service that way and say to the folks living in small rural areas, `We're sorry, but it cost more to get the phone service out to you, so your bill is $210 a month"? Why don't we do that? It is because we decide that phone service should be universal. It doesn't matter where you live; the presence of one phone advantages any other phone. The fact that someone in Mott, ND, has a phone makes every phone in New York City more valuable because they can call that phone. That is the notion of universal service. 
All of that has been funded and developed by the present universal service system. In some areas, they provide some additional resources to support other areas. The result is that the price affordable and reasonably low phone service is maintained across the country. The FCC is now in the middle of a decision about how to restructure that universal service, as required under the act. If they make the wrong decision--and they are inching in that way, regrettably--they will decide, in my judgment, to erode the foundation of universal service. 
Last week, for example, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission announced that the Commission is considering excluding intrastate revenue streams from the Federal universal service support mechanisms. That means only interstate revenue streams will be available for those support mechanisms. That, in my judgment, doesn't comport at all with the act that we passed. 
It is imperative that the FCC, as well as local authorities, comply with not only the letter but the spirit of the Telecommunications Act that was passed by Congress. The Telecommunications Act is clear on this issue, and Congress never intended for each State to be on its own to ensure that services in rural or high-cost areas must be `reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.' That is what Congress affirmatively desired. We never intended for each State to be left to its own devices to ensure national universal service. We want this to be a universal telephone system that is universally affordable. 
I hope the FCC will reject this distinction that has been referenced now by the Chairman of the Commission. To do otherwise, in my judgment, will contradict the intent and the letter of the law in the Telecommunications Act. But the FCC still has ample opportunity to address this concern, and others, under the time frame provided by this act. I was among the group of 25 Senators who sent a letter to the Chairman of the FCC last week highlighting some of the concerns we have about the FCC's deliberations. We have, between now and May of this year, to work with the FCC to develop a Federal-State universal service support system that will ensure affordable telephone rates all around this country. In the absence of accomplishing that goal, we will see a number of monopolies, increased telephone rates, and blame it on the telecommunications bill. Why will it happen? It will happen 
because the act and the legislation was not implemented the way Congress intended it to be implemented. 
One additional point I want to raise is the issue of media concentration. I offered an amendment on the floor on this issue, and I won my amendment, actually. At that point, the majority leader was the major opponent to the amendment. I won by four or five votes. It was 4 o'clock in the afternoon. At about 7 o'clock, there was reconsideration, and another vote was taken. Some people, having eaten a dinner that I am not privy to, decided they had better judgment after dinner than before. They came with arms in casts--having been broken in several places--and they changed their vote, and I lost. My victory was short-lived. My amendment was to strike what I thought was fundamentally unwise deregulation of the 12-station broadcast television rule and the limit on 25 percent of the national audience reach. The bill proposed that we unhitch and let whatever media concentration exists in broadcast properties and television is just fine. That is really what the act did, with no regulation in radio and little regulation on television ownership. 
I thought that was, in my judgment, exactly the wrong way to move. I repeatedly said so and offered an amendment and won the amendment for a few hours, and I subsequently lost. But since the enactment of the 1996 Telecommunications Act and, along with it, the lifting of broadcast ownership limits in that act, media acquisitions hit a record $48 billion in consolidation buyouts. In the first year of the act, broadcast television deals increased over 121 percent from the previous year, totaling $10.5 billion. Radio consolidation increased a whopping 315 percent since passage of the act, leading to more than 1,000 deals worth a total of $14.9 billion. 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 increased the national audience reach for television broadcast ownership from 25 to 35 percent. Already, two of the major networks are between 25 and 35 percent. It also allowed unlimited numbers of television stations to rest under one ownership.

Mr. DORGAN. This consolidation is a direct result of a green light provided under the deregulation in broadcast ownership limits in the Telecommunications Act. We have to ask ourselves if this is the result that Congress intended and, if it is, I ask all of those who stood on the floor of the Senate and said this act is going to provide much more competition: How do you square that with the notion that you have many fewer competitors? Competition means many competitors competing in a market system. Concentration is exactly the opposite of competition. 
At present levels, I think every one of my colleagues ought to be alarmed. If this consolidation continues, we will soon be facing the question of how we deal with the prospect of a small handful of media moguls controlling the majority of all media sources in this country. At what point is the issue of localism and diversity so seriously compromised that the Congress finally wakes up to pay attention to this situation? 
Where is responsibility in these areas? Well, I think the time for that is now. In addition to the deregulation allowed under this act with respect to broadcast ownership, the FCC is considering further ownership rule changes that could further increase concentration. In one proceeding, the FCC is considering changes to its so-called attribution rules that will allow for a more liberal use of local marketing agreements, which they call LMA's. That will allow broadcasters to manage stations without counting them under their ownership column. Currently, there are 49 LMA's in 45 markets, and if the FCC liberalizes those attribution rules, LMA's could become even more widespread. In the strictest sense, station ownership is limited to a nationwide reach of 35 percent. But these so-called LMA's permit far greater influence in many more stations beyond the 35 percent audience reach limit. Liberalizing the attribution rules will further encourage consolidation under this loophole. 
In addition, the FCC is also considering changes to the newspaper and broadcast cross-ownership restriction and is seeking comments on what kind of objective criteria should the FCC consider when evaluating waivers to the newspaper/radio combinations. 
The prospect of further consolidation in the media industry, I think, should be of serious concern. This wasn't what was contemplated by the Telecommunications Act, although I feared that was going to be result of it. There has been this orgy of concentration in the industry, and that is exactly the antithesis of competition. 
It is interesting that on this floor we talk about what we are seeing, especially from the broadcast industry, from television, and from the airwaves, pollution that comes into our living room and hurts our children with excessive violence and course language. Where is the accountability? Where is all that produced? It is produced, apparently, on the coast to be broadcast into our living rooms, and some are fighting--myself included--to see if we can't see more responsibility in what is broadcast during times when children are watching. But you find more and more concentration in this industry, and what you will have is less and less accountability. More concentration is not moving toward more accountability; it is moving towards less accountability. And that concerns me as well. 
Mr. President, I wanted to describe some of my concerns today largely because many believe--and I felt it worthy to support something that would encourage competition in an industry that was changing dramatically. The telecommunications industry is making breathtaking changes in our lives, and it can be changes for the good. But also it can be destructive, and changes that are unhelpful to the market system. 
I am concerned about local phone companies demanding deregulation of rates before there is effective competition. That would mean higher telephone rates across the country. I am concerned about the FCC and the decision it is going to make on universal service funds which will determine how much someone in one of our local rural counties pays for telephone service. I am concerned about concentration in the telecommunications industry, because I believe that determines what kind of an industry we have and at what price it is made available to the consumers as well. I hope as we have oversight hearings in the Commerce Committee that we will begin to address these issues. 
If the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is not implemented as intended, if its implementation is a perversion of the intent of that act, if it moves toward less competition rather than more competition, if it moves toward greater monopoly rather than toward more competition, if it moves toward higher prices for cable television, for telephone service, and for other services in that industry, then I think Congress ought to revisit this issue, because that is not what was intended. 
Mr. President, let me finish with one note. I have from time to time held up a little vacuum tube to describe what this revolution is all about, and with it a little computer chip that is half the size of my little fingernail. We are all familiar with the vacuum tube, which is old technology, and the little computer chip. The computer chip is the equivalent of five million vacuum tubes. That is what we have done in this country in terms of technology. 
The head of one of our major computer firms, in a report to stockholders, was talking about storage density technology. He said, `We are near a point where I can believe that we will have in the future the capability of putting on a small wafer all 14 million volumes of work which exist at the Library of Congress,' which is the largest repository of recorded human knowledge anywhere on Earth. The largest deposit of recorded human knowledge anywhere on Earth is at the Library of Congress. Fourteen million volumes we will put on a wafer the size of a penny. Think of what that means--the capability of and the development and distribution of information and knowledge. It is breathtaking what is happening. But it must happen the right way to be accessible to all Americans and at an affordable price. If it doesn't, if the on ramp and off ramp doesn't exist in the smallest towns of Alaska, or 
the smallest towns of North Dakota, or Nebraska, then we will not have built an information superhighway that works for all Americans. 
That is why the implementation of this act is so critical to the American people. And it is why I am so concerned about what I think is happening in three areas that will represent a contradiction of what Congress intended with the passage of this act. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that the Commerce Committee will have oversight hearings and that we will continue to address these special and important issues. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank you. 
I enjoyed listening to my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. 
Edmund Burke said something similar to the words used by Senator Byrd when he closed, and I do not know them exactly, but he was talking about what a representative in a representative government owes to his or her constituency. And Edmund Burke said something like: Your representative owes you not only his industry but also his judgment, and he betrays rather than serves if he always sacrifices it to your opinion. 
I do not know if that is an exact statement, but it is close to the expression of Mr. Burke and I think describes the requirement of someone serving in public office in this country to do what they think is right--not to be a weather vane to analyze what is the prevailing wind on Tuesday or Thursday, but to do what they think is right. That is especially important when we are talking about altering the Constitution of the United States.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because we will be taking up an issue dealing with the confirmation of a nominee for U.S. Trade Ambassador. In conjunction with that will be an issue raised by the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] on a matter relating to the negotiation of international trade agreements and whether in those negotiations, agreements can be reached that effectively change U.S. law. I intend to support the amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina. I think he is absolutely correct, and I hope to be able to come and speak to that point when he offers his amendment. 
As we begin talking about the nomination of the U.S. Trade Ambassador, I want to take a moment to mention something that occurred about 2 weeks ago which passed almost unnoticed in this town, and it relates to the issue of trade. It relates to the kind of trade ambassador we have and relates to the kind of trade policies we employ. 
A couple of weeks ago, we learned that in this last year the merchandise trade deficit experienced by the United States of America was $188 billion--a $188 billion trade deficit. This makes 21 consecutive years of U.S. merchandise trade deficits, with a cumulative total of nearly $2 trillion. 
We have spent a lot of time in recent days with books stacked on books 8 feet high in this Chamber showing fiscal policy and budgets. Perhaps we should have a chair or a table that stacks piles and piles of trade agreements and trade deficits one on top of another to show what we owe others in the world from an accumulation of nearly $2 trillion in trade deficits. 
That is the other deficit, the deficit no one wants to talk about, the deficit no one wants to address. And yet, it is a deficit that predicts a weakness and a continual weakening in America's manufacturing base. That which we used to produce at home is now all too often produced abroad. That which was manufactured here is manufactured somewhere else. Good jobs that paid well with good benefits here are now offshore. And that is what this deficit spells. 
No country in history that I am aware of has long remained a strong, dominant world power without retaining its core manufacturing base, for economic health in any country is not what you consume but, rather, what you produce. What you produce is measured by the strength and the breadth and the dimensions of your manufacturing base. This trade deficit is injuring our country. No one seems to care much about it or be willing to do much about it. 
Six countries comprise more than 90 percent of our current trade deficit: Japan, nearly 30 percent of the deficit; China, 24 percent of the deficit; Canada and Mexico, which represents NAFTA, the NAFTA trade agreement, that is 24 percent of the deficit; Germany and Taiwan together, about 16 percent of the deficit. 
NAFTA was one the most recent trade debates we have had in this Chamber. We were told that if we have a free trade relationship with Mexico and Canada, our two nearest neighbors, we would have new vistas of economic opportunity and create hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. Well, NAFTA was passed--not with my vote, but NAFTA was passed. The NAFTA bill was enacted, it is now law, and now we are choking in trade debt with our two neighbors. 
The architects of NAFTA knew what they were doing. They constructed a kind of economic cow that feeds in the United States and is milked by both neighbors. No one that I know of can credibly come around to this Chamber who had advertised the virtues of NAFTA and now do anything but be embarrassed with what has happened. What has happened is injuring this country. Giant trade deficits with Canada and Mexico are hurting this country. 
Mexico now sends more automobiles to the United States than the United States exports to all the rest of the world. Let me say that again because I think it is important. Mexico now ships more automobiles into the United States of America than the United States of America exports to all of the rest of the world. 
We were told: Well, NAFTA, that's just a little old thing so that some of those low-skilled jobs can go down south. They could do some of those low-skilled jobs at lower labor costs down south. So, what are the largest imports into the United States from Mexico today? The product of low-skilled jobs? No. Electronics, automobile parts, automobiles. Exactly the opposite of what was predicted. 
My point is that we must be concerned about this, we must be vigilant about it, and we must try to do something about it. We must have the same energy in this Chamber on this issue as there has been exhibited on the issue of fiscal policy, the budget deficits that result from fiscal policy that is out of balance. 
There is merit, enormous merit in requiring that we march toward a balanced budget in the fiscal policy in this country because you cannot keep saddling your children and grandchildren with consumption that you now have and saying, well, we are going to consume, but you pay the bills. That is not fair, it is not right, and it is not healthy for this country's economy. 
There is something else that is fundamentally unhealthy about this country's economy, and that is our trade relationships that result in this enormous trade deficit that we have, a merchandise trade deficit of $188 billion. I could spend hours talking about the specifics, and I cannot and I will not because I do not have the time. Let me just mention one item, and I will bet not many people understand. 
For example: Let's talk about T-bone steak that is shipped from the United States to Japan, just to demonstrate the low expectations we have of those with whom we trade. Some while ago there was a negotiation on beef from America to Japan, and at the end of the negotiation there was a day of feasting, people believing that those who engaged in these negotiations had just won a gold medal at the Olympics. Enormous success, we were told. They crowed about the successful negotiation on beef. 
Well, where are we now some years later? We are getting more beef into Japan. That is true. So they all say that is enormously successful. Guess what. There is a 50 percent tariff on American beef being sent to Japan. Does anybody under any set of circumstances believe that is success, that we now are able to get beef into Japan with a 50 percent tariff, and therefore we ought to say, `Hosanna'? 
That is not fair trade. That is not free trade. That is not open trade. It is not fair for this country. It is not fair for our beef producers. And I can go through line after line and example after example. T-bones to Tokyo. They ought to go there without a 50-percent tariff on them to be fair to our producers. 
We purchase much of what they export to us. They ought to purchase what we export to them without impediment. 
I do not want to go on. I would like to talk about trade in some more detail, with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and Senator Hollings and others. I would say, for myself, and I expect I could say on their behalf, we do not complain about this as people who believe that we ought to put walls around our country. 
I believe in expanded trade. I believe in expanded opportunity. But I darned sure believe in retaining a manufacturing base in this country, insisting that trade around the world be fair trade. Nobody in this country working in a manufacturing plant ought to have to compete with a 14-year-old working 14 hours a day making 14 cents an hour. Nobody under any condition ought to be expected to or ought to have to compete with that, and it happens every day in every way under our trade agreements. 
I am just saying the other deficit, nearly $2 trillion at this point, with this year's trade deficit being one of the largest in history, that deficit we ought to care about and ought to do something about. 
Ambassador Barshefsky--we are going to vote on her. She is tough. She has confronted a number of other countries on trade relationships in a significant way. I appreciate that. But she is only as tough as the administration will allow her to be in demanding fair trade. The last several administrations, the last four administrations, in fact, have been disappointments to me on trade, including this one. They have done better than previous administrations, but not good enough. It is not good enough for this country. 
It used to be, we could handle international competition with one hand tied behind our backs because we were the biggest, the best, the most. That is not true anymore. We face shrewd, tough, international competitors and it is time we understand that trade relationships must be fair and must be balanced, and must care about this country's productive sector as well. 
I am not going to speak at length about the amendment offered by Senator Hollings. I do intend to support it when he offers it. I hope to be able to come down and speak about it. But I did want to say a few words, just as a precursor to a discussion we will have about the confirmation of another trade ambassador. 
We have had trade ambassadors. We have confirmed them. We have heard the talk about straightening out some of our trade relationships. But year after year, the merchandise trade deficit continues to grow with almost no notice and almost no one seeming to care about its impact on this country. 
Mr. President, I expect to come back later in the day when we debate these issues. With that I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. I will not engage the remarks of the Senator except to say we should reserve the decision on this point. One can drive down a street and see a Cadillac in front of an expensive house, and if you do not understand the debt that will be used to repossess the house and the Cadillac, you don't understand the financial position there. The same with our country. The fact is, our abiding trade deficits are undermining our country's long-term economic future and we had better not decide to ignore them. We had better confront them on behalf of American producers and on behalf of this country's interests. This is a debate we must have soon. 
I appreciate very much the indulgence of the Senator from Ohio.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from South Dakota. 
Madam President, for those who want to know where this Constitution was written, it was written in a small room in Constitutional Hall called the Assembly Room. Fifty-five white men wrote the Constitution over 200 years ago. George Washington's chair is still at the front of the room because he presided over the writing of the Constitution. His chair is still there if you want to go see where George Washington sat as they drafted the framework for our form of government. George Washington was the fellow who was reported to have said, `I cannot tell a lie' about cutting down the cherry tree. 
I was thinking about his chair when I saw it in this room, and about the cherry tree, and lies, and about political wafflers when we get involved in a discussion of this type. This is a very, very important discussion. 
In the debate in the last couple of hours, one would think it is about balancing the budget. It is not that. It is about altering the Constitution of the United States. It is now 4:32. If, by some magic, we could by 4:35 amend the Constitution just like that, at 5 o'clock nothing would have changed with respect to this Government's deficit or debt. 
This is about altering the Constitution. The question is, shall we do it? And, if so, how shall we do it? 
We voted on a constitutional amendment last week to balance the Federal budget. I offered it. It got 41 votes. Almost all--except two--on that side of the aisle voted against it. Had they voted for it, we would have had a constitutional amendment to balance the budget passed by this Chamber. It was identical to the one they offered, with one exception: It said you can't count the over $1 trillion in Social Security trust funds to pretend you have balanced the budget. 
Based on all the crowing that I hear, one would think, if a constitutional amendment to balance the budget is passed, the 
budget will be balanced. Of course, that is not the case. The budget will be balanced when you make individual spending and taxing decisions to balance the budget. 
In 1993, I cast a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate for a deficit reduction package. It was a hard vote. The politically easy vote was to say, `I am gone. I am on vacation. Count me as no because I do not want the baggage that comes with having to vote to reduce the budget deficit.' 
We passed that by one vote. And we didn't get one vote from that side of the aisle--not a bit of help, not a bit of help from the people who now stand on this floor and crow about how much they want to balance the Federal budget. And the budget deficit came down 60 percent. 
We paid an enormous price for casting that vote. It was a price I was willing to pay. I am glad I cast the vote. And that is the way you reduce the budget deficit. 
How do you eliminate the budget deficit? Well, amending the Constitution, if you do it the right way, will help. And I am willing to do that. We had a vote on it last week. I offered the substitute that would have amended the Constitution the right way. But I refused to alter the Constitution in a way that will allow the Federal debt to keep increasing when they say it is in balance. 
I have asked repeatedly, and there is no answer to it, why do the managers of this constitutional amendment pretend to the American people that if they pass it and then pass a budget that accomplishes it--when they pass this budget and then claim the budget is in balance--why will the Federal debt keep increasing? Why, in the very year that they claim the budget is in balance, will they be required to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 billion, in that year alone? Why? Why, if the budget is balanced, will the Federal debt keep increasing? 
I have asked that a dozen times, and no one has answered it. Why has no one answered it? Because it is a fiction. This constitutional amendment, the way it is crafted, is a fiction. It misuses over $1 trillion in Social Security trust funds to pretend they are balancing the budget, and, in fact, it is not balanced. In fact, the Federal debt will keep increasing. That is why they can't answer the question. 
It is one more chapter in a book of fiction. But this is a chapter of fiction that they intend to put in the Constitution of the United States. 
In North Dakota they want a balanced budget. I have voted for balanced budgets. But in North Dakota they understand the virtue of, if you are going to do something, doing it the right way. There is the right way and the wrong way. The proposal here is the wrong way. 
This is a country that seems obsessed sometimes with instant gratification and quick fixes. 
Madam President, I ask for 30 more seconds.

Mr. DORGAN. There is a mentality that would have us believe sometimes that instant gratification is paramount--quick fixes, fast foods, Minute Rice, instant coffee, instant pudding, Jiffy Lube. Hook the budget to the Constitution and pretend you have balanced the budget, but have the Federal debt keep increasing. It fits right in with the whole genre of quick and easy fix--no trouble at all. 
The American people know better. There is the right way to do things and the honest way to do things. Yes, we ought to balance the budget. And when we have taxing and spending decisions on the floor of the Senate to do that, join us and help us to it. 
I am amazed that those who come here speaking the loudest about this issue will come on one of the largest spending bills that will come before this body, the defense appropriations bill, and say, `No, we are not spending enough. We want to add $10 
billion more, and we insist that you spend it.' 
I am amazed that those who come to this floor and talk about balancing the budget are also the ones who come and say, `And, by the way, we want $500 billion in tax breaks.' They propose plans suggesting $30,000-a-year tax breaks for those that have $250,000 a year in income. Why? I guess they think we can afford it. Do you know that every dollar of tax break will be borrowed and will add to the Federal debt in that plan? These are the people who are now suggesting we alter the Constitution the wrong way in order to pretend that we have balanced the budget. 
Madam President, we ought to balance the budget. Yes. Last week I even offered a constitutional amendment to do so drafted the right way, drafted in a way that it will not misuse the Social Security trust funds. But we ought not, no matter what the price--any of us--ought not stand up and say, `Well, it doesn't matter. We are just amending the Constitution of the United States. It may not be perfect. Yes, it may cause some problems for Social Security. But let's do it anyway.' 
The 55 people who wrote the Constitution of the United States provided for a way that it might be amended. But they always assumed, I suspect, that we would do the very best we could to make sure this document is perfect, or is as near perfect a document for the governance of this country as is possible. 
This is the greatest democracy on the face of this Earth. I get a little tired of people talking about how awful this place is. Most people around the globe want to come here because they understand the torch for freedom and the beacon of hope in this country still burn brightly for all the rest of the world. It is a remarkable place. And when we alter the Constitution--and I am prepared to do so--let us make certain we do it the right way. 
I appreciate very much the Senator from South Dakota yielding.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will equitably resolve a longstanding problem involving a judgment fund distribution to Sioux tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. Specifically, the bill would distribute the accrued interest on funds awarded by the Indian Claims Commission in 1967 to the Mississippi Sioux Tribes. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Conrad, Johnson, Daschle, Baucus, and Burns in introducing this measure. 
In 1972, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to distribute 75 percent of a $5,900,000 judgment award to the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota, the Sisseton and Wahpeton Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota, and the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. The remaining 25 percent was to be distributed to individuals who could trace their lineal ancestry to a member of the aboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. 
The three Sioux tribes received their respective shares of the judgment award by the mid-1970's. To date, though, the funds allocated to the lineal descendants have not been distributed. This has resulted in a situation in which the accrued interest on the original principal of approximately $1.5 million has now grown to more than $13 million. 
Today, if the 1,969 lineal descendants identified by the Department of the Interior receive their per capita payments, they will be paid more than 18 times what the 11,829 enrolled tribal members received in the 1970's. 
In 1987, the three Sioux tribes filed suit in Federal court to challenge the constitutionality of the lineal descendancy provisions of the 1972 act. This litigation is currently in its second appeal. In 1992, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Attorney General to settle the case on any terms agreed to by the parties involved. I support this approach because I believe that it is long overdue that this matter be resolved. However, the Department of Justice has refused to proceed with any settlement negotiations and has taken the position that the 1992 law did not authorize the Department to settle the case on any terms other than those laid out in the original 1972 Act. While I view this interpretation as flying in the face of Congressional intent, the Department has been unwilling to change its position or actively seek a resolution of this matter outside of the courts. 
The legislation I am introducing with my colleagues on behalf of the three Sioux tribes represents a reasonable solution to this protracted matter and a substantial compromise on behalf of the tribes. In the past, the tribes have sought to repeal the lineal descendancy provisions of the 1972 Act altogether, and, in 1986, a bill was reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs which would have achieved this goal. 
In contrast to the 1986 measure, the Mississippi Sioux Tribes Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 1997 would retain the undistributed principal for the lineal descendants and distribute the accrued interest to the three Sioux tribes. The distributed funds would have to be deposited into a trust fund administered by the tribal governing body. There would be no per capita payments of these funds, which would have to be used by the tribes for economic development, resource development, or for other programs that collectively benefit tribal members, such as educational and social welfare programs. In addition, the legislation contains an audit requirement by the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that the funds are properly managed. 
I believe that this legislation takes a fundamentally fair approach to resolving a matter which will otherwise remain mired in legal disputes for years. It keeps the commitment that the Federal Government made to provide compensation to lineal descendants while ensuring that most of the remaining undistributed funds go to the tribes. It was, after all, the tribes who were wronged and who should be compensated for their losses.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Ford, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Johnson. 
Mr. President, I would like, as I offer this amendment, to describe it and begin at the beginning. I know that this issue has been debated again and again, and yet it seems to me it is probably appropriate now to describe what this is and what it is not. 
Mr. President, I offer a substitute constitutional amendment. This substitute is essentially the same as the amendment offered by Senator Hatch, amended, if it would have been amended, by the amendment offered by Senator Reid. Senator Reid offered a perfecting amendment. It failed. So I am offering a substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, the stack of books that has resided on that desk for some long time now is apparently designed to illustrate a number of budgets that have not been in balance. There is no one in this Chamber, I believe, who stands on the floor of the Senate trying to make a case for unbalanced budgets. I have known no one who stands up and says, `I've come from my office to the floor of the Senate to put in a few good words about the deficit,' or, `I come to the floor to be a champion of Federal debt.' I know of no one who says that, no one who believes that, and no one who comes and argues that on the floor of the Senate. 
There is not a difference, it seems to me, about the will or the interest of Members of the Senate to see a balanced budget. This Government ought to spend within its means. It ought not keep charging consumption today to our children and grandchildren. We ought not continue to add to the Federal debt. We ought to have some fiscal policy that is in balance. 
But this is not about balancing the budget. This debate is about altering the Constitution of the United States. We can alter the Constitution of the United States at 3 o'clock--that is 1 minute from now--and at 1 minute after 3, there will not have been one cent difference in the Federal debt or Federal budget deficits. 
So it is about altering the Constitution. How do we do that? Should we do that? We have some people who come to this floor wanting to alter this Constitution at the drop of a hat. Some people think the Constitution is a rough draft and they have better ideas. 
Last year we had three proposals to alter the Constitution offered in 1 month here in the U.S. Senate--three. We have had about 2,000 or 3,000 proposals to alter the Constitution since it was written. I do not peer around the Senate--and I do not mean this to sound disrespectful of the wonderful people I serve with--but I do not really see Madison and Mason and Franklin and George Washington. Thomas Jefferson was not at the constitutional convention. He was in Europe at the time, but he contributed greatly to the Bill of Rights and especially the first amendment. It is hard to recognize the folks here and compare them to those who wrote the Constitution. But we sure have a lot of folks who want to alter the Constitution. 
Last evening I was at the National Archives, and I got to take a look at Thomas Jefferson's original draft of the Declaration of Independence, written, I think, when he was 33 years old. 
I got a chance to take a look at the Senate markup of the Bill of Rights. It is really quite remarkable when you see the documents that represent the framework of our democracy, the system of Government, created in a Constitution of the United States by some wonderful people. 
Included in the Constitution is a procedure by which we can change it.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was in the process before the unanimous-consent requests of just trying to describe exactly where we are and what we are doing here. I was talking about the Constitution of the United States. I pointed out that there is a process in the Constitution of the United States that describes how we can change the Constitution. And we have, in fact, changed it from time to time. 
I was not around, but I recall that we changed it and put something called the 18th amendment in the Constitution. That had to do with outlawing drinking; it was called prohibition. And then if you go to the 21st amendment to the Constitution, it says the 18th amendment to the Constitution is hereby repealed. That is a short, little amendment. That is the 21st amendment to the Constitution. I guess because at that point the American people 
felt we made a mistake on the 18th amendment, so the Framers of the Constitution not only provided a method by which we could change the Constitution but also described how we might correct a mistake. It is far better, however, not to make a mistake when you are changing the Constitution of the United States. There is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. This is not a debate so much about whether we should balance the budget. We should, and some of us have cast tough votes to reduce the budget deficit by 60 percent. Some have not cast those tough votes. Some have just bellowed on the floor of the Senate, thumbing their suspenders and going out and puffing on their cigars and ranting to anybody who listens, how much they oppose the deficit. But would they vote to reduce the deficit? No, it was `count them out.' They just wanted to talk about it. 
Some of us have cast hard and tough votes and paid a price to reduce the budget deficit. The only way you can reduce the budget deficit is individual votes on taxing and spending issues. You can change the Constitution until you are purple, and it will not alter the budget deficit or the Federal debt. 
Shall we, however, change the Constitution? I say that yes, there are circumstances under which I will support that, and I have supported amending the Constitution dealing with fiscal policy, because I think there is merit--especially after the last decade and a half--there is merit in suggesting that the fiscal discipline that would come from requiring a balanced budget in the Constitution would be worthy and worthwhile. So then the question is, if a suggestion to alter the Constitution to require a balanced budget has merit, how do you alter the Constitution to do that? That is the question today. 
I have said before, and the Senator from Utah will not find it surprising, that I think this amendment is terribly flawed with respect to the Social Security surpluses that it will use to claim it has balanced the budget. 
Madam President, when Abe Lincoln and Stephen Douglas were involved in their famous debates, I was reading at one point that Abe Lincoln was enormously frustrated with Douglas because he could not get Douglas to understand his point. He just could not get it through. Finally, he said to Douglas, `Listen, tell me, how many legs does a horse have?' Mr. Douglas said, `Why, four of course.' Lincoln said, `Yes, and now if you call a horse's tail a leg, then how many legs will the horse have?' And Douglas said, `Why, five.' And Lincoln said, `You see, that is where you are wrong. Simply calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg at all.' 
That is what we have here. We have a tail called a leg. They say if we pass this constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the budget will be balanced. But a ninth grader with elementary math will have known the budget is not balanced because, guess what? This will enshrine in the Constitution a practice of using $1 trillion and more of Social Security trust funds, and in the year in which they claim the budget is balanced, that neon debt clock that ratchets up the Federal debt so we can all see where it is going, that debt clock will keep going, because the very year in which the budget is supposedly balanced the Federal debt will increase by $130 billion. The year in which the Federal deficit that is supposed to have been in balance, eliminate the deficit, 2002, the year in which those who support this will claim they have eliminated the Federal deficit, they will have to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 billion. 
I have asked why, I guess for 2 weeks now, and no one will be able to answer: Why is the Federal debt continuing to increase at a time when they claim they balance the budget? Because they will have locked in the Constitution a process that allows them to use tens and tens of billions of dollars that are needed elsewhere, that are taken from workers out of paychecks to put in a trust fund to be saved for the future. They are able to use that money over here to claim they balanced the budget even as the Federal debt continues to increase. That is the weakness and the fatal flaw of this proposal. That is why this is not a balanced budget proposal. That is why this is masquerading as a leg, when, in fact, it is not a leg at all. 
Now, I want to go back to the beginning, and I know that for some this is probably a debate that provides wonderful sleep medicine. It is so filled with complexity and dates and positions and laws. 
But I want to go back to the beginning, in 1983. In 1983, there were no Social Security surpluses. The Social Security system was taking in almost as much as it was spending out. But we knew that, in the long term, there was going to be a real problem because we knew of the baby boom--the largest baby crop in the history of our country. These folks would eventually find their way through the work system and go onto the retirement rolls, and we knew that at some time we would have a problem. 
In 1983, the Greenspan commission convened and said, all right, Republicans and Democrats and outsiders and insiders working, here is a menu or a strategy by which we are going to respond to this problem in our country, where in the future we have the largest baby group retire, supported by the smallest working group, and we have a demographic time bomb and a problem. Here is the recipe by which we address it. That recipe included a lot of things. It included increasing the retirement age, beginning after the turn of the century, to age 67. That extends out some long while before it finally happens, but it goes to 67, the new retirement age. That was done in 1983. A series of benefits were cut from the Social Security system in 1983. In addition to that, Social Security payroll taxes were increased for workers and for employers in 1983 and beyond. And the point and purpose was that the Social Security system would accrue a surplus, year by year, to be used later when it is needed. 
I would like to just show my colleagues some of these surpluses that are going to exist. This chart shows what is happening to the Social Security trust fund. The Social Security trust fund isn't contributing a penny to the Federal deficit. In fact, the taxes taken out of the workers' paychecks and the taxes coming in from business, which are being paid for the purpose of keeping the Social Security system solvent, are in this year $78 billion more than is necessary to be spent in Social Security--just this year, $78 billion more. But you will see from the chart, every year from 1996 on up to the year 2010--and the surplus goes on out to 2019--surpluses every single year. This program doesn't contribute a penny to the Federal budget deficit, not a penny. It is taking in far more than it is using, at this point, every single year. This year, $78 billion more than is spent--just in this year alone--is taken in and put into the Social Security trust fund. 
Now, I don't think those facts are in dispute. At least I have not heard anybody come to contest them. These are numbers from the Social Security Administration. I think the Congressional Budget Office reaffirms these numbers. Nobody is contesting that. So if these surpluses exist, why do they exist? Why are workers paying more than is needed to run the Social Security system today? Because the plan was to save it for the future when they and their children will need it. 
What happens under this constitutional amendment to balance the budget? Under the majority's proposal, this money is not part of a savings account, in a trust fund. This money becomes part of all the other money in the system. This money is no different than a dollar of income tax. It is no different than any other dollar of revenue the Federal Government has and is used as an offset against all other spending. 
In 1983, I was on the House Ways and Means Committee and we largely accepted the Greenspan commission's report. That report included a whole series of steps to respond to the Social Security problem that we faced. In 1983, when the Ways and Means Committee considered this legislation, I offered an amendment and I had thought the amendment was defeated. I said that on the floor, and I was wrong. I looked it up. The amendment actually passed in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives. It was dropped out in conference with the Senate. That was before I served in the Senate, and I spoke less well of the Senate at that point. But the amendment I offered in the Ways and Means Committee 
was approved, and it got through the House. I want to describe the amendment, just to say that I am not on this floor as a Johnny-come-lately on this issue. 
Fourteen years ago, in 1983, when we debated the Social Security reform package in the Ways and Means Committee, which was the committee of jurisdiction--that is where it all originated, and I was a member of the committee--I offered an amendment on March 1. My amendment was exactly what I am talking about here, in 1997, in the U.S. Senate, to take the Social Security system and its trust funds and the surpluses it is going to have out of the unified budget so that its money cannot be used for every other purpose in Government that some would want to use it for--take it out, separate it, make Social Security whole and make decisions about Social Security, both on spending and taxing, on the basis of whether you are going to make the Social Security System solvent. Don't make Social Security decisions on the basis of whether you want to fund the star wars program, or whether you want to fund some other program in some other agency. Make decisions about Social Security and its future based upon the merits of Social Security solvency. On March 1, 1983, I offered an amendment. The amendment would have removed the Social Security system from the unified budget effective October 1, 1988. I gave it a 5-year phase-in, so it could be removed completely in 1988. I made a statement. I will not make it today, but it is essentially what I have been saying ever since. There is a tendency for everyone to want to use those funds for purposes other than solvency of the Social Security system. 
Now, when I offered that amendment, in 1983, I was supported, among others, by Congressman Archer, who now happens to be chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Congressman Archer made the point in 1983 that `if the Social Security funds are permitted to be used in the unified budget, it will distort all of the spending and permit massive deficit spending out of the general fund.' And so Congressman Archer supported me--a Republican, now head of the Ways and Means Committee, supported me. Congressman Gradison supported me, also a Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. 
The point is, in 1983, we started down the road of doing the right thing with my amendment, and then it got thwarted. Here we are, 14 years later, building substantial surpluses in the system that we need when the baby boomers retire. This constitutional amendment--yes, every President, including this President, and every Congress, including this Congress, has used the money the same way. It is wrong. The budget deficit, last year, was not $107 billion, as advertised by the CBO; it was $107 billion plus the $70 billion they used of Social Security funds. The same was true back when it was a Federal deficit of nearly $300 billion. It was more than that, because then they were using the Social Security funds as well. 
My point is, the proposal in the Senate will enshrine in the Constitution a practice that is fundamentally wrong. It says, take all these Social Security trust funds--one of the few sober things done in the 1980's, to save for the future--and just throw them in with other revenue and balance it out and measure it. If you come to zero, that is fine. But it is not fine, because nobody can answer the question I have asked: When you say you have come to zero, why does the Federal debt continue to increase? Why, in the year in which you claim you balance the budget, does the debt increase $130 billion? Because you are not truly saving in the Social Security trust funds. That is the point of the substitute amendment I offer. 
If we had done the right thing 14 years ago, in 1983, we would not even be discussing this. Well, we might. My fear back then was the tendency for those who want to get their mitts on this and use it for another purpose. 
But I can't think of one Member of Congress who would come to the floor and say: I have a plan. Here is my plan. I think it is going to be really politically popular. My plan is to tell workers and their employers that we want to have them contribute to Social Security, and then take some taxes from them and call it the Social Security tax, promise them to put it in a trust fund, promise that we are going to dedicate it for one purpose, and that it will be available when it is needed in the future. And then the second part of my plan is more intriguing. The second part of the plan is that, once we get it, then ignore all the promises and throw it in a pot with all the rest of the money and use it to add up the revenue so you can say you have balanced the budget. 
I would like to know of one man or woman serving in the House or Senate who is willing to stand up and wave their handkerchief and say, `Count me in, sign me up to that, let me do that right now.' Is there one? Is there one Senator? I do not think so. Yet, if you vote for this constitutional amendment, that is exactly the proposition you support, exactly. There isn't any way to argue it another way. 
You can argue that pigs fly and shrimp whistle and that this piece of paper is purple and that grass is black. You can argue it in whatever way you like. But when the day is done, what you have described, under the constitutional amendment offered by the majority, is that you believe it is OK to take dedicated trust funds to the tune of over $1 trillion and mix them up with other revenues so that you can claim you have balanced the budget. 
What I offer is a substitute constitutional amendment that includes the Reid provision which, if passed, would prevent that very thing from happening. It would say that, if we are going to balance the budget, we should do it honestly. Let's do it honestly. It would say that at the end of the day when you have balanced the budget, the debt clock will not still be increasing, the debt clock will be a stopwatch, and there will be no increase in the Federal debt. Maybe we will start seeing a paydown or a drawdown on the debt. Wouldn't that be a nice thing to see happen? The proposal that is on the floor of the Senate by the majority would enshrine in the Constitution this practice which I have described. My substitute constitutional amendment would prevent that very practice. That is a pretty stark difference. Those who want a constitutional amendment, those who want a balanced budget, if they will support my substitute--I think we will have 70 to 75 votes this afternoon--we will have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and we will have done it the right way and we will not have misused the Social Security trust funds. 
We have a law. I know Senator Hollings has been over to the floor. Long after 1983 when I did what I did in the House Ways and Means Committee successfully, but then it was dropped in conference, Senator Hollings in 1990 wrote a law that requires the Social Security System to be treated as off budget and not part of the unified budget. That is now the law, section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act. Senator Hollings has talked about it a number of times. That existing law will effectively be nullified by this constitutional amendment. Senator Hollings makes that point. There is no one in this Chamber who has said Senator Hollings is wrong because they can't say he is wrong. This constitutional amendment will nullify Senator Hollings' law. And it will enshrine in the Constitution a practice that I think is fundamentally wrong. 
I said last year that we have three different arguments, and it is hard for me to reconcile them. I try to keep them straight. 
There is one group who stands up and says, `What are you talking about, the Social Security trust fund? Don't you know there is no trust fund? There is no Social Security trust fund.' 
Then we have the second position. These are the three stages of denial. The second position is, `Yes, there is a trust fund, but we insist we are not misusing it.' 
The third position is, `There is a trust fund. We are misusing it, and we pledge to stop doing so in the year 2008.' That was the third thing I was told on the Senate floor in the 1995 debate. 
So those are the three stages of denial as best I am able to interpret them. 
I don't know what people think when they hear this debate about this issue because it is so intriguing to see all of this maneuvering and movement. This is not rocket science. It is important. It is critically important. But it is not rocket science to understand that you have a certain amount of money, a 
certain amount of expenditure, and a certain money dedicated for a certain thing. So you have money left. Either it matches or it doesn't. Let's say that we take the amount of money dedicated for something else and bring it over here and claim it is all matched up. It doesn't take sophisticated mathematics to understand the bankruptcy of that. That is why you end up, when they say they have balanced the budget, with $130 billion in increased debt. 
The Congressional Research Service has reviewed this matter several times. I am amused actually by the folks who came rushing to the floor of the Senate with six dozen different interpretations of the Congressional Research Service missive on this issue. 
But the Congressional Research Service has concluded something interesting. What they have concluded is that, under the majority's proposed balanced budget amendment, if you save this money to be used for the future, you can't spend it in the future, according to the Congressional Research Service, unless when you decide to spend it you have a corresponding tax increase or a corresponding budget cut somewhere else. You are simply, with this amendment that they are offering, prevented from spending the savings that you have accrued. 
That will be interesting--when somebody shows up for their Christmas Club savings account or to cash in their bonds someplace and the bank says, `Well, the only way you can take your savings out is if you cough up a like amount yourself,' people would look at them like they have been drinking all afternoon. 
That is exactly what the Congressional Research Service says is required by enshrining this practice in the Constitution: save money for a specific purpose and then later call on that money to be used, what are you required to do? Raise taxes in order to use it. That is not much of a bargain, in my judgment. That is what the Congressional Research Service says. We had people knocking each other down at the door over here trying to get through the door waving several iterations of the Congressional Research Service memos, all of which said the same thing with different language. 
So they all had a chance to wrap it around on the floor, wave it, create a bunch of wind with it, and all of them said exactly the same thing. There isn't any way, with the proposal that we have before the Senate, where you can use the savings that we have promised people we would use for Social Security unless it is timely to do it. You either cut other spending or raise other taxes to do so. 
There are other points that I wanted to make. But I am going to at this point conclude my remarks--there are others who want to speak on this issue--by saying this: 
There have been a lot of polls cited about this issue on the floor of the Senate. Frankly, I think there are too many polls in our country, and there are too many pollsters in our country. I wish people would stop polling and stop worrying what the pollsters are telling us and do what is in their guts, but do what they think is right, do what the message somewhere between the brain and the pit of the stomach tells them is right to themselves and to their constituents of the country. I am a little tired of hearing about this poll or that poll, this cross tab and that cross tab. Yes, the polls will show that the American people want a balanced budget, that they support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and, yes, polls will show, if you ask them the question: `Should you enshrine in the Constitution the issue of Social Security trust fund?' those same people will say, `No; absolutely not.' Seventy to seventy-five percent will say that is fundamentally wrong. 
So you can find polls every way from Sunday to support every position on the floor of the Senate. The only thing that matters to the American people, in my judgment, is, are we going to make the decision to honestly balance this budget? If one of those decisions is to alter the U.S. Constitution to require more fiscal discipline, I will participate in doing so and I will 
vote for it. But I will not in any event vote for a proposition that alters the Constitution that will in my judgment require us to come back just as we did on the 21st amendment and repeal it because it is a dishonest budgeting practice--yes, practiced by both political parties. It is dishonest, in my judgment. It takes from those who are now paying taxes under the pretense of savings for the future when they are going to need it, and it says to them, `We will give you an IOU instead' that we are not going to be able to pay because we are going to use the money now. That engages in a practice of let us pretend that we have balanced the budget even as we increased the debt. 
When this is an honest proposal, and a proposal as I offered as a substitute that is an honest proposal that will not allow that budget practice to occur, then we will alter the Constitution. If my friends in this Chamber who are anxious to alter the Constitution will join us in doing it the right way, they will have this afternoon 70 to 75 votes for doing it and they will be able to celebrate an achievement that is significant. If not, they may not be able to alter the Constitution because there are some of us who refuse to support something that is as flawed as that which is being proposed on the floor of the Senate today. 
I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to ask the question and have the response come out of my time. 
This is a chart that shows what happens to Social Security through 2035. The Senator is correct: at 2029, you run out of money; there is nothing left in the trust fund. And the purpose of this saving, incidentally, is so that you have an amount of money to cover the deficits, at least between 2019 and 2029. There are going to have to be deficits beyond 2019, no question. But with this constitutional amendment, if you do not have this money available, what you have done is you have shortened the life of the Social Security trust fund by 10 years--10 years, and that is the problem. Current law provides that the trust fund will go broke in 2029 or thereabouts. But this constitutional amendment that is on the floor would in effect make the trust fund go broke 10 years earlier, unless the Government raises taxes or cuts spending to fund the deficits between 2019 and 2029. So the question of the responsibility here on the side of saving to meet the future, the constitutional amendment that the Senator supports does precisely the opposite, and that is the point I was trying to make. 
I appreciate the Senator yielding.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to serve with the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. I appreciated his statement. I obviously disagree strongly with his contention that doing what he proposes to do will in any way strengthen Social Security. It will do exactly the opposite. In fact, the surpluses that we are desiring to save are not going to be there and that is precisely my point. Let us balance the budget, but let us also do what we need to do to make sure the surpluses are to be saved for the future. 
I ask my friend from Wyoming, it is probably unfair for me to ask him this, but if he is able to answer the question: Why, at a time when we have a balanced budget, presumably, by the constitutional amendment and by the mandate, in 2002, why the Federal debt will continue to increase? Is that not because the trust funds are used to show a balanced budget?

Mr. DORGAN. If we are going to be honest with senior citizens and take the money out of the trust fund and claim you take the money over here but the Federal deficit keeps growing, isn't the purpose of limiting the Federal deficit to discontinue the building of additional debt? The whole purpose here, in my judgment, is to stop burdening the shoulders of our kids and grandkids with more debt. If we claim to balance the budget at the very time the debt keeps increasing, what have we added onto our children's shoulders? Shouldn't we, and if we should, won't you join us--shouldn't we decide we want to do two things: Balance the budget and stop the Federal debt from increasing? Are those not two goals we ought to aspire to? And if we are going to require discipline in the Constitution, shouldn't we aspire to acquire that discipline rather than say we balanced the budget even as the Federal debt keeps increasing? 
I am not asking the Senator to respond for everybody on his side of the aisle, but I continue to ask the question, and will this week, because I think the Senator from Nevada and I have proposed something that will respond to both issues. Let us balance the budget and let us do so in a way that does not have the Federal debt continue to increase, even after those who claim they have balanced the budget have finished the job, according to them.

Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a moment? I deeply appreciate the compliments. There are probably too many compliments on the floor of the Senate. I suspect there are a lot of people out there who view us all as a bunch of windbags in blue suits. The fact is, people judge us not on what they think we say or do here on the Senate floor but whether the public policy we create improves their lives, whether at the end of the day we advance this country's interests, whether we have helped them find a way to send their kids to a better school, whether we have helped them find a better job, whether kids have an opportunity to breathe clean air and clean water. 
Compliments aside, the real task is for us to do the right thing for the future of this country, and that is part of this debate. When you put something in the Constitution, it ought to be right for the future of this country.

Mr. DORGAN. It relates to the question I asked the Senator from Wyoming a few moments ago. With the alternative that is being proposed, the majority party's proposal, we will not achieve both a balanced budget and a freezing of the debt. What we will have is an increase in public debt, building up even as those in the Chamber claim they have balanced the budget. 
I come from a very small town, as I have said repeatedly: 300 people. On Main Street on Saturday night everybody would come to downtown. The barber would cut hair until midnight--a wonderful place. You could not take this proposition we are talking about here today to my hometown and take it to the barber shop or the bar and tell people about it and have them say, `Yes, that sounds OK to me.' There is not anybody who says this sounds OK. You cannot take money from people's paychecks and say to them this money we are taking is for Social Security and we promise to put it in a dedicated trust fund and we will save it for you, you cannot do that and say: By the way, we have changed our mind. The trust fund doesn't exist, or the trust fund exists and we are now misusing it, or it does exist and we promise to stop misusing it in 15 years. That does not work in a small town where people think through these things a little more rationally than I think is exhibited by some of the debate in Congress. 
What we are proposing is to amend the Constitution of the United States the right way, sufficient so that at the end of the day we will require both the budget to be in balance and we will stop the growth of the increase in the Federal debt.

Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the views offered by the Senator from Wyoming made the point I have been trying to make so hard here this afternoon. The Senator from Wyoming indicated what the Senator from Utah has indicated before him, and others, saying that the gross debt will continue to increase even after the budget is balanced because we have to be honest about that to the senior citizens. 
Gross debt will continue to increase--translated, that means that once the budget is balanced, the Federal debt will continue to increase. But they say, `Gross debt is different than net debt; net debt is different than gross debt,' and it is, you know, `Honey, you're complaining about the credit card debt I owe, but you don't understand it's net debt versus gross debt. Net debt is more important than gross debt. You just don't understand.' 
I am sorry. Is it debt or is it not? Is it an obligation or is it not? Will it have to be paid back or won't it? We know the answer to that. Gross debt will continue to increase, the Senator says. That is the problem. That strips naked the entire proposition here and is why I hope Senators will vote for the substitute constitutional amendment I offer. 
When the Senator says people have promised to vote for a constitutional amendment, they can vote for the one that I offer today, the right one, the one that at the end of the day will not have a budget in balance with gross Federal debt continuing to increase, but will have instead a budget that is in balance without an increase in gross debt. Gross or net does not make much matter to folks in my hometown. It is a debt and an obligation, it is saddling their children and grandchildren. 
I will simply observe that as we discuss this, the end goal is not just to alter the Constitution of the United States; the end goal is to alter the decision-making process here in Congress sufficient so that we have done what the American people want us to do--put our budget in balance, eliminate budget deficits, and especially eliminate the increases in Federal debt. 
I want to make one more point responding to something the Senator from Wyoming said. He talked about Governors and States. I have heard all these Governors and other folks from States come here and talk about their balanced budgets. It is interesting to me that those same Governors and States who claim to have balanced budgets also have debt. 
Question: Why would a State that has a constitutional prohibition against having a deficit, why would a State like that have a debt? Answer: Because they have capital budgets. If they accounted for their budget the way the Federal Government accounts for its budget, they would not have balanced their budgets. 
In fact, we have had Governors come up to a table and sit there and talk about the fact that they have balanced their budgets and then talk about fiscal policy and how it impacts their credit rating in their State. Credit rating? Why do you need a credit rating? Because of borrowing money. Why are they borrowing money if they have a constitutional provision that prohibits deficits? Because they have debt. They have a capital budget. I mean, that is a fact of life. We do not, of course. We probably should. I think we should. But, nonetheless, that is a different issue. I always am constrained to respond when people talk about the States balancing their budget--balancing their budget and then ending up with a debt. 
So I will just conclude my presentation--Senator Conrad is on his way to the floor, I believe--by again pointing out there is more than one constitutional amendment being offered. I am offering one now as a substitute. Those who choose to vote for it can choose to alter this Constitution of the United States the right way. 
The Constitution is just a mere, small portion of this booklet. We can alter this the right way. We can do it in a way that will not require us to come back as we did with the 21st amendment and say the 18th amendment is hereby repealed. It will happen, I guarantee you, if we pass the amendment offered by the majority party. That will not happen if we enact the amendment and send to the States the amendment I now propose as a substitute because it does the two things simultaneously. It requires the budget be in balance and does it in a way that you are not using large portions of trust funds and creating a future obligation by misusing them now so that you have claimed a balanced budget and then have increased the Federal debt. 
Again, you can, until you are blue in the face, talk about gross debt and net debt and gross and net, this and that. 
The question I ask is this: At the end of the day, when 
you claim the budget is in balance, is the Federal debt increasing? The answer is yes, and that is exactly what is wrong with this proposal. 
The answer will not be yes if this Senate adopts my substitute. The question will be: At the end of the day, is the Federal debt continuing to increase? The answer will be no. The budget will have to be in balance and there will be no further increases in Federal debt. I yield the floor and reserve my time.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah is overanxious. 
`Phony,' `demagog,' he uses the words with great abandon. Phony? You show me a plan that says I have balanced the budget but my debt is still increasing, that is what I call phony. That is what the folks in my hometown call phony, a plan that says we have balanced the budget but the debt goes up. 
You say, why is that the case? Is that the case? 
Oh, yes, you don't understand, it is debt held by the public, 
and net debt is more important than gross debt. Tell that to the folks who are going to bear the burden of the debt. 
I have watched people make sausage and try to sell it as tenderloin. I see what is going on. We have a stack of books, a Tower of Babel here about balanced budgets. The way we are going to balance the budget is to make taxing and spending decisions. We had one big chance to do that in 1993. I signed up, and I said, `Count me in.' Some of the folks now speaking the loudest said, `Count me out; I'm out the door because I want to vote no and tell the folks back home that what they did back there was unpopular.' 
It is not popular to make the tough decisions to really balance the budget. I suppose it is popular to suggest we should alter the Constitution and then not want to describe to the American people why, after we boasted we balanced the budget, we are still increasing the Federal debt. They may have some popularity from this, but it's not the right way to alter the Constitution, and it will not ultimately balance the Federal budget. 
Let's alter the Constitution the right way, and let's balance the budget the right way. At the end of the day, when the dust has settled, let's decide we are not increasing the Federal debt and we are not continuing to saddle our children and grandchildren with additional debt. 
Mr. President, this is a substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I intend to support it, as I have in the past, and those who want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget to pass in this Chamber, and to do so with 70 or 75 votes, should decide to support this substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening to my friend from Florida, Senator Mack, someone for whom I have great regard and affection. The interesting thing about this debate is that we essentially agree that we ought to balance the budget. There is no disagreement about the goal here. There is a disagreement about the methods of achieving that goal. 
Earlier this afternoon, I heard someone come to the floor of the Senate and speak of the Reid amendment. He said that the Reid amendment actually threatens Social Security. Well, that is the most byzantine argument I have heard, perhaps, in all the time I have served in the U.S. Senate--the Reid amendment injures or threatens Social Security. The Reid amendment is designed to make sure that we do two things at once--balance the Federal budget by exacting the discipline needed to do that in the Constitution, but while we do it, keeping our promise to those who we made a promise to with the Social Security system, saying that you are paying taxes into the system, that taxes are dedicated for one purpose, and we are going to honor that. That is what the Reid amendment is about. 
Without the Reid amendment, this constitutional amendment 
doesn't balance the budget. I came here this morning at 9:40 and spoke in favor of this amendment. I asked a question, and I am going to ask the Senator from Nevada, who has been on the floor all day because he has been managing his amendment, whether anybody has come to the floor to respond to that question. I asked this question, and the question itself strips naked the proposition that what is on the floor from the majority party requires a balanced budget. If we passed this proposal, just like that, 20 seconds from now, and if we then passed a proposal to balance the budget, as offered by the majority, just like that, 20 seconds later, and it is the year 2002, why then does the budget require that the Federal Government increase its debt limit by $130 billion in a year in which the proponents claim the budget is balanced? I have not heard anyone respond to that. If the budget is balanced, why is there a requirement to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 billion? 
I know the answer, but I am asking it of the other side because I want to hear them say what I know to be the case. The reason you have to increase the debt limit by $130 billion when you claim the budget is in balance is because the budget isn't in balance, precisely because of the kind of thing Senator Reid is trying to address. You take, on that side, the Social Security revenues and add them in over here and say, look what we have done, we have balanced the budget, implying somehow there is no obligation over here to use those moneys in Social Security when the baby boomers retire. 
The Senator from Nevada offers an amendment that says if we are going to do this, let's do it the honest way. I suspect there are not the votes in the Senate to pass the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. I intend to vote for it. But I suspect it will be defeated so we can have the same old same-old here of claiming to balance the budget when, in fact, the Federal debt limit continues to increase. 
I ask the Senator from Nevada, has anybody come and answered the question of why, using this approach, enshrining this practice into the Constitution, when they say they have balanced the budget, why the Federal debt would then increase by $130 billion in the very year they claim they balanced the budget?

Mr. DORGAN. I think the reason for that is that this is a giant dance that goes on. The farther they get from the truth, the faster they dance. I am talking about those who are suggesting to us that they have an approach that will balance the budget, even as that balanced budget requires the Federal debt to continue to increase. 
There was a hearing on this subject. I went and testified at the hearing. At the hearing they had the debt clock. That is the neon clock with the numbers that keep increasing that shows how the Federal debt is increasing. I made the point that debt clock actually reinforces what I was asking. I said, it is interesting. When you say that you have balanced the budget that debt clock is going to keep increasing. Until you turn the debt clock into a stopwatch you have not balanced the budget and nobody in my home town thinks you are going to balance the budget. 
So, if you accept the Reid amendment, which is a perfecting amendment to the underlying constitutional amendment that balances the budget, you will solve that problem. It is not so hard to do. Accept the Reid amendment, and I think we can enact this constitutional amendment to balance the budget with 70 to 75 votes, mine included. But this is important because it relates to the underlying question of are we really about balancing the budget, or are we about altering the Constitution so that we can claim we have done something that we have not in fact done? That is what is at the root of this issue. 
Mr. President, we will have an opportunity to vote for a perfecting amendment that Senator Reid is offering. If we lose that, we will have the opportunity to vote for a substitute constitutional amendment which incorporates the Reid amendment that I will offer. 
So we will have two votes on this. If those who study this subject decide that they don't want to change it so that we do this in a way that really does balance the budget, which does require a balanced budget, and which does not increase the Federal debt after you have claimed the budget is in balance--if they don't want to do that, then I guess there will not be a constitutional amendment. If they want to do it, all they have to do this afternoon is accept the Reid amendment. This is not just on our side of the aisle. Congressman Neumann, Senator Specter, and many other folks said the same thing that Senator Reid and I are saying. So this is not just a group of folks who are on one side of the political aisle that makes this case. This is a $1 trillion issue over the next 10 years. It is very important to a very important program. It is also important in terms of the question of whether we actually are going to balance the budget and at the same time meet our obligations for Social Security in the years ahead. 
I appreciate the Senator from Nevada yielding to me.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by inquiring of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, about his perfecting amendment. My understanding of the perfecting amendment as opposed to a substitute here--this is a perfecting amendment--is that 
he would amend the constitutional amendment to balance the budget in a way that prevents the counting of Social Security receipts and expenditures in that constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Is that correct?

Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from Nevada one additional question. Why Social Security? I suppose some would say, well, there other areas that ought to be excluded. The Social Security area is one of the largest areas of public spending and has had accrued surpluses now available, needed to be available for meeting the time when the baby boom generation will retire. So are there other programs like it? Or is this the major issue that will have a distorted impact if this constitutional amendment as currently worded would be enacted by Congress?

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer the Senator from Nevada has provided. He and I have worked on this issue for some long while, and I want to try to frame this a little differently. 
This debate is not about whether the budget is balanced. This debate is about whether the Constitution is altered. This is a question of shall we change the Constitution of the United States? I am prepared to change the Constitution of the United States under certain conditions. 
We have had a lot of goofy proposals over time in this country to change the Constitution. We have had proposals in which there would be a President from the North followed by a President from the South. That was one proposal. Let us make sure that the Presidency goes from the northern part of the country to the southern part of the country on a rotating basis. That is one. Sound a little strange today? Yes, I think so. There have been thousands of proposals to amend the Constitution. 
We have a bunch of folks around here who think that somehow they are better than Madison, Mason, Franklin, George Washington, and, yes, even Thomas Jefferson, although Jefferson was not in Philadelphia at the writing of the Constitution. He was in Europe at the time but contributed mightily to the Bill of Rights, and especially the first amendment. But we have folks who think the Constitution is a rough draft and that they ought to get a pencil and eraser and every day make little changes in the Constitution. 
In the last session of Congress in 1 month we had three proposals which came driving through here to change the Constitution of the United States by in some cases or in most cases people who call themselves conservatives. It is strange to me that those who call themselves conservatives would be so quick to alter the Constitution of the United States but nonetheless there are plenty of proposals to do so. This is one. 
Is there merit in altering the Constitution to require a balanced budget? I think so. I think the demonstration of the lack of fiscal discipline is sufficient over the last especially decade and a half that there is merit in doing so. If there is merit in doing so, why should we not support any proposals that come to the floor of the Senate to change the Constitution? The answer is because if we are going to alter the Constitution let's do it in the right way. Let's solve problems--not create problems. 
This constitutional amendment to balance the budget is enormously flawed especially in one area as described by the Senator from Nevada, and that is the area of Social Security. One of the largest programs in the Federal Government is Social Security. It is not contributing one penny to the Federal deficit. In fact, this year it will have $70 to $80 billion more collected in the program than is necessary to be spent. Why? Because one of the few sober things which was done in Washington in the 1980's, in my judgment, was the creation of a Social Security commission which created recommendations which the Congress enacted which resulted in the accrual of substantial savings year by year to be used when the baby boomers retire after the turn of the century. 
If this constitutional amendment is enacted by Congress and ratified by the States, what will the impact be of that on the Social Security savings that we now have that are necessary to meet the needs of the baby boomers after the turn of the century? The impact will be that they will be used as offsets against other revenues, and you will not have the savings. And in any event, the Congressional Research Service says that after the turn of the century if you have the savings you couldn't use them unless you raised other taxes, or cut other spending in a commensurate amount. 
The noise on the floor of the Senate is interesting. We have folks who rush to the floor to hold up this piece of paper, or that piece of paper. On the floor of the Senate, because we have a doctrine of free speech and unlimited speech, and recognition here that when someone is recognized, even the newest Member, they can be recognized and stand and hold the floor until they are mentally and physically exhausted. No one can take it from them. The Senate has worked that way since its inception for a couple of hundred years. It is a wonderful institution but allows anybody to come and say anything--anything on the floor of the Senate. You can hold up this piece of paper and say, `I have in my hand a purple piece of paper. Notice this green piece of paper. Notice this 8,000-page document.' It doesn't matter. You can say whatever you like. And that is part of the problem that we face with a stack of books sitting on a desk over here being used to demonstrate budgets that have been out of balance. 
People say, `Well, everyone else has to balance their budgets. So should the Government.' The Government should balance its budget. But it is not true that everybody else balances their budgets. We have $21 trillion in debt in this country. We have nearly as much corporate debt as we have Federal Government debt. We have a substantial amount of consumer debt. We have a substantial amount, and it is growing at an alarming rate with credit card debt. We have debt all around this country. And it is a problem. It is a problem with the Federal Government, and it is a problem for the entire country. 
We ought to have, in my judgment, a different kind of budget in our country. We certainly ought to have a capital budget. But I have not hinged my vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget on that point. But it is interesting. Most of the State Governors who come here pull out their suspenders and trumpet to anyone who will listen within a reasonable distance that they have to balance their constitutional budgets. They have a constitutional amendment to balance their budgets, and their States have a constitutional amendment requiring that they balance their budget. Those States are worried about their credit ratings. Why? Because they are borrowing more? Why, if they are balancing their budgets? Because they have capital budgets. And they amortize 
over a longer period of time the amount of money they are spending on roads and other things instead of as in the Federal Government expensing it in the very year in which you do anything. If you build an aircraft carrier that is going to last 30 years, expense it all in 1 year. Roads, the same way. 
So we ought to have a capital budget. But I have not leveraged my support for a constitutional amendment on that basis. 
The question, however, today is: Shall we put in the Constitution this proposal, or shall we put in the Constitution a proposal that is modified in this case by the suggestion of the Senator from Nevada, which I support? And, if a constitutional amendment is modified with that provision, I intend to vote for and support the constitutional amendment. If it is not, I will not vote for it, and will not support it. I will offer a substitute following this vote, if this vote is defeated. I will offer a substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget that is identical to the one on the floor that includes the provision offered by the Senator from Nevada as a substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I will vote for that. If that passes--and I would say to those on the other side of the aisle that support that, they would have sufficient votes on this side of the aisle to perhaps pass it with 75 votes--then we would be done with this question. Are we going to alter the Constitution of the United States? Then we would be on to something that is important. I am not suggesting altering the Constitution isn't important. I am saying that the issue here is balancing the budget. And you could alter the Constitution at 10 minutes to 10 in the morning. Two minutes from now you can alter the Constitution to require a balanced budget, and at 10 o'clock--2 minutes from now--you will not have made 1 penny of difference in balancing the budget. The only way we will balance the budget is if men and women in the Senate on a budget document that describes the specific spending and taxing issues are willing to cast hard votes to do that. 
I found it interesting that the people who stand the highest and seem to speak the loudest on this issue about altering the Constitution were not around on the floor of the Senate in 1993 except to predict that if we pass the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993--something I voted for--if we pass that we would throw the country into a recession; that, if we pass that, there would be cataclysmic results in impacts on the country, and the country will be going down the wrong road. 
So a group of us by one vote in 1993 passed a bill called the Deficit Reduction Act, and the deficit has been reduced by 60 percent; 60 percent. Was it a smart thing to do to vote for that? No, not at all. Was it a smart political thing to do? No, not at all. The smart and the easy political thing to do was to go out that door and say to anybody who would listen about how they are doing dumb things in there. But they are actually casting tough votes to reduce the budget deficit. If enough of us did that, it would pass by one vote. 
That is dealing with the budget deficit. This is altering the Constitution. And after you alter the Constitution, someone here still has to decide how we are going to spend the money, where we are going to cut spending, how are we going to raise the revenue, and how we balance the budget. And that is the tough part. The easy part is braying, trumpeting, shouting, and doing all the things that make a lot of noise that doesn't do anything about reducing the budget deficit. The tough thing is the quiet negotiations and the quiet agreements that are necessary to agree on budget cuts, spending cuts, and revenue needs to balance the Federal budget. 
We have had a number of people here on the floor of the Senate who say that the Social Security issue that has been raised is specious; it is an irrelevant issue. Those who ought to be concerned about the Social Security trust fund and the Social Security fund itself would be better off supporting a balanced budget because the only way to really guarantee Social Security benefits will be to balance the budget. Let me respond to that for just a moment. 
If we pass this constitutional amendment to balance the budget as it is currently written the savings that are now accrued in the Social Security trust fund to be available after the turn of the century will not be able to be used unless somebody comes along and raises taxes, or cuts other spending in order to use them. And I do not understand when folks say, `Well, the best way to assure the long-term health of the Social Security system is to pass this amendment.' I do not understand that in passing this amendment we are creating a circumstance where it will prevent the very use of the Social Security funds we are now collecting to be used after the turn of the century when it is needed. 
I mean, that just stands logic on its head. I guess, again, in a debate forum like this, when you are able to say whatever you want to say at any time about anything, you can say that. But I am wondering how many people are willing to believe that. If you tell taxpayers we are going to take money out of your paychecks, we are going to put it in a trust fund, and we promise you we will save it and use it for Social Security, but then use it for something else--I wonder how many people out there in the country think that is an honest way to behave. 
I would like--and I am still waiting, incidentally--I would like one Member of the U.S. Senate, just one, to stand up, and maybe this week we can find one who will, stand up and say this: `I support telling those who are going to work and working every day that we want to take your money from your paycheck, we want to have a little box there on your paycheck that says we have taken $1,000 out of your paycheck and we have called it taxing for Social Security, and we promise you we are going to put it in a trust fund, and then we are going to take the trust fund and move it over here and use that as other revenue so we can now say we have balanced the budget.' I want one Member of the Senate to stand up and tell me that is a proposal he or she makes to their constituents. There is not one Member of the Senate, I think, that would vote for that, yet that is exactly what we have. It is exactly what we have in this country in our fiscal policy. 
And this proposal wants to enshrine it in the Constitution of the United States. This proposal wants to enshrine it forever in the Constitution of the United States, and it makes no sense at all. As an affirmative proposition to misuse these trust funds makes no sense at all. I do not know of anybody who will say, `That is my position. Let me go ahead and push this. That is what I believe in.' Yet, that is exactly what will be written in the Constitution of the United States. 
This is the Constitution of the United States, in the rules and the manual of the U.S. Senate. That has the Constitution in it. The Constitution is actually not a very lengthy document, as most folks know. The 18th amendment to the Constitution was passed:  
After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territories subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited. 
That is prohibition. The 18th amendment to the Constitution, prohibition. Just to demonstrate that in this country we have a right to make a mistake, the 21st amendment, three amendments later, says the following: 
The 18th article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. 
It is a wonderful thing about democracy, we have a right to be wrong. We have a right to make mistakes. We can even do it in the Constitution. But we ought to be enormously careful about what we do with the Constitution because it is very hard to correct. We corrected the 18th by passing the 21st amendment to the Constitution. Let us not create a circumstance where we amend the Constitution and are required to correct it again. That is not, in my judgment, the sort of thing we ought to do with the Constitution of the United States. 
Let me emphasize this one more time. The Senator from South Carolina has now come to the floor, Senator Hollings, who has been involved in this discussion for some while on Social Security. Those who come to this floor to say this is a specious argument were not in the room in 1983 when we passed the Social Security Reform Act. I was part of the originating committee that did it, the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. I was part of those, that group of people who originally debated this in the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives. And the day it was marked up, I was the one person in the committee who offered the amendment. That is 14 years ago. I offered an amendment, on the very day this was considered, to say if you do not take this money, this Social Security money that we are going to accrue to be used after the turn of the century, and set it aside so it is not part of a budget that somebody else can use, if you do not do it, it is going to be misused. I was defeated that day with the amendment I offered. 
So, when people write to the Washington Post, as someone did last week, or people come to the floor of the Senate and pop up here and talk about what they know and what they do not know, I was part of the group in 1983 that decided to create a surplus in Social Security to be used when the baby boomers retire and they need it. This constitutional amendment will enshrine in the Constitution the practice of misusing that Social Security trust fund, and there is no question about it. 
As I said, people can come and protest and hold up purple sheets or green sheets all day long and it will not alter the facts. If we are going to amend this Constitution, and I am willing to do that, if we are deciding to say there is merit in requiring a balanced budget, and I think there is, then we ought to do it right, not do it wrong. We ought to do it even if it 
is hard to do. We ought to do it the right way, rather than to do it the easy way and misuse $1 trillion in 10 years of Social Security trust funds. That is what this debate is about. That is what the perfecting amendment by the Senator from Nevada is about. 
I would say to the majority side, if you accept this perfecting amendment, you will pass this with 75 votes. You want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? You will get it. Accept this perfecting amendment and you will have it. If you do not get it, it is your fault because you have decided that you want to do something that, in my judgment, would not be allowed anywhere in the private sector. But you want to get away with it in the public sector. 
The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has said before--and I will say it before he says it again this morning--if you tried this in the private sector as an employer, and say to the folks in your business, `You know I have been losing money, so what I decided to do, even though I have been losing money in my business, I will take your pension funds and bring them into the business, claim I have not lost money, and use your pension funds to do it,' you would be on your way to 2 years in a minimum security prison somewhere in this country, because it is against the law to do that. You cannot do that. 
That is exactly the budget practice of the Government of the United States. It is wrong, and it ought to be stopped. The last thing that ought to happen is that we enshrine it in the Constitution of the United States. 
If you accept this proposal, this perfecting amendment by the Senator from Nevada, then you will pass this amendment; don't, and you may not. But if you don't, the failure of passing the constitutional amendment is on the shoulders of those who failed to perfect the amendment in a way that means something to the American people. 
One final point, and I will take 30 seconds. The demonstration of the naked truth of the bankruptcy of this proposed use of the Social Security trust funds is this. When the majority party has claimed to have balanced its budget, the Federal debt will have to be increased by $130 billion the very year in which they have claimed to balance the budget. Ask anybody--a fifth grader, seventh grader, high school sophomore--why, if you balanced the budget, would you have to increase the Federal defendant limit? The answer: Because it is a scam. The budget is not balanced. Plain and simple. That is the naked truth, and that is what exposes this balanced budget amendment for what it is. 
Amend it with the perfecting amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada, and you will have my vote. It is not a bluff. You will have my vote. Do not amend it with that and you will not have my vote, because it is the wrong way to alter the Constitution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is one of those I admire most in this Chamber. He is one of the brightest and most interesting Members to serve with. He has demonstrated over many years and many disciplines a great knowledge and great intellect. I have always enjoyed serving 
with him. 
With great respect, I think he is so wrong on this issue, but I say that with the greatest respect.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to give the other side of exactly the issue the Senator from New Mexico has just spent some time describing. I say this not because I believe my side is right and therefore he is here doing something untoward. That is not the case. I think we have a disagreement here about this issue that is very substantial, and it is very important. I do not suggest that someone who does not agree with me on this position is out here deciding to play games or to take a position for anything other than a noble purpose. But, by the same token, I feel so strongly that the discussion I just heard is wrong, I feel compelled to correct it, at least from my perspective. 
Let me describe what we have. We have a proposal to change the Constitution of the United States. Some refer to it repeatedly as a proposal to balance the budget. It will not do that, and no one who understands the difference between a statute and a constitutional change should refer to it as balancing the budget. You can change the Constitution 2 minutes from now, and 3 minutes from now you will not have altered by one penny the Federal debt or the Federal deficit, and there is not anyone in here who would stand up and contest that, I would judge. So this is not about balancing the budget. It is about altering the Constitution. 
I am prepared to alter the Constitution under certain circumstances, but I will not--repeat, not--support an approach that changes the Constitution of the United States in a manner that I think will create more problems than it solves. 
We have, and will vote for, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We will all be required to vote on a couple of versions of that, one, the version proposed by the majority, one, a version that I will introduce as a substitute amendment. So we will have an opportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. The version proposed by the majority says this. It says that revenues and expenditures in future years must be relatively equal so that you are not running a deficit. And that includes counting all of the revenues and all of the expenditures. Period. End of description--I think a fair description of what the majority is proposing. 
The problem with that is this. We have a separate program in Government, one of the largest programs, called the Social Security system. It has been a very successful program. But we have a demographic problem with our Social Security system. We have a group of babies born who represented the largest group of babies born in our history, and when they hit the retirement rolls, we are going to have a significant strain on that system. And so, a decision was made some years ago to save for that purpose, and therefore this year, and last year, and next year, to run a surplus, a very significant budget surplus in the Social Security accounts, only in those accounts, in order to have that available to save for the future.  
The amendment that is being offered by the majority is an amendment that would say: Let's not distinguish between one dollar and another dollar. Yes, we're running a surplus in Social Security, but it doesn't matter. We can use the surplus of Social Security to just pay for other spending elsewhere. 
Well, I do not think that is the way we say to those with whom we have decided that we are going to provide for their future and have a Social Security trust fund, I do not think that is the way for us to say to them we are meeting our responsibilities. That is not meeting our responsibilities. What that is doing is allowing us to say we have balanced the budget when we have not. We have taken trust funds that we said would be used for only one purpose and brought it to say, now we have balanced the budget. 
I am waiting--and I will ask the question again; there is only one other Member on the floor--but I would ask the question again, and I have not yet heard an answer: If under this constitutional amendment and a budget plan that is proposed to meet this constitutional amendment of balancing the budget, if in the year in which they claim they have balanced the budget the Federal debt limit must be increased by $130 billion, how do you claim you have balanced the budget? 
If you have balanced your family budget, do you have to borrow more money? I would not think so. If you have balanced your business budget, would you have to borrow more money? I do not think so. Why, in this plan, in the year in which they say they balance the budget, does the Congressional Budget Office tell us in that very year they have to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 billion? Why? Can anybody tell me? They have not told me for a couple weeks because there is not an answer to that. There is not an answer. 
The answer, if everyone here were honest, would be that this is not truly balancing the budget. The budget will be called in balance, they will describe it as in balance, and the Federal debt will continue to increase. So the folks who moved the Federal debt clock around that shows how the Federal debt is increasing will still have a clock that keeps ticking. The Federal debt will keep rising. I do not understand that. 
I would like us to balance the Federal budget. I think there is a compelling reason for us to balance the Federal budget. In fact, the budget deficit is down 60 percent in the last 4 years in part because some of us have had the courage to cast hard votes, votes that were not popular. I am glad I did it. They were not very popular votes, but we cast the votes to bring the budget deficit down. 
But the job is not done. The job is half done. We need to finish the job. We can alter the Constitution, but that will not finish the job. The only way this job gets finished is if individual men and women in the U.S. Senate make spending and taxing decisions that say we want to balance the budget. When they say to their constituents, `We've balanced the budget,' and then must confess to their bankers back home, `But, yes, we increased the Federal debt by $130 billion,' no one here can claim that with a straight face, unless they have no sense of humor, that they have done what they promised back home they are doing. 
That is the point I am making. If we are going to alter the Constitution, let us make those changes in the Constitution in a careful, measured way that does not create more problems than it solves. 
My time is up. I will be on the floor for a few minutes and perhaps have some other discussion. I know another Senator is waiting to discuss this. But, Mr. President, this is an important issue. We are finally talking about what we ought to talk about. And I hope we can have some exchange of views in the coming days on this very subject because this is not a nuisance issue. This is not a nettlesome issue or some tiny, little issue. This is a trillion-dollar issue that deals with people who earn paychecks and pay taxes, expecting certain results from them, and a trillion-dollar issue that deals with senior citizens on Social Security who expect something from that program as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a piece of legislation on behalf of myself, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Bingaman, Senator Conrad, Senator Craig, Senator Domenici, Senator Thomas, and Senator Daschle. 
At the conclusion of my remarks I will send a copy of the bill and the statement to the desk. 
Mr. President, we will have in this Congress a lot of debates about a lot of issues. One of them that will be very interesting and have great consequence will be the issue of reauthorizing the highway bill. And the question of how much money is available to which States and under what conditions will the money be available to build, to construct, and to maintain highways, roads, and bridges across our country. And to some that may seem like kind of a dull uninteresting subject. But the development, the building, and the maintenance of highways and bridges is critically important to regions of our country. It determines where people live, and where people can travel. It determines economic development, jobs and opportunity. 
I come from a rural State. I recognize that there will be a formula fight, as there always is--a formula fight about how to apportion the highway dollars, and who gets what. I do not intend to take sides between one big State and another big State. But I come from a State that is rather large in geography but small in population simply to say that when all of the fighting is over we want to make certain that States like North Dakota and others, where you have large expanses of territory and relatively few people living in those States, are not left out of this process. 
Some may not understand the frame of reference to a North Dakota. Let me describe it, if I might, as I begin talking about this bill. 
I come from southwestern North Dakota, a town of 300 people, and graduated from a high school class of 9. The county I come from is called Hettinger County. The county next to Hettinger is Slope County, a wonderful territory. Southwestern North Dakota is ranching country with wonderful people. Slope County has fewer than 1,000 people. It is a land mass the size the State of Rhode Island. Slope County is the size of the State of Rhode Island but has fewer than 1,000 people. 
There were a lot of births in Slope County last year. There were 7,900 calves born. There were 2,500 pigs born. There were about 1,500 lambs born. And there were seven children born in Slope County; seven children born in Slope County, a land expanse the size of the State of Rhode Island. 
I have said--and I do it just I guess because it is obvious--that there is not a lot of childbearing going on in the Medicare years. The fact is that the average age of the population in counties like Slope County, a rural county, is increasing, and there just are not a lot of children born in those counties. In North Dakota, we have 11 counties that are growing and 42 counties that are shrinking. Slope County is an example of that. 
I mention all of this to you for one reason. Roads are important. How hard do you think it is to support road building or road maintenance in a county that size with so few people? I can say the same thing about Hettinger County not only in North Dakota, but in South Dakota, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, and other States as well. It is very hard with a small population base and a lot of miles of road to support them with our current circumstance. 
As we have a fight about highway funding here in the Congress--and the fight is a big-stakes fight over billions and tens of billions of dollars to be sliced up and divided between 50 States, and the big States have an enormous amount of money at stake, New York, Florida, California, and others--an enormous amount of money is at stake for these States. I am going to be someone who helps move this along by saying that I think highway building, highway maintenance, highway construction, and bridge repair is very important for our country's future. We must rebuild our country's infrastructure. We must pay attention to these kinds of things. All you have to do is go to some less-developed country and drive the first mile and understand how important infrastructure is and what we have here versus what they have in many other areas of the world. 
But much of our infrastructure is in trouble, and we must reauthorize a highway funding bill that gives us the resources across this country to rebuild our infrastructure. 
How do we divide up the money? Well, that then becomes part of this formula fight. How much does one State get versus another? 
There are about eight States in this country where you have a large land mass, and only a few people. That makes it very difficult for the few people living in those States to maintain the network of highways necessary. Why is it necessary? It is necessary for the country. It is necessary for an entire transportation system. 
You can imagine perhaps President Eisenhower sitting at the White House probably having Speaker Rayburn down to talk about his idea of an Interstate Highway System across our country connecting various parts of our country. And, if someone in that meeting when they talked about building an interstate highway program had said, `Well, gee, how could you conceivably support building a four-lane, expensive interstate highway that goes among other places from Fargo, ND, in the east and exits at Beach, ND, in the west as it enters Montana, for the number of people it serves in North Dakota, how on Earth could this country justify that investment in the interstate highway program?' the answer was simple. It was a national program. And the fact that you build a highway across a State with low populations such as North Dakota means that frozen fish and fresh fruit move from Boston to Seattle, not across gravel roads in the center of the country because there are only a few people living there, but across an interstate highway system that is part of a national network of highways and roads that are important for our entire country. That is the purpose of all of it this. 
Those of us that come from the less-densely populated States drive a lot. Gas taxes mean a lot to us. The price of gasoline means a lot to us. In North Dakota, for example, we drive exactly twice as much per person as they do in New York. 
Why? Well, if you are going to go someplace in North Dakota, it is not two blocks to the hospital. It might be 50 miles to the hospital. It might not be a block and a half to a movie. It might be 10 miles or 15 miles from the farmstead to the small town with a theater. 
The fact is we drive just almost exactly twice as much in North Dakota per person as they do in New York City. Therefore, per person we pay twice as much in highway taxes as they do, for example, in New York City or the State of New York. Is that unfair, unfortunate? Probably unfortunate. We do not like that necessarily, but we choose where we live. 
The point I am making with that is that in terms of burden, we have a very substantial burden with respect to highway taxes. Our burden is much higher than the burden per person in other States. 
The contribution to the Federal highway trust fund in terms of gas taxes by the average North Dakotan is $116 a year; the average Florida resident, $73; Massachusetts, $61; Rhode Island, $55, and the list goes down. We are fourth from the top in per person contribution to the Federal highway trust fund. 
Some will come to this floor in all of this fight about money and they will say, well, there are donor States and donee States, and the donor States are the ones that pay more into the highway trust fund than they get back and that ought to change; it is unfair. The donee States are the recipient States and they are the ones that get more back than they paid in and they ought not to. 
That is one way of looking at it. I suppose if you want to look at that in the context of funding the Coast Guard, we do not have any coast to guard up in North Dakota so whatever our taxpayers in North Dakota are paying into the Federal Government for the purpose of running a Coast Guard, I suppose we are a donor State. We are a donor State for the Coast Guard. But so what. That is not the way you ought to measure this, nor should you measure it that way from a highway funding standpoint. Measure it in terms of what citizens are having to contribute to the highway trust funds relative to the amount of driving they are doing and the amount of tax they are having to pay, and what you will see is a State such as North Dakota is right near the top. 
A group of us who come from States similarly situated, States with very large expanses of land and not as many people, and therefore not having the tax base to raise the funds necessary to meet the needs of road maintenance and road building and bridge making, and so on, want to be a part of this debate on the reauthorization of ISTEA or the highway reauthorization bill in a manner that says the following. We want at the end of this discussion for these eight States that are situated in this manner not to be a part of the juggling between the formula fights that will go on on this floor from time to time this year on highway funding, but instead to be a part of a solution that says with respect to those States with unique circumstances, we will provide a guarantee that those States will receive what they have received in the past in terms of the percentage of the highway funds that have gone to these eight States with large expanses of land, many miles of highway to maintain and a lower population base, and in addition to that we will have a highway preservation fund of 1 percent--1 percent out of 100 percent of the money that is available--to be put in a pool to be distributed back to those eight States on a need basis to preserve those highways, roads and bridges, build and maintain and preserve that infrastructure in those eight States that face this unique challenge and face these unique circumstances. 
That is all we say in this legislation--two things. One, North Dakota's share, for example, of the current formula is about .62 of 1 percent. North Dakota and the other seven States would be guaranteed that allocation at the end of the reauthorization bill for the coming years, plus we would be the recipients on a need basis of a pool equal to 1 percent of the highway fund that would then be reallocated on a need basis to the eight States that face these special and unique challenges. 
There are a number of us, 16 Senators specifically that come from these 8 States, who have already cosponsored this legislation. I hope others will. And when we do, I hope we will be able to make a case to the rest of the Congress that we want to be helpful to others. We want to be helpful to all of those who believe there ought to be a robust highway funding program, that funding for it ought to be certain, that funding for it ought to be adequate to meet the needs in this country and we are prepared to support that. But that when the larger formula fights are completed, those eight States, uniquely situated, the eight States which include North Dakota, situated in a circumstance where their population base does not allow them to raise the resources to meet their infrastructure and transportation needs, they will be dealt with in a fair and equitable way. That is what our legislation does. It is what it would provide. And we hope that when this is over at the end of this Congress, we will look back and say we did something that was important for our States. 
I want to mention one additional point. Some say let us 
not have a Federal highway program anymore. Let us abolish the Federal gas tax, and then say to the States, you go ahead and raise your own money. All that I have been discussing so far describes the unique problem we have raising our own money with a large road network to deal with and a smaller population base. If we were required under a program like that, a devolution of the highway program, saying we will not have a Federal program, let us let the States do it, and therefore a State like North Dakota, we were told, you go ahead and raise this yourself, just to meet the current revenue stream we now have from the Federal highway program in North Dakota, we would be required to raise the current State gas tax by 27 cents per gallon simply to replace the revenue the State currently receives. Other States would not fare the same way. Other States would be able to decide they could raise their gas tax at the State level by a very small amount of money. 
For example, Florida would have to raise their State gas tax 11 cents to raise the amount of money they now have under their road program. So when you take a look at the impact and the burden on taxpayers here, that approach, the devolution approach, saying let us not have a Federal highway program, let us tell the States raise your own money by your own gas tax, would say to Florida, you raise your gas tax by 11 cents, and would say to North Dakota, you raise yours by 27 cents. 
That is the inequity of it. That moves us away from the notion that highways represent a national need, that transportation is a national system and is part of a unifying force in this country that we have always felt should work to meet our country's universal needs, and that includes especially the area of transportation. 
Mr. President, this year the Congress will be debating the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. Some have focused the debate around the question of the ratio between how much States receive in highway funding related to what they pay in. However, framing the debate around the donor verses donee State concept fails to address the real issues in the reauthorization of ISTEA: that is, how do we allocate resources to maintain a national transportation system and ensure that all States have the necessary resources to participate in that system. If the heavily populated States want to ship their frozen fish and fresh fruit from coast to coast in trucking convoys, they don't want to be shipping it on gravel roads in parts of the country where the local tax base is not sufficient to maintain a national network of good roads. It is in the interest of all Americans to have a national network. That is why the donor verses donee formula fights are so counterproductive. 
If we are interested in maintaining a national transportation system, the question should be how do we allocate resources to meet all the Nation's highway needs. This includes meeting the unique needs of rural States with low-density populations and large geographic areas. If there is a national need, there's a national responsibility and we ought not to have formula fights in ways that hurt small population States with large networks of highways to maintain. 
I am not a bit uncomfortable that North Dakota receives more money back in highway funding than it sends into the highway trust fund through gas taxes. In fact, if measured on a per capita basis, North Dakota is actually one of the highest contributors to the Federal highway trust fund. Some of the so-called `donor States' contribute has as much in gas taxes per capita than many of the `donee States' contribute. That happens because we have a small population and are required to maintain a large highway system on a small local tax base. Without a Federal program to make up for scarce local resources in low-density States, we could not have a national network of highways. 
Those who frame the debate as one between donor or donee States beg the question as to why does this notion only apply to highway funding. Should we treat all transportation programs the same way? Why single out only highway funding? Why not apply the same `return to the states' approach for mass transit, disaster relief for hurricanes and earthquakes, or the Airport 
Improvement Program? Should the same principle be applied to funding the Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration whose services are almost entirely used by coastal States? We don't have much of a Coast Guard in North Dakota, but our taxpayers still help pay for it. Thus, North Dakota is a donor State when it comes to these programs. Why should landlocked States support these programs? 
The reason is simple--we have a national economy, not a State-by-State economy. If such approach were adopted, it would represent a dramatic abandonment from the basic principle that has been vital to our national economic and social well being: a quality national transportation system. And that is why the debate about the reauthorization of ISTEA must meet the unique needs of rural States. 
A network of efficient and well-maintained roads in rural areas is just as important to densely population urban centers that export products across the country as the roads are to middle America. 
We need a national transportation system that reflects a commitment to all regions of the Nation as the principle priority. To do this, highway funding formulas must provide for the unique needs of every region. Currently, the needs of States with small populations but that maintain highways for large geographic areas are not reflected under ISTEA formulas and this ought to be changed. ISTEA formulas need to reflect the needs of the national system and the unique circumstances of various geographic regions. While major urban areas need support for relieving congestion and heavy traffic loads, rural States with low populations need additional assistance to maintain long stretches of roads with smaller local tax bases. 
Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to ensure that rural States with low-density populations and large geographic land areas get an adequate share of Federal support under the Federal Aid to Highways Program. There are two major provisions under this legislation. First, low-density States with large geographic land areas will be held harmless under the same percentage distribution of total highway funds as they received under ISTEA. In addition, these same States would qualify for a rural State adjustment, which would be established by setting aside 1 percent of the total highway program for rural States. These funds would be distributed by a formula that takes into account the number of National Highway System [NHS] miles of road in a qualifying State and the number of NHS vehicle miles traveled in that State. Certainly, this legislation does not resolve the matter as to how Federal highway funds will be distributed to all States. Rather, this bill only focuses on one aspect of the picture--that is, it emphasizes the unique circumstances of a small number of States that ought to have their needs recognized in the final formula. 
Those of us from rural States are not suggesting that all we care about is meeting our unique needs. Much to the contrary. We desire to work cooperatively with all our colleagues to develop a strong and effective highway bill that meets the needs of all regions. Our objective is to have a fair formula that ensures that our Nation maintains a truly national system. To that end, we pledge our good faith and determination to develop the best reauthorization of ISTEA possible. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kempthorne, Senator Conrad, and I in supporting this legislation. It is our hope that the Congress will succeed this year in passing a strong reauthorization of ISTEA and hopefully, that legislation will reflect the concerns raised in the bill we are introducing today. 
So, Mr. President, I am sending the legislation to the desk, and I hope in the coming week or so to add cosponsors to the legislation. I hope when the debate occurs on the reauthorization of the highway program, the ideas embodied in this bipartisan piece of legislation will be ideas that we will see incorporated in the final legislation passed by this Congress.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate resolution to focus national attention to the Bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which will be celebrated during the years 2003-2005. I am pleased that Senators Bond, Burns, Conrad, Cochran, Craig, Daschle, Gorton, Jeffords, Kerrey, Moseley-Braun, Murray, Gordon Smith, and Reid have joined me as cosponsors of this resolution. 
The Lewis and Clark Expedition is one of the most remarkable events in our history. In the words of historian Paul Cutright, `the Lewis and Clark Expedition stands, incomparably, as the transcendent achievement of its kind in this hemisphere, if not the entire world.' Known as the Corps of Discovery, the expedition traversed a vast expanse of largely unknown territory that was just added to the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. 
The expedition was conceived by Thomas Jefferson at his home in Monticello, VA. His primary motivation was to find a water route to the Pacific Ocean for commercial reasons. But President Jefferson was interested in far more than trade routes. He was equally interested in expanding the Nation's knowledge of the flora, fauna, geology, geography, and the native peoples who inhabited this vast expanse of unexplored territory that was recently added to the United States. He specifically instructed Lewis and Clark to carefully record what they found. The historic Lewis and Clark Journals were the result of that Presidential directive. The journals, maps, drawings, and specimens which Lewis and Clark produced vastly enhanced the Nation's scientific knowledge and created a lasting cultural legacy for the Nation. 
During their 28-month journey, the expedition crossed 11 future States. All along the route--from St. Louis, MO, to Mandan, ND, to Fort Clatsop, OR--preparations are already underway to celebrate this epic exploration. The National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council was formed to stimulate and coordinate bicentennial activities across the Nation. Its mission is `to commemorate that journey, rekindle its spirit of discovery, and acclaim the contributions and goodwill of the native peoples.' In cooperation with, Federal, State, tribal, and local governments as well as other interested groups, the council will undertake educational programs, re-enactments of historical events, essay competitions, symposia, athletic events, and other commemorative activities in observances of the bicentennial of this historic journey. 
I hope this resolution will help to focus public attention on this great American adventure and its remarkable achievements.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor of the Senate to respond to and to discuss some items on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
There has been a great deal of talk about the constitutional amendment here on the floor of the Senate. There have been press conferences on both sides and a great deal of literature distributed in the Senate. I want to talk about what the issue is and what the issue is not. 
The issue is not, as some would have us believe, a discussion between those who think it is meritorious to balance the Federal budget and those who think we should not balance the Federal budget. Generally speaking, most Members of the Senate believe it is important for this country's long-term economic interest to find a way to balance the Federal budget. We ought to do that. This Federal Government has spent more than it has taken in for a good long while. I would just say, that it is the irresponsibility of Democrats and Republicans that have allowed that to happen. 
It is true that there is a difference in how they want to spend money, but there is not a plug nickel's worth of difference between Republicans and Democrats about how much they want to spend. One side might want to spend more for Head Start and another might want to spend more for B-2 bombers or whatever. But nevertheless, if we take a look at the aggregate appetite for spending you will not find a plug nickel's worth of difference on either side of the aisle. Priorities and choices, though would be different. 
But both political parties--Presidents who are Republican, year in and year out, Presidents who are Democrat, not quite as many, I might add--both have submitted budgets to the Congress that are wildly out of balance and that have had substantial deficits. So this is not a case where one can stand on slippery sand and say, `It's your fault. You're the folks who are at fault over here.' It is everybody's fault. And it ought to stop. We ought to balance the Federal budget because that will be good for this country. 
The debate here is, shall we alter the Constitution of the United States? Shall we change the Constitution of the United States? I would observe that if it is done, 5 minutes from now the Federal debt and the Federal deficit will not have been altered by one penny. We will have altered the constitution of the United States, but we will not have changed by one penny the Federal deficit or the Federal debt. 
I want to talk a bit about that because I think there are circumstances under which we should alter the Constitution. There are circumstances under which I will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But I think when we do change the U.S. Constitution we ought to do it with great care and we ought to do it right, because you do not get many chances to correct a mistake. 
First, I want to talk about debt. The discussion about debt is an interesting one because we have people coming to the floor of the Senate and they say, `Well, these Federal deficits that we have had, you know, everybody else has to balance their budget. Business has to balance its budget. Consumers have to balance their budgets.' 
We have about $21 trillion of debt in this country, about $21 trillion of debt. This chart shows what has happened to debt. The growth of debt in my judgment has not been very healthy for this country, not in the public sector, not in the private sector. 
This shows what has happened to business debt, corporate debt, household debt, Federal Government debt. Take a look at the curve. And $21 trillion worth of debt. 
Now someone might stand up and say, `Well, everybody else has to balance their budget.' That is not true. If so, what is all this debt about? In fact, we have developed a culture in 
this country in which it is fine for the private sector to send a dozen solicitations to college students who have no jobs and no visible means of support saying to them, `Please take our credit card. You have a $1,000, $2,000, or $5,000 approved limit. Just go ahead and take our credit card. We want you to have a credit card. You don't have a job, no income. Take our credit card.' That is the culture in our country. Is it good for this country? I do not think so. 
I said also, the culture is walking down the street as a consumer, and the picture window of the business literally raps on your elbow and says, `Hey, you, walking in front of me here,' the window says, `Come in and buy this product. It doesn't matter you can't afford it. Doesn't matter you don't need it. Buy the product. Take it home. You don't have to make a payment for 6 months. And we'll give you a rebate next week. And charge it.' That is the culture. Is it right? No, it is not right. 
We ought to change that. We ought to change it here in the Federal system by balancing our budgets responsibly. And we have a problem well beyond this Federal system. Take a look what is happening with credit card debt in this country. Take a look at consumer debt. 
My point is, we ought to be concerned about the Federal debt and the Federal deficit, but we ought not stand up and say that is the only place debt exists. We have a whole culture of debt that raises real significant questions about where we are headed and how we are going to get there. 
The discussion today is about altering the Constitution in order to require budgets be in balance. Last evening I was privileged to see a preview of something that is going to be on public broadcasting on the life of Thomas Jefferson. It is a wonderful piece written by Ken Burns. It describes Thomas Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence at age 33. I got a copy of that today. I can only imagine having the kind of talent that he had. I mean, he was almost unique in the history of the world in his ability to think and write and express for us the spirit of what this democracy is. 
Thirty-three years old and in a boarding house he writes: 
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve their political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. 
You can see Thomas Jefferson's handwriting and his corrections, the words he has crossed out, the words he has added when he wrote this marvelous, wonderful document. 
The year following the writing of this document when he was 33 years old, a group of 55 white men, largely overweight, we are told, convened in a small room in Philadelphia called the Assembly Room in Constitution Hall. They said it was so hot that summer in Philadelphia that--and those folks had such ample girth--that they had to cover the windows to keep the Sun out because it got very warm and they did not have air-conditioning in those days. And those 55 men wrote for this country a constitution. 
The Constitution itself is quite a wonderful document. Thomas Jefferson was in Europe at the time. He contributed to the writing of the Constitution by sending substantial writing back about the Bill of Rights. The Constitution of course is the living document that is unique in the history of this world. 
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. 
Language so clear and so wonderfully written, they established the foundation of this country, the fabric of a democracy that has now become the most successful surviving democracy on this Earth. 
The spirit of that document, the spirit of that Constitution is, I think, attested to by virtually all who serve here in what it means to us, our families, our future, to our country. When we decide that we should consider altering that Constitution, provisions for which were made in the very Constitution, we should do it carefully. 
We have had people propose all kinds of schemes to alter the Constitution of the United States. I am told there was a proposal to alter the Constitution that would require a President first coming from the northern part of America and then followed by a requirement that the next President come from the South. 
There have been thousands of proposals--some good, some bad, some baked, some half-baked--to change the Constitution of the United States. In fact, it was not very long ago that we had three proposals to alter the Constitution, in the last session of Congress, proposed to be voted on by the U.S. Senate, in the period of 6 weeks--three separate proposals to alter the work of Franklin, Madison, Mason, George Washington, and so many others, who over 200 years ago framed this issue.

Mr. DORGAN. I observe that there will be no limit of time for anyone here to speak to their last breath about any subject they so choose on this issue, I guess. 
I will continue because I wanted to provide a framework for what I was going to say. I respect the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch. He has been on this floor on this issue and he has not wavered. He believes very strongly in what he is doing. I would support him if he would make one change in the constitutional amendment. 
A columnist said, `Call his bluff,' naming me by name. I say to the Senator, you make the change and I vote with it. I expect the change will not be made. If you do, chalk me up. I am one more vote. 
I want to talk about that change and the dimensions of it and the response of it. The change is in the issue of Social Security. We have had a lot of debate about this. Some said this is the biggest red herring in the world. Two political pundits this weekend said this is a fraudulent issue. Of course, pundits are either 100 percent right or 100 percent wrong and no one knows which or who. A columnist said this is a totally fraudulent issue. I want to describe the issue once again and describe why I think not only is it not fraudulent, it is one of the most significant issues we will face in fiscal policy. A position on this issue is now prepared to be put into the Constitution of the United States in a way I think hurts this country. 
Let me describe it. Social Security is a remarkably successful program in this country. We decided some long while ago that we would have people pay in a payroll tax and that payroll tax would accumulate money which would be available to people when they retire. What has happened is we have developed kind of a `bulge' in our population, a very large group of children who were born just after the Second World War. I mentioned the other day, kind of kidding, but it was true, there was a tremendous outpouring of love and affection after the Second World War. A lot of folks came back and a lot of this love and affection blossomed into the largest baby crop in the history of our country. It caused some real long-term demographic problems, because when they hit the retirement rolls, what will happen is we will have the fewest numbers of workers supporting the largest number of retirees in this country's history. 
What was to be done? About 13 years ago, a discussion was held about how do we finance that when the largest baby crop hits the retirement rolls and we do not have enough money. The answer was, let's accumulate some surpluses in the Social Security system to be used when we need them later. I do not expect there is disagreement about that, that we have a circumstance where we accumulate $70 million more now than we need to be put into a trust fund to be saved for the future. If there is disagreement, I want to hear that, but those are the facts. 
Now, what is happening is a proposal is now made to alter the U.S. Constitution with this language, according to the Congressional Research Service, and the language says that all receipts and expenditures shall be counted for purposes of completing a balanced budget, and therefore the Congressional Research Service says `because the balanced budget amendment requires that the required balance be between the outlays for that year and the receipts for that year,' the moneys that we are `saving in the surplus would not be available as a balance for the payments of benefits.' That means if we save $70 million extra this year for Social Security to be made available in the year 2015 or 2020, and in the year 2020 we balance the rest of the budget but want to spend that surplus we have in the Social Security accounts, the Congressional Research Service says you cannot do it. You cannot do it. This ought not be a 
controversial conclusion. I do not know of anyone who disagrees with it. You cannot do it unless you raise taxes in the rest of the budget to accommodate it. 
I say if that is the case, why are we raising more money than we now need in Social Security if it will not be saved and it will not be available for future use? 
I want to read to my colleagues something from the Social Security trustees last year: 
`Total income for Social Security is estimated to fall short of the total expenditures in the year 2019 and will continue thereafter under the immediate assumptions, but in this circumstance the trust funds would be redeemed over that period to cover the difference until the assets are exhausted in 2029. 
That is what the Social Security trustees said. CRS says that cannot be done because the trust funds will not be able to be used in those years unless you have raised taxes on the other part of the budget or cut spending in the other part of the budget, and I say in the year 2029 it would require $600 billion that year alone. 
I have a 9-year-old son. This is not rocket science. I think he would understand that double-entry bookkeeping does not mean you can use the same money twice. You cannot say I am using this money to show a balanced budget and then use this money to save over here for Social Security. You do it one way or the other. You cannot do it both ways. 
My Uncle Joe used to own a gas station. Can you imagine him coming home to my Aunt Blanche and saying, `We lost money this year, Blanche, but I put away money for my employees because I bargained with them and I told them I put money in their retirement account. So we got money in their retirement account for their pensions. But since I lost money in the service station, what I intend to do is take their money out of the retirement account I have put it in and use it over here so I can tell people I don't have a loss on my service station anymore.' My aunt would say, `Joe, you cannot do that. It is illegal. Somebody will send you to jail for that.' Joe would say, `Well, the folks down there in Washington, DC, seem to think it is OK. They think they can take $1 trillion in the first 10 years and put it first in this pocket and then in that pocket, thumb their suspenders and puff on their cigars and say, `We balanced the budget.' 
Guess what? The year in which the budget is presumably balanced and the year in which all of those who will stand up on the highest desk in this Chamber and bray and bellow and trumpet and talk about how they balanced the budget, I ask every American to look at one number. What happened to the debt in that year in which they balance the budget? The answer: They say they balanced the budget and they have to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 billion, the same year in which they claim they balance the budget. Why? Because the budget has been balanced. 
And it is not just me. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is on the floor, he raised the same points the other day. There are Republicans in the House, two or three dozen, that raised the same points. I do not know how he and others will vote on final passage, but I say, as controversial as this is, I agree with what the Senator from Pennsylvania said on the floor the other day. I agree with what Congressman Neumann and others are saying in the House. I agree with the presentation I am making. This is an issue that is not insignificant, $1 trillion in 10 years, and it is much more than that in the 20 to 25 years that you have to look out to see what will be the consequence of this kind of proposal. 
Let me frame it in a positive way. I believe we ought to balance the Federal budget. I will support altering the Constitution to place in the Constitution a requirement to balance the Federal budget. We will vote on an alternative, on a substitute constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does that. I will offer it. I intend to vote for it. I will not vote for a constitutional amendment that accomplishes this--that essentially reduces by 10 years the solvency of the current Social Security system and guarantees that which we are supposed to be saving will not be saved and that which we are supposed to be saving cannot, by virtue of the language of this constitutional amendment, be available for use by Social Security recipients when it was promised. 
Sometimes I get the feeling that the only thing we do in this Chamber is talk to ourselves. We just talk back and forth with `budgetspeak' and language and a priesthood of dialog that only we understand and that seems almost totally foreign to the American people. I will bet you that with a lot of this discussion that's the case. The American people, I think, want a balanced budget and should expect that we can do what is necessary to balance the budget. But let me emphasize again that, although I believe there is merit to alter the Constitution to require a balanced budget, if we alter the Constitution at 2:05, by 2:10--which is 5 minutes later--we would not have changed by one penny either the Federal debt or Federal deficit. That will only be altered by decisions on taxing and spending made individually by Members of this Congress, deciding what is a priority and what isn't, how much should we spend or should we not spend, or how we raise revenues or how don't we raise revenues. Only those decisions will bring us to a place we want to be--a balanced budget that provides for the long-term economic health of this country. 
My hope is that, in the coming days, when we finish this debate, we will have accomplished something in that we will all have resolved not only to perhaps make a change in the Constitution, if we can reach agreement on how that is done, but we will have resolved that we should, as men and women, balance the budget. Changing the Constitution is not balancing the budget. Some want to substitute that as political rhetoric. But, ultimately, the question of whether we balance the budget will be determined by the choices that we make individually. 
Mr. President, I see the Senator from Connecticut on the floor. I wanted to say to the Senator that I used a bit of the time in the 4-hour block. I hope he didn't mind. I wanted to make this point. I hope to come back in general debate, and I hope that the Senator from Utah and I can engage on the consequences of this language because I think it is a trillion-dollar question that remains unanswered. I would like to have a dialog back and forth rather than just presentations that vanish into the air when the presentations are completed. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with Senator Ashcroft and 28 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle, that will prohibit Federal funds from being used to pay for the costs associated with assisted suicide. 
I want to say right off that the Dorgan-Ashcroft bill does not attempt to address the broad and complex issue of whether there is a constitutional right to die. That job belongs to the Supreme Court, and as you all know, the High Court is expected to issue a decision later this year to answer this fundamental question. 
It is the job of Congress, however, to determine how our Federal resources will be allocated. I do not believe Congress ever intended for Federal funding to be used for assisted suicide, and my bill will ensure that such funding does not occur. 
I understand that the decisions that confront individuals and their families when a terminal illness strikes are among the most difficult a family will ever have to make. At times like this, each of us must rely on our own religious beliefs and conscience to guide us. 
But regardless of one's personal views about assisted suicide, I feel strongly that Federal tax dollars should not be used for this controversial practice, and the vast majority of Americans agree with me. In fact, when asked in a poll in November of last year whether tax dollars should be spent for assisting suicide, 87 percent of Americans feel tax money should not be spent for this purpose. 
The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act prevents any Federal funding from being used for any item or service which is intended to cause, or assist in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual. 
This bill does make some important exceptions. First, this bill explicitly provides that it does not limit the withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment or of nutrition or hydration from terminally ill patients who have decided that they do not want their lives sustained by medical technology. Most people and States recognize that there are ethical, moral, and legal distinctions between actively taking steps to end a patient's life and withholding or withdrawing treatment in order to allow a patient to die naturally. Every State now has a law in place governing a patient's right to lay out in advance, through an advanced directive, living will, or some other means, his or her wishes related to medical care at the end of life. Again, this legislation would not interfere with the ability of patients and their families to make clear and carry out their wishes regarding the withholding or withdrawal of medical care that is prolonging the patient's life. 
This bill also makes clear that it does not prevent Federal funding for any care or service that is intended to alleviate a patient's pain or discomfort, even if the use of this pain control ultimately hastens the patient's death. Large doses of medication are often needed to effectively reduce a terminally ill patient's pain, and this medication may increase the patient's risk of death. I think we all would agree that the utmost effort should be made to ensure that terminally ill patients do not spend their final days in pain and suffering. 
Finally, while I think Federal dollars ought not be used to assist a suicide, this bill does not prohibit a State from using its own dollars for this purpose. However, I do not think taxpayers from other States, who have determined that physician-assisted suicide should be illegal, should be forced to pay for this practice through the use of Federal tax dollars. 
I realize that the legality of assisted suicide has historically been a State issue. There are 35 States, including my State of North Dakota, which have laws prohibiting assisted suicide and at least 8 other States consider this practice to be illegal under common law. Only one State, Oregon, has a law legalizing assisted suicide. 
However, two circumstances have changed that now make this an issue of Federal concern. First, the Supreme Court's decisions in Washington versus Glucksberg and Quill versus Vacco could have enormous consequences on our public policy regarding assisted suicide. In these two cases, the Federal Ninth Second Circuit Courts of Appeal have struck down Washington and New York State statutes outlawing assisted suicide. Although the circuit courts varied in their legal reasoning, both recognized a constitutional right to die. 
Second, we are on the brink of a situation where Federal Medicaid dollars may soon be used to reimburse physicians who help their patients die. In another case, Lee versus Oregon, a Federal district court judge has ruled that Oregon's 1994 law allowing assisted suicide is unconstitutional and he has blocked its implementation. However, his decision has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has already recognized a constitutional right to die. 
Once the legal challenges to Oregon's law have been resolved, the State's Medicaid director has already stated that Oregon will begin using its Federal Medicaid dollars to reimburse physicians for their costs associated with assisting in suicide. Should this occur, Congress will not have considered this issue. I do not think it was Congress' intention for Medicaid or other Federal dollars to be used to assist in suicide, and I hope we will take action soon to stop this practice before it starts. 
It is important to point out that the Supreme Court decisions will not resolve the important issue of funding for assisted suicides. Even if the Supreme Court finds that there is not a constitutional right to assisted suicide, the ruling likely will not negate Oregon's statute permitting assisted suicide. As a result, the Ninth Circuit Court could well uphold the Oregon statute and Oregon could, in turn, bill Medicaid for the costs associated with assisted suicide. If Congress does not act to disallow Federal funding, a few States, or a few judges, may very well take this decision out of our hands. 
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Right to Life Committee have endorsed this legislation. The American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association have issued position statements opposing assisted suicide, and President Clinton has also indicated his opposition to assisted suicide. 
I hope you agree with me and the vast majority of Americans who oppose using scarce Federal dollars to pay for assisted suicide. I invite you to join me, Senator Ashcroft and 28 of our colleagues in this effort by cosponsoring the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act.

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a question? Mr. President, the Senator indicated he wished to speak for 6 or 7 minutes. The Senator from North Carolina, apparently, wishes to speak for 3 minutes, and I had come to the floor wanting to speak also on the legislation. 
I ask the Senator to propound a unanimous-consent request that he speak for 7 minutes, the Senator from North Carolina follow for 3 minutes, after which I be recognized.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to make an observation and make a point. The Congressional Research Service has sent a second letter. I wanted to make the point the Senator from Nevada made. The second letter says the same as the first letter on the question of whether surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund can be used in the outyears to be spent for Social Security needs. The answer is, in the first letter from CRS and in the second, the answer is no, unless there is a corresponding tax increase in the same fiscal year, or corresponding spending cuts, equal to those surpluses. And that is the very point we were making. 
The second letter from the Congressional Research Service simply says the same thing that they said earlier with slightly different wording. We want to make that point, that this is not a change in position for them at all. 
In the outyears, the way the constitutional amendment to balance the budget is worded, the Government would be prevented from using the surpluses accrued in the Social Security Trust Fund that were saved for the specific purpose of being used later when they were needed. It would be prevented from using those unless in those years it also increased taxes sufficient to cover them or cut spending sufficient to cover them. This, despite the fact that they were accrued as surpluses, above other needs in the Social Security system now, in order to meet the needs in the future. 
I know this is confusing. We just wanted to leave the message that the Congressional Research Service is saying the same thing. This is not a change in message from them at all, and this is about a $3 trillion issue. It is of great significance, and I hope Members will take account of it as we consider these issues.

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for 1 additional minute, that is exactly the point of this debate. It is not an attempt in any way to create more diversion, or any diversion, on the issue of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
The question is, Shall the Constitution be altered? But we are raising the question of, if an alteration of the Constitution is made, how will that affect, in the outyears, the opportunity to spend the surpluses that we are accruing each year now because we need it when the baby boomers retire? 
And the answer is, according to the Congressional Research Service, it will have a profound and enormous effect on the Government's ability to do that. That is what we want our colleagues to understand.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will likely have a longer debate about this, and I shall not lengthen it today, but the Senator from Utah always makes a strong case for his position. 
In the circumstances this evening, he, once again, has made a strong case, but on a couple of points, in my judgment, he is factually in error, and I want to point that out. 
In one respect he is not in error, he is absolutely correct. President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton have all sent budgets since 1983 to this Congress--1983 is the period in which we began to decide we were going to accumulate substantial surpluses in Social Security to save for a later time when they are needed--all Presidents have sent budgets to this Congress that use the Social Security trust funds as part of the unified budget. I think 2 days ago on the floor of this Senate, I pointed out the President did that in his budget, and his budget that he says is in balance is not in balance. I pointed that out about this President. I made the same point about President Bush and President Reagan when they did it as well. 
But, having said that, the Senator from Utah says the Social Security trust funds that are derived from Social Security taxes taken from paychecks of workers all across this country and from the employers, is a technical issue, and they simply go into all other funds and they are commingled. This technical resolution of all these moneys means that there really is not a dedicated Social Security fund, and so on and so forth. 
I would be happy to go for a drive with the Senator from Utah to Parkersburg, WV, where the Social Security trust fund securities are held under armed guard. I might even be able to bring him a copy of one of those securities so we could show him that those securities exist. They are held under armed guard. I can tell him where they are held, and it is not merely technical. It is much, much more important than that. 
If it is purely technical, then I say to the tens of millions of workers out there, `The next time you get your paycheck stub and you see that little portion where they take some tax away from you and they say, `We're doing this to put it in the Social Security account and it's a dedicated tax to go into a dedicated trust fund to be used for only one purpose,' you deserve a tax break; you ought not be paying that if it is not going to where it is indicated it is going, to a trust fund to save for the future.' If this is just like other money, commingled with other funds, let's stop calling it a trust fund, let's stop calling it a dedicated tax and call it an income tax, and a regressive one because everybody pays the same amount. 
In fact, it is the case that most Americans pay more in this payroll tax than they do in taxes, regrettably, but they do so because they believe it goes into a trust fund. I reject the notion somehow that there is no difference between all this money. I think the trust funds are dedicated funds that we promised workers would be saved for their future. 
The Congressional Research Service says nothing in the second letter they did not say in the first. They say--and you can say it two ways--the Government with this constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the way it is worded, would be prevented from using the Social Security trust funds in the outyears, when we are going to use that surplus because it is needed, unless a corresponding tax increase or corresponding spending cut equal to those trust funds is enacted by Congress. That is one way of saying it. 
The other way of saying it, which they now have in this paper, says the Congress, in the outyears, can use the Social Security trust funds, but only if there is a corresponding tax increase or spending cut. It is another way of saying exactly the same thing. Why use two pieces of paper when you can use one? It doesn't matter much to me. It is probably a waste of paper, but it says exactly the same thing. 
I want to make one final point. The reason I have taken issue with President Bush, President Reagan, and, yes, President Clinton 
on this issue, and taken issue with the Senator from Utah, is embodied in the debt clock that the Senator brought to his hearing. I hope we will have this discussion at some point soon. The Senator will I think agree that the clock showing the amount of public debt that is owed in this country will not stop with the passage of this balanced budget amendment and the passage of a budget that complies with this amendment. 
I ask the Senator from Utah, is it not true that if the Congress passes this constitutional amendment to balance the budget and then passes a budget in compliance with that, in the very year in which that budget is so-called balanced, is it not true that the Federal debt will increase $130 billion in that year? And if it is, and I believe the Senator from Utah would admit that it is, if it is true that in the year in which it is represented to the American people that the budget is balanced, then why does the Federal debt rise by another $130 billion? Somehow that doesn't pass any standard of common sense in my hometown.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might--I will not belabor this because there will be another time when we can have a 
lengthier discussion. I hope we can have some questions back and forth. 
The Senator used the word `sophistry.' I was recalling when in high school I worked at a service station and learned how to juggle three balls. I remember how difficult it was when I started trying to learn to juggle three balls at once, but how easy it became once I learned how. And I marvel sometimes at how those who really know how to juggle do it with total ease. It seems effortless. 
The juggling that I just saw was interesting. The Senator said there may be an increase in gross debt even when the budget is in balance. It is not `may.' The Congressional Budget Office says there `will' be an increase in gross debt by $130 billion the very year in which people claim there is a balanced budget. So it is not `may'; it is `will.' 
The question I was asking was, does that matter? Is it not a paradox or contradiction that when we say we have balanced the budget, my young daughter will inherit a higher national debt? And the Senator from Utah, I think, said, yeah, but that is just technical. He said the gross debt is different than the net debt. 
In fact, the only reason we keep track of the gross debt, as I heard him say it, is because it has an impact on the economy. But if it has an impact on the economy, I did not understand the second position of why it does not count. It seems to me that the circumstances of the gross debt are that if you increase the indebtedness of the Federal Government, this cannot simply be on cellophane paper someplace. It represents securities that my daughter and sons and all others in the country will have to repay. I would be happy to yield for a question.

Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, I was yielding for a question. I guess the question that often comes up for us is: Isn't our balanced budget amendment a gimmick? Isn't yours real, the one offered by the Senator from Utah? The answer, I would say to the Senator from Utah, is, it is now 6:27. If at 6:28 we pass and all the States ratify your proposal, at 6:29 will there have been one penny difference in the Federal debt or the Federal deficit? The answer is `No.'

Mr. DORGAN. I say this. My proposal is a proposal to similarly require a balanced budget. I think there is merit in that discipline. But I would say this. When we alter the Constitution to require a balanced budget, I want to do it in a way that really requires that this debt clock that you brought to your 
hearing that day stop, dead stop; not a slow creep, but a dead stop. No more debt for your kids, my kids, no more debts for this country, so we can start paying down the debt rather than continue to increase the debt. 
I do not want to create a shell game here where we say, let us have a giant feast because we have balanced the budget, and then have someone, some little kid point up to that debt clock and say, `Gee, Daddy, why is the debt clock still increasing, because Senator Hatch or Senator so and so said we balanced the budget?' 
I say you and I do not have a disagreement about what we ought to be doing. We ought to balance the budget. Nor do we have a disagreement about whether there is merit to have put it in the Constitution. 
We have a very big disagreement about the $3 trillion in the next 20 years or so in Social Security surpluses, deciding that we ought to take those out of reach and save them for the purpose we said we are going to save them for. We have great disagreement about whether or not that is a gimmick or whether that is important for the future of this country. That is where we disagree.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I introduce the Family Estate Tax Relief Act of 1997. This legislation is nearly identical to my bill from the 104th Congress with one major change. 
My new legislation still targets substantial estate tax relief to help preserve one of our Nation's most important economic assets--its family run small businesses. But it also increases the existing $600,000 unified estate and gift tax credit, which is available to everyone. 
Of course, increasing the unified credit will further reduce the estate tax burden now imposed on many families trying to transfer their businesses to the next generation. It also will help any families wishing to pass along to the children or grandchildren some stock, proceeds from a life insurance policy or other assets acquired over many years. 
The main thrust of this legislation remains the preservation of family farmers and other family run businesses. These businesses are the major creators of new wealth and jobs in this country. However, they face a number of obstacles to succeeding, ranging from price gouging by tough international competitors to excessive U.S. regulations. That is why it is not surprising to find, for example, that we have lost some 377,000 family farms since 1980, a decline of some 23,500 family farms every year. 
Since 1980, we have lost some 9,000 of our family farms in North Dakota. At the same time, we see that only a small fraction of other family run businesses survive beyond the second generation. 
When families have to sell their farms or board up their Main Street businesses, those families lose their very livelihood. Moreover, our communities lose the jobs and services those family businesses provide. 
I have been approached on many occasions at town meetings by North Dakotans who say it is virtually impossible for them to pass along their farm or business--which has been the family's major asset for decades--to their children because of the exorbitant estate taxes they would pay. They think it is unfair, and I agree. 
Unfortunately, our estate tax laws force many family members who inherit a modestly sized farm, ranch, or other family business to sell it, or a large part of it, out of the family in order to pay off estate taxes. This is especially onerous when the inheriting family members have already been participating in the business for years and depend upon it to earn a living. 
I think that we must take immediate steps to breathe new economic life and opportunities into our family businesses and the communities in which they operate. It seems to me that a good first step is correcting our estate tax laws so they do not unfairly penalize those working families. 
There are a few provisions included in our estate tax laws to help a family keep its business running long after the death of the original owner. But for the most part, these provisions are either too modest or too narrowly drawn to do much good. 
Now I also understand that there are some complicated estate tax planning techniques available for those wealthy enough to hire sophisticated and costly tax advisors. Clearly some estate planning devices may reduce the estate tax burden imposed on some family businesses upon the death of a principal owner. But for those less affluent families inheriting a family business--where such estate planning tools were unavailable for whatever reason--the estate taxes will ultimately force them to amass a pile of debt, or to sell off all or a large part of a family business, just to pay off their estate taxes. I think that this is wrong, and it runs counter to the kinds of policies that we ought to be pursuing in support of our family-owned businesses. 
That is why I am introducing the Family Estate Tax Relief Act to rectify this matter, and I urge my colleagues to consider joining me in this endeavor. 
The Family Estate Tax Relief Act of 1997 would provide three significant measures of estate tax relief to those families hoping to pass along their businesses or other assets to the next generation. 
First, my bill would increase the existing unified estate and gift tax credit from $600,000 today to $1,000,000 in the year 2004. The amount of the existing credit has not been changed for nearly a decade, and its benefit has been reduced by more than 35 percent due to inflation over this period. Moreover, even 3-percent inflation for another 7 years will rob an additional 20 percent of the real value of the unified credit. This provision will prevent erosion of the credit's real value by inflation. 
Second, my bill allows a decedent's estate to exclude up to the first $1,000,000 of value of the family business from estate taxes so long as the heirs continue to materially participate in 
the business for many years after the death of the owner. The full benefit of this new $1,000,000 exclusion is available to couples trying to pass along the family business without the complicated tax planning tailored to one spouse or the other that is sometimes used today. 
Together, these two proposals would eliminate estate tax liability on qualifying family business assets valued up to $2.0 million. This would eliminate the burden of estate taxes for the majority of family run businesses. 
Third, my bill would allow the executor of a qualifying estate who chooses to pay estate taxes in installments to benefit from a special 4-percent interest rate on the payment of estate taxes attributable to a family business worth between $2.0 and $3.0 million. In other words, my bill would also lighten the estate tax burden on the next $1 million of estate assets. 
The parts of my legislation targeted to family run businesses expand upon the well-tested approaches found in sections 2032A and 6601(j) of the Tax Code. 
For example, we currently provide a special-use calculation for valuing real estate used in a farm or other trade or business for estate tax purposes, where a qualifying business is passed along to another family member after the death of the owner. To benefit from the special-use formula under section 2032A, the inheriting family member must continue to actively participate in the business operation. If the heir ceases to participate in the business, he or she may face a substantial recapture of the estate taxes which would have been paid at the time of the original owner's death. 
In enacting this provision, Congress embraced the goal of keeping a farm or other closely held business in the family after the death of the owner. However, in the case of family farms, special-use valuation primarily helps those farms adjacent to urban areas, where the value of the land for non-farm uses is often much higher. But section 2032A does not help many farms located in truly rural areas of the country where farming is the land's best use. This provision also provides little help for families transferring other nonfarm small businesses under similar circumstances. My legislation would correct these glaring shortfalls in current law. 
In addition, my bill would increase the benefit of the existing preferential interest rates under section 6601(j) that apply to farms and other closely held businesses. The benefits of the current provision have been significantly reduced by inflation over the past several decades, and my bill simply increases the amount of estate taxes that qualify for a special 4-percent interest rate if paid to the IRS in installment payments over time. 
Moreover, my bill includes several safeguards to ensure that its tax benefits are truly targeted at the preservation of most family businesses. 
Finally, I plan to offset any estimated revenue losses from this bill by offering another legislative package to close a number of outdated or unnecessary tax loopholes for large multinational corporations doing business in the United States. As a result, passing my estate tax relief proposals will not increase the Federal deficit. But passing the Family Estate Tax Relief Act will help to preserve the economic backbone of this country and to help thrifty parents to help their children. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this much-needed legislation.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been very interested in the discussion today about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It is a serious subject and one which the Senate should take seriously. We should have a robust, aggressive, provocative and interesting debate on a question of this magnitude. 
I have told the Senate before, and I would like to again at the risk of being redundant, that I was privileged to be one of 55 people to go back into the room in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia on the 200th anniversary of the writing of the Constitution. 
200 years previous, 55 white men went into the room in Philadelphia Hall, some very great men, and they wrote a Constitution for this country. George Washington's chair is still in that room. You can see where he sat in the front of the room and presided over the Constitutional Convention. 
Mr. President, 200 years later 55 people--men and women, people from all ethnic and racial backgrounds--went in and had a celebration in that room. 
Coming from a very small town in southwestern North Dakota, I kind of got goose bumps that day because I was sitting in the very room where they wrote the Constitution of the United States. It was a unique and special privilege for me to be present and to be one of those participants. 
Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and I were just visiting moments ago about the U.S. Constitution and he gave me a copy of the Constitution that he carries in his pocket. It is a very small document, one of the most remarkable documents ever written by people who live on this Earth. It is the framework for the most successful democracy in the history of the world. 
It is this document, the Constitution of the United States, that we are talking about amending. We are debating whether or not to alter this document. And we are in the midst of a blizzard of rhetoric about a stack of 6 or 8 feet of budget documents spanning some 29 or 30 years. 
Well, those budget documents do not read like this:  
`We The People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.' 
You will not find this language in that stack of documents. 
This Constitution has a provision in it by which it can be amended. We have some people in politics today who believe that this is an imperfect document. Some, in fact, in the last session of Congress, some proposed three separate amendments in the period of 3 months. Over the years we have had thousands of proposals to change this document. I do not see many people who look like Madison, Mason, Franklin, or Washington walking around making these proposals. I see a lot of other folks making these proposals. 
My point is this: When we debate how and whether we should alter the Constitution of the United States, we ought to be mindful of the need to get it right. Be careful. Do not dishonor this great document by making alterations that will in the long run weaken our country. 
That brings me to the debate about the current constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the comments by the Senator from West Virginia. 
I will talk just for a moment about this issue of debt. Clearly, the amount of Federal debt that we have is excessive. The deficits that we have experienced in recent years, in the last couple of decades, especially, saddle our children with interest payments that we do not want to have to have them meet. Clearly, we need to make progress in balancing the budget and finally achieve fiscal stability and have a budget that is balanced. That is clear. 
We have a debt problem. That is clear as a bell. 
I say to people who come to the floor and talk about this issue, however, it is not just the Federal debt. We have corporate debt that is rising just exactly like the Federal debt is. We have credit card debt that is rising faster. We have consumer debt that is rising just as fast. We have $21 trillion in debt out there in this country. 
In fact, you walk down the street, you walk past a picture window of a business someplace, and you almost hear the invisible tapping on the windowpane behind the bright red letter sign that says to you `Say, consumer, come over here a second. It does not matter you cannot afford this. It does not matter that you do not have money for it. Come and buy this product. Come over here and buy this product. We will give you the product. You take the product home. We will give you a rebate. You do not make a payment for 6 months. Come over here. Credit bad, it does not matter. We will give you credit. Are you in college and have no job? We will give you a credit card. In fact, we will give you four of them, from four different companies. You do not have to have a job and you can be in college and you get a pen pal or a dozen of them, saying `Take our credit card, buy our product. It does not matter that you cannot afford it.' 
We have a debt problem in this country. It is an addiction and it is a problem in a range of areas in our economy. One area we can do something about is the Federal Government's spending and the Federal Government's fiscal policy. I want to talk about that. In 1993, President Clinton won his election to the Presidency. He came to this Congress and he said the Federal deficit is a problem and he proposed that we do something about it. He proposed a deficit reduction act. It included some tough medicine, some things people did not like, some controversial items, 
spending cuts, yes, real spending cuts. Some tax increases, yes, very unpopular. We passed it here in the Senate by one vote. I voted for it. Was it the popular thing to do? Of course not. The popular thing to do would have been to have voted against it and go home and crow about having voted in opposition to this proposal. Now, that would have been the political thing to do--go home and crow about your opposition to this proposal. We didn't get one vote from the other side of the aisle, not one, not even by accident. You would think maybe someone on that side would have made a mistake and voted for it. No. We passed it by one vote. 
I will read for my colleagues some of the comments during that debate. If you pass this legislation to tackle the deficit in this way, some of my colleagues said, what is going to happen? `This bill is going to cost America jobs.' `It will kill jobs.' `It's going to be devastating.' `We are buying a one-way ticket to a recession.' Another Senator said, `It will turn a fragile recovery into a solid recession.' Another said, `It will lead to a recession.' All of that was said here on the floor of the Senate. `Do this and you kill this economy.' 
But we did it, and here is what happened to the Federal budget deficit since then: 4 straight years of reduced deficits; the unified deficit cut in real terms by 60 percent--60 percent. 
Now, this isn't the deficit the Republicans use or the President uses because neither one use the right numbers. This is a deficit without the Social Security funds in it, because you ought not be able to misuse those funds. A 60-percent reduction in real terms in the unified deficit. 
What happened to the economy? We have seen record numbers of new jobs. The economy continues to grow. 
What did we do? We cut the deficit by 60 percent. I am glad I did that. Was there a price to pay for that? Yes. The popular thing would have been to do something different. But we did this. 
Now, how do you cut the deficit from here to zero? Well, you can get a costume and suit up and strut around and bellow or bray or crow, or whatever it is one wants to do. Or you can decide that the way to reduce the budget deficit is by individual spending and taxing choices that we must make in a budget document. 
You can alter the Constitution of the United States, I guess. You can take this little Constitution and alter it in a hundred places and when it's done, in 5 seconds, not one penny will have been altered from this budget deficit. You can change the Constitution at 2:10 today and you won't have done one thing to change the budget deficit. Why? Because changing the Constitution doesn't change the deficit. Only men and women making individual decisions on spending and taxing can change the budget deficit. We did that in 1993. We didn't have many friends when we did it, but we did it. It's tough medicine, but it's the medicine we have to take. 
Now, some come to us today and say that if we simply change the Constitution, we will solve this problem. I have taken the position that I am willing to alter the Constitution of this country. I have not been willing to do it often. I voted against most of the proposals--term limits and dozens of proposals around here--to alter the Constitution. I have not been very willing to change the Constitution. But I have said I think there is some merit in fiscal discipline. I would vote to alter the Constitution. 
But I will not, under any condition, vote to alter this Constitution in a manner that, as the majority proposal does, takes the Social Security trust funds, adds them in, and then claims to have balanced the budget when they haven't. That happens today in normal fiscal policy practice, and it is wrong today. It was wrong last year and, especially, it will be wrong and devastating to this country if you enshrine that practice into the Constitution of the United States. 
I want to ask one question, and I want to come here this coming week and ask it repeatedly because I want to find someone who will stand up and answer the question. 
To frame the question, I want to give a little history. In 1983, the Congress said, `We have problems financing the Social Security system.' We formed a commission, headed by Mr. Greenspan, who now chairs the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan and the commission reported to Congress and said that the way we are going to solve the Social Security problem in the long-term is we are going to increase payroll taxes, we are going to increase the age of retirement in the outyears, far out in the outyears, and make a number of other changes. When we do that, we are going to deliberately develop a Social Security surplus--this year, incidentally, it's $78 billion--and that surplus will be available when the baby boomers need it and retire, well after the turn of the century. 
Why was that necessary? Because after the Second World War there was this massive outpouring of love and affection when our young men came home. Guess what? There was something called the World War II baby boomers, the largest baby crop in the history of our country. That large baby crop has worked its way through our society. When it reaches retirement age, we have a demographic problem in Social Security. That is what the Greenspan commission said. The Congress recognized that and they said, `Let us save for that period of time, collect more money now in the Social Security system so that we have it available later when we need it.' 
Now, the reason I say that they did that, here is the commission testimony before the Ways and Means Committee on which I sat. It is what they claimed, what they said and recommended to us. Create the surplus now so that it's available later when we need it. It was the sober and right thing to do. That is exactly what was done. 
In fact, on the chart here are the Social Security surpluses that are going to accrue. This simply goes to 2010-- actually, the trust fund is in surplus out to about 2018, and in 2019 begins to run a deficit. You will see the surpluses. These are not insignificant amounts of money. We are talking a trillion dollars in the next 10 years alone. 
Now, unfortunately, what has happened as a result of all of this is, instead of this money being saved, it has been used as an offset against other spending. Some say, well, that is all technical garble. It is not technical garble. 
I want to ask this question as a result of all of this: In the year 2002, when we are told by this constitutional mandate and by a budget that calls for a balanced budget--and this would be true of the administration's budget and also true of the majority party's budget--in 2002, if the budget is in balance, why in that year will the Congress be required to increase by $130 billion the limit on total Federal debt? 
I want to ask this question again. I want to ask this a fair amount and get an answer to it. If the budget is balanced by constitutional mandate, if the budget is balanced by a budget plan submitted by anybody in the year 2002, why in the year in which the budget is balanced does CBO tell us that the debt limit will have to be increased by $130 billion? 
I will give you my answer. My answer is that the reason the debt limit has to be increased the very year they say the budget is in balance is because the budget isn't in balance, and everybody here knows it. It's a charade. 
I want to ask that question and ask someone to come and answer it. I certainly intend to ask the sponsors to answer it. If the budget is in balance, why are you then required to increase the Federal debt? 
Does anybody sitting around their dinner table talking about how they balance their checkbooks believe that is what would happen? We are in perfect balance, our spending is meeting the amount of money we have to spend and, therefore, our debt is increasing. Does anybody believe that would meet the test of credibility in business? I don't think so. It doesn't meet the test of credibility here. 
I will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I have introduced one with six of my colleagues, which does not misuse the Social Security trust funds to the tune of a trillion dollars. I challenge those who say they want to alter the Constitution of the United States to join us. We can pass it in 10 minutes, pass it with 75 votes. But that's not what is at stake here. What is at stake are people who want to talk about balancing the budget. 
We did more than talk in 1993. We cut the unified budget deficit by 60 percent in real terms, at some political peril, and we paid a price for it. Some people want to talk about balancing the budget and about altering the Constitution. What I want to talk about is doing what we promised the American people we would do--saving over a trillion dollars in the next 10 years of Social Security dedicated trust funds that are taken from workers' paychecks. We promised those workers their money would be saved in a trust fund, saved for when we need it after the turn of the century. Yet here we see a Constitutional proposal to misuse those trust funds and claim that we have balanced the budget. 
A columnist in the Washington Post, who I shall not name--Charles Krauthammer--wrote a column last week about this matter. This was his third column on this issue. He is all cranky about it. He basically said, `Dorgan and those folks don't know what they are talking about.' 
There is no Social Security trust fund? Social Security is pay as you go? Nonsense. What a bunch of nonsense. 
You have a right to be wrong in this country. God bless political pundits who are wrong. You have a right to be wrong. But if you want to see the Social Security trust fund securities, go to Parkersburg, WV. The bonds are under armed guard. The trust funds exist under law. Bonds are in the trust fund. 
Pay as you go? Nonsense. The Commission in 1983 said it was not going to be a pay-as-you-go system anymore, that we will raise more money--$78 billion this year alone--and save that money for the future. So Mr. Krauthammer is just flat wrong. 
A group that is right is the well-respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They published something on this issue this week. I want to read part of it into the Record because I heard some discussion here today saying if we do not pass our constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the one that misuses all of these Social Security revenues, it is going to hurt our kids. 
You want to hurt kids? I will tell you how, and do it quickly. It is confirmed by this study. What you do is take the savings that are designed to be spent in the Social Security system when our kids are going to be out there working and you use the surplus now in order to claim that you are balancing the budget and continue running the deficit. That is why you are still increasing the Federal debt even as you claim you have a balanced budget. 
That will really hurt kids, because 10, 15 or 20 years from now you will have to have massive tax increases on our kids to pay for the baby boomers' retirement. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities lays the whole scenario out in this document. 
Pass the constitutional amendment that I have talked about, and you do the honest thing. You save the money we said we would save and you are balancing the budget.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will come back to the floor and ask this question again: If the budget is balanced, why is the Federal debt increasing? Why do you want to put a process in and enshrine a practice in the Constitution that reaches this result, a budget that you claim is in balance when the Federal debt is continuing to rise? 
I will continue to ask that question and ask if there isn't a better way to decide to alter the Constitution of the United States. 
I want to just respond for one moment to some of what we heard on the floor about how we got to where we are now. I will be very brief on this final point. 
We are constantly told--in fact, one of my colleagues last year, and I will never forget this, talked about how we ought to somehow regret the last 50 years in our country. `Gee, what an awful place. What terrible decisions were made in America in the last 50 years.' 
In November I was in several countries in Asia, and one of the interesting things that I discovered is that when you talk to most of the citizens of those countries, they want to come to the United States. Why? They think this is a wonderful place because of the things that we have created--our education policies, our achievements in a whole range of areas such as health care, education, and the environment. 
Most people see America as a beacon of hope and opportunity. Most people around the world see this as a wonderful place in which to live. And much of what makes us a great country is Medicare, Social Security, Head Start programs, and so many other things, almost all of which had to be done by people standing up on the floor of the Senate saying let us do these things, let us improve this country, this is a step forward. 
And others are standing up saying, `Oh, Lord no, we can't do this.' I know people who are just opposed to everything for the first time. We all know people like that. No matter what it is, they oppose it for the first time, and 10 years later, of course, they think it is just fine because they then understood that it worked. 
We have done some good things in this country. And we have made some mistakes. 
David Stockman, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Reagan, has written about one of our mistakes. And he was one of the architects of what was done. One of the mistakes made in the early 1980's, as he tells it, was this. `The root problem'--he is talking about the deficits now and where we are financially as a nation--`The root problem goes back to July 1981, the frenzy of excessive and imprudent tax cutting that shattered the Nation's fiscal stability * * *' He says, `A noisy faction of Republicans willfully denied this giant mistake of fiscal governance and their own culpability in it ever since. Instead they have excessively poisoned the political debate pretending that economic growth and spending cuts alone will cure the deficit.' 
That is David Stockman. That is a Republican. 
The only point I am raising is not to point back and forth but just to say here is where we are. Here is how we got here. Let all of us decide, yes, let us balance the budget. Let us put this country on a fiscal policy plane that makes some sense. Let us do this for the benefit of our kids. 
But let us not enshrine in the Constitution a practice that is not honest budgeting. Let us not do something that ends with this result of people crowing about how we are balancing the budget, even for their children's benefit, who come to vote for increasing the Federal debt and the same year claim the budget is balanced. How do they explain that to their kids? 
If we are going to do something on this floor, especially with this document, let us do it the right way and not the wrong way.

Mr. DORGAN. That is the point I was making. It is the point David Stockman made. 
It was the fiscal policy recommended and designed by them. However, we also have a responsibility. Democrats and Republicans all have a responsibility for this problem and to solve it together but not create circumstances where we can claim a balanced budget as the Federal debt continues to increase. That is my point.

Mr. DORGAN. That is correct. As I pointed out, if the Constitution is amended at 2:25 today, at 2:26 the deficit will not have decreased by one penny. Why? Because altering the Constitution will not decrease the deficit. Only individual choices by men and women of goodwill in this Chamber who are willing to take some risks and take a little heat for it will cut the deficit and finally balance the budget. 
I am willing to do that. I demonstrated that in 1993, as did the Senator from Vermont. We had the fiscal discipline. 
If we can get some others to join us, we can balance this Federal budget. I just do not want us to play games, saying we balanced the budget, only then trying to explain to our children why the Federal debt continues to increase at the same time. That is not balancing the budget. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had ample discussion this morning about a wide range of public issues, discussion about the President's State of the Union Address, and a discussion about the agenda before the Congress. I wanted to comment on a bit of that, and then begin a discussion about the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the Senate will shortly take up. 
First the general issues. I do not think there is a difference between folks who serve in this body on Government or the size of Government. I mean, I don't think there is a case where one side says, `We want bigger Government.' 
I don't want a bigger Government. I want a better country, and there are some circumstances under which the requirement for schools and roads and other things that we do together in Government are necessary. I want us to improve the things we do in Government. But there are things that are important for us to do together in Government. 
Part of the agenda that we discuss, part of the reason for us being in a U.S. Senate, is to decide what to do together to make this a better country. 
Provide for the common defense? Yes, we do that. We have a Defense Department. We created it, and we fund it. We ask men and women in uniform to go out and help preserve this country's liberty and put their lives on the line to do so. That is part of Government. 
Roads, schools, research in health care at the National Institutes of Health, the Coast Guard, and so much more--we do those things together. We should do them well. We should make sure they contribute to a better country and achieve the goals and objectives that we have for those functions. 
Some come to the floor and they say: Our objective is less Government, balance the budget, two or three other things, and that's all. My objective is this: I want better schools for our kids in this country, and we can do that and we should do that. And I want better paychecks for workers in this country. 
That has always been the legacy of what we fight for, a country in which workers might expect that they will have more opportunity, more job security, more advancement, their children will have more income and better opportunity and better educations. 
I believe we ought to have good health care in our country, and that does not come by accident. At the turn of the century you were expected to live to be age 48; 100 years later you are expected to live to nearly 78. Is that magic? No. Massive research in health care in this country has developed breathtaking new medicine, breathtaking new procedures so that those with cataracts now get surgery and see, those whose heart muscles get plugged now get open heart surgery and live, those with bad hips get their hips replaced and are out of the wheelchair and walk. Good health care. 
We don't see people getting on airplanes, leaving America to find good health care elsewhere. Our health care system is the envy of the world. By accident? No. Wonderful men and women working in health care, and a substantial amount of research, especially Government sponsored research, have allowed these breathtaking breakthroughs to occur. 
Safe streets? We want safe streets and safe neighbors. That deals with crime. That responds to police and security, the kinds of things that we also do in Government. 
Restoration of values? Yes, that is of interest. Really, not so much Government, but we all ought to care about it and work together on it. 
It starts in the home, the community, the neighborhood, the family. And a balanced budget? Absolutely. We ought not spend beyond our means. 
So better schools, bigger paychecks for workers, good health care, safe streets, a sound defense, restoration of values, balancing the budget--all of these things are things that we think can make this a better country and we ought to work on together. 
It is interesting to me that in the context of the balanced budget, we really also will have to talk about priorities. As we balance the budget--and we should--what are our priorities? What is important and what is not important? What do we invest in and what don't we invest in? 
For instance, do we build the star wars program? Do we build a program that will cost well over $100 billion, a program that many say is not needed? Do we build that and then say we do not have enough money to expand the Head Start Program for early intervention for kids? 
These questions are examples of the choices we must make. We must choose priorities that we want to develop. That is precisely what the Congress must be about: making choices, some of them very hard. 
I want to make one point as I begin talking about the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I am not someone who believes that we have made a lot of wrong choices in this country. I have heard people stand on this floor and talk about shame on the last 50 years in this country, shame on us, this country somehow has gone down the wrong road. What an awful place, we hear. 
I tell you, this country remains the beacon of hope for the rest of the world. I traveled in six countries in November, and one of the refrains I heard everywhere I went was they would like to come to America. They like America. America is opportunity. America is freedom. America is still a beacon of hope. 
We can dwell on the negative, and we have plenty of challenges and there are negatives, but look at the positives as well. This country is a remarkable country, with a remarkable economy and a market system that provides great jobs and great opportunity for a lot of people. 
I agree with those who say there is no social program in this country--none--that is as important as a good job that pays well. There is no social program as important as a good job that pays well. And that's why our economy and the market system that we have had has performed so well and helped us create a country that grows and prospers. 
As I said, we have lots of challenges, but part of why this has all happened is we have made a lot of right choices. We decided that we were going to have a substantial system of universal education for virtually anyone who wanted it. What happened? 
What happened was we led the world in virtually every area of technology and achievement. Who stood people on the Moon? The United States of America. How did that happen? It happened because massive investments in education unleashed the potential, the technology, the understanding and the knowledge that allowed us first to fly and then to fly to the Moon. And that has been true in virtually every other area of our life. Yes, space, technology, walking on the Moon, but health care, and in virtually every other area as well. 
We have made all kinds of decisions about what we do in all of these areas, and some of them have been great decisions. Let's have a Head Start Program. Let's invest in young kids. Let's build the best system of colleges in the world--in the world. No one else comes close to us. We have done all these things--including building up our national defense. There is no other military in any country that parallels ours or matches our strength. 
So it is time for us to understand a bit about what we have 
built, that this is a remarkable achievement. 
Where do we go from here? We can undercut all of those achievements and weaken this country substantially if we don't balance our budget. I agree with that. We ought to balance the Federal budget. I will say this, that I am one of those in 1993 who cast a very controversial vote, and the vote cut spending and increased some taxes. It carried by one single vote, and since that time, the unified budget deficit is down 60 percent. 
I am pleased I did it. Was it an easy vote? No. The political vote would have been to say, `No, I don't want to do any heavy hitting.' I did it because it was the right thing for this country. Controversial, yes, but right. We made some progress in reducing the Federal budget deficit, but it is not enough, and we must do more to balance the budget. The debate will be about changing the Constitution to balance the budget. 
Let me say that I am someone who will support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Do I think it is a great choice? No, not necessarily, but do I think it probably is a reasonable choice, given the need for fiscal policy discipline in our country? Yes. But I insist that it be done the right way, not the wrong way. 
I have been in the room where they wrote the Constitution of the United States, and for those who want to visit it, George Washington's chair still sits in front of the room. Fifty-five of them wrote a Constitution over 200 years ago. Some here think it is a rough draft. Every second day they want to make a change in the Constitution. I, frankly, don't see a lot of folks who can represent Madisons, Masons, or Franklins these days. So if we are going to change the Constitution, we need to think it through. 
We are going to have a proposition on the floor of the Senate that says, let us amend the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget. And it says that for describing when a budget is in balance, all spending and all revenue will be considered to determine whether the budget is in balance. 
The dilemma with that is this: In 1983 this country recognized it was going to have a difficult time with Social Security in the long term because America was growing older and there were going to be more people retiring relative to people working to support them in Social Security. So we decided that we would do something different for a change. We would begin saving in the Social Security system. In other words, each year taking in more in Social Security revenue than we need to expend, and that money would then be saved so that when the baby boomers retire after the turn of the century, we could more easily afford to pay them the benefits they will have earned. 
I was involved in that decision. I was on the House Ways and Means Committee, and I cast a vote in support of that legislation. But the decision was not to increase payroll taxes and accrue a body of savings so that someday later somebody can misuse it to claim they balanced the budget with Social Security trust funds. That is not what we said. We said, let's increase savings so that savings will be available after the turn of the century. 
When you describe a balanced budget proposal that says let's take Social Security trust funds and throw them over here to use the surplus to show we balanced the budget, I want to show you what happens. What happens is the very year in which the budget is balanced, according to the majority that is supporting this constitutional amendment, the very year in which they claim the budget of the United States is in balance, Federal debt will rise in that year by nearly $130 billion. 
Question: If the Federal debt is increasing by $130 billion in a year, is the budget in balance? If the budget is in balance, why would one have to increase the Federal debt? 
Answer: Because the budget isn't in balance. They pretend it is in balance, they say it is in balance, but they use the Social Security dedicated trust funds to make it look like it is in balance, but it is not. The Federal debt will continue to increase. 
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has put out a report that I hope my colleagues will read. In it they describe exactly this dilemma. The constitutional amendment that is going to be debated, and I will address this matter again during that debate, is an amendment that offers no choice. It says we will take the Social Security trust funds and use them as an offset for other revenue and claim we balanced the budget, when we really have not. 
We will give our Senate colleagues an opportunity to vote on another constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It is one that does it the right way. It says let us balance the budget. Let us require in the Constitution that we balance the budget. But let us do it exclusive of the Social Security trust funds because we promised that we would save those trust funds for the future when they are needed. 
This publication by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities describes chapter and verse of exactly what is happening in this area. I have heard people come to the floor and say, `Oh, what a bunch of prattle that is. What a bunch of nonsense, these folks worried about Social Security.' Well, it is not prattle, and it is not nonsense. 
We had a column by Mr. Krauthammer in the Washington Post last week. It is the third column he has written on this subject. In it he says essentially what he has said before. He says, there is no Social Security trust fund. There is no Social Security trust fund. 
Let me suggest a tour to him in Parkersburg, WV, where, under armed guard, the bonds that are the securities of the Social Security trust fund exist. It would not be too long a drive for him to go on up there and take a look at those bonds. 
He is wrong. There is a Social Security trust fund. The dilemma is that there will not be anything there of meaning unless we decide to make the right choice here. 
Mr. Krauthammer also says that Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. He must have missed 1983, because in 1983 it was decided that it will be more than a pay-as-you-go system. It was decided in 1983 that we would collect more money than is necessary in current years, specifically in order to accrue a surplus. Social Security is more than a pay-as-you-go system. So, when Mr. Krauthammer says it is pay-as-you-go, he clearly does not understand the law and clearly does not understand what the Congress did to save some money. 
Let me read for him and for others something from the 1983 commission on Social Security because they described exactly the plan. This is a quote by commission member Robert Ball in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee talking about separating the Social Security system from the operating budget.  
Only by such a separation can it be made unmistakably clear that Social Security decisions are being made for reasons internal to [Social Security] and not for the purpose of making a unified budget look better. Since Social Security funds can be used only for Social Security benefits and to pay for the cost of administration, I believe that separation is also better accounting practice. 
The point is, the increase in taxes and the other things that were necessary to accrue this surplus in Social Security will all be obliterated by a decision to enshrine in the Constitution a practice of misusing the Social Security trust funds. 
Mr. Krauthammer does not like this problem. He says, well, this debate is without substance. I can only say that his argument is without substance. He is flat, dead wrong on this issue, demonstrably wrong. And he ought to know it. The minimum amount of research would tell him that. 
The same is true of colleagues here who have taken three lines of defense offered at different times by different people. 
One will pop up like one of these little carnival games and will say, `Well, first of all, there is no Social Security trust fund,' and make a long, windy argument about it, and then sit down. 
Then someone else will pop up at another moment and say, `All right, there is a Social Security trust fund, but we are not misusing the money,' and then vanish. 
Then a day later someone else will pop up and say, `All right, there is a Social Security trust fund, and we are misusing the money, and we pledge to stop doing it by the year 2008.' 
Those are the three stages of denial I have heard on the floor of the Senate, all from supporters of a constitutional amendment 
that would enshrine in the Constitution the practice of taking Social Security trust funds, using them as an offset against other revenue, and claiming you have balanced the budget at the same time that the Federal debt will increase by $130 billion the year they claim the budget is in balance. 
There is a way to solve this. A way to solve it is to vote for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not use or misuse the Social Security trust funds. I will offer it, along with my colleagues, Senator Reid, Senator Hollings, Senator Ford, Senator Feinstein, and others, and we will give people an opportunity to say, `Yes, I support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but when we do it, let us make sure we really balance the budget.' 
Let us make sure we keep the promise of accruing the surpluses in the Social Security trust fund and make sure that no one is able to misuse the Social Security trust fund in the future. 
Mr. President, there will be much more to discuss on this subject. I wanted to make note of the piece that Mr. Krauthammer did because it is the third time that he has essentially written the same piece, misunderstanding the issue in this country. 
Everybody has a right to be wrong. I do not quarrel with that. 
I just say that someone got up this morning and went to work. That person will work hard all day, and then collect a paycheck and discover that part of that paycheck is taken away first. The part taken away is called Social Security taxes, and it is promised by the Government to the worker that the amount of money we took from your paycheck is going to be put in a fund, and it is a fund dedicated for one purpose, Social Security. That worker does not deserve to have someone in Congress now say, `Oh, but we changed our mind. That's the premise under which we took it from you, but we're using it for another purpose.' That is precisely what is happening today. I think we ought to stop it. There is a way to stop it when we have these votes in the coming days or weeks. 
We can amend the Constitution the right way, or we can, as is usually the wont around here, mess around some more, talk and talk some more, and claim and claim some more that we have really done something worthy and meritorious and have balanced the budget, and then have some constituent stand up in a town meeting some night, somewhere, and ask you, `Mr. Senator, if you balanced the budget, why did my son or daughter just inherit a Federal debt that went up $130 billion this year?' I want to be in the room with a microphone to record the response because there is not a response that is adequate. 
What our constituents should expect from us is that we balance the budget the right way and that we amend the Constitution the right way. I hope at the end of this debate this Senate and this Congress will have determined to do that. 
It is not just a few Democrats who believe this is a serious problem. Several dozen Republicans over in the House of Representatives, some of whom I have talked to, make exactly the same case in the House of Representatives. So it is not a one-sided issue. We have Republicans and Democrats who believe that there is a right way and a wrong way to do things. Some of us are going to insist that when we do something as significant as amending the U.S. Constitution that finally we do it the right way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DORGAN. I was interested in the Senator's statement. He, I think, identifies one of the priorities of many of us in this Congress. If we do not make an investment in education of America's youth then the country does not have much of a future. I am enormously proud of what we have done in the investment in the Head Start Program, for example. This does not start in grade school or high school or college. It starts in the early intervention years with Head Start. The Head Start Program we know works. It produces enormous dividends. It gradually improves the opportunity of young people who come from difficult circumstances. 
But one of the things that it seems to me we should invest in is safe schools. First of all, if the school is not safe and the students feel insecure, they cannot learn. And the other ingredient is a teacher who knows how to teach--a good teacher, a student willing to learn, and a parent who cares. If any one of those are missing, it does not work very well. 
But let us talk about the safe school issue first. The Senator from New Mexico I know heard me describe on the floor a bill which I introduced late last year on this issue. If I might, with the indulgence of the Senator from New Mexico, I would like to describe again a circumstance that exists that I am trying to correct dealing with safe schools in New York City. 
A young boy came into a school with a loaded pistol in his belt and a jacket covering his loaded pistol. He went through the school, walked down the hallway to his classroom, and a security guard identified or saw the bulge in the young 16-year-old's jacket and apprehended this young boy and took a loaded pistol from this young fellow. A loaded pistol with this young fellow walking down the school hallway; the security guard removes it. It goes to court and goes to a disciplinary proceeding. The result of it all was that the court said the exclusionary rule applied to the disciplinary proceeding and the security guard had no right to search that kid and take the gun away. 
When I read that I thought, `Can this be right? Could anybody use that kind of strange thinking to conceive of that kind of decision?' 
You go to the airport and get on a plane going to New Mexico or North Dakota. They will run you through a metal detector 
because they say, `You can't get on an airplane with a gun. We will not allow it.' But it is OK to go through a school hallway to a classroom with a loaded pistol with a 16-year-old. I do not think so. That does not make any sense to me. 
So I introduced legislation dealing with that issue. The exclusionary rule, my eye. A 16-year-old and a loaded pistol--I want a security guard to take that pistol away in a schoolroom because my kids and yours and all of the kids in this country deserve to be safe in school. 
That is the first element: Safety in school. 
The second is what the Senator from New Mexico is talking about: Directing investment into programs that we know work and we know yield significant returns. He talked about good teachers, and the President talked about attracting and keeping good teachers in our classrooms. Nothing could be more important than that because we send our kids to someone else most of the day. We place them in their hands. I have been in a school that the Senator from New Mexico has. He knows some of these teachers. I leave that school thinking, `Wow, this is an incredible person. What a job they do with these young kids.' There are times when perhaps you find something that you think isn't quite right. The President addressed that last night. 
But the key, it seems to me, is matching the three things: First, a teacher who really knows how to teach; a kid who is willing to learn; and a parent who cares about that kid's education and is with that kid at the end of the day before they go to bed at night, reviewing the homework. All of those elements come together to make an educational system work. 
But the Senator from New Mexico is right. We need in this country at the State and local level and at the Federal level to decide that the education of our children is a priority for us because educating our children is an investment in our country's future. 
I really appreciate the statement which the Senator from New Mexico made.

Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, Mr. President, I was in a school recently called the Ojibwa School on an Indian reservation in North Dakota. When the Senator from New Mexico talks about construction, the President last evening talked about our trying to provide help to State and local governments with respect to school construction. I can tell you that in the Ojibwa School, and others that I have visited, there is a significant need for some construction, some maintenance, and some repair. I worry very much that these little kids on that Indian reservation going to this school are going to be in significant trouble some day because the repairs have not been made. That school is not a safe school. We have report after report and investigation after investigation. Now we have another one going on. But we very much need to invest in the infrastructure of these schools. 
The Senator from New Mexico is right. We do not run the schools, and should not. Local school boards should run the local schools, and the States are involved largely in the State judgments about what the curriculum is, and so on. But we can marginally help in a range of other ways and do Head Start and college. We also can help in the kinds of things the President recommended in providing some resources for school construction in areas where you need to have some additional construction to repair and bring up to standard some of our schools. 
Again, I say finally, the question around here is always a question of choices: What is your priority? 
Two years ago, I was on this floor talking about the strange sense I had when I looked at a budget document offered and actually passed--it was subsequently vetoed--which said let us double the amount of money we spend for star wars and let us cut by half the amount of money we spend for Star Schools. Star Schools was not a very big program, but it was a really interesting program--directed investment to try to help certain people. I just thought that was a strange priority. But the priority I hope for all of us is to find some way to advance the opportunity to improve our schools in this country for the future of this country. 
I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico yielding.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I noticed in the newspapers this morning that the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee is suggesting that he be given some $6.8 million to hire some 80 investigators on the issue of investigating campaign irregularities, apparently including the ones that are in the paper about the Democratic National Committee, and more. 
It seems to me the first step in dealing with the issue of irregularities in campaigns--and if there are some, they ought to be investigated--the first step would be to give the Federal Election Commission some teeth. Invest a little bit in the Federal Election Commission and give it some teeth, and let them investigate. But if we are going to investigate in Congress, if we are going to have a group of politicians investigating another group of politicians, I don't think we need $6.8 million to do that. But if they decide to do that, I have a suggestion: Go ahead and rent a truck and back it up to whatever house--the Republican National Committee or the 
Democratic National Committee--and I hope all of them will encourage their minions to load up all the relevant paper and let people read it to see who did what, who didn't do what and who didn't comply with laws and who did comply with laws. 
But it ought to be more than that. The trail of trouble, it seems to me, in campaign financing isn't just in the national committees--and there are some problems in both national committees. One fellow went to jail already earlier this year on the issue on the other side of the aisle. There are plenty of questions on this side of the aisle with respect to the DNC. 
Let's find out where the trouble was and correct it. But that is not the only place there is trouble on the campaign trail. Let's also investigate the growth of these 501(c)(3) organizations that some in politics have created to get tax-exempt money and use it in the political system. Let's follow that string wherever that leads. 
In my judgment, there are a substantial number of questions that need to be addressed by investigators in that whole range of areas. Once we start down this trail, let's make sure we follow the fresh trail all the way to the end, not just take a look at one little building or another little building. Let's look at all of it. 
I say to those who are concerned about it--and I am concerned about it--the first step ought to be for us to come to the floor of the Senate--we could do it this afternoon or early next week--and decide there is too much money in politics and we ought to limit campaign spending. 
The Supreme Court says that is hard to do, but there are mechanisms by which we could do it. If Republicans and Democrats decided to create a system in which there were voluntary spending limitations, we would limit spending in campaigns, and we would solve a lot of these problems. 
We have some folks trotting around here who think there is not enough money in politics. They say we spend more money on washing machines and dog food than we do on politics, suggesting somehow that politics is a commercial activity like everything else, just buy and sell. 
Our political system is our democracy. It ought not be for sale. What has happened to money in politics is that it has ratcheted up out of control in an exponential way, and it is time for us to put some limits on campaign spending. Let's limit campaign spending, and let's make it stick. There is too much money in politics, and we can do the American democratic system and the American public a real service if we would, on a bipartisan basis, decide to come together and support campaign finance reform that has real and effective spending limits. 
Yes, it can be done and it ought to be done today, tomorrow, next week or next month. We do not need $6 million or 80 investigators to do that. All we need is the will to decide there is too much money in American politics and we ought to limit campaign spending. 
Take a look at what has happened with campaign spending relative to the consumer price index in this country. You will see the consumer price index has risen a bit and campaign spending has risen out of sight. There is too much money in politics, and we ought to adopt a bill that the President will sign that limits spending in our political system. 
Some won't like that, I suppose. We have one party that spends twice as much as another party. I suppose they would say, `We have a 2-to-1 advantage, so why would we want to do that?' 
We ought to do it to clean up the political system. The fact is, there have been abuses on both sides. Any abuse ought to be investigated, and we ought to investigate it thoroughly. Let's not take one little cause of abuses and say, `All right, let's drive our trucks over there and send all our investigators over there.' Let's look at all the whole thing. Let's look at 501(c)(3)'s using tax exemption and trying to contravene the law. Let's find out how they have done it, why they have done it, and what laws they have broken. If we are going to have an investigation, we ought to open that investigation, make it aggressive and don't limit the vision.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to have a vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget very soon. Some discussion on the floor of the Senate in the last day or so said that those of us who believe that when we put a provision in the Constitution requiring a balanced budget, we ought not enshrine in the Constitution the requirement to use the Social Security trust funds to balance the budget, because we think it is dishonest budgeting. They say, those of us who believe that, that is an accounting gimmick; just an accounting gimmick, they say. 
There are two to three dozen folks over in the House of Representatives now, I am pleased to say, on the Republican side who are saying exactly what some of us have been saying for some long while, that it is not honest budgeting to collect money from paychecks of workers, call it Social Security taxes, tell them we promise we will put it in a trust fund, and then use it as an offset for other revenue so you can claim the budget is in 
balance when it isn't. 
To those who say this is an accounting gimmick, I ask one question: Why is it that when those who want to use this device of misusing Social Security trust funds to balance the budget, why is it when their budget is balanced, the Federal Government will still borrow $130 billion more that year? Why, if your budget is in balance, is the Federal debt still growing? 
The answer: The debt is still growing when those who advocate this practice claim the budget is in balance because the budget is not in balance. It is a ruse. It is a charade. More than that, it is misusing money that if you did it in the private sector, you would be on your way to some minimum security installation, because you can't do it in the private sector. 
If you run a business and say to your employees, `I will put money away in a pension program for you, but, by the way, I had a loss in my business this year so I am going to take your pension money and offset it against my loss so I can say to people that I haven't lost any money,' what happens to you isn't very pretty, because that is against the law. 
That is exactly what is proposed we enshrine in the Constitution, by saying that we should take the Social Security trust funds and declare them revenue with all other revenue and then declare that we have balanced the budget. 
In the same year when we declare we have balanced the budget, we will have to increase the debt limit because the debt is still increasing. And when the folks in North Dakota or Wyoming or New Mexico or elsewhere ask us the question, `If you have balanced the budget, why did you have to increase the debt limit?' I want to be around for the answer, because the answer is, the budget was not balanced. 
I think fiscal discipline is a pretty good thing. I come from a small town, a small school, a small State. We believe in fiscal discipline. I am pleased I have been one of those who cast votes to reduce the Federal budget. The deficit is down 60 percent in the last 4 years. The last 4 years in a row it has been down. I cast tough votes to do that. 
I will continue to do that. I will cast a vote in the coming weeks to support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But I will not cast a vote that puts something in the Constitution that is wrong. And it is fundamentally wrong to suggest that we take that balance of trust funds every year and use it to balance the budget. 
In 1983, I was on the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Greenspan, at that point, headed a commission to make recommendations on Social Security funding. The commission recommended that we begin to accumulate a pool of savings so that when the baby boomers retire, there will be some money in the Social Security system to pay for their retirement. That is going to be the maximum strain on the Social Security system. 
So we began to accumulate a surplus this year. We will collect $70 billion more in Social Security than we spend from that same system. Why? Because we designed to save that. 
I will ask any of my colleagues on the floor whether double-entry bookkeeping means you can spend it twice. Can you claim you are saving it when in fact you use it over here with ordinary revenue and claim you use it to balance the budget? The answer is `no'. There is no study, no set of studies in this country, that allows you to make that claim. 
That is why, when we have a vote on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we will vote on two of them. One I will vote for and offer along with colleagues, and one I will oppose. That is the one that says, let us enshrine in the Constitution a practice that I think is fundamentally dishonest budgeting. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one issue I want to visit is the need to reauthorize the ISTEA program or the highway program in this country. It is important for States like North Dakota. 
I notice the Senator from Alaska is on the floor. He will, I am sure, have the same feelings about this that I have. We are large States in land mass, small States in population. We have a need to construct a network of highways still across our States for interstate commerce and for a whole range of needs, but we have a very small tax base with which to do it. 
We have seen developed in this discussion who are the donor States and who are the donee States with respect to highway moneys. Well, that is largely irrelevant to me. If they want to ship fresh fruit and frozen fish from Boston to Seattle, do they want to ship them on gravel roads through North Dakota and Wyoming? I do not think so. We want to maintain and develop a National Highway System that works for everybody. That means that we need, as small States in the debate on this highway system, fairness for the highway needs for our States. 
I will just say that as we work through this debate in the coming weeks and months, those of us who come from States like North Dakota and Wyoming and Alaska and others are going to be working very hard to make sure that we are treated fairly in this reauthorization. Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Daschle and others in reintroducing legislation to bring much-needed tax relief to family farmers and ranchers whose businesses have suffered from unduly harsh weather conditions in the Upper Midwest this winter. 
Livestock producers in North Dakota and other States in the Northern Plains have been facing unusually extreme conditions during this winter. North Dakota has experienced at least a half-dozen blizzards, winds of up to 50 miles per hour, and wind chills of near 80 below zero. 
Our livestock producers have had great difficulty in moving snow and keeping paths open to both feed and livestock. Our interstate highways have been closed seven times this winter so it is easy to imagine the difficulties that our rural people have had in keeping township roads open and usable. 
Some are beginning to compare this winter to the infamous winter of 1886 which nearly wiped out the cattle industry on the Northern Plains. That was the year in which Teddy Roosevelt lost his cattle herd on his ranch in the North Dakota badlands. 
When this winter is over, we will be able to make some judgments as to whether this winter will be another of those history-making times which will haunt the memories of another generation of farmers and ranchers in the Dakotas. 
But right now, we need to do everything possible to ease the burdens that our livestock producers are facing. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has been working very hard to get workable programs to help producers get to their livestock and feed. They have also been working on the longer range problem of helping ranchers and farmers with the extra feed supplies that are needed to get these cattle through the winter. 
While USDA has had some problems in getting those programs on the ground, we certainly appreciate the Department's efforts especially when we consider the limited tools that are currently available to them. It should be noted that the Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance program that would normally have been available for such a situation was suspended by the 1996 farm law. This has put USDA in a position of having very limited resources and authorities for this emergency. 
Compounding the problems of our livestock producers have been the very low cattle prices that have come from a combination of being at the bottom of a cattle pricing cycle together with record levels of concentration in the marketplace. 
Our producers have had a hard time maintaining their herds even without this winter emergency. That is why it is extremely important that we help them through this time period. 
Some of our producers are making the choice to either sell their cattle altogether or reduce the size of their herd, rather than to continue to maintain them at high costs and high risk. 
Unfortunately our current tax laws hinder such sales in the case of most weather-related disasters except for drought. If a farmer or rancher is forced to sell cattle or other livestock prematurely this winter, they will be burdened with a large tax bill. There is no provision at present for tax deferral of gains on involuntary conversions of livestock for severe winter conditions. The Tax Code allows for such deferrals only for drought conditions. 
In the last session of Congress, I cosponsored legislation with Senator Daschle that would have expanded this tax provision to respond to a variety of severe weather conditions. 
Our legislation would allow a farmer or rancher to defer paying taxes on the proceeds of an involuntary sale of livestock due to severe weather-related emergencies if he reinvests the proceeds in similar property down the road. A farmer or rancher who decides not to reinvest the proceeds under these circumstances may elect to report the proceeds from the sale on the next year's tax return. This legislation, which is supported by the Administration, builds upon similar provisions in the Tax Code which is provided in the case of forced livestock sales due to drought. 
Initial estimates following the January 10th blizzard across our State indicated that about 2,000 livestock producers were selling nearly 35,000 additional cattle as a result of that storm. The weekly reports from the North Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service indicate that cattle sales continue to be more than 20 percent above normal in the State. 
This legislation will give these producers an additional tool in managing their operations so that these involuntary conversions do not impose additional financial hardships upon them. 
Again I am pleased to once again cosponsor this legislation with Senator Daschle to help our producers meet the unusual conditions of this winter. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, America's family farmers and ranchers deserve a high priority in the legislative agenda of this new Congress. The families who produce our daily food and help feed a hungry world, have not been on the center stage here in the Nation's Capitol. They deserve our attention and our concern. 
The 7-year farm bill that was passed in the last session of Congress is an economic disaster in the making for rural America. All that needs to happen is for mother nature to bless us with abundant crops, and farm prices will once again fall. Under that new farm law, there is no safety net for our nation's farm and ranch families, who provide the economic base of rural America. 
That is why I could not support that legislation. That is why President Clinton was very reluctant about signing this bill into law. If you remember, he only did so because further delay of the farm bill would have created planning chaos for farmers as they prepared for and began their spring's work last year. 
In the closing debates of the farm bill, I said that we would have to come back to this issue when farm prices fall as they inevitably do. Well, the glow of high grain prices has faded and the reality of increased production costs has come home to hundreds of thousands of farm families. 
It is time to consider what responsibility we as a nation have to those who grow our daily food. 
It was important that on the very first day for the introduction of legislation in the 105th session, that we paid attention to agriculture. It is not only the key economic sector in rural America, but also continues to be the single largest industry in our Nation. 
I am pleased that the minority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, introduced two bills that day as part of his leadership package to deal directly with the problems facing our family farmers and ranchers. I am proud to be a cosponsor on both bills.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while the Senator from Iowa is here, I wanted to comment on some remarks he made at the start of his presentation. 
As the Presiding Officer and other Members may know, Senator Grassley and I have cosponsored and introduced last week a piece of legislation dealing with this current Internal Revenue Service problem on the alternative minimum tax that is going to affect a lot of farmers in our part of the country. 
I agree with the Senator from Iowa that the news that came out of the Internal Revenue Service this morning is indeed good news. The Internal Revenue Service, this morning, has indicated that it will, in effect, not enforce in 1996 a provision that it was intending to enforce, which we believe is a misinterpretation of tax law. What IRS was intending to do, in effect, on the alternative minimum tax was to force a number of family farmers to pay taxes on income they have not yet received. 
We do not believe Congress ever intended for that kind of enforcement to occur, or for that interpretation of tax law to exist. We think the IRS was wrong. 
The Senator from Iowa and I have repeatedly contacted the administration. I have visited with the Secretary of the Treasury and others to make this case. But, in any event, on a bipartisan basis, as the Senator from Iowa and I introduced legislation with 54 cosponsors--the Republican leader the Democratic leader are on the bill--it is clear, or would have been clear, it seems to me, to the IRS and Treasury that this legislation will pass in this Congress and in effect say to the IRS that your interpretation of the law is wrong. 
I think the IRS has, to its credit, understood now that to enforce in this year and put a fair number of farmers at risk--asking them to pay taxes on income they have not yet received--would be really a travesty of justice. The IRS today has taken the position that they will allow farmers to file tax returns in 1996 as they have in the past with respect to deferred contract commodity sales. And I commend them for taking that position. 
I appreciate the cooperation of the IRS and the Treasury Secretary on this issue. It is the right thing to do. It is what the Senator from Iowa and I and others have been advocating they do. 
So we have made some incremental progress today. That ought to be good news for farmers who have been worried about this issue of how the IRS will enforce and treat and audit the deferred contract commodity sales. 
I just wanted to follow the remarks of the Senator from Iowa to say that I am pleased to work with him on it. It is an example of a bipartisan effort to fix a problem, and we have at least gone part of the way to fix this problem.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Proctor Jones for his outstanding service and dedication to the U.S. Senate since 1960. While his Senate employment was interrupted for 2 years for service in the U.S. Marine Corps, I don't believe any staffer has served in the Senate longer than Proctor. Certainly, no one has served this institution more honorably or with greater dedication. 
During my tenure in the Senate, I have had the pleasure of working with Proctor on numerous occasions in his capacity as the staff director for the Democrats on the Energy and Water Subcommittee of Appropriations. Unfortunately, my State of North Dakota seems to be plagued with too little water or too much. Proctor was fully conversant with and sensitive to the unique needs of North Dakota and was always ready to assist us with our water problems. He was especially helpful to me over the past 3 years in finding additional funding to help the citizens of Devils Lake, N.D., who have been devastated by flooding for 4 consecutive years. 
Proctor represents the finest there is in public service. He was dedicated to the institution he so honorably served under a succession of outstanding chairmen of the Appropriations Committee. He was ever the student of the budget and appropriation processes. He was the master of the art of politics--forging compromises. He was the protector of the purse--evaluating Federal programs under a microscope to ensure that they were necessary, effective, responsible, and responsive. He was the ultimate professional. And he was a true gentleman. 
During his more than 35 years in the Senate, Proctor earned the respect of Members and colleagues alike. His expertise, sound judgment, political skills and professional talents will be sorely missed in the Senate. But I want to join my colleagues in wishing Proctor good health and every success as he joins his former boss, Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, in pursuing new challenges and opportunities in the private sector.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today the agricultural statistical folks who have been doing surveys in the Dakotas have told us that the winter storms--successive, bitter, awful winter storms that have hit one after another--in our State have killed somewhere around 13,000 cattle in North Dakota. It has been a rugged difficult time for North Dakotans and for livestock producers in our State. 
I spoke the other day about the kind of bitter storms that we face, almost unlike any that most of us in North Dakota can remember. And again, within the last 24 hours, another storm has hit. Both interstate highways, the east-west highway in North Dakota and the north-south highway, were closed down completely. Snow, 50-mile-an-hour winds, and bitterly cold temperatures make this an awfully difficult time for North Dakotans. 
Thousands and thousands of volunteers in North Dakota have responded to the crisis. And the Federal Government has too. President Clinton has declared that our entire State is suffering from a major disaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is in North Dakota. They are rounding up heavy equipment from around the country to come and help us open roads to help protect the lives of people and the livestock herds. 
The Department of Agriculture has provided some feed assistance and some other aid to try to help producers get to their cattle and feed them. So we have had some help. But we need more. And today we are going to be visiting with the Department of Agriculture once again because the assistance they have offered so far--feed assistance for livestock--is simply too narrowly drawn to be of very much help to anybody. It is of help to some but it is just too narrow. 
It is interesting. In the last Congress when the freedom to farm bill was passed these emergency feed programs were abolished. I thought it was the wrong thing to do. And it was. But they were abolished. Now we have gotten the Department of Agriculture to try to jury-rig an emergency approach to try to give us some help. But they need to broaden that substantially so the livestock producers--farmers and ranchers out there, many of whom have been operating on very thin margins anyway--have the capability of getting their roads open, getting the feed in, and feeding their herds. 
We really do need some help not just in North Dakota but in our whole region of the country. 
So we are going to be visiting with the Department of Agriculture again this afternoon to try to broaden this approach to see if we can't get some help in there. Mr. President, 13,000 cattle have died in North Dakota. Many more are at great risk because they have survived five or six blizzards now and are hit with another at the moment. We expect other storms. So this is a very difficult problem. 
I spoke the other day about the heroes in our part of the country during this difficult winter, and talked about going out on a snowplow with a crew in conditions in which you couldn't see 2 feet in front of you; nearly whiteout conditions with 50-mile-an-hour winds, bitterly cold; going up by a trailer court where you could not see any trailer houses because even their roofs were not to be seen; 
snow was over the roof line. Conditions were about as difficult as they could get, and yet people made an emergency run to help get a 2-year-old boy, about whom I talked the other day, to a hospital who would have died had he not gotten there, a 20-mile trip that took 6 hours with four people driving two ambulances, two snowplows and two trucks plowing through roads that were impassable, in zero visibility conditions, with 40- and 50-mile-an-hour winds. The people who do that are public servants out there to whom we owe a great debt of gratitude and who are really truly heroes. 
I also wanted to mention another fellow in North Dakota who I think deserves mention because when we have these tough times it is not just the program that is put in place to help people; it is the people who help people, neighbors coming together and doing things to help each other. 
On Tuesday night this week, at 10 o'clock in the evening, Jan Novak was driving home, having just finished her work, in Grafton, ND. As Jan Novak was driving home--and that was a point when the blizzard was hitting and the interstates were being closed and giant winds were coming up--she lost her way and could not see much in front of her. She had to pull off the road and became stuck in a snowbank. 
And there she was in the middle of this raging blizzard. This was just Tuesday evening of this week. 
She did say she had blankets and she had some gas. She was not feeling that she maybe would not be found. She felt that she would be able to hold out, and she started her car intermittently in the terribly cold weather, but then she worried about whether her car was going to start just based on the sounds from her engine. 
Her husband called the Walsh County Sheriff, Lauren Wild, about 1 o'clock in the morning, and the sheriff tried to get some people out to take a look to see where she was. They tried to search the road she might have taken to go home out in the country from Grafton, ND, and they searched for several hours, and in conditions of almost no visibility and could not find Jan Novak, who was then out there stuck in the car. 
And they also called people along the route. They called a fellow named Halvorson, Don Halvorson, at 3:30 in the morning--he is a farmer--got him out of bed, woke him up and told him that there was a woman lost along this route and they could not seem to find her. Of course, Don Halvorson had not seen her, nor had anyone else passing along the way, and because nobody could see the roads they eventually had to call off the search. 
Don Halvorson could not sleep, he said. So at 3:30 in the morning, after having gone back to bed and not being able sleep, he got up, put his clothes on and went out in the yard and started his tractor, which had a cab on it, and went out to look. And with the tractor, in conditions of almost zero visibility, for 3 hours he searched up and down his road and up and down his area of the country, and somewhere around 6:30 in the morning this fellow named Don Halvorson, in his tractor, pulled up to Jan Novak's car. And he got out of the tractor and rescued her, took her back to his home. She says that he is a true hero, and he said he just could not sleep knowing there was somebody out in that storm. 
It is interesting to me that these stories of people helping each other seem to get so little attention. This one did get a little attention. But bad news travels halfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on, they say, and I understand that. But there are wonderful stories of people who cannot sleep when something is wrong and who want to go out and help other people. 
In our part of the country, and I expect in the part of the country that is represented by the Presiding Officer, we face some pretty difficult times. And the only way you get along is to work with each other, neighbors helping neighbors, folks helping folks. Don Halvorson could have gone back to sleep, I suppose. He did not know where Jan Novak was. He did not know Jan Novak. Instead, he got up, put on his clothes, got in his tractor in bitterly cold weather, with raging wind and zero visibility, and risked his life to go search for a woman stranded in the blizzard whose life was also at risk. 
Even as I talked today about the need for some help from the Department of Agriculture for livestock feed and for ranchers and farmers out there who are struggling, I also wanted to pay homage to some heroes who are out there. Some are on road crews today working shift after shift. Some are also in farmhouses helping neighbors get along in about as difficult a winter as I can remember in the history of North Dakota. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator Grassley and I are introducing legislation called the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act. This legislation deals with a tax matter affecting farmers that is a foreign subject to some people. But, simplified, what has happened is the Internal Revenue Service has turned logic on its head and said to family farmers, `We're going to ask you to pay taxes on income you have not yet received.' There is no basis for them doing that. That is not what we ever intended them to do. 
It is not the way they interpreted the law previously or the instructions for IRS auditors and accountants all across the country or farmers across the country, but they have now decided to change the way they do business. The brain is apparently disconnected from the hand, and the hand writes that farmers should pay taxes on income they have not received. 
I introduced the first piece of legislation on this. The Senator from Washington pointed out it was introduced in the House. But 18 months before it was introduced in the House in the last Congress, I introduced legislation to try to correct this. 
When we introduced it today, Senator Grassley from Iowa and I have organized a group of 54 Senators who support this legislation, including the cosponsorship of the Republican leader and the Democratic leader, including the support of the Treasury Secretary and of the agricultural community. 
We are going to pass this. It ought not be necessary for us to pass this legislation, because the IRS should not have made the mistake it made. It should not have turned logic on its head. But we must pass it because in this country when the IRS makes a mistake, everybody pays. Somebody once said, `You have a right to be wrong in America.' But the IRS does not have that right. When they are wrong in this case, family farmers are going to have to pay unfairly. And we are going to change that. 
Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senator Grassley and a majority of our colleagues in the Senate in reintroducing my legislation to rectify a serious tax problem confronting our family farmers. 
The Internal Revenue Service [IRS] has, in my opinion, mistakenly taken a position that threatens to hit many farmers with huge tax bills for using deferred payment commodity contracts, which have been routinely used in their businesses for decades. In my judgment, the IRS's position is dead-wrong and is going to impose an unintended and unacceptable financial hardship on the farming industry. 
For years, family farmers have used deferred payment contracts to sell their commodities in order to better manage their business income. For example, a typical grain contract between a farmer and grain elevator calls upon a farmer to sell and deliver grain to a grain elevator--often because the farmer does not have adequate storage--for a fixed amount. In many cases, one or more payments paid by the elevator to the farmer under the contract occur after the close of the farmer's taxable year. 
For regular tax purposes, farmers are allowed to defer income from the deferred payments under the grain contracts in computing their regular tax liability. But because the IRS apparently now views all deferred payment grain contracts as installment sales, it now requires them to add back this income in computing the Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT] in the tax year preceding the year of payment. As a result, thousands of family farmers are potentially facing hefty tax bills because they are being whip-sawed by a new IRS policy which effectively repeals their ability to use such contracts, and to benefit from the cash basis method of accounting. 
To make matters worse, many farmers were advised by tax experts and IRS field representatives, for that matter, that some traditional deferred payment commodity contracts will not amount to an installment sale that would require an AMT calculation. For this reason, many farmers have not made AMT adjustments on their income tax returns. Now they are being told by the IRS that they may owe large tax bills on income that they will not receive until later. This position is based upon an incorrect interpretation by the IRS which ignores the fact that our family farmers are, by law, permitted to manage their business operations on a cash basis. 
That's why we are reintroducing my legislation from the last Congress to ensure that our family farmers are allowed to engage in deferred payment transactions and get the same kind of tax treatment they have always received. 
We do not believe that Congress intended this kind of tax treatment for farmers using deferred payment commodity contracts for legitimate business purposes. Moreover, Treasury Department officials, who agree that this misguided IRS position was likely not the intent of Congress, support the goals of this effort as `reasonable tax policy, and * * * welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to address this matter through corrective legislation.' 
Our bill simply makes clear the original intent of Congress which is to allow farmers to continue to receive the tax benefit provided from the use of cash method accounting and from installment sales for their deferred payment transactions. 
I urge my colleagues to include this much-needed legislation--which is strongly supported by the agricultural community--in any revenue measure considered by the Senate this year. This measure needs to be considered quickly to resolve any lingering doubt about the correct tax treatment for farmers using deferred commodity contracts.

 Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we begin a new session of Congress, I thought this would be an appropriate time to stop for a moment and reflect upon some of the sacrifices that have been made by our citizens to ensure the protection of liberty and democracy in this great Nation. One group of citizens comes immediately to mind--the Gold Star Mothers. 
This organization was formed in the years following the end World War I. It is a nonprofit, nonpolitical group which was organized by 25 mothers in June 1928 and incorporated on January 5, 1929. The cost of membership is incalculable. To join, one must have lost a son or daughter during a war waged by the United States. 
As a parent myself, I know from personal experience that there is nothing more costly that losing a child. To raise and nurture a son or daughter, instilling in them the aspirations and goals that are only achieved through a long and full life, and then to having their lives cut short is a tragic and devastating blow to any parent. The pain never goes away. It is a pain that Gold Star Mothers live with every day. 
What is remarkable about this group of courageous women is that they refused to allow their grief to become the victor. Instead, they chose to channel their pain and suffering into productive work to benefit veterans and the community at large. 
In 1940, Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt recognized their tireless efforts on behalf of veterans and Gold Star family members by enacting legislation to honor these brave women by designating the last Sunday in September as Gold Star Mothers Day. There is no organization more worthy of this perpetual honor. 
But the Gold Star Mothers did not stop there. They wanted to expand their opportunities to assist veterans and their families and sought a congressional charter so they could work in veterans hospitals throughout the country. That charter was granted in 1984. The charter outlines the objective and purposes for which they were organized, including assisting all veterans and their dependents in claims to the VA; inspiring respect for the Stars and Stripes; encouraging a sense of individual obligation to the community, State, and Union; perpetuating the memory of those whose lives were sacrificed in our wars, and supporting and extending needful assistance to all Gold Star Mothers. 
Over the ensuing years, Gold Star Mothers has provided assistance to countless veterans needing help. They do so with great dedication and great love. What greater love is there than a mother's love? 
Although the group started out with only 25 members, Gold Star Mothers grew quickly and today has department officers covering all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. And they keep expanding. 
I just wanted to take this time to salute this organization, to assure them that a grateful nation has not forgotten their sacrifice, and to thank them for the good work they continue to do for this great nation. I would like to pay special tribute to a Gold Star Mother in my State, Margaret Renner, who lost a son in Vietnam in 1969. She has been an active member of Gold Star Mothers, Inc., for many years, and all of us who know her are grateful for her dedicated service to the men and women who have served the Nation honorably as well as to those who have lost their sons and daughters to war.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I just finished testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the issue of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. When I appeared before the committee, there was a debt clock the chairman put up in the back of him. He hung it up in the room. It showed the debt increasing every second as we were there testifying. It was a fairly effective prop, I thought, because we ought to be concerned about the debt. And we are on the right subject when we are talking about eliminating the deficit and trying to reduce the Federal debt. 
But I pointed out to the chairman of the committee that if we pass his proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget, if we pass it right now, and then pass the proposed budget that will balance the budget in the year 2002, it doesn't stop the debt clock. The debt clock doesn't become a stopwatch on debt, because they are defining a balanced budget as a budget that takes all the money in the Social Security system that is coming in and uses it as other revenue to balance the Federal budget. The result is, in the year 2002, when they claim the budget will be in balance and they will comply with the constitutional requirement to balance the budget, the debt in America will increase by $130 billion. 
I went to a small school, a high school class of nine. We didn't take the most sophisticated arithmetic in the world, but I guarantee you nobody in the country teaches that if you claim you balance the budget, it is OK for your debt to continue to increase. Let me say it again. They will enshrine in the U.S. Constitution a practice that takes dedicated trust funds that can be used only for Social Security to be used now as other revenue, and then claim they have balanced the budget, even as the Federal debt will continue to increase by $130 billion a year after they say the budget is balanced. 
It is not budgeting that is correct, it is budgeting that--if you were in the private sector saying, by the way, in my business, I am going to take the workers' pension funds and use them to cover my operating loss in the business, it would get you sent off to 2 years of hard tennis in a minimum security prison. That is illegal. In Congress, they can simply change the definition so it allows them to say they have balanced the budget, even when they have not balanced the budget and are still borrowing $130 billion a year more. That is not a good recipe for my children or yours. And it is not an honest way to balance the budget. 
We will introduce tomorrow, a group of us, a constitutional amendment to balance the budget that says, yes, we support it. Let us do it the right way, the honest way. If we are going to balance the budget, let us do it the old-fashioned way. In fact, putting the provision in the Constitution won't balance the budget. It will be men and women who vote for a combination of taxing and spending changes that ultimately will balance the budget. 
We have made progress, and I am proud to say that I am part of the team that has allowed us to make that progress year after year, reductions in appropriations in program after program, year after year, biting the bullet to do the tough things, make the hard choices, to bring the budget deficit down 4 years in a row, down by 60 percent. I am pleased to be a part of the group in this body that says that is the right course, it's the responsible thing, a thing we ought to do for our children's future. 
Now, Mr. President, let me make a final point. We are going to introduce that tomorrow with eight or nine of us as original cosponsors. I hope that will be considered whenever there is consideration of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. That is an important first topic for this Congress--again, how to get our fiscal house in order. But there is much more to be done. 
The convening of a new Congress is not just about trumpeting by elephants or parading by donkeys; it is about people representing men and women of good will across the country who send 
us here to do the public's business and to try to do the things that improve the future of this country. 
We care about education because that is America's future. What do we do to improve education in this country? That is a topic that we need to address. We can address that in a bipartisan way, in my judgment. 
What about health care? What about 10 million kids who don't have health care? What about a 2-year-old that is crying with an ache in his stomach, but his parents don't have money in their wallets and can't take him to a doctor they believe in? We should address health care. That is the right subject. 
What about the environment? Nobody in America would have predicted that in the past 20 years we have doubled our use of energy, but we now have cleaner air and cleaner water. Why did we end up with cleaner air and water when we doubled our use of energy? Because this Congress said to those who pollute this country, `You can't do that anymore.' We are not done with that job. There is more to do. But that is the right topic as well, to improve the future of this country. 
Crime. Yes, crime. They say statistics show that crime has diminished. We have a lot to do on crime. I am somebody who believes we ought to say to people in this country: If you commit a violent act, you stay in jail until the end of your time, and no time off for good behavior. You go to prison and stay there. We have a lot to do on crime. We can do that, I hope, in a bipartisan way. 
Trade. I hope in the next few days my distinguished colleague from West Virginia and I will introduce, once again, a piece of legislation we introduced toward the end of the last session, which says, what about the other deficit, the deficit that is increasing at an alarming rate, the merchandise trade deficit, which was the largest in the history of this country last year, breaking records 3 years in a row. What about the other deficit? How does this country get its trade in balance? Because the trade deficit, after all, must be repaid in the future with a lower standard of living in this country. That is why it is dangerous for our future. That represents an export of American jobs. Jobs that used to be here are there. Jobs that used to be ours are theirs. We must confront this trade deficit. It is dangerous for this country to proceed without dealing with the other deficit, the merchandise trade deficit, which, after all, in my judgment, is the deficit that will inexorably weaken this country. 
No country will long remain a world economic power unless it retains a strong manufacturing base. The merchandise trade deficit represents the erosion of America's manufacturing base, the loss of American jobs, jobs that pay well, jobs that have good benefits. That is why it is so critically important to the future of our economy. I will be introducing again some days ahead, with Senator Byrd, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, a piece of legislation that establishes an emergency commission to make recommendations in how to address this vexing, dangerous merchandise trade deficit. 
Mr. President, I know the Senator from Florida is waiting for the floor. I yield the floor to him.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a piece of legislation and also to discuss an issue that is very important to residents of my home State of North Dakota and residents of a good many States, particularly in the northern Great Plains. Let me begin by talking about some of the hardships and some of the challenges faced by Dakotans and by others in our part of the country as a result of an extraordinarily severe winter. 
North Dakota has had six blizzards, which others might already know about, having heard the reports of these blizzards on television, news reports, and elsewhere, six blizzards from November 17 to January 15. The blizzards have been about as tough as any I have seen in North Dakota in my years in that wonderful State. It has been a tough, hard winter--lots of snow, lots of wind, conditions that are dangerous to people and to livestock. 
I want to talk just a little about the challenges that these winters blizzards portray for our citizens and what the response has been. I want to tell you first about a young boy named Wyett Magike who lived about 20 miles from the nearest medical center near Mandan, ND, or Bismarck, ND. Steve Conmy, who is the coordinator of emergency services for Morton County, during the middle of a blizzard about a week and a half ago told me about some of his plow and truck operators and what they were facing. I went out in a big plow with Mr. Conmy and we drove on the north edge of Mandan, ND, where snow covered the trailer houses altogether. In other words, the snow was to the roof of a trailer house so you could not see the trailer house. Getting there, you could not see anything in front of you because it was almost total white-out conditions--high wind, snow, a lot of snow pack, with blowing snow. Those are the kind of conditions that road crews all across North Dakota have faced for some long while. 
November 17, a very large blizzard and storm in North Dakota in the northeastern part of the State; December 16, 17, and 18, a winter blizzard through most all of North Dakota; December 20, 21, and 22, again, a big winter blizzard in the northeastern part of the State; January 4 and 5, a very severe winter blizzard throughout the State; January 15, another severe winter blizzard throughout the State. That is what our citizens have faced. 
Now Wyett Magike was 2 years old, and on a recent morning, at 10 o'clock in the morning a call was received by the Morton County emergency management group regarding a medical emergency down near Flasher, ND. This young child was very, very ill and he needed to be transported to the bismark hospital immediately. He was dehydrated, severely vomiting blood. Everyone was very concerned about him and knew that he had to get medical attention immediately or he might die. Due to the road conditions and the weather reports, travel was impossible. The roads were completely blocked and the conditions were near white-out conditions. For people who do not know because they are not from our part of the country, a white out is when snow and blowing snow make it impossible to see anything in front of you. All the roads, including the main highways, were blocked with snowdrifts and there was zero visibility that morning. 
What the emergency group did was coordinate two snowplows dispatched from Flasher, ND, to escort and ambulance crew from Flasher, ND. And then two snowplows were dispatched from Mandan, ND, also with an ambulance. They met at a major snow block on the highway east of Flasher, ND, and it took 45 minutes just for all that equipment to punch a hole through the snow that was blocking that road. This journey took some 6 hours by these road crews, again at zero visibility, with snowblock virtually everywhere. 
James Gerhardt and Gerald Friesy ran the plow and the truck from Flasher; Leland Gross and Robert Jochinm ran the snowplow and the truck from Mandan. And Steve Conmy said when he asked the folks to go out and do this, they did not wring their hands and say. `Gee, there is a risk out here.' They said, `What equipment shall we take.' They hit the road, and 6 hours later the young boy was in the hospital at Bismarck. The doctor said he would have died except for the heroic efforts by these folks. 
Now, James, Gerald, Leland, and Robert are not well known by their deeds. They are just a road crew. When I say `just a road crew,' they are heroes. There are road crews all over North Dakota working 8-hour after 8-hour shifts and risking their lives doing things that save other people's lives. 
I mentioned this story only because a lot people do not understand the severity of the winter storms we have had. Lives have been lost in the Dakotas. We are now doing an assessment to find out how much livestock has been lost. Undoubtedly, a substantial amount of livestock loss has occurred. People have not been able to get through roads to feed the livestock. If they did, feed was not available. The result has been a very, very serious problem for people and for livestock in our State. 
In the November 16 and 17 storm, we had 13 inches of snow fall in North Dakota; November 20, 6 inches; the 16th, 8 inches; December 20, 8 inches; 10 inches; 7 inches; on it goes. In each case, we had winds of 30, 40 and 50 miles an hour. In December and January there have been 10 days where the wind chill has been recorded at or below 50 below zero--10 days at or below 50 below zero. The other evening the wind chill was 80 below zero. 
I am not trying to diminish our tourism efforts in North Dakota, although I expect there was precious little tourism in early January with forecasts of blizzards in our State, but it has been a very difficult circumstance. January 9, 83 below zero wind chill in Minot, ND. For 11 days in November to January it did not get above zero. 
What to make of all of this and the challenge that it poses for North Dakotans. Clearly, North Dakotans who were isolated and stuck out in the country with roads impassable, often in need of medical help or in need of food or in need of feeding the cattle who also were at risk, needed some assistance. 
I mentioned the emergency crews that were available, and all over the State in unknown ways by unknown people, they have committed heroic acts. But North Dakotans needed more help than that. They needed low-income energy assistance, especially for some areas on Indian reservations and elsewhere. They needed emergency feed assistance. Cities and counties and townships and others who have not been able to clear the roads, have not had enough equipment, needed assistance. 
I am pleased to say that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others are now in North Dakota at the President's direction. The State of North Dakota, the counties, the townships and the Federal Government are working together to respond to an extraordinarily difficult circumstance. We are not nearly through this. Winter is only about a third over. We do not know what the next couple of months will be for our State. but we know that North Dakotans have endured a very difficult winter so far. We hope for better conditions. Whatever happens, North Dakota will be prepared to deal with it and respond to it. 
I do want the President to know and my colleagues to know that just as when a tornado comes along and wreaks havoc in and area, or where a raging flood gathers homes and runs the homes down a river, just as those emergencies such as an earthquake, for example, that causes chaos, just as they need to be responded to and always are responded to by the Federal Government, so, too, must this snow emergency and the storms and the deadly blizzards that have crossed our States in the northern Great Plains in recent weeks, so, too, must they be responded to in an appropriate way. 
We are continuing to work on snow clearing, on low-income energy assistance issues, on feed assistance for livestock, and on many other approaches to try to help people and respond to the needs that exist as a result of this very severe winter. 
Today, I wanted to at least tell my colleagues of the circumstances that we face and thank the President, thank the administration and others who have joined to help. I also wanted to described the people who assisted the 2-year-old boy. That has gone on across our State every day and in every way. To those who work in public service, those who man those graders and trucks and keep the roads open, punch through snowdrifts with zero visibility to protect life in North Dakota, I say: You are the real heroes, and North Dakotans and all of America owe you a debt of gratitude.

Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, the current system of electing Members of Congress is badly in need of reform. Elections are too long, too negative and too expensive; incumbents have a decided advantage over challengers, voter participation continues to decline, and 30-second political attack ads are polluting the airways. The American people want us to fix the system, and they want us to do it now. It is my view that campaign finance reform, along with balancing the budget, should be the highest priorities on the Senate agenda in the 105th Congress. 
Successive Supreme court decisions have made it increasingly difficult to control campaign spending. In its review of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971, the Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, stuck down the mandatory spending limits in that law as an infringement of First Amendment rights. The Court stated unequivocally: `In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the people--individuals as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.' The Court at that time did, however, retain the section of FECA which limited contributions to political candidates because of the Court's stated concern that unlimited gifts to candidates were a recipe for corruption. Simply put, the Courts have prohibited mandatory spending limits while preserving contribution limits. In the long run, it seems to me that we will have to pass a constitutional amendment to get a handle on the spending side of the campaign equation, and I intend to cosponsor just such a measure. 
Nevertheless, there are short term solutions that can and should be addressed, including voluntary spending limits. The system is awash in money, and the public is disgusted with the ever increasing amounts of money flowing into congressional campaign coffers. Whether we like it or not, the public believes the money is tainted. They know that money flows towards power, and are convinced that large campaign contributions buy influence. To put their concerns in some perspective, one need only look at the statistics. The average cost of winning a Senate seat rose from $609,100 in 1976 to $3.6 million in the 1996 election cycle, and incumbents on average have a spending advantage of more than 2-1 over challengers. 
There is simply no way to justify these escalating expenditures. No wonder the American people have grown cynical of public institutions and officials, and no wonder talented people in our communities do not want to run for elective office. If we hope to reverse public attitudes and restore confidence in our government officials and institutions, we should begin with campaign finance reform. We have a unique opportunity this year to pass meaningful and bipartisan reform, something that has eluded us for more than a decade. I hope we will seize the moment. 
While I intend to support comprehensive reform efforts as I have in the past, I am introducing legislation today to address what I perceive to be the most serious problems in the system now. My bill includes the following provisions which I will describe briefly:  
1. VOLUNTARY SPENDING LIMITS/LIMITATION ON PERSONAL FUNDS/FEE ON NON-COMPLYING CANDIDATES 
As a result of the Supreme Court decisions mentioned above, the only way to control spending in the short term is through voluntary spending limits. My bill contains voluntary limits which are based on a percentage of the voting age population in each state. These are the same limits that were contained in the campaign finance reform bill that passed the Senate in the 103rd Congress and which have been the basis of comprehensive reform proposals in the 104th Congress. In addition, my bill would limit the amount of personal or family money that a candidate can contribute to his or her campaign to $25,000. I don't believe any candidate should be able to spend unlimited personal funds in an attempt to buy a seat in the U.S. Senate. 
Unlike other bills, however, my proposal imposes a fee on candidates who choose not to comply with the spending limits. Under my legislation, non-complying candidates would be charged a fee of 50 percent on all expenditures exceeding the spending limits. The fee would be due and payable at the time candidates are currently required to submit quarterly and other reports to the Federal Election Commission. The proceeds from the fee would be distributed by the FEC on a fair and equitable basis among complying candidates for the same federal office. It is my hope that this fee will provide a strong inducement for candidates to comply with the voluntary spending limits. 
2. SOFT MONEY 
My bill prohibits national political parties and congressional campaign committees from raising or spending so-called `soft money.' Only money raised and spent according to the requirements and restrictions of federal law can be used to `expressly advocate' the election or defeat of a federal candidate. This is called `hard money.' However, unlimited amounts of soft money are being raised by the national parties and congressional campaign committees, outside the constraints of federal election law, ostensibly to support state and local candidates as well as federal candidates to the extent that they do not directly advocate the election or defeat of that candidate. In practice, however, soft money is being raised and spent on federal elections because of a loophole in federal election law. 
Soft money is raised from unions and corporations, which are prohibited from contributing to federal elections except through their PACs, and from individuals who have reached the aggregate federal contribution limits of $25,000 a year. In a nutshell, soft money contributions are unlimited and unregulated. 
It is this pot of soft money which has dramatically increased in recent election cycles. The Republican national committees raised $141.2 million in soft money in the 1996 election cycle, a 183 percent increase over the $49.2 raised in 1992. The Democratic party committees raised $122 million in 1996, a 237 percent increase over their 1992 level of $36.5 million. A substantial portion of soft money spending by party campaign committees has gone to finance the generic issue ads we have come to know as attack ads. The figures above illustrate the problem. My bill would eliminate it by preventing national committees from raising or spending soft money which does not comply with the source and dollar restrictions in federal campaign finance law. 
3. EXPRESS ADVOCACY 
As mentioned above, only money raised under the restrictions and prohibitions of federal election law can be used to advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office. As currently defined in FEC regulations, only communications which use such words as `vote for', `elect', `support', `defeat', `reject' or `Smith for Congress' are considered express advocacy which must be paid for with money raised under federal election law restraints, i.e., hard money. 
This overly narrow definition of what constitutes express advocacy has created a giant loophole for attack ads. Simply by avoiding the magic words mentioned above, political parties, corporations, unions and other special interest groups can pay for brutal attack ads which certainly have the intent of influencing the outcome of federal elections--and they can do it without having to disclose it to the FEC. 
My bill would expand the current express advocacy standard to include both the content and intent of such ads. It would not prohibit such ads; it would simply ensure--as Congress intended--that such ads are paid for with money which is subject to regulation and disclosure. Any political ads that clearly identify a candidate(s) and which are broadcast within 60 days prior to an election (or 90 days prior to a general election with respect to a candidate for Vice President or President) will be considered express advocacy and, therefore, will be subject to the restrictions and limitations of federal election law. The bottom line is that you would have to pay for these ads with hard money which is more difficult to raise and which requires full disclosure to the FEC. 
4. POLITICAL ADVERTISING 
I have long thought that the 30-second political attack ad does little, if anything, to advance the cause of public debate. They tend to be hit-and-run ads. Under current federal communications law, television broadcasters are required to provide political candidates with their lowest unit rate--the rate they charge their best customers--for political ads run in the 45 days prior to a primary election and 60 days prior to a general election. Unfortunately, oftentimes the candidate never appears in the ad. My bill would require broadcasters to provide this reduced rate only for ads which are at least one minute in length and in which the candidate appears at least 75 percent of the time. 
5. NON-CITIZENS 
It is my strong view that people who are not citizens of the United States should not be able to influence our election process in any way. Therefore, my bill prohibits non-citizens from raising funds for or contributing to federal elections. 
6. VOTER PARTICIPATION 
I am extremely disheartened by the lack of individual involvement in the political process and the every increasing decline in voter participation numbers. Between 1948-1968, voter turnout for presidential elections was 60.43 percent. Between 1972-1992, it fell to 53.21 percent. Last year, it fell below 50 percent. These statistics are a national disgrace Certainly, there must be something that can be done to increase voter participation. Unfortunately, past initiatives have had little or marginal impact on increasing the number of voters who choose to fulfill their civic responsibility to vote. I believe we need a comprehensive analysis of what has worked, what has not worked or what we might try to change public attitudes, educate voters and improve participation. Early voting, extended polling hours and weekend voting are areas that ought to be researched. My bill provides $150,000 for the Federal Election Commission to conduct such a study and to make recommendations to Congress. This is a small amount of money to invest in an increasingly serious public problem. 
7. TAX CREDIT 
If we want to encourage participation by ordinary citizens, I believe it is in our national interest to restore a tax credit for small contributors similar to what existed between 1972 and 1986. My bill does that by providing an annual 100% tax credit for the first $100 ($200 for joint returns) of contributions to congressional campaigns. It is my belief that many people who want to participate financially in the political process simply cannot afford to do so. These voters believe they have no power or influence. They are increasingly frustrated, disgusted and disengaged. My bill will afford them the opportunity to participate in the process. 
The American public and the voters in my state of North Dakota are clearly appalled by the amount of money involved in electing federal officials. They are adamant that we clean up the system--NOW. If we don't, we do so at our personal and collective peril. 
I want the people of North Dakota and the Members of this body to know that I intend to support and to work as hard as I can to enact comprehensive campaign finance legislation this year. I think is in all our best interests to do so, and I hope my bill will stimulate debate and be incorporated in the final reform package.
