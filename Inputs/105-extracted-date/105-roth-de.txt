 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on September 29, the Finance Committee reported unanimously H.R. 4342, the Miscellaneous Tariff and Technical Corrections Act of 1998. It was my hope that we would pass this legislation this year. Unfortunately, for reasons unrelated to the substance of the bill, this did not happen. 
The failure of this legislation is disappointing because it served a number of important practical purposes. For example, this bill would have temporarily suspended or reduced the duty on a large number of products, including a wide variety of chemicals used to make anti-HIV, anti-AIDS and anti-cancer drugs. Also included were certain organic pigments which are environmentally benign substitutes for pigments containing toxic heavy metals. 
In each instance, there were either no domestic production of the product in question or the domestic producers supported the measure. By suspending or reducing the duties, we would have enabled U.S. firms that use these products to produce goods in a more cost efficient manner, thereby helping create jobs for American workers and reducing costs for consumers. 
The bill also contained a number of technical corrections and other minor modifications to the trade laws that enjoyed broad support. One such measure would have helped facilitate Customs Service clearance of athletes that participate in world athletic events, such as the upcoming Women's World Cup, the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the International Special Olympics. Another measure would have corrected certain outdated references in the trade laws. 
For each of the provisions included in this bill, we had solicited comments from the public and from the Administration to ensure that there was no controversy or opposition. Only those measures that were non-controversial and that had no opposition were included in the bill. 
The failure of this bill is also disappointing because of the amount of time and effort that the staff put into preparing this extremely technical piece of legislation. That is why I would like to give special thanks to Faryar Shirzad, Linda Menghetti, Tim Keeler, Lisa Lee, Marsha Moke, Matthew Sorenson, Bruce Anderson, Bob Merulla and Myrtle Agent from the Finance Committee staff, Polly Craighill, from the Office of Legislative Counsel, and Hester Grippando from the Congressional Budget Office, for their extensive work on this legislation.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, before we adjourn, Senator Moynihan and I would like to speak to an issue that has yet been unable to be resolved--the funding for the Conservation Trust Fund of Puerto Rico. The Conservation Trust was created in 1968 for the protection of the natural resources and environmental beauty of Puerto Rico. 
The Trust lost much of its funding as a consequence of the decisions to phase-out section 936 and eliminate the Qualified Possession Source Investment Income (also known as `QPSII') provision in the tax code. I hope that Congress and the Administration will continue to work together to find an equitable solution that will permit the Trust to continue its protection of the environment in Puerto Rico.

Mr. ROTH. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I am well aware of your interest in this amendment, as well as the continued interest of the Senators from New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The Senator raises important issues with regard to the uniqueness of such state-mandated payments. Unfortunately, as you know, we were not able to take up such issues during the 105th Congress. It would be my intention, though, to address this and other tax matters at the next available opportunity.

Mr. ROTH. I understand my colleagues' concerns. For some time now I have been studying how to provide targeted incentives to develop clean alternative fuels. It is essential for Congress to develop sound tax policy for alternative energy to help protect our environment. Several weeks ago, I introduced legislation to provide such incentives for facilities that produce energy from poultry waste. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues early in the 106th Congress.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to make some comments with respect to the question of the allocation of resources to assist our State and local governments in meeting their challenge in the provision of education for grades K through 12. 
First, in this war of words it should not be overlooked that there was no disagreement last year in establishing education as a priority when we enacted the Balanced Budget Act. We entered into an agreement only one year ago with this administration where we indicated that yes, we agree that education is a priority for all. We have honored that commitment. 
Under the balanced budget agreement from last year, we agreed to increase spending on education by 15 percent, or $3 billion. We did that. 
This year in the budget resolution adopted by the Senate we agreed to increase education spending over the next 5 years by an amount equal to inflation which would result in spending increases of $6.6 billion in budget authority and $4.1 billion in outlays over the next 5 years. Almost all other discretionary programs were frozen. 
In addition, earlier this year we passed a bill--with bipartisan support--the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act to expand the education IRA which we enacted last year as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Under this provision the annual contribution limit for education IRAs would be increased from $500 under current law to $2,000 and expand the use of the proceeds from these accounts for elementary and secondary education expenses. 
Education expenses, it is important to note, under the provisions of the bill were broadly defined to include after school-programs, expenses for special needs children, computers, tutoring, uniforms--in sum, virtually any expense associated with improving the totality of a child's education. 
The benefits of this provision were large for a very small cost, and I would note most importantly, with no Federal interference. Mr. President, this one provision was anticipated to generate $5 billion for education over a 5-year period and $10 billion over a 10-year period. 
It was thought that 14 million families would utilize the savings benefit and 20 million school children would benefit. All at minimal cost and interference. The administration vetoed this good and important bill. 
As I see it where we are today is not in disagreement over the importance of education or the investment in education, but rather a very different philosophical approach in the best way to provide assistance. As a staunch believer in State and local control of education it is my firm belief that the assistance we provide to our State and local educational agencies must be given with the maximum amount of flexibility. 
Time and time again, the evidence has shown that a one size fits all directive from Washington is not the tonic to cure any ills within our educational system. I therefore believe the administration's insistence on their school construction and class room size reduction initiative is wrong, and actually may be harmful. 
A policy briefing issued in June of this year by the Progressive Policy Institute states it best: `It makes little sense to dictate in across the board class-size reduction policy from Washington. A national policy can only expect average gains, which appear to be very small at great expense.' 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the policy briefing `Improving Student Achievement--Is Reducing Class Size the Answer?' be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, an additional problem with inflexible mandates from Washington is that it directs resources from the State and local level to areas which a State or local school board might not think is the best use of resources. 
Some schools or districts may wish to have smaller class sizes or devote resources to capital projects, others may feel that their school reform efforts can best be served by adding computers, newer textbooks, teacher training, or after school programs or other ideas. This is where I think directives become harmful. 
We do not have the solutions in Washington, We must let our State and local educational agencies, parents, and teachers, have the freedom to put their resources where they feel they will do the most good for the benefit of our children. An editorial from the News Journal from my State entitled `Misguided Mandate: Micromanagement by Legislators Is Mockery of Real School Reform' is illustrative of this point, though they were editorializing on an action taken by the State legislature in Delaware. 
I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in full at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in conclusion, Mr. President, I would say that I am disappointed in the rhetorical excess surrounding the issue of educational excellence. 
Our focus should not be on inputs and micromanagement, but on how we can best deliver assistance which will result in positive outcomes reflected by improved student achievement. I suggest that the solution to this problem rests in our communities, with those closest to the problems at hand. 
Exhibit 1 Editor's Note: Silver bullet ideas for school reform come and go, usually warranting little more than passing attention. However, one idea seems to be taking hold among many camps: class-size reduction. In light of the attention and support this idea has received, the Progressive Policy Institute asked University of Rochester's Eric Hanushek--a renowned education scholar--to review the evidence on the impact of class-size reduction policies. This is his analysis. 
Improving Student Achievement--Is Reducing Class Size the Answer?  
Growing numbers of Americans are dissatisfied with our nation's schools and are demanding reform. Recently, results from an international study showed U.S. students trailing the world in twelfth grade math and science. Faced with the daunting task of reforming education, politicians in both parties, including President Clinton, are seizing on a cure-all that appeals to interest groups and enjoys public support: reducing class size. 
This is by no means a new idea; teachers' unions have fought for smaller classes for decades. 
All other things being equal, smaller classes are preferable to larger ones because teachers can give students more individual attention. However, all things are seldom equal, and other factors, such as the quality of the teacher, have a much more decisive impact on student achievement. Moreover, the huge expense of class-size reduction may impede the ability of schools to make other important investments in quality. Here lies the fundamental question: What effect do broad policies of class-size reduction have on overall student achievement levels? 
Supporters of broad class-size reductions generally point to a few studies or a few experiences that suggest improved performance with smaller classes and then rely on the `obviousness' of the proposed policies to carry the day. To be sure, there are U.S. classrooms that are overcrowded. But not every school ranks reducing class size as the highest priority. Some schools may prefer to invest in smaller classes, but others might opt for reading tutors, after-school programs, computers, higher salaries for teachers, or increased professional development. In fact, a thorough review of the scientific evidence shows a startling finding; class-size reduction may be one of the least effective educational investments. 
Historical and international evidence also shows that a national policy to reduce class size could displace more productive investments in schooling. The United States has already significantly reduced class sizes over the past 40 years and student performance has remained stagnant, at best. The overall pupil-teacher ratio fell by 35 percent from 1950-95 (from about 27-to-1 to 17-to-1). 1 Aggregate student performance has shown no improvement over this period. Similarly, these changes have done nothing to boost our standing on international achievement tests. 
Federal policy should aim to improve teacher quality, not quantity. Rather than reducing class size, a better use of federal money would be to encourage states to boost teacher quality by developing meaningful teacher tests and alternative certification programs. Better yet, federal funds could be used to encourage stronger performance incentives in our schools.

Mr. ROTH. 
Mr. President, I rise to introduce the `Tax Relief Extension Act of 1998'. I am pleased to have as my principal cosponsor my distinguished friend and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Fifteen Finance Committee Members have joined Senator Moynihan and myself on this bill. 
Before I discuss the Finance Committee bill, I'd like to comment on the House bill. 
Chairman Archer and I attempted to negotiate a bill that would address expiring tax and trade provisions. 
Chairman Archer and I had many discussions and made a lot of progress in trying to resolve differences on extenders, but we were unable to reach agreement. Let me say the House bill has many worthwhile proposals that we in the Senate should support. 
Mr. President, we find ourselves in a difficult situation. Although the House bill has many good proposals, it is unlikely the House bill will move by unanimous consent in the Senate in its present form. We will not be able to obtain unanimous consent because the House resisted negotiations on expiring provisions important to Members of the Senate. 
I remain hopeful that the House and Senate can reach agreement on an extenders bill. I believe the Finance Committee is taking a step today that can lead us to that agreement. 
Mr. President, this bill is the product of a Finance Committee meeting yesterday. At that meeting, a bi-partisan majority of the committee agreed on a package to address expiring tax and trade provisions--the so-called extenders. This bill is meant to be offered as a substitute to H.R. 4738, the House extender bill. 
We expect to consider the House bill together with the Finance Committee bill shortly. 
This Finance Committee bill follows three principles: 
All non-controversial expiring provisions are covered; 
No policy changes are made to the extenders--only date changes; and 
The package is fully offset. 
The purpose of this bill is to leave tax policy on the expiring provisions settled until the next Congress. At that time, hopefully, we will be considering a major tax cut bill. When we are considering that tax cut bill next year, we will be able to address the policy and long-term period of the various provisions. 
This bill is necessarily narrow. There are no Member provisions in this bill, including some I am interested in. In order to expedite this bill, the Finance Committee Members on this bill agreed to forego Member issues. 
This bill extends several important provisions in the tax and trade areas, including:  
The research and development tax credit; 
The work opportunity tax credit; 
The welfare to work tax credit; 
The full deductibility of contributions of appreciated stock to private foundations; 
The active financing exception to Subpart F for financial services operations overseas; 
The tax information reporting access for the Department of Education for the Federal student aid programs; 
The Generalized System of Preferences (`GSP'); and 
The trade adjustment assistance (`TAA') program. 
In addition to extenders, the Finance Committee bill speeds up the full deductibility of health insurance deduction for self-employed persons. This bill also addresses time sensitive farm-related issues. 
The final provision in this bill would correct an upcoming problem for millions of middle income taxpayers. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included tax relief for America's working families in the form of the $500 per child tax credit and the Hope Scholarship tax credit, and other benefits. Taxpayers will expect to see these benefits when they file their returns on April 15th. 
What some of these families will find is that the tax relief they expected will not materialize because of the alternative minimum tax (`AMT'). That is, these tax credits do not count against the alternative minimum tax. The final provision in the Finance Committee bill would provide that benefits such as the $500 per child tax credit would count against the alternative minimum tax. 
This point deserves emphasis. We can correct this problem for millions of taxpayers in this bill. As Chairman of the Finance Committee, I consider it my responsibility to simplify the tax code whenever possible. This last provision provides us with that opportunity. I am pleased the Members of the Finance Committee back me in this effort. 
Finally, I'd like return to the Senate's procedures, schedule, and the prospects for extender legislation. 
It is important to recognize that the House and Senate are very different bodies governed by starkly different rules and traditions. Unlike the House, the Senate Rules and schedule do not allow us to move this bill at this point in any other way than by unanimous consent. If we are to address these tax and trade provisions, we will need the cooperation of every Senator. 
If we can get every Senator's cooperation, and resolve our differences with the House, I believe we can deliver an extenders bill the President will sign. 
I urge my colleagues to support this Finance Committee bill.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Home Health Fair Payment Act of 1998. 
This legislation is the product of a great deal of hard work and analysis. It has bipartisan, bicameral, support. Currently, the bill has 15 cosponsors, and similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives. 
Staff worked to make sure that the technical aspects of this bill could be implemented. After technical review from the Health Care Financing Administration, it is our understanding that the changes in home health payments could be implemented as intended. 
I would like to thank the many Senators who were very helpful and contributed to the debate of addressing the home health interim payment system. In particular, I commend Senator Collins, Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, Senator Cochran, and Senator Bond. All put forward legislative proposals which we examined closely, and which helped us in our development of the legislation now before us. 
With this budget neutral proposal, about 82% of all home health agencies in the nation will benefit from improved Medicare payments. Although I have heard concerns that we do not go far enough to help some of the lowest cost agencies, it is an important step in the right direction. In fact, we have received letters of support from the Visiting Nurse Associations of America and the National Association for Homecare. 
Let's remember where we were before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Home health spending was growing by leaps and bounds, cases of fraud and abuse were common, and the Medicare program was headed towards bankruptcy in 2003. 
Last year, Medicare spent $17 billion for 270 million home health care visits so that one out of every ten beneficiaries received care at home from a nurse, a physical or occupational therapist, and/or a nurse aide. 
Unlike any other Medicare benefit, the home health benefit has no limits on the number of visits or days of care a beneficiary can receive, beneficiaries pay no deductible, nor do they pay any co-payments. 
Prior to BBA, home health agencies were reimbursed on a cost basis for all their costs, as long as they maintained average costs below certain limits. This payment system gave immense 
incentives for home health agencies to increase the volume of services delivered to patients, and it attracted many new agencies to the program. 
From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health payments grew with an average annual increase of 33 percent, while the number of home health agencies swelled from about 5,700 in 1989 to more than 10,000 in 1997. 
In response to this rapid cost growth and concerns about program abuses, the BBA included a number of changes to home health care. Congress and the Administration supported moving toward a Prospective Payment System (PPS). In order for HCFA to move to a PPS, however, a number of computer system changes were necessary with respect to their home health operations. The interim payment system (IPS) was developed to manage reimbursement until the PPS could be implemented. 
Significant Medicare payment issues for home health care have emerged from our analysis from the impact of the IPS. There are severe equity issues in payment limit levels both across states and within states. These wide disparities are exacerbated by a major distinction drawn in payment rules between so-called `new' versus `old' agencies. `Old' agencies being those that were in existence prior to 1993, and `New' agencies those in existence since then. 
The effects of the current home health payment methodology are that similar agencies providing similar services in the same community face very different reimbursement limits, leading to highly arbitrary payment differences. 
The payment limit issues will deepen significantly more in 1999 due to a scheduled 15% cut in already tight and severely skewed payment limit levels. Further, the prospective payment system scheduled to go on-line in October, 1999, will be delayed by several months to one year, because of year 2000 computer programming problems, according to the Health Care Financing Administration. 
This legislation takes several steps to improve the Medicare home health care IPS and addresses the 15% cut. 
First, it increases equity by reducing the extreme variations in payment limits applicable to old agencies within states and across states. This is achieved through a budget-neutral blend for `old' agencies. 
Second, it increases fairness by reducing the artificial payment limit differences between `old' and `new' agencies. Such distinctions are contributing to the perception of arbitrariness in the home health care system. And, our proposal does not 
create additional classes of home health agencies, such as `new-new' agencies subject to even deeper, arbitrary payment limits in the future. Restricting new entrants to home health care is an inappropriate barrier to entry in underserved areas--both in rural and inner city areas. In the legislation, greater fairness is achieved by eliminating the 2 percent discount applicable to new agencies, and raising the per visit limits for all agencies from 105 percent to 110 percent of the national median. 
Third, the proposal lengthens the transition period for payment changes by providing all agencies a longer transition period in which to adjust to changed payment limits. It creates a sustainable fiscal base for the statutorily mandated prospective payment system (PPS) by delaying the scheduled 15 percent cut and the PPS for one year. 
The following is a summary of the Medicare Home Health Fair Payment Act of 1998:

Mr. Roth. Senator Bond and Senator Cochran, I thank you for your leadership within the Senate of these crucial issues affecting Medicare beneficiaries across the country. Through your assistance we hope to ensure that home health care is readily available where the needs arise. We will continue to explore fully those issues which you have raised. We will also draw on the resources of Medpac, HCFA, the GAO, and representatives from home care patients and providers to determine whether more work is required. Home health care is a crucial part of our health care system and the elderly and disabled protected by the Medicare program deserve the attention of this Congress to insure that we not disrupt this important benefit without a full and accurate understanding of the consequences. Once again, I thank Senator Bond and Senator Cochran for the guidance that they have offered to this body in addressing these important issues.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the gentleman from North Dakota for his comments. He is right; this change is only a small step. It does not `fix' the interim payment system. However, in the time remaining this year, this is the best we can do. It takes an important step toward making the system more fair, and it reduces the perverse incentives in the current system. In addition, it recognizes that the Prospective Payment System for home health will be delayed, so it delays for one year the 15% cut in payments that is currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1999. 
I want to assure my colleague from North Dakota, however, that I fully intend to revisit the home health issue next year. At that time, I pledge to work with him and other members of the Finance Committee to see if we can come up with a system that better addresses the needs of North Dakota home health agencies.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to report out from the Finance Committee the Administration's nomination of David C. Williams to be the Inspector General for the Treasury Department. The nomination hearing for Mr. Williams was held on September 24, 1998. 
The Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, grants the independence and authority for an Inspector General to conduct audits and investigations to (1) detect waste, fraud or abuse, and (2) promote economy and efficiency in agency programs and operations. I, for one, deeply believe in the IG concept and support the important role an Inspector General must carry out. It is often a very tough and demanding job. 
The Treasury Inspector General is an extremely critical position that is responsible for overseeing several Treasury agencies, including three law enforcement bureaus, namely, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The previous Inspector General resigned as a result of an investigation conducted by Senator Susan Collins' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI). PSI determined that the IG broke the law twice concerning two contracts and identified significant mismanagement within the Treasury IG's Office. 
The Treasury IG's Office has been a very troubled agency because of bad leadership. It is, therefore, an absolute requirement for the next Treasury Inspector General to be an individual with a proven track record as a strong, effective manager and leader, one who will engage in aggressive--but fair--oversight, and one who will carry out their duties with the utmost integrity. Such behavior as demonstrated by the previous Inspector General will not be tolerated. As the watchdog for the Treasury Department, the Inspector General must set a good ethical example. 
Mr. Williams began his career in the Federal Government in 1975 as a Secret Service Agent. In 1979, he went to work for the Labor Department's Office of Inspector General in the Office of Labor Racketeering, where he served as Special Agent in Charge for two field offices and later as the Field Director. 
During that time, Mr. Williams also served on President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime. In 1986, Mr. Williams became the first Director for the Office of Special Investigations for the General Accounting Office. In 1989, Mr. Williams was nominated by President Bush to be the first Inspector General for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
In 1995, President Clinton nominated Mr. Williams to be the first Inspector General for the Social Security Administration; Mr. Williams became the SSA, IG in 1996. Since June 1998, Mr. Williams has been serving as a Senior Advisor at the Treasury Inspector General's Office. 
Mr. Williams' background as the Inspector General for two Government agencies, as well as his investigator background, is clearly representative of the qualifications needed to be the Treasury Inspector General. The Senate Finance Committee intends to monitor the progress of this agency as it gets back on track in accomplishing its mandated mission.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday the President announced his plans for helping Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in health plans which are not renewing their Medicare contracts for next year. I am glad that President Clinton recognizes the problems Medicare beneficiaries are facing and I think it is important that we all work together to address this issue. But I am concerned that the President offered a `tomorrow' solution for today's problem. 
The problems facing Medicare HMO beneficiaries need attention now and cannot wait until next year. The President's proposal is inadequate and we must take immediate action to help Medicare beneficiaries to stay in their chosen health plans. 
Across the country, including in my home state of Delaware, thousands of Medicare beneficiaries are losing their HMO coverage and being forced back into the original Medicare program with expensive Medigap policies. We need to help these beneficiaries today. 
I am urging my colleagues in the House and Senate to act now to allow Medicare managed care plans that have withdrawn from the program to get back into Medicare. The legislation I am introducing today, along with my colleagues Senator Liebermann and Senator Mack, would instruct the Health Care Financing Administration to allow these plans to restructure their costs where justified. This would give many of the health insurance providers the flexibility they need to go back in to these markets. But most critically important, it would give beneficiaries the opportunity to remain in their current plans without the disruption and increased costs that they will otherwise face. 
I am presenting this legislation today after several attempts over the last month to work with the Administration to allow Medicare+Choice plans to update their cost and beneficiary filings for 1999. I had hoped to resolve this problem administratively--before these plans made their final decisions to pull out of 371 counties leaving 220 thousand beneficiaries to find another Medicare option. I sent a letter to HCFA head Nancy-Ann Min Deparle urging HCFA to take immediate action to prevent these manage care plans from leaving the Medicare+Choice program. 
I find it highly regrettable that the Health Care Financing Administration decided not to allow Medicare+Choice plans to update their cost and benefit filings for 1999. This decision could undermine the Medicare+Choice program enacted into law just last year and which I believe holds so much promise for improving Medicare for seniors. 
HCFA's shortsighted decision will result in large out-of-pocket cost increases, fewer benefits, and fewer choices for hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries. The beneficiaries who will bear the hardest brunt of the Administration's decision are the 455,000 enrolled in non-renewing Medicare+Choice plans in counties where no additional plans exist. These beneficiaries will now be left with only a significantly more expensive Medicare option; that is, the original Medicare program combined with a Medigap insurance policy. This is particularly unfortunate given that premiums for Medigap insurance policies have been sharply increasing each year. In fact, the American Association for Retired Persons announced just this week that its Medigap insurance premiums will increase by an average of 9 percent nationwide next year. 
And even in areas where beneficiaries will be left with one or more health plan options, the plan withdrawal will result in reduced competition which translates to higher out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries. 
I am very concerned by the agency's failure to evaluate potential increased beneficiary cost-sharing when making the critical decision not to allow plans to update their cost and benefit filings. I believe this action demonstrates HCFA's continued resistance to facilitate private plan choices for Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of the consequence to beneficiaries. 
I hope that the Congress and President Clinton will fight the temptation to play politics with Medicare and instead do the right thing for beneficiaries by taking action before Congress adjourns for the year to help beneficiaries to remain in their current Medicare health plans if they so choose. Next year, we can work together toward a more comprehensive solution to this issue.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Internet Tax Freedom Act. This legislation imposes a temporary moratorium on taxes relating to the Internet and establishes a Commission to study and make recommendations for international, Federal, state, and local government taxes of the Internet and other comparable sales. 
This legislation reflects the exciting times in which we live--a time when commerce between two individuals located a thousand miles apart can take place at the speed of light. Today, names like Netscape, Amazon.com, Yahoo, and America On-Line are household names--each a successful company in a new and exciting global business community. And they are only a few of literally thousands who provide their goods and services over the Internet. 
They compete in a world where technological revolutions take place on a daily basis, and they benefit the lives of families everywhere. Even in America's most remote communities, our children have access to the seven wonders of the world, to metropolitan art museums, electronic encyclopedias, and the world's great music and literature. These companies--and the countless companies like them--are pioneers. And the new frontier is exciting, indeed. 
In the new realm of cyberspace, government has three choices: lead, follow, or get out of the way. The legislation we introduce today is a clear indication that government is prepared to lead. It demonstrates that Congress is not going to allow haphazard tax policies, and a lack of foresight to get in the way of the growth and potential of this new and promising medium. It makes it clear that government's interaction with Internet commerce will be well-considered and constructive--beneficial to future prospects of Internet business and the individuals they service. 
From the introduction of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, in early 1997, members of the Finance Committee expressed keen interest in considering this legislation. The Finance Committee has clear jurisdiction over state and local taxes--it's also the place for trade issues. And this July, we received a referral of the bill. We conducted a hearing on the issues and listened to witnesses detail the growth and potential of the Internet. Witnesses also articulated the many sides and concerns associated with the tax implications of Internet commerce. 
Following our hearing, the Finance Committee held a markup, where we approved an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the original bill reported out of the Commerce Committee. The Finance Committee made significant improvements to the original legislation. We beefed up the trade component of the bill. We directed the USTR to examine and disclose the barriers to electronic commerce in its annual report. And we declared that it is the sense of Congress that international agreements provide that the Internet remain free from tariffs and discriminatory taxation. 
The Finance Committee's substitute also shortened the moratorium period on State and local taxes relating to the Internet. We did this with an understanding that the advisory commission, set up in the legislation, would not need the five year period that was set out in the original Commerce bill. At the same time, we streamlined the Advisory Committee and focused its study responsibilities. 
We took out any grandfather provision, feeling that as a policy matter, there should not be any taxes on the Internet during the moratorium period--regardless of whether some States had jumped the gun and applied existing taxes to Internet access. The Finance Committee also felt that this bill should be an example to our international negotiating partners--that if we wanted to keep grandfather provisions out of the international agreements, that we should remove them from our domestic taxation. 
I recognize that there have been various floor amendments that have changed some of the things we did in the Finance Committee. Despite those amendments, the central thrust of the legislation, which is to call a time-out while a commission assesses the Internet and makes some recommendations about how we should tax electronic commerce, remains. Important international provisions--relating to trade and tariff issues--also remain unchanged. 
Mr. President, I support the Internet Tax Freedom Act. It is a demonstration of Congress' understanding of the exciting potential and the opportunities that will be realized in cyberspace. It is a thoughtful approach to a very important issue. It meets current needs, and allows continued growth in this new frontier. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate contains seven technical amendments. Although each provision may seem minor, every one serves a larger, more important purpose. Also, as I will describe, the legislation is time sensitive, which is why the Senate is considering this bill in an expedited manner. Let me also note that the bill has bipartisan support and passed the House on a voice vote on September 23rd. Also, the small cost of the bill is fully paid for. 
The first provision would ensure that every elderly or disabled noncitizen dependent on SSI and Medicaid benefits when welfare reform was enacted in August 1996 will remain eligible. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 grandfathered most legal aliens receiving SSI. However, at that time, a small number--about 22,000--received only a temporary extension, until September 30, 1998, pending a study of their legal status. That issue has been largely resolved, and this provision would complete the work of BBA. 
The bill also makes a number of common sense changes that encourage work and personal responsibility in several programs under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. 
Finally, I would like to highlight an important humanitarian provision in this legislation. Many members are undoubtedly aware of the Make-A-Wish Foundation and similar organizations that help fulfill the dreams of children with life-threatening or terminal illnesses. For example, the child with cancer who gets a trip to Disney World. Yet, a sick child could lose SSI and Medicaid benefits if the cash value of their `wish' exceed current law income limits. This bill would fix that problem. 
I urge the support of all Members of this legislation. 
Mr JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and my colleagues for bringing the important issue of Medicare private contracting to my attention in this constructive way. The individual stories described today on the floor illustrate why private contracting has generating intense interest and deserves careful study. Organizations including the United Seniors Association, American Civil Liberties Union, Christian Coalition, American Conservative Union, Heritage Foundation, National Right to Life Committee, CATO Institute, and Citizens Against Government waste share the concerns with current law and the belief that Medicare beneficiaries should be provided more freedom-of-choice in Medicare. In the months ahead, I intend to work closely with my colleagues here in the Senate to review the private contracting provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment contains the necessary conforming changes to the Tax Code required by this reauthorization bill. This amendment does not affect Federal revenues. Therefore, this bill remains a nonrevenue bill. This amendment will allow expenditures from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to occur as authorized by the underlying legislation relating to airport construction, maintenance and technology. 
It will also help ensure our air traffic control system continues to provide safe and efficient services. 
It is my understanding that this amendment is acceptable to both sides of the political aisle. At the appropriate moment, I will urge its adoption.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would amend section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit to biomass energy facilities that use chicken manure as fuel. 
Joining me as original cosponsors are Senators Biden, Mikulski, Sarbanes, Jeffords, Harkin, Helms, Huchinson, and Bumpers.  
Mr. President, I am bullish on poultry's future in America. It is hard not to be with world-wide poultry consumption growing at double-digit rates. 
In the United States, poultry production has tripled since 1975. We now produce almost 8 billion chickens a year to feed the growing world-wide demand for poultry. 
In particular, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia produce some of the world's finest poultry. Just last year Delmarva poultry farmers produced over 600 million chickens. Our poultry farmers are among the most productive and efficient in the world. 
As the amount of chickens we produce as a nation has grown, so too has the amount of manure. 
Due to environmental pressures, spreading manure on land is no longer an option in some areas for our rapidly growing poultry industry. 
In the United Kingdom, several companies have been able to do what medieval alchemists dreamed of--turning a base element into gold--in this case an agricultural waste product into electricity. 
The UK has two utility plants that use poultry manure to generate electricity. These two poultry power plants will, when combined with a third scheduled to open this fall, burn 50 percent of the UK's total volume of chicken manure. 
The electricity generated by these plants will supply enough power for 100,000 homes. These plants have the support of both the poultry industry and the international environmental community. 
The way this system works is simple. 
Power stations buy poultry manure from surrounding poultry farmers and transport it to the power station. At the station the manure is burned in a furnace at high temperatures, heating water in a boiler to produce steam which drives a turbine linked to a generator. The electricity is then transfered to the local electricity grid. 
It is then used to supply electricity to commercial and residential customers. 
There are no waste products created through this process. Instead, a valuable by-product emerges in the form of a nitrogen-free ash, which is marketed as an environmentally friendly fertilizer. 
The legislation I am introducing today will provide a tax credit to energy facilities that use poultry manure as a fuel to generate electricity. 
It will build on concepts in the tax code that provide incentives for environmentally friendly energy production. 
I am introducing this legislation in an effort to encourage the development of another environmentally-friendly method of producing electricity, while at the same time tackling a thorny animal waste disposal problem. 
This legislation will provide incentives to build an energy plant that will not only dispose of poultry manure and create clean electricity, but will also supply our nation's farmers with a clean fertilizer free of nitrates. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill, the Poultry Electric Energy Power Act, affectionately known as the PEEP Act. It is important for future generations that we continue to explore green technologies that will protect our environment.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 2, 1998 the U.S.S. Missouri, arguably our nation's most famous battleship, will be permanently berthed at Pearl Harbor. The Missouri, with its remarkable and gallant history of naval combat in the United States Navy, will serve as a fitting monument to those Americans who fought and died in the name of freedom, liberty, and justice. 
However, I must confess that the remembrance of the events surrounding the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor also rekindles a painful memory of one of the great injustices that occurred within our own ranks during World War II, an injustice that still remains, an injustice that continues to tarnish our nation's military honor. 
Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were the two senior commanders of U.S. military forces deployed in the Pacific at the time of the disastrous surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, these two commanders were unfairly held singularly responsible for the success of the attack. They were scapegoated. 
First, they were publicly accused of dereliction of duty by a hastily conducted investigation. Then, when subsequent investigations conducted during World War II exonerated these officers, those findings were kept secret on the grounds that they undercut the war effort. 
But, what is most unforgivable is that after the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a near permanent veneer when the President of the United States declined to advance Admiral Kimmel and General Short on the retired list to their highest ranks of war-time command--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who served in war-time positions above their grade. As Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific and United States Fleets, Admiral Kimmel, a two star, served as a four star commander. Major General Short, also a two star, served as a three star commander when he was the Commanding General of the Army's Hawaiian Department. 
Today, this singular exclusion from advancement on the military's retired list only perpetuates the myth that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were derelict in their duty and singularly responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This is a distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States. It is clearly inconsistent with the most basic notion of fairness and justice. Such scapegoating is inconsistent with this great nation's unmatched military honor. 
It is high time that this injustice suffered by General Short and Admiral Kimmel be rectified. Toward that end, I introduce on behalf of myself, Senator Biden, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Chairman of the Veterans Committee and Senators Inouye, Cochran, Hollings, Faircloth and Durbin, a joint resolution intended to right this longstanding injustice. 
The joint resolution calls upon the President to posthumously advance on the retirement list Major General Short's grade to Lieutenant General--his rank of command as Commanding General of the Army's Hawaiian Department and Rear Admiral Kimmel's grade to Admiral--his rank of command as Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet. 
The facts that constitute the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short have been remarkably documented over time--which is one the reasons that I am disappointed that after fifty-seven years this injustice has not been rectified. 
Since the attack on Pearl Harbor back in December of 1941, there have been numerous investigations and histories on the job performance of Kimmel and Short. These include nine official governmental investigations and reports and one inquiry conducted by a special Joint Congressional Committee. Findings of six of these inquiries are noted in the resolution. 
Perhaps the most flawed, and unfortunately most influential investigation, was that of the Roberts Commission. Less than 6 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack, it presented a hastily prepared report to the President accusing Kimmel and Short of dereliction of duty--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized. 
Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of the Roberts Commission later and disavowed its report, stated that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were `martyred' and `if they had been brought to trial, they would have been cleared of the charge.' 
Later, Admiral J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, wrote: 
In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in the minds of the American people, and in the way it was drawn up for that specific purpose, I believe that the report of the Roberts Commission was the most unfair, unjust, and deceptively dishonest document ever printed by the Government Printing Office. 
The highly publicized accusation of that infamous investigation contributed to the inaccurate myth that these two officers were singularly responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Since 1941 a number of official investigations provided clear evidence that these two commanders were unfairly singled out for blame that should have been widely shared with their senior commanders. These reports include, among others, a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, a 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional Committee Report, and more recently a 1991 Army Board for the Correction of Military Records. The findings of these official reports are described in the Resolution and can be summarized as four principal points. 
First, the investigations provide ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not provided vital intelligence that they needed and that was available in Washington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their senior commanders had critical information about Japanese intentions, plans, and actions, but neither passed this on nor took issue or attempted to correct the disposition of forces under Kimmel's and Short's commands. 
Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were consistent with the information that was made available to Admiral Kimmel and General Short. Based on the information available to the Hawaiian commanders, the forces under their command at Pearl Harbor were properly disposed. 
In my review of this case, I was most struck by the honor and integrity demonstrated by General George Marshall who was Army Chief of Staff at the time of the attack. General Short interpreted a vaguely written war warning message sent from the high command in Washington on November 27, 1941 as suggesting the need to defend against sabotage. Consequently, when he concentrated his aircraft away from perimeter roads to protect them, he inadvertently increased their vulnerability to air attack. When he reported his preparations to the General Staff in Washington, the General Staff never took steps to clarify the reality of the situation. 
The Report of the Joint Congressional Committee of 1946 is testament to General Marshall's sense of honor and integrity. General Marshall testified that as Chief of Staff, he was responsible for ensuring the proper disposition of General Short's forces. He acknowledged that he must have seen General Short's report, which would have been his opportunity to issue a corrective message, and that he failed to do so. 
Mr. President, I only wish that the force of General Marshall's integrity and sense of responsibility had greater influence over the management of the case of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. 
A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the Department of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the flow of intelligence. The Dorn Report completed in 1995 for the Deputy Secretary of Defense at the request of Senator Thurmond stated that the 
handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by `ineptitude * * * limited coordination * * * ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and follow-up,' among other serious faults. The bottom line is that poor command decisions and inefficient management structures and procedures blocked the flow of essential intelligence from Washington to the Hawaiian commanders. 
The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned reports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed only upon the Hawaiian commanders. Some of these reports completely absolved these two officers. While others found them to have made errors in judgement, all the reports subsequent to the Roberts Commission cleared them of the charge of dereliction of duty. 
And, Mr. President, all those reports identified significant failures and shortcomings of the senior commanders in Washington that contributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The Dorn Report put it best, stating that `responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly shared.' 
Mr. President, I would like to emphasize two points about these investigations. First, these two officers were repeatedly denied their requests--their requests--for courts martial. 
Second, the conclusions of the 1944 Naval Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been properly disposed according to the information available to them and that criticized their superior officers for not sharing important intelligence--were kept secret on the grounds that they were detrimental to the war effort. 
For reasons unexplainable to me, the scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General Short has survived the cleansing tides of history. It is an unambiguous fact that responsibility for the success of the Pearl Harbor attack lies with the failure of their superiors situated in Washington to provide them the intelligence that was available. 
One can make the case that back in the midst of World War II, allowing blame to fall and remain solely on Admiral Kimmel and General Short helped prevent the American people from losing confidence in their national leadership. But perpetuating the cruel myth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the disaster at Pearl Harbor is not only unfair, it blemishes the military honor of our nation. 
This issue of fairness and justice has been raised not only by General Short and Admiral Kimmel and their surviving families today, but also by numerous senior officers and public organizations around the country.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Mr. Bingaman to submit a resolution to state the sense of the Senate that the Governments of the United States and Japan should place priority on formulating a comprehensive and strategic policy of advancing science and technology for the benefit of both nations as well as the rest of the world. 
As this body is well aware, Japan is facing a number of economic and financial challenges that are of vital importance to the bilateral relationship. I have spoken about these challenges at length in other fora including through a hearing recently held by the Finance Committee. While our priority in bilateral relations should remain Japan's rapid economic recovery, we must not lose sight of other aspects of the relationship that are important to our shared future. 
For example, Japan is a major source of leading-edge science and technology. Two years ago, the Government of Japan released its Basic Plan for Science and Technology. That plan called for substantial funding increases and important policy reforms to further innovation in the country's science and technology programs and processes. 
This year, the Government of Japan will increase its investment in science and technology by more than 21 percent. With these new resources, Japan--already at the forefront in many areas of science and technology--will be poised to make further important advances. 
For decades, the U.S. has shared the fruit of its own basic research with Japan and the rest of the world in an effort to enhance global prosperity and the lives of average people around the world. With its increased resources devoted to science and technology, Japan has a more important opportunity to join the United States in taking a similar approach toward sharing advances in science and technology. The potential for greater benefits for both countries and for the rest of the world are enormous. 
For example, opportunities are emerging to improve human health by jointly addressing the problems posed by infectious diseases; sustaining the quality of the environment through research on global climate change; reducing the risks posed by earthquakes and hurricanes; furthering the fundamental understanding of matter so important for advances in new materials, telecommunications, and new medical treatments; and better ensuring mutual security. 
Partly because Japan was engaged in catching up with other leaders in science and technology for much of the postwar period, Tokyo tended to emphasize the accumulation--rather than the sharing--of information. Now that Japan is a global leader in science and technology, however, I believe Tokyo should move toward greater emphasis on cooperation. Similarly, I believe it important that Japan pay more attention to basic research that advances general knowledge as opposed to Tokyo's traditional emphasis on applied research. 
The potential for a greater bilateral partnership in science and technology is growing, and both the U.S. and Japanese governments should work toward turning that potential into reality. That is the purpose of this resolution and I urge my colleagues to support its early passage.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, as I stated earlier today, I am a strong proponent of fixing the marriage penalty. it is a top priority of the Finance Committee in our efforts to reform the Tax Code. But it must be done properly. And such is not the case with this amendment--nor with the amendment proposed this morning. As I said this morning, the bill on which my colleagues are trying to attach marriage penalty legislation is an appropriations bill. It is not a tax bill. 
As this Treasury-Postal appropriations bill is not a revenue measure--and as all revenue measures must originate in the House of Representatives--this one amendment could subject the entire bill to a blue slip. In other words, Madam President, adding a revenue measure that originates in the Senate to a nonrevenue bill, will sink the entire bill. Under the rules, any member in the House can raise an objection and kill this appropriations bill. And that is in no one's interest. 
So while I agree in principle with the objective of reforming the marriage penalty--I would be remiss in my duties if I did not make it clear that passing this amendment at this time is inappropriate. Whether the marriage penalty fix is paid for, or not, it must be handled in Congress as the Constitution requires. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Personal Retirement Accounts Act of 1998. This legislation has a simple but powerful purpose--to establish personal retirement accounts for working Americans. In my view, these accounts promise to give working Americans not only a more secure retirement future but a new stake in the Nation's economic growth. And, as I will describe, these accounts may provide the model for future Social Security reform. 
A few years ago personal retirement accounts were an exotic and even controversial concept. But no longer! In 1996, a majority of a Clinton Administration task force on Social Security reform endorsed the concept. Today, personal retirement accounts are a bipartisan, even mainstream, idea. In March, Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, and Senator Kerrey introduced legislation that would create retirement accounts as part of an overhaul of Social Security. 
And earlier this month, bipartisan, bicameral Social Security reform legislation that included personal retirement accounts was introduced by Senators Gregg and Breaux in the Senate, and by Congressmen Kolbe and Stenholm in the House. Their bill is based on the unanimous recommendations of a privately sponsored National Commission on Retirement Policy--comprised of 24 lawmakers, economists, pension experts, and businessmen. 
Yesterday, at a Social Security town hall meeting in Albquqerque, NM, the President said he had an `open mind' on personal retirement accounts. And in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last week, a top Clinton Administration official offered several guidelines for designing such accounts, including efficiency, such as low administrative costs, and protection of the progressive benefits. My bill meets these guidelines. 
Mr. President, let me explain why retirement accounts find so much support--not only in Congress but among the American people. With even conservative investment, such accounts have the potential to provide Americans with a substantial retirement nest egg, and an estate they can leave to their children and grandchildren. 
Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic growth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. More Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers. 
Creating these accounts may encourage Americans to save more. Today, Americans save less than people in almost every other country. But personal retirement accounts will demonstrate to all Americans the magic of compound interest as even small savings grow significantly over time. 
Lastly, creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare for retirement. According to the CRS, 60 percent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement program other than Social Security. A recent survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute found that only about 45 percent of working Americans have tried to calculate how much they will need for retirement. It is my belief that retirement accounts will prompt Americans--particularly baby boomers--to think more about retirement planning. 
Mr. President, let me describe a few of the features of my bill. First, the program would run for 5 years, from 1999 to 2003, utilizing half the budget surplus projected by CBO earlier this month. 
Each year, every working American who earned a minimum of 4 quarters of Social Security coverage--about $2,900 in 1999--would receive a deposit in his or her personal retirement account. About 127 million Americans would receive a deposit in 1999. 
The formula for sharing the surplus among the accounts is progressive. Each eligible individual would receive a minimum amount of $250 per year, plus an additional amount based on how much they paid in payroll taxes. 
Over the life of the program, a minimum wage earner--someone earning $12,400 this year--would receive about $1,720. That amount is equal to a 34-percent rebate of his or her payroll taxes. 
An average wage earner--earning $27,600--would receive about $2,300--equal to a 20-percent rebate of payroll taxes. And an individual who paid the maximum Social Security tax would get $3,840, a 14-percent rebate of payroll taxes. These figures do not include any investment income or deductions for the costs of running the program. 
Account holders would have three investment choices--prudent choices that balance risk and return. The three choices are a stock index fund--a mutual fund that reflects the overall performance of the stock market; a fund that invests in corporate bonds and other fixed income securities; and a fund that invests in U.S. Treasury bonds. 
However, my legislation also provides for a study of additional investment 
options--of other types of investment funds and investment managers. 
An account holder would become eligible for benefits when he or she signs up for Social Security. An individual could choose between an annuity or annual payments based on life expectancy. 
The bill also provides a number of features to ensure the program is properly run. First, the program would be neither on budget nor off budget. Instead, the program would be outside the Federal budget. The money in the program could be used for no other purpose than retirement benefits and the program's operating expenses. 
Second, the program would be supervised by a new, independent Personal Retirement Board, with members appointed by the President and Congressional leaders and subject to Senate confirmation. Board officials would be fiduciaries, and required by law to act only in the best financial interests of beneficiaries. 
Lastly, the stock funds would be managed by private sector investment managers. To insulate companies represented in the stock funds from politics, no board official or other government employee would be eligible to vote company proxies--only the investment managers. 
Mr. President, the design of this personal retirement accounts plan follows a proven model--the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Back in 1983, when I was Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the retirement program for Federal employees needed to be revamped. One of the new elements we added was the Federal Thrift Savings Plan--a defined contribution employee benefit plan--that has been a great success. 
Mr. President, many Americans will undoubtedly ask, `What size nest egg might grow in my personal retirement account?' According to an analysis done by Social Security's actuaries, someone earning the minimum wage would have an account worth about $2,150 in 2004, assuming a 7.5 percent interest rate. For the average wage earner, the account would be worth about $2,870, and for the individual paying the maximum Social Security tax, about $4,770. 
Of course, over the long term, accounts can grow significantly. For the minimum wage person, after 40 years--in 2039--his or her account would be worth about $27,000; the average wage earner would have $36,000; and the person paying the maximum payroll tax, $60,000. 
Mr. President, some might ask, `Why start with personal retirement accounts rather than proposing comprehensive Social Security reform?' Indeed, my bill will not affect the current Social Security program. Personal retirement accounts are an exciting concept, but still a big job, requiring careful work by the Finance Committee. 
And unlike many other Social Security reform proposals, retirement accounts have broad support. So let's get these accounts up and running, proven and tested, while Congress considers carefully protecting and preserving Social Security for the long term. 
Mr. President, in closing, let me add that personal retirement accounts have another big promise. Such accounts--if later made a part of Social Security--may help restore the confidence of the American people in Social Security. Polls show that Social Security is among the most popular of government programs, deservedly so. But many Americans--particularly young Americans--appear to have lost confidence in the program. They believe that there will be no benefits for them when they retire. Personal retirement accounts will provide the accountability and assurances that Americans are asking for. 
I encourage my colleagues to take a careful look at my bill, and I invite members to co-sponsor it. 
Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed into the Record.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment offered by Senator Brownback. I appreciate the work he and others have done. I agree with the premise of this amendment. 
We need to provide much needed marriage penalty relief to American families. We all know how unfair the marriage penalty is. We have heard from our constituents. We see how it cuts into the family budget. We realize that it must be changed. Our laws should not penalize married couples and their families. 
Over the years, I have been a forceful advocate for marriage penalty relief. In fact, during the recent consideration of the tobacco bill, I cosponsored an amendment that would have provided such relief. I have also stated many times that marriage penalty relief should be included in any package of tax cuts. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I remain committed to that position. 
As we look to real and meaningful tax reform, we will take care of the marriage penalty. This will be one of our top priorities. But addressing this important issue must be done at the proper time and in the proper way. This is not the time, nor is this appropriations bill the appropriate vehicle to proceed with this amendment. This is a tax issue. It does not belong on this appropriations bill. It did not come through the committee of jurisdiction. That committee is the Finance Committee. 
I know many of my colleagues agree with me when it comes to the marriage penalty. They are seeking an opportunity, as I am, to address it and find a remedy as quickly as we can. This will be our objective in the future. We intend to take care of this in the right way. I ask our colleagues outside the committee to support it. 
Adoption of this amendment at this time would not only disrupt the proper order of things and result in the loss of appropriate and constructive debate within the Finance Committee, but, equally important, it would subject the entire Treasury-Postal appropriations bill to a blue slip from the House of Representatives. Revenue measures must originate in the House. If not, any Member--I emphasize `any Member'--of the House can raise an objection. The result would be that this appropriations bill dies. And that is not in anyone's interest. 
While I completely agree with the objective and necessity of this amendment, while I remain a staunch ally of those who seek to provide marriage penalty relief, I cannot vote for this amendment. 
I ask my colleagues to vote with me. Allow the Finance Committee and the Senate to address this important issue in a way that is correct and will bring real and lasting tax relief to married couples and families. 
Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Texas wants to address this matter.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am in the contradictory position of agreeing in substance with this amendment. There is no question in my mind that it is wrong to penalize married couples who pay more taxes than if they were single. As I have said, it is a matter that must be corrected. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I shall work mightily to see that this is accomplished. 
But the fact is that this is a revenue measure. If this amendment is adopted, it subjects the entire Treasury-Postal appropriations to a blue slip from the House of Representatives. Under our Constitution, revenue measures must originate in the House. If not, any Member--and, again, I emphasize any Member--of the House can raise an objection. The result would be that this appropriations bill dies. I do not think that is in anyone's interest. For that reason, I move to table the amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, throughout my career, I have been a strong proponent of tax reform. I have made no bones about the fact that the tax burden borne by Americans is onerous and counter-productive to real economic growth, jobs, and opportunity. I have made it clear that we stand in need of tax reform--a tax code that is simple and fair, placing the needs and growth of our families and communities before the needs and growth of the Federal bureaucracy. 
I am encouraged by the developing consensus for serious tax reform. As chairman of the Finance Committee, this is among my highest priorities. And I look forward to working closely with my colleagues toward building a promising new tax system that will open a world of possibilities as America moves into the 21st century. 
At this time, however, I caution my colleagues to not let the momentum we are gathering overtake our constructive endeavors. 
To sunset the current tax code without first structuring a better system would be something like quitting your job before first establishing where your new place of employment is going to be. While such a move may be satisfying and even exciting, when you have a mortgage, some personal debt, and a family depending on your income it is not only imprudent, but could result in devastating consequences. 
Prudence, control, and careful planning--that's what our tax reform efforts require from us. Sunsetting the tax code without an alternative in place would create pandemonium in the marketplace. 
What would it do to our credit rating? To our ability to meet current responsibilities? How would it be perceived internationally, among our economic partners, and in the global banking community? And how would it affect our families and business community? How do they plan? Where do Americans put their money for retirement, for pensions, for investment, for housing? What will happen to the home mortgage deduction? And how will that influence the real estate and homebuilding markets? 
Today the Dow Jones industrial average is down because of recent corporate earning reports and developments in the investigation into the President. Can you imagine what will happen when news hits that the tax code is going to be sunset without a consensus or even a blueprint for a replacement? 
If Congress votes to sunset the tax code and does not enact a replacement by December 31, 2002, what happens? We need a tax system--despite how much I would prefer it to be otherwise. 
If there is no replacement by December 31, 2002--if Congress has not yet reached a consensus, if the decision--the best Congress can do--is to extend the tax code we have voted to sunset then that extension would, in effect, become the single largest tax increase in history! 
I do no want to be party to that. I don't think any of my colleagues do. 
To tear down the tax code before Americans know what will replace it is dangerous. We must work to change the current system. Toward this end, I pledge my every effort. 
We must eliminate the current code's complexity. We must bring relief to those who are bearing a back-breaking load. We don't need to fiddle at the edges of the current code. We can change the code altogether. We can create an innovative and promising code for a new century. But we must do it in an organized and orderly way. To vote for this amendment is to pass the buck to future Congresses. We can go home and declare victory for taking a strong stand for tax reform, but then the issue will still have to be addressed, a consensus will still have to be developed, Americans will still need to be included in such an important effort. 
I am sympathetic to this amendment. Emotionally, it appeals to me. But it is not right. It is not right analytically. It is not good public policy. And it, in fact, is not right Constitutionally. Only the House can originate a revenue measure. This vote would constitute a revenue measure, and--as such--would be subject to a blue slip. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this amendment and join me, and the many others who realize the importance of real tax reform, in working for a successful new code. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to express my profound respect and appreciation for Officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, two men whose lives were tragically cut short on Friday as they stood watch in the Capitol--a building that is, as we have constantly been reminded this weekend, `the People's House.' Officer Chestnut was 58--a loving husband, a veteran of Vietnam, the father of five children, and the grandfather of another five. 
Officer Gibson was 42--a bright young man, full of energy and good works, who had dedicated his life to protecting others. Like Officer Chestnut, he, too, was a loving husband and the father of three. 
Today, both men are gone. We mourn their loss and express our deepest condolences to their families. We acknowledge that we will never fully understand what would motivate such a heinous act of violence against the innocent in a building that is the icon of Democracy, but we know that in stopping such brutality--in saving the lives of how many tourists, staff members and Congressmen we will never know--the names of John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut are etched forever in the pantheon of heroes. 
All who are indebted to them--myself included--will from this day forward speak their names in reverence. Their courage will inspire those who will hear told the tale of their sacrifices. While their children, their grandchildren and great grandchildren will stand tall--living legacies of extraordinary men. 
In expressing our gratitude to these brave officers, we also acknowledge the skill, professionalism and dedication of the other 1,250 members of the United States Capitol Police force. They are among the most highly trained and well-respected law enforcement officers in the world. 
Members of Congress, congressional staff, tourists, and all those who come and go through these buildings are blessed to have these men and women on the ramparts. Our hearts are with them as well, as they mourn the loss of their two distinguished colleagues and friends. 
It is never easy, Mr. President, to weather a tragedy of this kind. There is little, if anything, that can be done to console loved ones and to reassure the children of men whose lives were lost that the principles and sense of duty for which their fathers stood are the very virtues which sustain life's goodness. But in time, they will be assured. 
They will come to discover--as we all discover--that such principles are eternal: service, selflessness, sacrifice. Their meanings resonate beyond mortality. And we come to acknowledge the simple truth written more than 2,000 years ago: Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his life for a friend.

Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York for yielding to me. I congratulate him and his colleague, Senator Sarbanes, for bringing this legislation before us. 
I want to take this opportunity to restate my support for Delaware's credit unions. As we all know, months ago, a Supreme Court decision placed the viability and future of credit unions in limbo. For that reason, I am particularly pleased that the Senate will be voting next week on H.R. 1151, a bill to ensure credit unions will be able to add new member groups. 
Mr. President, I support credit unions because I know how vital they are to the financial health of thousands of Delaware families and businesses. These nonprofit member-run institutions are unique. Their sole purpose is to provide financial services to their members at the best rates and under the most favorable conditions possible. 
Savvy consumers know that credit unions are often a great option. Their ATM fees are reasonable or nonexistent; single-digit credit card interest rates are common at credit unions; and your child's first savings account won't face a monthly low-balance fee. I don't think I mentioned, I say to my distinguished Senator from New York, you can also set up a Roth IRA. 
All Senators have undoubtedly heard from the thousands of credit union members in their States. Their message is one of self-sufficiency and of low-cost, low-fee consumer-based financial services. Credit unions are good for families, good for businesses, and they are good for Delaware. 
H.R. 1115 is necessary for these valuable institutions to thrive. 
Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking member for their role in bringing this legislation to this point. I look forward to voting for this legislation next Monday.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday's 96 to 2 vote to reform the Internal Revenue Service was a victory for the American people. I am grateful for the cooperation we received from our colleagues. I am grateful for the support that came from our constituents. And I very much appreciate the willing participation that came from individuals within the Internal Revenue Service itself. 
From the beginning of our intensive investigation, and throughout our hearings, I made it clear that the IRS is filled with hard-working, honorable men and women. 
We depend on these individuals, on their integrity and expertise to carry out a complex and often thankless task--yet a task that is fundamentally important to the welfare and future of America. Had it not been for those within the IRS who were concerned about the abuses they witnessed--had they not come forward to speak with us--there would have been no hearing. There would have been no reform effort--no change. And the abuses would have continued. 
What our investigation focused on was the culture of the agency. It focused on an environment that had been allowed to establish itself because of rules that granted excessive license to those inclined to abuse power--an environment that lacked sufficient oversight. This was the culprit. And I am grateful that after an attempt early on in our investigation to circle the wagons concerning the Finance Committee's efforts, the IRS--under the fine leadership of Commissioner Charles Rossotti--determined to work with us, not against us. 
Two reports issued today speak volumes about the spirit of cooperation Commissioner Rossotti demonstrated. They validate each of the concerns raised in our investigation. They are filled with examples that support those that we heard from the courageous witnesses who addressed our committee. They remove any question concerning the appropriateness or necessity of the extensive investigation we undertook. And they make it clear that our conclusions, and consequently our legislative outcome, were right on target. 
I appreciate the honesty and candor that is contained in these two internal audits. Prepared by the agency's Chief Inspector's office at my request, they offer a thorough and objective analysis of serious problems within the agency's culture. Among other things, these reports paint a vivid picture of how the IRS' Examination Division used performance measures and statistics, compelling auditors and examination personnel to inflate taxpayer liabilities. They show how the Collection Division abused seizure authority, in one case turning a taxpayer's life upside down for the grand sum of four dollars and seventeen cents! 
The reports even documented the most troubling issue of how the Internal Revenue Service would often go after taxpayers who were most vulnerable--those suffering from medical problems or severe financial setbacks. According to the internal audits, `the seizure[s] demonstrated insensitivity to the taxpayer's current situation or [were] conducted to enhance statistical measures.' 
These reports are astonishing in the scope of the taxpayer abuse they confirm and in the fact that they come from the agency itself. In the case of the man whose business was seized and sold to net the IRS four dollars and seventeen cents, the report states clearly that, `The revenue officer did not use sound * * * judgment when conducting this low dollar seizure.' 
And this is only one of many such cases documented, Mr. President. In these two reports, Americans will find a stunning array of similar abuses. 
The reports make it clear that the agency's focus on goals and statistics come at the expense of quality service and fair treatment of taxpayers. They came at the expense of fairness to IRS employees. One report admits that a full 74 percent of group manager evaluations contained references to enforcement statistics. The evaluations cited dollars per hour, hours per return, and dollars recommended for collection. 
The reports make it clear that districts routinely communicated goals and enforcement statistics to group managers and employees. 
In fact, the agency admits that such statistics were `communicated in all 12 districts through newsletters, monthly reports of Examination activity, group meetings, and similar methods. Enforcement statistics,' the report continues, `were often in referenced to how group managers and employees were doing in relation to district or group goals.' 
Cast after case is cited in these reports to illustrate how these activities within the agency adversely influenced the lives of taxpayers. In one example, collections officers did not even attempt to contact the taxpayer prior to seizing his property. The revenue officer confirmed the taxpayer's address and ownership of assets two days before seizing them. And what did the IRS seize? The tools the taxpayer needed to provide for his family. Even the taxpayer's 11-year-old daughter pleaded with the collections officer to halt the action, but the activity proceeded--the seizure producing a measly net proceed of $20! 
Again, Mr. President, these stories are not coming from witnesses whose credibility might be challenged. They are admissions made by the Internal Revenue Service itself. 
Nearly half of the seizures examined in these reports indicate that improper or abusive tactics were used against the taxpayer. Not only does this validate our findings, but the very existence of these internal audits demonstrate that a new era is drawing on an agency that for far too long has been operating in darkness. It looks to be an era of openness--of cooperation--and accountability. I laud the current leadership, Commissioner Rossotti, and those who support him in what will be an historic turning point in the life of the agency. What a legacy they will leave! 
And again, I express my gratitude to colleagues who stood firm in our effort to change the way the IRS does business. Our reform legislation, which I expect will be signed by the President in the very near future, will go a long way toward preventing the types of abuses chronicled in these reports. We are increasing oversight of the agency and holding employees accountable for their actions. We are ensuring that taxpayers have due process protections in collections activities. We are prohibiting the IRS from using enforcement statistics. 
This is a moment in which we can all be proud. The successful passage of reform legislation yesterday, the bipartisan spirit that marked our investigation and subsequent debate, the willingness of the agency, itself, to cooperate--all of these are to be credited.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to just take a few seconds to thank my colleagues for their support in this most important initiative. It has been less than a year that we have really been dealing with this problem. Today, we have seen the enactment of truly historic legislation. 
It is my firm conviction that because of this reform legislation, it will mean a new day for the American taxpayer. And the reason I think this legislation has had such broad support is that it is not only good for the American taxpayer, but it is good for the agency itself, it is good for the employees who work there. All we seek is an agency that provides service, stability, and fairness to the American people. 
I can tell you that we would not have succeeded in this effort if we had not had bipartisan support. 
I particularly want to pay my respect and thanks to the ranking member, Pat Moynihan, who is a joy to work with, and who always is able to help move along desirable legislation. It was not only due to his efforts, but to many others too many to enumerate. But I particularly want to thank the staff of the Finance Committee, both Republican and Democrat, and of the Joint Committee on Taxation for their contribution. I can tell you that much of the staff worked day in and day out, night after night, and on weekends to make this possible today. 
I, again, want to thank all those who contributed so much. We look forward to seeing an agency that is reformed become service-oriented. 
I believe, I say to Senator Moynihan, that we have given the tools to the new Commissioner, Rossotti, that will enable him to make the changes we all seek in a bipartisan fashion.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Wellstone amendment as it will halt the momentum of welfare reform which has gained bipartisan acclaim for reducing the welfare rolls by 34 percent from the peak level in 1994. This amendment is a step backwards, and it will surely invite additional means of thwarting welfare reform. 
The Wellstone amendment has little to do with education. It will weaken the work participation requirements under welfare reform for which the States are to be held accountable. The Wellstone amendment will create three new loopholes through which States will be tempted to avoid their responsibility for helping families gain the work experience they need to achieve self-sufficiency. 
First, the Wellstone amendment will double the amount of time in vocational education from 12 months to 24 months that can be counted as meeting the work requirement. Second, it allows postsecondary education to be counted as work in the same manner as vocational education. And, finally, it removes parents up to age 20 from the 30 percent cap on the number of individuals who can be counted in educational activity. In other words, it will expand the number of people who can be in educational activities rather than in the workplace. This amendment will significantly weaken the work requirements which deserve some of the credit for the decline in the welfare rolls. And the effect of this amendment is to keep individuals on welfare for a longer period of time. 
If this amendment passes, many more variations on this theme will follow, and without restrictions on the number of individuals counted in nonwork activities, there will be no meaningful work participation rates. Raising these limits is another way of unraveling welfare reform. 
The grave injustice of weakening the work requirement is that it takes the pressure off the States to assist the hardest to serve, and it also requires an inequity among welfare recipients. A person who does not have a high school degree must work first. Only after such a person has worked 20 hours a week does any education count toward his or her work requirement. But a person who is in postsecondary education will not be required to work. Under this amendment, college will count from the very beginning of the work requirement but reading, writing, and arithmetic will not. One of the harshest indictments of the former welfare system is that it shrugged its shoulders at the indifference to welfare dependency. It did nothing to help those with little skills and education to find the path to independence. 
The key to forcing the States to serve this most needy population is the work participation rate. Every time the work participation rate is weakened, it simply makes it easier for the States to do nothing for those who are hardest to serve, and that is the effect of this amendment. And this we should not do. 
The work participation requirement on the States is an issue which the Senate has now acted upon four times in the past 3 years. The Senate has debated this issue at length, and there is no demonstrated need to reopen the bipartisan welfare reform agreement. The Wellstone amendment simply does not belong on the higher education bill. Make no mistake about this amendment, its purpose is not about providing education to welfare recipients; it will begin to unravel welfare reform. 
The picture emerging from the states is crystal clear: welfare reform is working and work is the key reason. In March 1994, a record 5.1 million families were on the old AFDC program. There are now 3.4 million families receiving welfare assistance, a decline of 34 percent. 
As the General Accounting Office found in its recent report to Congress on welfare implementation, the `work first' strategy has been a central feature of states' efforts to shift the emphasis from entitlement to self-sufficiency. 
This strategy is working. States and counties which found the education and training model to be unsuccessful in moving recipients into work and self-sufficiency in the past are now helping more families find employment. 
GAO reports that more families are participating in work activities than under the old JOBS programs and are able to keep more of their earnings while maintaining eligibility. 
Another sign of success is in growth in wages. Oregon is among the states which are following the progress of families that have left the welfare rolls. 
By matching job placements with data on employer-related wages, Oregon found that between 1993 and 1996, those former recipients who remained employed experienced a wage growth averaging 14 percent per year. 
The states and the families are making progress. This is no time to change direction. 
This amendment is not about helping individuals get off welfare. 
The Wellstone amendment is about keeping people on welfare, even people who are seeking college degrees. 
Let us make it clear that federal law allows a person to receive welfare while she is in vocational school or even in college. Under current law, welfare recipients can participate in vocational education training, job skills training, education directly related to employment, or attend school to earn a high school diploma or GED. All of these count as work activities. 
Indeed, the new welfare law allows states to use welfare funds to pay for expenses related to a person's education if they so choose. 
There is plenty of flexibility already built into the new welfare system if the states choose to make accommodations for individuals pursuing post-secondary education. A number of states have already created special programs to provide assistance to students while in college, so models are available. And, because of the decline in the welfare caseload, sanctions for failure to meet the work participation rate is not really an issue for all but a couple of states. 
From a very practical standpoint, the Wellstone amendment is not really needed. But it sends the wrong message at the wrong time. 
The Wellstone amendment is simply not needed to allow someone to pursue her educational training she chooses to advance. 
The evidence of this comes from the `National Evaluation of Welfare to Work Strategies' which was recently released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education. 
This study, as conducted by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, tracks over 55,000 individuals in seven sites across the country. 
The first report examines the outcomes of welfare recipients in Atlanta, Georgia, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Riverside County, California. 
The studies include both individuals who are directed toward a `work first' approach and those who are assigned to educational activities. 
MDRC found that many individuals pursued their educational interests outside of the welfare programs which were offered. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, for example, MDRC found that about 34 percent of those in Grand Rapids `work first' approach reported they were already enrolled in an education or training program at the point they were randomly assigned to a research group. 
Moreover, MDRC found individuals were almost as likely, or more likely, to participate in basic education or college outside of the JOBS program as they were as part of JOBS. 
In other words, participation in basic education and college, was self-initiated. People are going to pursue educational opportunities if they believe that is in their best interest. 
Mr. President, the Wellstone amendment is simply another attempt to weaken the work participation requirements by excluding people from being counted under the cap on educational activities. 
Under the existing cap, no more than 30 percent of individuals engaged in work may be included in the calculation of work participation rates because they are in vocational training or in educational activities. 
The Wellstone amendment contains another feature which is troubling. It sends a very mixed message among those on welfare who are the hardest to serve. 
In general, if an individual is going to college or is in a two-year vocational educational program, that individual already has two advantages many welfare recipients do not--academic success and some means to support the pursuit of higher education. For these individuals, school alone meets the obligation to work 20 hours per week. 
But if you do not have a high school degree, you go to work first. 
For these individuals, the state receives credit for their basic education only after they work 20 hours per week. 
Mr. President, we have encouraging studies coming in which demonstrate that work requirements work. 
The `National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies' has found that in terms of comparing a labor force attachment strategy to an education and training strategy, work wins. 
This study shows that an emphasis on employment leads to higher earnings for the welfare family, is less expensive to operate, and produces higher savings to the taxpayers. 
So, there is evidence to suggest while the education approach is good, work is better. But just as I do not believe that we should re-open welfare reform to impose even tougher work requirements on the states, neither should we adopt the Wellstone amendment. I simply do not believe the rules should be changed at this point in time. 
More importantly, by weakening the work requirements, we risk falling back into the same trap of the old welfare system in which it was all too easy for the states to do nothing for those who need the most assistance in finding the pathway to independence. The Wellstone amendment turns its back on the hardest to serve and should be rejected.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if my colleagues' July Fourth recess was anything like mine, then they heard a great deal from their constituents concerning the bill that we bring to the floor today. The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 is legislation that not only has the interests but the support of Americans everywhere, and with good reason. 
For far too long, the Internal Revenue Service has been allowed to consolidate immense power without the counterbalance of accountability. For far too long, the agency has been allowed to operate in darkness, hiding behind section 6103 authority, using authority granted them by Congress to, in some cases, bludgeon taxpayers. 
Last summer, the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, following an extensive review of the IRS, issued a report that called for major changes to the agency. 
In September, the Finance Committee held 3 days of hearings which identified numerous additional problems and some terrible, even unconscionable taxpayer and IRS-employee abuses within the IRS. 
Those hearings were followed by others which demonstrated clearly that the Service was in need of serious reform. And we heard from taxpayers, tax collectors, tax practitioners. We heard from small business men and women. We heard from innocent spouses. And we listened to outrageous stories from innocent Americans who, for no valid reason, got caught in the crosshairs of an organization that was driven by quotas and lacking in oversight. 
Our outrage knew no partisan line. Colleagues on both sides of the aisle were offended by many of the stories. To the witnesses--many of whom testified without knowing what their efforts would bring--we apologized as best we could. We said that we would press forward, and we promised reform. That, Mr. President, is what we are delivering today. 
This is the bipartisan conference agreement on a plan that will effectively change the way the Internal Revenue Service does business. It represents the most comprehensive overhaul of the IRS ever enacted. It combines the House and Senate bills and incorporates the many good suggestions offered by the Agency's new Commissioner, Charles Rossotti. 
Let me be clear on just how important Mr. Rossotti has been to our efforts. Following our Finance Committee hearings, he had courage enough to release a report that validated the concerns we raised. Rather than try to throw up a wall or confuse issues, he made a commitment to reform. Every step we have taken he has taken with us. 
Commissioner Rossotti and I have met on many occasions, and he has testified before our committee. We have attended taxpayer service days together. He has advocated a new management plan that could revolutionize the way the Internal Revenue Service does business. 
I am also grateful for the taxpayers and the many current and former IRS employees who came before our committee. These were courageous individuals, and without them, there would be no reform. And they represent only a fraction of those who met with us, who wrote to us, who called, and, in the process, moved our investigation forward. Likewise, I am grateful to my colleagues--Senator Moynihan, a defining presence in the Senate, if ever there was one. I am grateful to Senators Charles Grassley and Bob Kerrey and their efforts on the National Restructuring Commission. 
Working with Congressman Portman, and others, they got the ball rolling early on, and were leaders in this effort. I thank Chairman Bill Archer for the work he did on the Ways and Means Committee, for the spirit of cooperation he brought to the conference, and for the success he had two weeks ago in getting this legislation approved overwhelmingly in the House. 
Now, the time has come, Mr. President, to pass it here--legislation that will open the door to real restructuring and reform of what can only be considered the most powerful agency in the United States government. 
This legislation is built on four principles: 
The first principle is to establish independent oversight of the agency to prevent abuses against taxpayers and against employees. One of the major concerns we heard throughout our oversight initiative was that the taxpayers who get caught in the IRS hall of mirrors have no place to turn that is truly independent and structured to represent their concerns. This legislation requires the agency to establish an independent Office of Appeals--one that may not be influenced by tax collection employees or auditors. 
Appeals officers will be made available in every state, and they will be better able to work with taxpayers who proceed through the appeals process. 
Mr. President, agency employees made it clear that there is no dependable and consistent mechanism in place to represent taxpayer interests. Just as this bill will give the appeals process greater independence, it will also make the Office of Taxpayer Advocate as well as local problem resolution officers more independent. 
In the future, the Secretary of Treasury, rather than the Commissioner will appoint the National Taxpayer Advocate. And the Taxpayer Advocate will be just that. Criteria to fill this position will include that the Advocate must not be an IRS employee two years before and five years after holding this position. In addition, this bill provides the Advocate with greater ability to issue an assistance order to help taxpayers. 
To ensure that independent review and accountability become part of the IRS culture--top to bottom--our legislation creates a nine-member IRS Oversight Board--a board composed of six experts from various professional fields in the private sector, the Commissioner, the Secretary of Treasury, and a full-time Federal employee, or a representative of employees. This board will be independent of influence from management and the senior executive corps. It will be able to monitor and hold managers and executives accountable for their actions, and the actions of their employees. 
Under our legislation, the Oversight Board will have broad responsibility and will ensure that the IRS has procedures in place to carry out its mission. I anticipate that the Board will be able to nip problems in the bud so that the IRS will not have to endure embarrassing Congressional hearings that expose systemic problems that should have been identified and addressed. 
These measures will go a long way toward protecting taxpayers and IRS personnel. To further protect IRS employees, this legislation creates a new Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. We heard far too often in our hearings that the current IRS Office of Chief Inspector does not have sufficient independence to adequately fulfill its obligation. Likewise, the current Treasury Inspector General lacks resources and has experienced problems of its own in providing seamless oversight of the agency. 
The new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will have greater independence than the IRS Chief Inspector. 
This provision is supported by Secretary Rubin and Commissioner Rossotti, and it will create a structure where the new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will not allow oversight to fall through the cracks. This new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will provide independent investigations of alleged IRS employee misconduct without management interference. 
The new Treasury IG will also respond in a timely manner to requests to investigate or audit made by the Commissioner or the IRS Oversight Board. 
Now, these measures will go a long way toward combating the intimidating culture that witnesses testified exists within the agency. They will provide independent protections and promote an agency that the public trusts--an agency that the employees can be proud of. 
The second principle incorporated in this legislation is to hold IRS employees accountable for their actions and to reward those who treat the taxpayer fairly. One of the problems we discovered in our hearings is that the Commissioner did not have the kind of authority that is necessary to streamline management and remove managers who contaminate the culture of the agency. Additionally, we found that the Commissioner does not have sufficient authority to hire those who will work toward making the kinds of changes that are necessary. 
This legislation changes that. It provides the Commissioner the tools he needs to hire top-flight managers who are experts in their field. It gives the Commissioner the wherewithal to transform the agency's work force by providing bonuses and other incentives, and to sufficiently discipline employees whose inappropriate actions harm the image and effectiveness of the agency. 
This bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if it is proven that the employee willfully failed to obtain required authorization to seize a taxpayer's property, committed perjury material to a taxpayer's matter, or falsified or destroyed documents to conceal the employee's mistakes with respect to a taxpayer's case. It allows terminations to take place if an IRS employee engages in abuses or egregious misconduct. 
Conditions for which an employee can be dismissed include, but are not limited to, assaulting or battering a taxpayer or other IRS employee, violating the civil rights of a taxpayer or other IRS employee, or breaking the law, regulations, or IRS policies for the purpose of retaliating or harassing a taxpayer or other IRS employee. Our legislation also allows an employee to be fired for willfully misusing section 6103 authority to conceal information from Congress. 
As I have said before, an environment that allows employees guilty of these kinds of behaviors to continue to work within the system is not acceptable to me, the Finance Committee, or to the American people. We have heard enough excuses. The time has come for change. And this legislation allows needed changes to take place. 
The third principle advocated by this legislation is to ensure that taxpayers are protected, that they have due process during collections activities. This includes requiring the IRS to obtain court approval before seizing a home. 
It also ensures that the burden of proof be lifted off the shoulders of the taxpayer when it's appropriate and placed on the agency. It allows necessary and long-overdue reforms to the interest and penalty system. This will guard taxpayers against the outrageous and often overbearing financial liability that occurs when the agency moves too slowly. 
With this legislation, the burden of proof is shifted to the IRS if the taxpayer maintains records, cooperates with the agency, and provides credible evidence to the court. In addition, the IRS will have the burden of proving a taxpayer's income if it uses arbitrary statistics to determine that income. 
Another major taxpayer protection in this legislation is our provision to strengthen innocent spouse relief. Some of the most tragic stories our committee heard concerned innocent spouses whose lives have been ruined by the unrelenting pursuit of IRS collections officers. 
This legislation allows divorced or separated spouses to elect to limit their liability for a tax deficiency to the amount of the tax that is attributable to their income. In this way, they will not be held liable for income earned by their spouse. Beyond expanding innocent spouse relief, this legislation allows the Secretary of the Treasury to provide equitable relief if innocent spouse relief is otherwise unavailable. It makes relief retroactive to help those innocent spouses who are still being hounded by the IRS. 
Let me say, however, that relief will not be available in cases of fraud, or if the IRS proves the taxpayer claiming innocent spouse relief had actual knowledge of an item giving rise to the tax liability. 
Beyond this, with this legislation, we make necessary and important changes to how penalties and interest are applied. In order to prevent IRS employees from arbitrarily using penalties as leverage against taxpayers, this bill requires non-computer determined penalties to be approved by management. 
Furthermore, each notice to taxpayers which includes a penalty or interest must specify how the amount was calculated. If a taxpayer enters into an installment agreement, the monthly failure-to-pay-penalty is cut in half. 
Under this bill, if the IRS does not provide a notice of deficiency--or other form of notification of the specific amount of taxes due--within eighteen months after a return is timely filed, then interest and penalties will be suspended until the taxpayer is actually notified. 
This eighteen month period will be reduced to twelve months in the year 2004, as the agency improves its ability to notify taxpayers of their deficiencies. In this way it is the IRS, not the taxpayer, who bears the burden of IRS delay. 
These enhanced rights are meant to protect honest taxpayers. We do not excuse those who evade their responsibility or cheat on their income tax returns. The protections contained in this legislation exclude the failure to file, failure to pay, and penalties related to fraud. 
Finally, Mr. President, the fourth principle this legislation advances is to provide the Commissioner the tools necessary to take the IRS into the 21st century. It directs Commissioner Rossotti to eliminate the current national office, regional office and district office structure of the IRS. 
It gives him the authority to replace these antiquated management models with operating units that will directly serve particular groups of taxpayers, better meeting their needs and making the agency much more efficient and user-friendly. As I have said before, Commissioner Rossotti should be complimented on his tremendous work and managerial skills. His plan to restructure the agency is as bold as it is necessary, and this legislation gives him the authority he needs to move forward. 
And moving forward is what this legislation is all about--to usher the IRS into a new era of accountability--to provide taxpayers with the protections they deserve--to bring efficiency and modern management to an organizational structure that dates back to before the industrial age. With this legislation, we bring a promise of hope to honest taxpayers and hard-working employees who have waited far too long. We bring responsibility and greater openness. 
We focus on the need for service and fairness. With this legislation, Commissioner Rossotti will be able to transform the IRS, make it more effective and intolerant of corruption and abuse of power. 
I appreciate all the work that has gone into this bill--for the many hours and weekends given by Senators, Congressmen, and staff. Particularly, I want to thank Frank Polk, Mark Prater, Tom Roesser, Mark Patterson, Nick Giordano, and our committee investigators. 
I want to thank Lindy Paull, and the staff on the Joint Tax Committee--Barry Wold, Mel Schwarz, Cecily Rock and Mike Udell. Again, I am grateful to Senator Moynihan--for his leadership and dedication to this cause. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who stood firm for legislation with teeth--who, in seeking change, demanded real change--real reforms. That's what we offer today. I am proud of this bill. Americans have every reason to celebrate. They have let their desire be known, and, Mr. President, they have been heard.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I do not wish to unnecessarily prolong the debate, but I would like to remind the Senate of the process by which the 18-month holding period became law. The 18-month holding period arose from the final negotiations between the congressional leadership and the administration on the conference agreement to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The 18-month holding period was not in either the House or the Senate bill. No House or Senate Member proposed this additional holding period. No hearing was held on its tax policy or compliance implications. 
Therefore, from the standpoint of process, today, we are reversing what was done about 1 year ago. In this conference agreement, we are eliminating a provision that was added in conference, a provision that was itself not contained in any House or Senate bill before its enactment. 
Mr. President, the most important factor to consider is this. If the point of order succeeds, the IRS conference report falls. All of the meritorious provisions that Members have addressed will also fall. One of the best chances to reform the IRS in over 40 years could well be lost if the appeal of the Chair's ruling succeeds. No one can guarantee what would happen if the distinguished Senator from North Dakota would prevail. Therefore, Mr. President, I move to table the motion made by the Senator from North Dakota, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

I can assure my friends on both sides of the aisle that I objected and fought many other provisions, some of which I think they would feel just as strongly about, if not more strongly.

The other point I want to make, Mr. President, is that the 18-month holding period resulted from exactly the same process to which the distinguished Senator from North Dakota is objecting. But I recall no one from that side of the aisle objecting to the 18 months on the same grounds that it is objecting to the reduction of 12 months.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the IRS reform conference report. It is expected that there will be lengthy debate during today's session on the conference report, with a final vote occurring by late afternoon. In addition to the conference report, the Senate may consider any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. 
Members are reminded that a cloture motion was filed last night to the substitute amendment to the product liability bill. Therefore, Senators have until 1 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments to the substitute. The cloture vote will occur on Thursday, July 9, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. 
Once again, the majority leader would like to remind Members that July will be a busy month, with late night sessions and votes. The cooperation of all Members will be necessary for the Senate to complete its work prior to the August recess. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of `The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998' now before the Senate as amended and urge its immediate adoption. 
Today we take another important step forward to help millions of children receive the financial and medical support owed to them by their absent parents. The child support enforcement system involves not only the federal, state, and local governments, but employers, financial institutions, and private sector agents and vendors as well. 
By continuing to improve the child support enforcement system, we will help families avoid and escape welfare dependency. 
Mr. President, when Congress passed welfare reform nearly two years ago, we sent a clear and unambiguous message that child support is indeed a personal responsibility. It has been with quiet determination that Republican and Democratic members have found common ground and worked together to strengthen and improve the child support enforcement system. The legislation before us today is directed at fulfilling the responsibilities of the states. 
The work on this legislation began shortly after the `Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996' was signed into law. 
The 1996 welfare reform act required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recommend to Congress a new, budget-neutral performance-based incentive system for the child support enforcement program. H.R. 3130 incorporates those recommendations which were developed in consultation with 26 representatives of state and local child support enforcement systems. The new incentive program is the centerpiece of this bill. 
Under current law, the federal government returns more than $400 million per year in child support collections to the states as incentive payments. But this incentive structure has been criticized for years as weak and inadequate. 
All states, regardless of actual performance, receive some incentive payments. But for more than a decade, performance has not been tied to the national goals of the program. 
H.R. 3130 breaks the past and creates five categories in which state performance will be evaluated and rewarded. The states will be measured according to their performance in paternity establishment, establishment of court orders, collections of current child support payments, collections on past due payments, and cost effectiveness. 
The new incentive structure is an important development not only for the child support enforcement system but also as a model for improving accountability and performance in government. 
The second major feature of this bill is to provide for an alternative penalty procedure for those states that have failed to meet federal child support data processing requirements. Less than half of the states have been certified as in compliance. Without this change, states face not only the loss of their entire child support grant, but all of their funds in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program as well. 
Such a result would obviously be crippling to a state and 
would ultimately hurt the very families these programs are intended to help. H.R. 3130 provides for a new mechanism under which HHS and the states will map out a strategic plan to meet the federal requirements. States which do not achieve compliance will face tough but fair penalties. 
The alternative penalty procedure is a new tool for both the state and federal governments to achieve compliance with federal requirements in the child support enforcement system. It is not intended to be a means of raising revenue at the expense of the state and potentially at the expense of the very families who rely on this system. 
H.R. 3130 also provides additional flexibility to the states in how they design their automated systems. In looking back over the history of automation, we find there were a number of mistakes made at both the federal and state levels which contributed to the delay in getting these systems operational. The child support enforcement system is a prime example of what can happen when regulations fail to keep pace with real world practices. 
H.R. 3130 recognizes the advances in technologies and allows states to take advantage of these improvements. It properly refocuses federal policy on function and results rather than on rigid rules. 
All of these changes will work together to get the states in compliance as quickly as possible. This will mean the child support enforcement system will work better for the families who depend on child support. 
Working with the states and employers, a bipartisan effort has yielded a three part approach to eliminate barriers to effective medical support enforcement. More children will no doubt gain access to their non-custodial parents' private health insurance plans because of H.R. 3130. Children and taxpayers alike will benefit from the medical child support provisions. 
H.R. 3130 also makes a correction in how penalties are applied under the new `Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997' which became law last November. It is vitally important that the states be held accountable for assisting the children in foster care. 
When Congress passed this legislation last fall, it sent an important message across the country that a child should not be denied the opportunity to be adopted into a loving and caring family simply because the prospective parents live in the next county. The intent of Section 202, `Adoptions Across State and County Jurisdictions' is to ensure that states facilitate timely permanent placements for children so their wait in foster care be brief. 
A child should not be denied the opportunity to be adopted into a loving and caring family simply because the prospective parents live in the next county. 
The intent of P.L. 105-89 clearly is to remove interjurisdictional barriers to adoption. I am deeply concerned about recent reports that some states may in fact be erecting new barriers to families who are seeking to adopt. There are some disturbing reports that some states may be engaging in policies or practices that could create interjurisdictional barriers to adoption such as discontinuance of the registration of waiting families with adoption exchanges outside the state, refusal to share home studies across state lines, and refusal to respond to out-of-state inquiries. 
The Secretary should closely monitor any change in state policy or practice which discourages families from seeking to adopt children and take appropriate action if a state is not 
complying with the law. When the Department of Health and Human Services issues regulations on how the new penalties are enforced, it should of course provide the states with the opportunity to present evidence of how it complies with the new law. The review of this new requirement must be a fair and complete assessment of whether the law is being met. 
Mr. President, this is indeed an important, bipartisan bill which will prove itself to pay dividends for Americans' families. I urge its adoption.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote policies and programs that make quality education accessible to students, to their parents, and to their families. Today, students and parents are under an enormous burden when it comes to paying for education. There is serious and legitimate concern about the accessibility of quality schools and teachers and materials necessary for success. 
And costs continue to rise. 
With the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 we succeeded in helping parents and students prepare for and even offset some of the escalating costs associated with higher education. For example: 
We created an education savings IRA to allow parents to save for higher education. 
We expanded the tax-deferred treatment of State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans. 
We restored the tax deduction on student loan interest. 
We extended the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance. 
And, we established tax credits--the HOPE scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Credite--for students to use in connection with their education. 
Each of these measures goes a long, long way toward helping our students and their families handle the financial burden associated with college life. 
But, Mr. President, we did not go far enough. Personally, I would like to have seen more powerful measures. The Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 actually contained stronger provisions, but they were dropped as part of the conference agreement. 
I firmly believe in those stronger measures and so I introduced them as a separate bill on the very day that we passed the Taxpayer Relief Act. My objective then was the same as it is today--to help American families afford the costs of a quality education. 
I proposed to push the education IRA from its $500-a-year limit to $2,000 a year, and to allow withdrawals for elementary and secondary school; to make tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance permanent and to reinstate it for graduate education; and to make State-sponsored prepaid tuition programs tax free, not just tax deferred. These were my objectives as 1997 came to a close, and I am happy to say that we have succeeded in adopting many of them with this bill, the Education Savings and School Excellence Act of 1998. 
This bill comes out of the Senate Finance Committee with bipartisan support. As I already indicated, the distinguished Senator from Georgia has played a leading role in helping shepherd this important piece of legislation through the Senate. Our bill allows families to increase their contributions to education IRAs from $500 to $2,000 per year. Not only will the $2,000 per year IRA contributions be available for college, but they can be used for students at any level--from kindergarten all the way through college. 
As such, the education IRA will be a tremendous asset to parents and students in grade schools and high schools. The money will be available to help cover the costs associated with both public and private schools. And the money can be used for a multitude of necessities--from buying school uniforms or books to purchasing a new computer. 
The bill also makes prepaid tuition programs tax free, meaning that students will be able to withdraw on a tax-free basis the savings that accumulate in their prepaid tuition accounts. Parents will have the incentive to put money away today, and their children will have the full benefit of that money tax free tomorrow. 
These innovative proposals will be a boon to higher education--to our students and families. Already, 44 States have prepaid tuition programs in effect. 
The other six have legislation to create a State plan, or they have implemented a feasibility study. Such programs will become increasingly more attractive to parents and students, as will individual retirement accounts that allow them to meet the educational needs of their family. 
As I have said before, these measures are an important step forward. They are important for our families--for our students--for the future. With this legislation, Congress is demonstrating its leadership on education. 
It is a very, very important step in the right direction. And I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Again, let me thank my distinguished colleague for his leadership and his courtesy in letting me make my statement at this time.

Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his offer as I am in a conference on IRS and it is important that I get back there as promptly as possible. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly on this most important amendment. 
Mr. President, as you know, Senator Jeffords and I are offering an amendment today that will restore funding for renewable energy programs in the fiscal year 1999 energy and water appropriation's bill. The renewable energy program has been cut by 33 percent below the administration request and $27 million below fiscal year 1998 levels. This amendment would add $70 million back to the renewable budget restoring all programs to fiscal year 1998 levels and boosting some programs 10-20 percent more. Even with these increases, America's investment in wind, solar, biomass, and other clean energy technologies will be well below the funding levels of 3 years ago. 
Mr. President, renewable energy technologies represent our best hopes for reducing air pollution, creating jobs and decreasing our reliance on imported oil and finite supplies of fossil fuels. Whatever one's position on the issue of climate change--these programs promise to supply economically competitive and commercially viable exports. I believe that the nation should be looking toward alternative forms of energy, not taking a step backward by cutting funding for these important programs. 
My own state of Delaware has a long tradition in solar energy. In 1972, the University of Delaware established one of the first photovoltaic laboratories in the nation. The university has been instrumental in developing photovoltaic cells, the same type of technology that powers solar watches and calculators. 
Delaware has a major solar energy manufacturer, Astro Power, which is now the fastest growing manufacturer of photovoltaic cells in the world. In collaboration with the University of Delaware and Astro Power, Delaware's major utility--Delmarva Power & Light--has installed an innovative solar energy system that has successfully demonstrated the use of solar power to satisfy peak electrical demand. Through this collaboration, my State has demonstrated that solar energy technology can be an economically competitive and commercially viable energy alternative for the utility industry. 
It is vital that we continue to manufacture these solar cell products with the high performance, high quality, and low costs required to successfully compete worldwide. 
Investment in Department of Energy solar and renewable energy programs has put us on the threshold of explosive growth. Continuation of the present renewable energy programs is required to achieve the goal of a healthy photovoltaic industry in the United States. 
While the solar energy industries might have evolved in some form on their own Federal investment has accelerated the transition from the laboratory bench to commercial markets in a way that has already accrued valuable economic benefits to the nation. Solar energy companies--like Astro Power--have already created thousands of jobs and helped to reduce our trade deficit through exports of solar energy systems overseas, mostly to developing nations, where 2 billion people are still without access to electricity. 
International markets for solar energy systems are virtually exploding, due to several key market trends. Most notably, solar energy is already one of the lowest cost options available to developing countries that cannot afford to build large, expensive centralized power generation facilities with elaborate distribution systems. 
The governments of Japan, Germany, and Australia are investing heavily in aggressive technology and market development in partnership with their own solar energy industries. Until recently, Japan and Germany held the lead in world market share for photovoltaics; the United States has only recently recaptured international market dominance. 
Cutting funding for commercializing these technologies would have a chilling effect on the U.S. industry's ability to compete on an international scale in these billion-dollar markets of today and tomorrow. The employment potential of renewables represents a minimum of 15,000 new jobs this decade with nearly 120,000 the next decade. 
Mr. President, I might also add biomass is another form of renewable energy with great potential. While traditionally biomass includes the use of wood chips and trash to create electricity, Maryland and Delaware are exploring the opportunities to use poultry manure as a biomass fuel. Manure used in this manner would not be spread on fields, a practice implicated by some as a cause of the recent outbreaks of pfiesteria. 
The electricity generated by the plant could then be sold to electric companies, the ash from the burning manure could be marketed as an environmentally sensitive fertilizer. In England the poultry litter fueled electric plants produce over 38.5 megawatts of power and burn 440,000 tons of chicken manure a year. 
The Jeffords/Roth amendment will restore the renewable energy accounts so that poultry manure fired plants and other renewable opportunities may become a real possibility in the future. 
It is imperative that this Senate support renewable energy technologies and be a partner to an energy future that addresses our economic needs in an environmentally acceptable manner. My State has done and will continue to do its part. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will look to the future and do their part in securing a safe and reliable energy future by supporting this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Kerry amendment once again raises the fundamental questions as to why the United States Senate is considering this tobacco settlement bill. Is its purpose to reduce the number of children who will become addicted to nicotine, or it is cover for another Washington power grab? 
In recent days, the Senate has debated various amendments which affect the agreement Senator McCain reached with the nations' governors to secure their support for this legislation. Members have voiced opposition to amendments on the grounds that it violates the agreement reached between the governors and the White House. 
There can be no doubt that the Kerry Amendment fractures that agreement. 
On a bipartisan basis, Governor Voinovich of Ohio and Governor Carper of Delaware have issued a letter opposing the Kerry amendment. Their May 19 letter states, `the National Governors' Association strongly opposes the Kerry amendment which dictates state funding choices.' 
Governor Carper and Governor Voinovich go on to state, `This fundamentally undercuts the agreement included in the manager's amendment and would make it impossible for Governors to continue to support this agreement. 
`In addition, by locking states into a specific child care requirement, the Kerry amendment would prevent states from meeting other compelling needs as their particular circumstances dictate.' 
Mr. President, the Kerry amendment is the old broken record that Washington knows best. Only Washington can set the priorities. 
Mr. President, by imposing this restriction on the states, the Kerry amendment has changed the rules of welfare reform. The effect of the Kerry amendment is to increase the state matching requirement for receiving funds out of the child care and development block grant. Why are we imposing such a policy on a tobacco bill? 
If the Kerry amendment is adopted, the tobacco bill will contain two completely contradictory policies. The McCain May 18 modification already establishes new rules for claiming additional federal dollars for child care. Under section 452, `Grants to States,' the bill now changes the federal match rate for new child care dollars to 80 percent. This is a higher match rate than any state receives for the Medicaid Program. 
Why must the federal government bribe the states to claim federal dollars for child care by lowering the cost to the states? Simple. Because the states are not spending all of the child care dollars already available to them. 
In fiscal year 1997, the states spent only 72 percent of what they could have spent out of the child care and development block grant. The tobacco bill includes this higher match rate at insistence of the White House. The Clinton administration fully understands it must change the rules in order to pump more dollars into child care. 
Mr. President, this administration proposal is so troublesome to me because the White House is blowing hot and cold air at the same time on the issue of child care. The White House proposed cutting funds for child care under the title XX program. The President's budget requested a reduction in this important program for fiscal year 1999 and in the years beyond. 
Under the Clinton administration's budget, the SSBG would receive $1 billion less than what is authorized under welfare reform in 2003. 
Mr. President, you cannot profess to be for child care when you propose to reduce the social services block grant. The two ideas are mutually exclusive. Every state uses SSBG funds to provide day care for children. 
Mr. President, the Kerry amendment does not define who is for child care or who is against child care. The Clinton administration has acted in a contradictory way and those who voted to cut the social services block grant have acted in a contradictory manner. If we are serious about child care, the first priority should be to restore the social services block grant. 
If the Kerry amendment is adopted, the U.S. Senate will be saying that the state match for child care funds is both too high and too low. 
Mr. President, this simply does not make sense. 
The Kerry amendment is not needed. The states are free to spend their entire amount of unrestricted funds on child care if they so choose. Of the 50 percent of funds which are restricted, child care is one of the options the states can spend their tobacco funds on. 
Mr. President, Delaware is considering using its tobacco funds for expanding health insurance to low-income families. The Kerry amendment would substitute the judgment of the U.S. Senate about what priorities should be funded for the judgment of the elected men and women of Delaware. 
That is a mistake we should not make.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the pending amendment begins to address tax relief in two important areas. The first is the marriage penalty that exists in the code. The second is health care costs. This amendment begins to give back to the people some of the money that is raised through the tobacco tax in the bill. And for these reasons I intend to support the pending amendment. 
Personally, I think the spending is still too high in the tobacco bill. More of the revenue should be returned to the taxpayer. 
In addition, there are many measures that the Finance Committee recommended which are not adequately included in the final bill. For example, the tobacco bill is inconsistent with the work of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Medicaid program. The tobacco bill also re-opens the Balanced Budget Act by increasing spending beyond the $24 billion we have already provided for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Another aspect of the overall bill which concerns me is the way that the international trade provisions are drafted. 
Mr. President, there have been media reports that the tobacco bill is in trouble because the managers have to accommodate so many factions within the Senate and that today they have to accommodate the tax-cutters to make progress on the bill. I take exception with the suggestion that tax relief is just another nuisance to be accommodated. My perspective on this bill is quite different. 
It is repeatedly asserted that this bill's purpose is to reduce teen smoking. That is a very desirable goal. I support that goal. However, in the bill I find only two policies that bear on that goal. 
The first one--the tax increase--is said to bring in $65 billion over 5 years. The second one--under $1 billion in the President's budget--is a cessation program for teenagers. 
In my opinion, we have accomplished the goal with $64 billion left on the table. That money should be returned to the people, not be used as a slush fund to make government bigger. Making government bigger is not the goal of this legislation. But it seems to be the effect. 
In my opinion, the debate on this bill should center on how we rebate excess revenues to the people not on how we can fund government spending increases that cannot survive the traditional discipline of the budget and appropriations process. I support this amendment because it is philosophically the only legitimate course, in my opinion, for the Senate to take. 
The pending amendment provides tax relief in two specific ways. First, it partially reduces the inequity of the marriage tax penalty. 
As my colleagues know, this penalty places an unfair burden on two-earner married couples. 
According to a recent Congressional Budget Office study, a married couple filing a joint tax return in 1996 could face a tax bill more than $20,000 higher than they would pay if they were not married and could file individual tax returns. The same study estimated that according to one measure of the marriage penalty more than 21 million married couples paid an average of nearly $1,400 in additional taxes in 1996 because they filed jointly. Marriage tax penalties totaled $29 billion in 1996. 
Let me take a few minutes to describe the history of the penalty--which has been around for almost 30 years. Before 1948, all taxpayers filed as single individuals. In that year, Congress gave taxpayers the ability to file jointly--meaning that a couple had the benefit on income splitting. The tax bracket for married couples was double the bracket for single individuals. Because of complaints that singles were being unfairly penalized, in 1969, Congress devised a special rate schedule and standard deduction amounts for singles. This new rate schedule created a marriage penalty for some taxpayers. 
Because of changing demographics and the prevalence of two-earner couples in America, the marriage tax penalty has become an even greater concern. Moreover, after being reduced during the 1980s, the tax increases and creation of additional tax brackets in 1990 and 1993 have made it much worse today. 
In the current tax code, there are over 65 examples of provisions causing the marriage tax penalty. The most obvious and dramatic one is the rate structure itself. 
But there are numerous others, all of which can have a significant effect on the pocketbook of a married couple. The penalty provisions are built into deductions, exemptions, credits, and other facets of the code. 
What the pending amendment does is take a step toward providing some relief for this inequitable condition. It provides a deduction, up to an amount of roughly $3,400, for married couples. This deduction is phased in over 10 years. It will partially alleviate the burden, and toward doing this, I am a strong advocate. However, I regret that this relief does not go far enough. 
The phased-in deduction is only available to couples with an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000. In other words, Mr. President, someone who works in the Chrysler or GM plant in Delaware and whose spouse is a school teacher would have too high an income to qualify for marriage penalty relief. That doesn't seem fair. I would have liked to see us give relief from the marriage penalty to many more Americans. Frankly, I would like to see us get rid of the marriage penalty altogether. 
The second major component of tax relief in this amendment is in the area of health care. The amendment provides self-employed individuals next year with a 100 percent deduction for their health insurance. This is long over-due. It will help farmers, small business people, and others who buy their own health insurance. Because of this amendment, 3 million taxpayers and their families will have more affordable health care, and you cannot overstate how important this is. 
This is a good first step. But I want to be clear that I do not consider it to be everything we must do. There are 18 million other Americans who lack health insurance, some are unemployed, others are elderly, and many have jobs. Simply put, I would like to see these individuals receive an above-the-line deduction for the cost of their health care. This is something I have worked on for some time. 
When the Finance Committee marked up the tobacco legislation I placed before the committee a two-part proposal in the area of health care. 
The first part was an immediate increase to 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed. The second part provided the same benefit to the other 18 million Americans who need health insurance. This attempt was a natural follow-on to my successful efforts in 1995 to raise the deductible percentage from 25 to 30 percent and to make it permanent. Unfortunately, this time my tax cut proposal was not approved by the Finance Committee. 
I intended to offer the same tax cut amendment on the floor, and I was pleased that several members--Republicans and Democrats--agreed to support it. 
This proposal was also supported by farmers and small business, and I am pleased that it is reflected in the amendment before us now. Though, again, I want to go further. This is a good start, but I hope that in the future we revisit this with a mind to making health insurance more affordable for millions more of American workers. 
It is the same with the marriage penalty. It is egregious that married couples are penalized by our tax code. I believe this sends the wrong message in more ways than one, and it must be addressed. We have attempted to do this in the past. For example, in 1995, in the Balanced Budget Act, Congress approved a proposal to phase out the marriage penalty in the standard deduction. Our legislation was vetoed by President Clinton. 
I realize that at this point we are constrained by financial limitations and other priorities, and I compliment my colleagues for moving as far as they have with this bill. But I want all of my colleagues to agree with me that this should be seen as only the beginning. There is no justification for a married couple to be penalized just because they are married. 
Mr. President, though it is not perfect, and while it does not go as far as I would like, I intend to support this amendment. It sends the right message. 
It does provide partial relief. And it is a step in the right direction. I encourage my colleagues to support this effort.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in coordination with the Treasury Department, Senator Moynihan and I are introducing a bill today to eliminate an unwarranted tax benefit which involves the liquidation of a Regulated Investment Company (`RIC') or Real Estate Investment Trust (`REIT'), where at least 80 percent of the liquidating RIC or REIT is owned by a single corporation. Identical legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Archer. 
The RIC and REIT rules allow individual shareholders to invest in stock and securities (in the case of RICs) and real estate assets (in the case of REITs) with a single level of tax. The single level of tax is achieved by allowing RICs and REITs to deduct the dividends they pay to their shareholders. 
Some corporations, however, have attempted to use the `dividends paid deduction' in combination with a separate rule that allows a corporate parent to receive property from an 80 percent subsidiary without tax when the subsidiary is liquidating. Taxpayers argue that the combination of these two rules permits income deducted by the RIC or REIT and paid to the parent corporation to be entirely tax-free during the period of liquidation of the RIC or REIT (which can extend over a period of years). The legislation is intended to eliminate this abusive application of these rules by requiring that amounts which are deductible dividends to the RIC or REIT are consistently treated as dividends by the corporate parent. 
RICs and REITs are important investment vehicles, particularly for small investors. The RIC and REIT rules are designed to encourage investors to pool their resources and achieve the type of investment opportunities, subject to a single level of tax, that would otherwise be available only to a larger investor. This legislation will not affect the intended beneficiaries of the RIC and REIT rules.

That is one of the things that got me moving a year ago, because I think, as the Senator, it is critically important that we assure the agency is functioning as the President and Congress intend it to function. That has not been the case with IRS. 
So I can assure the good Senator that it is my intention to have continuing oversight hearings. I think it is important now that we are involved in this massive reorganization opportunity to change culture that we do have at least once a year, if not more often, the kind of hearing the Senator is talking about. We are all very pleased to have this new Commissioner. We think we have an individual with the type of qualifications and background that will really make a major change. At the same time, I think it is our responsibility to continue from time to time to hold hearings to see if progress is being made. So I assure the Senator that as long as I am chairman of the committee we will continue to do so.

Mr. ROTH. I think, I say to the distinguished Senator, that we are all very concerned about this problem of the year 2000. We must solve it. We have no alternative. We have no choice. So we are all going to work to accomplish that. 
At the same time, it is critically important that we move ahead, bringing about the kind of reforms we have been debating and talking about this week. Neither one has to take a back seat. We want to move forward together. I assure you that we have been working with Senator Moynihan, with Commissioner Rossotti, as well as Joint Taxation. And Senator Moynihan will be offering an amendment that will address some of the concerns you are raising. 
This is going to be an ongoing process. As time moves on, we may have to adjust, because we are going to make certain, as the committee with oversight responsibility, that this agency meets its obligations.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in order to accept this amendment--which deals with the effective dates of many of the provisions in the IRS Restructuring Bill. 
As I have stated before, this legislation has three main purposes--first, to reorganize, restructure, and re-equip the IRS to make it more customer friendly in its tax-collecting mission; second, to protect taxpayers from abusive practices and procedures of the IRS. And third, to deal with the management problem and misconduct of some IRS employees. 
In order to accomplish these goals--to bring about fundamental reform, we are enacting numerous provisions. Some of those provisions will require the IRS to undergo significant reprogramming of its systems; some of them can be accomplished with little burden. 
I recognize that the IRS needs to continue to function at the same time that it makes these important changes. The IRS also needs to deal with massive computer reprogramming brought about by the century date change--the so called `year 2000 problem.' 
It is not my intention to impose unreasonable effective dates on the IRS. At the same time, I recognize that sometimes we need to push the IRS, to prompt it to make changes. We should not simply defer to their assessment that they will be unable to accomplish the goals we have set. 
On April 23, Commissioner Rossotti expressed his concern that the effective dates in our bill could severely impact the ability of the IRS to deal with the year 2000 computer problem. I understood his position. 
Nevertheless, I believed then, and I believe now, that justice delayed is justice denied. Many of the reforms in our bill are long overdue. Taxpayers have already been waiting for them for a long time. Innocent spouses should not have to wait any longer for relief. Taxpayers in installment agreements should not have to wait any longer for reduction of their failure to pay penalty. Taxpayers subject to IRS audits should not have to wait any longer for the IRS to complete its business. 
To find a middle ground, I asked the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation to meet with representatives of the IRS in order to discuss the impact of the effective dates. Joint Tax did so, and on Tuesday, May 5, they provided Senator Moynihan and me with their recommendations. 
Joint Tax recommended that many of the effective dates remain the same, but that some others be delayed. 
This amendment adopts most of the recommendations made by Joint Tax. Specifically, the amendment does not delay the effective date for the major taxpayer protections in the bill. 
The amendment does not delay innocent spouse relief--in other words, as of the date of enactment of this bill, innocent spouses will no longer suffer under the burden of paying for their spouse's tax fraud. 
The amendment also does not delay due process for taxpayers--meaning that among other things, taxpayers will receive rights of appeal and rights of notice before their property is seized. These are fundamental rights that we should get to taxpayers as soon as possible. 
The amendment also does not delay what we have referred to as the one year rule. This means that effective next tax year--1998--taxpayers will know that the IRS has one year to tell them whether they owe any additional tax. If the IRS is delinquent, all interest and penalties on that additional tax will be suspended until the IRS gets its act together and notifies the taxpayer of the deficiency. 
The amendment also does not delay what we refer to as cascading penalties. That means that taxpayers can designate which period their deposits are applied to, and can avoid the situation where a taxpayer is making payments, but nevertheless, accruing penalties even faster. 
I have said already, these reforms are long overdue. Our guiding principle should be rapid relief for American taxpayers--for the individuals who have suffered long enough because of the practices and procedures of the IRS. This bill is all about taxpayer protections. We should deliver those protections to taxpayers as soon as possible. 
I note that President Clinton recently stated that these reforms should be enacted as soon as possible. I assume that he did not mean that the law should go into effect two years from now.  
Mr. President, this bill is also about changing the culture of the IRS. Under Chairman Rossotti's leadership, that had already begun. We expect that to continue. The fact that we are accommodating some of the IRS' requests and delaying certain effective dates should not be taken as a sign that we are not serious about reforming the agency. On that subject, let there be no mistake. This bill will bring about fundamental change at an agency that is in dire need of such change. We expect the IRS to improve its service--to change its culture--to be more responsive to taxpayers--at the same time that it implements its system changes. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I will accept this amendment.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as we bring these deliberations on IRS restructuring to a close, I want to express my appreciation to everyone who has strongly supported this necessary legislation. I am particularly proud of the fact that it was unanimously supported on the floor of the Senate this evening. I again want to reiterate my belief that the Internal Revenue Service--with its 102,000 employees--is filled with hard-working, service-oriented, honorable men and women. 
The problem, Mr. President, is that the agency, itself, has too much power and not enough sunshine. 
It is marked by an environment where even a few overly aggressive, vindictive, arrogant, or power-hungry individuals can get away with trampling the rights of honest Americans. It is an environment where honesty can be met by retaliation, where employees are frightened to come forward to report and correct abuses, and where the taxpayer is often perceived as the enemy and not the customer. 
The legislation we have passed today will go a long way towards correcting these problems. Will it do everything we would like it to do? No. There needs to be a cultural shift inside the agency itself. 
This legislation will provide a catalyst for that shift. Is this bill a good start toward long-term reform? Absolutely. 
This legislation will allow Commissioner Rossotti to implement the necessary reforms and restructuring that need to be done to bring the agency into the 21st century. It is a strong bill, building on what the House passed last November. It is what the American people need to strengthen fundamental protections. However, Congress must not see this as the be-all-and-end-all of offering taxpayers the protection and service they need when it comes to the IRS. 
We need to continue our oversight efforts. We need to make sure that the provisions we have included in our legislation are taken seriously by the agency and embraced in the manner in which they are intended. 
Mr. President, this thorough and comprehensive piece of legislation is the product of a collective effort. It represents the best work and thinking from both sides of the aisle. 
I express my sincere appreciation to my colleagues, particularly Senator Moynihan, as well as Senators Charles Grassley and Bob Kerrey, both of whom worked on the National Restructuring Commission with Congressman Rob Portman. I'm grateful to Chairman Archer and those on the Ways and Means Committee who provided a solid foundation upon which we built this legislation, and to my colleagues on the Finance Committee who diligently sat through our extensive oversight and restructuring hearings and voted this legislation out of committee unanimously. 
I am also grateful to those who have spoken so eloquently as proponents of this legislation here on the floor. 
I also appreciate the hard work our staffs have put in. I'm grateful to our investigators--Eric Thorson, Debbie McMahon, Kathryn Quinn, Anita Horn, and Maureen Barry. I'm grateful to Frank Polk, Joan Woodward, and Mark Patterson, to Tom Roesser, Mark Prater, Sam Olchyk, Brig Pari, Bill Sweetnam, Jeff Kupfer, Nick Giordano, and Ann Urban. I also want to thank Jane Butterfield, Mark Blair, and Darcell Savage. 
I believe the future will remember the work we have done here. The history of the Internal Revenue Service is marked by aggressive tax collecting tactics and consequent Congressional efforts to reform the agency. Those reforms, however, often did not go far enough, and they were not accompanied by a dedication to sincere oversight. These reforms, Mr. President, do go far. 
They are the most extensive reforms ever made to balance power and responsibility inside what can only be characterized as one of America's most powerful agencies. And, as we have heard over the past few days here on the floor, this Congress is dedicated to continued oversight. 
In closing, I am pleased to work with Senator Kerrey, the floor manager for the Democrats. I think it has been a great collective effort.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, before we begin debate today, I would like to offer some comments about the consent agreement that governs the offering of amendments. Basically, amendments that are to be in order must be relevant to the purpose of the IRS reform legislation, which covers three major areas. 
First, it reorganizes, restructures, and re-equips the IRS to make it more customer friendly in its tax-collecting mission. 
Second, it protects taxpayers from abusive practices and procedures of the IRS. 
Third, it deals with the management and conduct of IRS employees. 
These are the main purposes of the bill. While there are provisions dealing with electronic filing and congressional oversight, that is basically what this bill does. 
Title 6 of the bill is an entirely different matter. That title contains technical amendments that run the breadth of the tax code. In the House of Representatives, this title was reported by the Ways and Means Committee as a separate bill--which, in fact, it is. 
Title 6 is unrelated to IRS reform. It contains only technical corrections to previously enacted tax legislation that meet the following criteria: 
First, they carry out the original intent of Congress in enacting the provision being amended. 
Second, by definition, the technical correction does not score as a revenue gain or loss. 
Third, the policy has been approved by the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the majority and minority of both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. 
As a consequence, amendments which are relevant because of provisions in title 6 must meet a more difficult standard under the consent agreement. They must not only be relevant, but must be cleared but the two managers and the two leaders. And in clearing provisions that relate to title 6, I will apply the same criteria that the provisions of title 6 had to meet to become part of that title. 
I hope this explanation provides a clearer understanding of the application of the consent agreement to possible amendments.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, under the Senate's budget rules, the first year, first five years, and second five years of revenue losses in a tax bill must be offset with either mandatory savings or revenue increases. 
When the Finance Committee marked up the underlying bill, the first five years of revenue loss were offset. The second five years of revenue loss were not fully offset. The IRS Restructuring bill was short in excess of $9 billion in the last five years. During the markup, I indicated that I would work with the Budget Committee to attempt to find offsets so that the bill would be fully paid for over the last five years. 
Finding offsets was not an easy task. Every major revenue raiser I considered brought forth opposition from different members. After several weeks of reviewing options, I have developed a package, in consultation with the leadership. 
Mr. President, this pay-for package contains three new revenue raisers and a change to a revenue raiser in the underlying bill. 
The first revenue raiser comes from the Administration's budget. This proposal would tighten the definition of operating losses that are eligible for a special ten year carry back. Congress intended this treatment to be limited to a narrow category of activities. This proposal simply clarifies the types of losses eligible for this special treatment. This proposal is noncontroversial. 
The second new revenue raiser relates to the rollover rules for Roth IRAs. Under current law, individuals or married couples with adjusted gross income over $100,000 cannot rollover a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. For purposes of the $100,000 test, minimum distributions which are required when an IRA beneficiary reaches 70 1/2 are counted as income. 
This second new raiser would modify current law by excluding minimum distributions from the $100,000 test. The effect of this proposal is to allow more taxpayers, at age 70 1/2 and above, to rollover from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. This proposal will enlarge the group of taxpayers who can enjoy the benefits of the Roth IRA. 
The third new raiser would extend the current law user fees charge by the IRS for private letter rulings. This extension would be effective for four years. 
Let me note that the IRS restructuring bill uses the balance on the pay-go scorecard of $406 million in the last five years as an offset. We have been informed by the Budget Committee staff that the use of the pay-go balance is appropriate in this instance. 
Finally, this amendment modifies an effective date of a revenue raiser in the Finance Committee bill. The proposal modified is the proposal to limit the carry back period of the foreign tax credit. Under this amendment, the effective date of the foreign tax credit raiser has been moved out one year to tax years beginning after 1998. 
Now, Mr. President, some on the other side may criticize the most significant new revenue raiser in this package. The target of their criticism is the proposal to allow more older taxpayers to convert to Roth IRAs. 
As I see it, those criticizing the rollover provision have the objective of limiting retirement savings choices for taxpayers who reach the end of their working years. For taxpayers who reach 70 1/2 , the opponents of the rollover provision are saying those taxpayers should fall under a more restrictive rule than those taxpayers under 70 1/2 . 
If you are over 70 1/2 and you are a middle income person who has a healthy IRA or pension plan, the opponents of the rollover provision are arguing you should not have the choice of a Roth IRA. 
Alan Greenspan says America's most important economic problem is its low savings rate. It is a problem that we must address. The rollover provision in this amendment is a small step toward resolving our number 1 economic problem.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would now like to turn to the amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey. 
Senator Kerrey is offering an alternative pay-for package. I must oppose Senator Kerrey's package. 
The Kerrey amendment contains revenue raisers similar to the Roth amendment. There are a few additional items that I had considered in crafting my pay-for amendment. 
There, is, however, one very controversial revenue raiser in the Kerrey amendment. I think it is important that my colleagues focus their attention on it. 
Rather than modifying the rollover rules for Roth IRAs, which would allow more taxpayers to enjoy the benefits of the Roth IRA, the Kerrey amendment would reinstate the expired Superfund taxes. 
It is an undisputable fact that the present Superfund program needs immediate, substantial reform. I am a longstanding supporter of the Superfund program. It is critical that Superfund sites be cleaned up. It is a shame that the program has floundered over the past several years. Every Senator should feel the responsibility to get the Superfund program back up and running at full speed. 
The Superfund trust fund received its revenues from excise taxes on domestic crude oil and imported petroleum products, certain chemicals and imported derivative products, and a corporate environmental tax. 
These taxes expired a couple of years ago. If the taxes are extended, they will provide the necessary resources for Superfund cleanup activities. 
It is important to maintain the `connection' between the Superfund taxes and the Superfund program. It is the view of our Senior Republican colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee that this connection is important for both the politics and policy of Superfund. 
Our distinguished colleagues from the Committee on Environmental and Public Works, in particular, Senator Smith and Senator Chafee, have worked long and hard on Superfund reform legislation. 
They produced a bill, passed it out of committee, and have asked me to extend the expired Superfund taxes to cover the authorization period. Senators Smith and Chafee should be commended for moving Superfund forward, not undercut here on the Senate floor. 
I intend to support Senators Smith and Chafee's efforts. As they have communicated to me, unless the Superfund taxes are enacted directly in connection with a Superfund reform bill, any hope for the long-needed changes in this environmental program would be dashed. 
In deference to Senators Smith and Chafee, the Finance Committee did not include an extension of the Superfund taxes in either the IRS Reform bill that passed our committee unanimously or in the Roth amendment. I agree with Senators Smith and Chafee that the appropriate vehicle for extension of the Superfund taxes is their Superfund bill. 
As chairman, let me be clear--I pledge to work with Senators Smith and Chafee on Superfund with respect to the issues within Finance Committee jurisdiction. 
It is my hope that will move forward with a viable Superfund reform proposal. The recent progress made by the Environment and Public Works Committee is encouraging. 
If you are for Superfund reform, as I am, you need to support Senators Smith and Chafee. For this reason, I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose the Kerrey amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, Alan Greenspan says that America's most important economic problem is its low savings rate. With that, I agree. As a practical matter, I have done my very best the last several years to try to build the kind of incentives into the tax picture that would promote savings on the part of the American people. The rollover provision in this amendment is a small step toward resolving our No. 1 economic problem. 
Just let me point out what we are saying. What we are proposing is letting older people keep the money that they have saved. We are not asking them to do anything that others are not able to do. As a practical matter, the way the system now works, it discriminates against the older people. The problem is that if you are under the age of 70 1/2 , there is no requirement that you make withdrawals from your IRA. It is only when you reach 70 1/2 that you are required to do so under the deductible IRA. So there is a built-in discrimination against the senior citizens. I think that is wrong. 
Again, let me emphasize what we are talking about. What we are proposing is to treat these older Americans, those that are over 70 1/2 , to have the same kind of treatment as those that are younger than 70 1/2 . As I said, if you are under 70 1/2 there is no requirement of withdrawals, and of course the basic problem is that if you have income in excess of $100,000 you are not entitled to this benefit. 
Let me correct one further point that has been made. My distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Kerrey, has said that the purpose of the IRA rollover provision is to allow heirs to escape payment of estate taxes. That is just not the case. If the IRA is part of the estate, then the individual who passes on is subject to the estate tax. If he or she tries to give it during the lifetime to someone else, and it is a permanent irrevocable gift, then it is subject to the gift tax. So there is no escaping of estate taxes by this provision. 
Let me just say, as we all know, the Roth IRA has become a very popular savings vehicle. A taxpayer, as I said, who has a regular IRA may convert their regular IRA into a Roth IRA as long as the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse have adjusted income of $100,000 or less. Again, let me repeat, older Americans are now required to receive minimum distribution from their regular IRA on an annual basis beginning in the year following the year they attain the age of 70 1/2 . Those required distributions must be counted, under current law, as part of the older taxpayer-adjusted gross income, which in some instances will cause these older Americans to become ineligible to roll over their IRAs. 
My amendment gives these older taxpayers the opportunity to roll over their IRAs into Roth IRAs by not counting these required minimum distributions toward $100,000 adjusted growth income. 
It is only fair, in my judgment, that these older taxpayers are given the same ability to roll over their IRAs and not be penalized because they must take distribution from their regular IRA solely because of their age. 
Let's be clear here, the revenue cost by this provision comes from taxpayers who will pay tax on their regular IRA when they convert to the Roth IRA. These conversions are entirely voluntary on the part of the taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I ask the Members of this distinguished body to support the Roth amendment because I think it brings equity into the picture and only treats the senior citizens the same as the younger. 
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
Mr. President, I, too, join my colleagues in paying my respects to the distinguished Senator from Missouri. He brings a wealth of background and experience, so his comments are always welcomed and listened to with great care. While I completely agree that the IRS oversight board must be adequately structured, I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment which would make the IRS oversight board a full-time board. 
In my judgment, the board should be a part-time board. The purpose of the board is to provide `big picture' oversight over the IRS, provide specific expertise to IRS management to ensure accountability at the IRS, as well as to ensure that taxpayers are being treated and served properly. 
The purpose of the board is not to micromanage the IRS. Commissioner Rossotti is a management expert, unlike his predecessors who were experts in tax law. As I have said many times on the floor, I think we are very fortunate in having an individual of his qualifications, his expertise, not only in management but high tech as well. I believe we should support the manager and provide a board that will help him turn the troubled agency around. 
It is my judgment a full-time board would destroy the delicate balance we tried to include in this legislation. The Commissioner, not the board, should manage the IRS. 
A full-time board would bog down in details, diffuse accountability, and I fear very much probably not include the type of individuals, the experts, the background, and vision that are necessary on the board. Also, I have to say that I would doubt that Commissioner Rossotti might remain with the IRS if the board were full time. 
The very basic question is what would be the point? While I agree with my colleague's objectives, I do not believe that a full-time board would enhance the prospect of turning this agency around. In fact, making the board full time could very well undermine the purpose of this legislation. 
As my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, has pointed out, the board is sunsetted. There will be an opportunity in the future to see how this board is functioning, whether it is working in the manner that we hope and believe it will. 
I urge my colleagues, Mr. President, to vote against the full-time board. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from Nevada that that is a very positive step, a very sound way of addressing the problem. It has been the practice in Government, as he well knows, that contingent fees are sometimes made available, not only in the IRS, but I believe in other areas of activity as well. As we all witnessed last week, this practice was used in an extremely abusive manner--a manner that should be dealt with. So I can understand the Senator's concern and interest in this matter. 
I appreciate it and would find it acceptable, as far as I am concerned, if he would modify this to make a study, and within a limited time come back. I think we do have a new commissioner that is very effective and is bringing about change. This would help give him direction, and we think this is a matter of critical importance.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first, I would like to say I regret I cannot agree, on this particular issue, with my distinguished friend from Iowa, for whom I have the greatest respect. We are, more often than not, on the same side of an issue. But, because of the overwhelming arguments, at least in my judgment, to the contrary, I must rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the Senators from Tennessee and Alabama. 
This amendment would strike the special waiver of all the criminal conflict of interest laws that were necessary to accommodate having an IRS employee representative on the IRS oversight board. Let me say that what I say today in no way is in disrespect to the individual who would probably be the employee representative, Mr. Tobias. By all reports, he is a most dedicated, informed man. But, as I said, the problem is that this amendment would strike the special waiver of all the criminal conflict of interest laws that were necessary to accommodate having such a representative, and waiving all the conflict of interest laws is bad policy. It establishes very bad precedent. 
When this issue was debated during the Finance Committee markup session, the Deputy Director of the Office of Government Ethics, the office that was set up and created to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise in the Government, testified that she was not aware of any case where all the criminal conflict of interest laws have been statutorily waived for a single person. 
Last Friday, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, in identical letters to the majority leader, the minority leader, Senator Moynihan, the ranking member, and myself, said that waiving the conflict of interest laws for one board member, `is antithetical to sound Government ethics policy and thus to sound Government. Such across-the-board statutory waivers for someone other than a mere advisor is unprecedented and, we believe, inadvisable.' 
Let me repeat, this statement that it is inadvisable comes from the Office of Government Ethics.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Senators note importantly, I think, how we are a nation of laws and we are, indeed, a nation of laws. When it comes to Government service, perhaps the most important set of laws is the criminal conflict of interest laws. Many of these laws trace their origins back to the Civil War era. They were enacted in the 1860s in response to misconduct in the procurement process. These laws embodied the principle that a Government servant, even a part-time servant, has an overriding responsibility to serve the best interests of the American public. The punishment for violating this public trust includes imprisonment of up to 5 years and penalties of up to $250,000. The severity of the penalties reflects the critical importance that these laws play in our Government. They serve to protect the public's trust in Government employees and the laws are designed to prevent Government employees from taking actions that could jeopardize this public trust. 
Let me give a few real-life examples of what could happen if the conflict of interest laws are waived for the IRS employee representative. Just suppose that a representative of the IRS employees union serves on the oversight board and the union files a lawsuit against the oversight board. If the conflict of interest laws are waived, the union representative could work with the union in preparing the lawsuit and at the same time--at the same time--work with the oversight board in defending against the lawsuit. Taxpayers would be outraged by this conduct, and rightfully so. 
Just suppose the union is asked to make a formal presentation to the oversight board. The union representative can make the formal presentation and then participate in the oversight board's deliberations with respect to the presentation. What message does this send to the taxpayer? What does this do to the public trust in Government employees and in what Congress is trying to do to improve the IRS? 
Let me quote again from the letter by the Office of Government Ethics: 
The criminal conflict of interest laws should not be viewed as impediments to good Government. They are there for a purpose and should not be waived for mere convenience. 
Mr. President, the criminal conflict of interest laws should not and must not be waived for a single individual. To do so would seriously erode the sacred trust that the public has placed in its employees to do what is in the Nation's best interests. For these reasons, I strongly support this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Let me say, on this question of completion of consideration of this legislation, I strongly agree that we want to move as expeditiously as possible. It is my intent that we will complete the legislation tomorrow, staying as late as may be necessary. 
Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the earlier comments made on the granting of waivers to the conflict of interest laws. I would like to point out that the waiver granted Mr. Rossotti was made by the same Office of Ethics that made a very persuasive argument here that we should not waive the criminal conflicts of interest as has been done under the legislation. 
Let me point out that there is a major difference between receiving a specific agency waiver under section 208 of the ethics law, which is what the Senator was referring to, and a wholesale statutory waiver of all the conflict of interest laws, which is what is contemplated in the IRS bill. 
Again, what Mr. Rossotti got was a specific agency waiver under section 208. To get a specific agency waiver under section 208, the employee must disclose the situation which gives rise to the conflict, and the agency need only to determine that the conflict--and I quote--`is not so substantial to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from the employee.' 
The problem with the IRS employee representative is that the conflicts are so substantial and pervasive that the representative would almost never qualify for a waiver. And that is not my conclusion, that is the conclusion of the Office of Government Ethics. Quoting from their letter dated March 27, 1998, the director wrote: 
While section 208 does contain a waiver provision, it applies only where the financial interest involved is `not so substantial' as to be deemed likely to affect an employee's service. We believe that it would be almost impossible for an officer of a union to legitimately meet the test set forth in the statute because of his own and the union's financial interest that would be affected by the matters before the Board. 
The director repeated this point in his letter dated May 1, 
1998, saying: 
For those conflicts laws that do provide for waivers (not all do), we believe that it would be extremely difficult for a reasonable person to determine that the interests this individual Board Member will undoubtedly have through his or her affiliation with the organization could meet those waiver tests. 
The quoted language also raises a second important point, which is that some of the conflict of interest laws do not provide for waivers at all. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is this: A statutory waiver of all the criminal conflict of interest laws for one person is simply wrong, it is very bad policy, and it establishes a dangerous precedent.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the need for this Internal Revenue Service restructuring legislation is clear. Last summer, the National Commission on Restructuring--following an extensive review of the IRS--issued a report to revamp the agency. 
Last September, the Finance Committee held 3 days of hearings regarding practices and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service, which raised even more startling problems that have been festering within the IRS for years. 
Following these hearings, the agency's new Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, released a report that validated the concerns we raised, and he made a commitment to reform the Service. Likewise, in response to these hearings, the House considered and passed an IRS restructuring bill in November, and the Finance Committee began the new year with a series of five hearings on restructuring, which included testimony from past IRS Commissioners. Those restructuring hearings were followed with what can only be considered the most in-depth IRS oversight hearings ever, which concluded only last Friday. Throughout this extensive effort at oversight restructuring, my colleagues and I have been working on the legislation before us today. Our staffs have been meeting. There have been countless hours, late nights, and early mornings spent to develop a restructured bill that is strong, thorough, and workable. I appreciate these efforts. I also compliment the House on its swift action on the earlier version, and recognize the very effective leadership of Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer. Their efforts provided a solid foundation for restructuring the agency, and made it clear that Congress is ready to respond to the demands of the American people and reform the IRS. That, again, became clear when the Senate Finance Committee voted 20 to nothing in support of the legislation which we are about to consider--legislation that takes a major step toward changing the way that the IRS does business with the American people. 
I call this legislation a major step because it provides greater protections and reforms that were included in the House bill. It goes much further than the House bill, offering powerful provisions to correct the abuses and inefficiencies our extensive investigation and oversight efforts have uncovered. But I also want to refer to this effort as a step, because I believe reform of the IRS must be an ongoing process. It must be a process of continued vigilance, constructive hearings, and cooperation between Congress and the executive branch. But anyone who reads all this legislation proposes will realize that it is a strong product of a collective effort. If this legislation were a collegiate athlete, it would be considered a blue-chip recruit. While it is not perfect, it is ready to play and includes numerous provisions that strengthen taxpayer protections. It makes IRS employees more accountable, provides enhanced oversight, gives the Commissioner the tools necessary to bring the IRS into the next century, and offers greater due process to taxpayers who are trying to comply with our complex tax laws. 
The legislation pending before us today allows Commissioner Rossotti to eliminate the current national office, regional office, and the district office structure of the IRS. It gives him the authority to replace these antiquated management models with operating units that will directly serve particular groups of taxpayers, better meeting their needs and making the agency much more efficient and user friendly. 
Commissioner Rossotti should be complimented on his tremendous work and managerial skills. His plan to restructure the agency is as bold as it is necessary, and this legislation gives him the authority he needs to move forward. 
One of the major concerns we've listened to throughout our oversight initiative--a theme that repeated itself over and over again--was that the taxpayers who get caught in the IRS hall of mirrors have no place to turn that is truly independent and structured to represent their concerns. With this legislation, we require the agency to establish an independent Office of Appeals--one that may not be influenced by tax collection employees or auditors. Appeals officers will be made available in every state, and they will be better able to work with taxpayers who proceed through the appeals process. 
We heard a lot about the need for independence in our hearings. Agency employees themselves made it clear that there is no dependable and consistent mechanism in place to represent taxpayer interests. Just as this bill will give the appeals process greater independence, it will also make the Office of Taxpayer Advocate as well as local problem resolution officers more independent. In the future, the Secretary of Treasury, rather than the Commissioner will appoint the National Taxpayer Advocate. And the Taxpayer Advocate will be just that. 
Criteria to fill this position will include that the Advocate must not be an IRS employee two years before and five years after holding this position. In addition, this bill provides the Advocate with much greater discretion to issue an assistance order to help taxpayers. 
In an effort to ensure that independent review and accountability become part of the IRS culture--top to bottom--our legislation creates a nine-member IRS Oversight Board--a board composed of six experts from various professional fields in the private sector, the Commissioner, the Secretary of Treasury, and a representative of IRS employees. 
As we heard in our oversight hearings, one of the key elements missing in the current agency is a powerful influence independent enough from management and the senior executive corps that it can monitor and hold managers and executives accountable for their actions, and the actions of their employees. Under our legislation, the Oversight Board will have broad responsibility and will ensure that the IRS has procedures in place to carry out its mission. 
In order to help prevent the types of abuses disclosed in our Finance Committee hearings, the Board will have `big picture' authority over law enforcement and collection activities. While the Board may not intervene in particular taxpayer or employee cases, it will have access to information in order to help prevent the types of abuses that are brought to the Board's attention. If the Commissioner does not respond to issues raised by the Board, the Board may contact the chairmen of the tax writing committees. 
We discovered in our hours and hours of testimony from IRS employees, and in the countless letters we received, that part of the intimidating culture of the agency is sustained by the fact that they feel there are no independent protections for them if they report wrong-doing. I was most disturbed to find in our investigation that there is a dangerous kill-the-messenger syndrome within the agency. Over 50% of employees servicewide believe that management does not communicate honestly with the rank-and-file. Fifty-four percent were adamant that there is distrust between management and employees. 
When asked if there is adequate protection from retaliation against employees who report misconduct, 72% either disagreed, strongly disagreed, or did not care to comment. More than one in four indicated that they believe management fails to treat employees with respect. And 30% strongly disagree that, `Disciplinary actions are applied fairly to employees.' If we are to have an agency that the public trusts and that the employees are proud of, these statistics must change. 
In an effort to do this, our legislation eliminates the IRS Office of Chief Inspector. It transfers its full time equivalents to a new Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. There have been too many allegations that the current IRS Office of Chief Inspector does not have sufficient independence from the IRS to adequately fulfill its obligation. Likewise, the current Treasury Inspector General, which lacks resources and has experienced problems of its own, does not provide seamless oversight over the IRS. 
This change is one of the most important distinctions between the House bill and the Senate bill, and it is of critical importance. 
Our bill creates a new Treasury IG for Tax Administration which will have greater independence than the IRS Chief Inspector. This provision is supported by Commissioner Rossotti, and will create a structure where the new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will not allow oversight to fall through the cracks, and will provide a seamless check on how tax laws are being administered. 
This new Treasury IG for Tax Administration will provide independent investigations of alleged IRS employee misconduct without management interference. The new Treasury IG will also respond in a timely manner to requests to investigate or audit made by the Commissioner or the IRS Oversight Board. 
I believe that an intimidating edge now exists in the current management structure. The statistics I've just disclosed confirm that this is true. 
One of the problems is that the Commissioner does not have the kind of authority that is necessary to eliminate those managers who contaminate the culture of the agency. And the Commissioner does not have sufficient authority to hire those who will work toward making the kinds of changes that are necessary. This legislation gives the Commissioner the tools he needs to hire top-flight managers who are experts in their field. 
It gives him the wherewithal to transform the agency's workforce by providing bonuses and other incentives, and to sufficiently discipline employees whose inappropriate actions are a plague on the agency. 
As we have seen--even this past week--the Finance Committee has disclosed egregious conduct by IRS employees. We have received thousands of letters relating the same. 
They have come from taxpayers and agency employees, alike. The stories we have heard are outrageous, as is the fact that many of those who perpetrate these abuses do so without consequence. This will not stand. Our bill requires the IRS to terminate an employee if it is proven that the employee failed to obtain required authorization to seize a taxpayer's property, committed perjury material to a taxpayer's matter, or falsified or destroyed documents to conceal the employee's mistakes with respect to a taxpayer's case. 
This legislation allows terminations to take place if an IRS employee engages in abuses or egregious misconduct. Conditions for which an employee can be dismissed include, but are not limited to, assaulting or battering a taxpayer or other IRS employee, violating the civil rights of a taxpayer or other IRS employee, or breaking the law, regulations, or IRS policies for the purpose of retaliating or harassing a taxpayer or other IRS employee. 
Our legislation also allows an employee to be fired for willfully misusing section 6103 authority to conceal information from Congress. 
With this legislation, we show that we mean business. An environment that allows employees guilty of these kinds of behaviors to continue to work within the system is not acceptable to me, the Finance Committee, or to the American people. We have heard enough excuses. And Commissioner Rossotti agrees that enough is enough! 
One of the most troubling issues raised in our September hearings was the widespread use of enforcement statistics to evaluate front line IRS employees and their supervisors. 
Subsequent reports by the IRS Chief Inspector substantiated our findings that the agency was, in fact, illegally evaluating employees based on enforcement statistics. Then, in our hearings just last week, we heard that such evaluations continue. In my mind, Mr. President, this mocks Congress. It demonstrates that the IRS believes it is above the law. It is indicative of a culture that believes that if it will simply hold on long enough oversight and accountability will go away and the managers and executives who have made careers out of bending the law can get back to business as usual. 
The bill pending before us strengthens the law against this. It prohibits the use of enforcement statistics to evaluate any IRS employee, not merely front line collection employees and their supervisors. And the new Treasury IG would be required to report on whether the IRS is abiding by the law. 
Each of the measures I have outlined thus far demonstrates just how serious we are in our effort to change the Internal Revenue Service. 
Each will go a long way towards protecting the taxpayer and honest employees who are working to make the IRS a true service-oriented agency. But we don't stop here. We offer much more in the way of taxpayer protections. We shift the burden of proof to the IRS if the taxpayer maintains records, cooperates with the agency, and provides credible evidence to the court. In addition, the IRS will have the burden of providing a taxpayer's income if it uses arbitrary statistics to determine that income. 
This legislation also allows taxpayers to recover attorney fees and costs from the date the taxpayer rightfully appeals an audit, and it eliminates the $110 per hour cap on recoverable attorney fees. Taxpayers should not be forced to litigate if the IRS is unreasonable. In order to level the playing field, if the agency forces a taxpayer to litigate and go to trial, our bill allows a taxpayer to recover all attorney fees and costs from the time the taxpayer makes a qualified offer if the amount of the court judgment is equal to or less than the taxpayer's offer. 
Taxpayers should not have to foot the bill if the IRS is unreasonable. Beyond this, our legislation includes various provisions which allow taxpayers and third parties to recover against the IRS for civil damages. It also establishes procedures for third parties to have erroneous liens removed from their property. 
Another major taxpayer protection in this legislation is our provision to strengthen innocent spouse relief. This legislation overhauls the current innocent spouse relief which is wholly inadequate. 
We do this by limiting a spouse's tax liability to the proportion of his or her income reported on the tax return, or returns, in question. As a result of concerns raised by members of the Finance Committee, relief would not be available in cases of fraud, or if the IRS proves the taxpayer claiming innocent spouse relief had actual knowledge of an item giving rise to the tax liability. 
Some of the most tragic stories our committee heard concerned innocent spouses whose economic lives have been ruined by the unrelenting pursuit of IRS collections officers. 
What we propose here are needed changes--changes that will bring a semblance of sanity to the current system and protect honest spouses who, under no circumstances, should be held accountable for the liabilities of their former spouses just because they are easier to find or more vulnerable to intimidation. Many of the innocent spouses we listened to in our hearings--and many of the letters I have reviewed since--told us how they have been placed under terrible burdens because of interest and penalties that continue to grow as their cases age. 
Again, with this legislation, we do something about that. We make necessary and important changes to how penalties and interest are applied. In order to prevent IRS employees from arbitrarily using penalties as leverage against taxpayers, our legislation requires non-computer determined penalties to be approved by management. Furthermore, each notice to taxpayers which includes a penalty or interest must specify how the amount was calculated. Our legislation disallows the imposition of the failure-to-pay penalty while the taxpayer is in an installment agreement. 
It allows the taxpayer to designate deposits for each payroll period rather than using the first-in-first-out--`FIFO'--method that results in cascading penalties. 
Under this bill, if the IRS does not provide a notice of deficiency within one year after a return is timely filed, then interest and penalties will be suspended until 21 days after demand for payment. Of course, this increased protection--as all increased protections--are meant to protect honest taxpayers. 
We will not excuse those who evade their responsibility or cheat on their income tax returns. These protections exclude the failure to file, failure to pay, and penalties related to fraud. 
Increased protections for honest taxpayers will also affect due process. This was one of the glaring issues raised in our IRS hearings. 
Currently there is a woeful lack of protection in this area, particularly during collection activity, where the IRS is the judge and jury, and where some agency employees take a cavalier approach to issuing a notice of lien, levy, or seizure of a taxpayer's home, personal belongings, or business property. In order to ensure due process to taxpayers, our bill requires the IRS to provide 30-days notice to a taxpayer before it may issue a notice of lien, levy, or seizure. 
If the taxpayer requests a hearing, all collection activity must stop. If the taxpayer disputes the findings of the appeals officer, the taxpayer may petition the tax court for relief. 
Our legislation requires the IRS to implement a review process under which liens, levies, and seizures would be approved by a supervisor who would review the taxpayer's information, verify that a balance is due, and affirm that a lien, levy, or seizure is appropriate under the circumstances, including the amount due and the value of the asset. 
Failure to follow these procedures, under our legislation, would result in disciplinary action against the revenue officer and his or her supervisor. We also require the Treasury Inspector General to collect this information and annually report to the tax writing committees of Congress. 
On those occasions when the IRS makes seizures, the agency will be required to follow certain procedures and provide an accounting to the taxpayers. It is unbelievable that the IRS does not currently provide a receipt to taxpayers when their property is seized and sold. 
Revenue Officers have incredible discretion. As such, this bill requires the IRS to implement a uniform asset disposal system for sales of seized property to prevent revenue officers from conducting sales. 
It would prohibit the IRS from seizing real property used as a residence if the unpaid tax liability is less than $5,000. Also, a principal residence or business property would only be seized as a last resort. 
In the area of examination, our bill expands the attorney-client privilege to other tax practitioners to the extent such communications would be privileged between an attorney and his client. 
It limits IRS authority to require the production of computer source code and establishes a number of protections against the disclosure and improper use of trade secrets and confidential information of any computer software program or source code that comes into the possession of the IRS as part of an examination of a taxpayer. 
The legislation allows taxpayers to bring an action to quash all third-party summonses by informing the taxpayers of such summonses before the IRS contacts the third party. 
Beyond these important changes, this legislation introduces several other measures to protect the taxpayer. It is surprising how long some IRS cases remain open and how long some taxpayers remain in the crosshairs of the agency. This is accomplished when the IRS pressures taxpayers, often by threatening them, to waive the 10-year statute of limitations on collection. Mr. President, 10 years is long enough, and to protect these taxpayers, our bill would prohibit waivers of the collection statute. It would also make it easier for taxpayers, who dispute the amount of their tax liability or can't pay the full amount, to compromise with the IRS or enter into installment agreements. 
The legislation that we introduce today also provides taxpayers with an enhanced mechanism to appeal an audit, request early referral to appeals, and request alternative dispute resolution. It includes various routine requirements, including an explanation of the reason for denial of a refund and annual statement to taxpayers regarding the amount remaining on their installment agreement. 
The bill also requires IRS notices to include the name and phone number of an IRS employee the taxpayer should contact to resolve any issue on the notice. 
In order to protect innocent taxpayers who are improperly labeled as `illegal tax protesters,' this bill will, out and out, prohibit such designation. It will also take an important step towards helping Congress simplify the law by requiring the Joint Tax Committee to prepare a complexity analysis on tax legislation. 
As you can see, Mr. President, this is a very thorough, comprehensive piece of legislation. It is extremely important. There is no question that it is well worth the wait. When our hearing began last September, an agency employee made a complaint that lodged itself in my mind, one that I have not been able to forget. He said, `If the true number of incidents of taxpayer abuse was ever known, the public would be appalled. If the public also knew the number of abuses covered up by the IRS, there would be a taxpayer revolt.' 
What we bring with this important legislation is a new era of openness to an agency that for too long has been able to operate beyond the view of Congress. 
We bring a new era of accountability to an agency marked by a culture that protects even the most lawless employees from the consequences of their actions. 
We bring a new era of efficiency and modern management to an organizational structure that dates back to before the industrial age. 
We bring forward a promise of hope to honest taxpayers and valued employees who have waited too long. With this legislation, Commissioner Rossotti will be able to transform the IRS, provide accountability, and establish much-needed taxpayer protection. Americans, for the first time ever, will have a tax collection agency marked by a sincere dedication to service. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it would be a great mistake to condition the future of the NATO, a transatlantic military alliance of unparalleled success led by the United States, to actions and decisions of the European Union. The EU is a strictly European political-economic organization of which the United States is not a member and has no say. For this reason, it is with great regret that I stand in opposition to my good friend, the Senator from New York, and urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
EU enlargement is highly desirable on its own merits. Indeed, the Resolution of Ratification specifically states it is the policy of the United States to encourage EU enlargement. 
However, as worthy as EU enlargement is, it should not be formally linked to NATO enlargement. Nor should EU membership serve as a condition for NATO aspirants. Let me emphasize three basic reasons: 
First, this amendment is inconsistent with the Washington Treaty. Article 10 of the Treaty states that membership in NATO is open to, and I quote, `any European State in a position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.' 
The North Atlantic Treaty makes no mention of the European Union. Moreover, several NATO member states are not EU members, including the United States, Canada, Turkey, Iceland and Norway. Are they any less effective members of the Alliance because they are not part of the EU? The answer is unambiguously NO. 
And what if Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic decide, as Norway has--a founding member of NATO-- that membership in the European Union in not in their interests? I point this out to highlight that this amendment establishes an arbitrary standard that is not necessarily a reflection of a NATO aspirant's state of economic and political well-being. 
Second, Mr President, by conditioning NATO membership on attainment of EU membership, this amendment would strip the Alliance of control over its own future--specifically its decisions over future membership--and transfer it over the European Union. The EU is not a transatlantic organization. It has no effective security or defense capability or policy for that matter. Let us not forget, it was a complete failure in the effort to end to the conflict in Bosnia. Do we really want the EU to have such significant influence over NATO? 
And, let us not over look the fact that this amendment could well suspend NATO enlargement indefinitely. EU enlargement is far from certain. It is far from clear when the EU will extend its membership to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. It could be a decade, if not more for all we know. There are still significant political forces and economic interests within the EU deeply opposed to EU enlargement. 
Third, this amendment would undercut U.S. leadership of NATO by relegating the United States--and the United States Senate for that matter--to a second class tier of Alliance members. Why? because NATO members who are not in the European Union would be denied the same voice and authority over the future of the Alliance that this amendment would reserve for those NATO countries that are members of the European Union. 
In one fell swoop, this amendment would: impose an unprecedented restriction upon the Washington Treaty; transfer key decisions over NATO's future to the EU, an European institution that lacks an effective security policy; demote the United States to a new second-class tier of Alliance members; and, thereby weaken U.S. leadership of NATO. 
I am sure that these are not the intentions behind this amendment, but they would clearly be the consequences. My colleagues, we have no choice but to vote this amendment down.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as well intentioned as the Warner amendment may be, I urge my colleagues to oppose it. To accept it would be inconsistent with the NATO Treaty. It would unnecessarily limit U.S. flexibility in pursuing further enlargement. It is constitutionally unnecessary. And, above all, it undercuts the tremendous gains for peace accomplished over the last decade in Central Europe and in our relationship with Russia. 
What this amendment proposes is an arbitrary freeze--or a pause--in the enlargement process. This, despite the fact that Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, the Alliance's founding charter, states clearly that membership is open to, and I quote, `any other European state in a position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.' 
Mr. President, we all agree that NATO is an unprecedented success in deterring conflict and promoting peace and stability. Toward these ends, NATO has been expanded three times in the past. To remain vital, relevant, and successful in the future, NATO must remain consistent with Article 10 and keep its doors open to those European democracies ready to bear the responsibilities and burdens of membership. 
NATO enlargement is a policy rooted in this principle and driven by moral imperatives, strategic self-interest, and objective criteria concerning military readiness and political and economic reform. Any proposal to freeze enlargement--whether it be permanent or temporary--subordinates these factors to an arbitrary timeline. And it opens the door to other significantly adverse consequences for the United States and the Alliance: 
First, a freeze would reduce U.S. flexibility and leverage within NATO. It would unnecessarily undercut our ability--and the Alliance's ability--to respond to the inherent uncertainty of the future. 
Second, it would send an unfortunate, and even dangerous message to the reformist governments of Central Europe. They would suppose--and not incorrectly--that the United States is slamming the door shut concerning their possible accession into the Alliance. 
Do we really wish to send such a disillusioning message? 
Article 10 of the Washington Treaty was a source of hope to Central Europeans during Soviet oppression. The prospect of NATO membership remains an important incentive for democratic and economic reform. It has motivated the reconciliations between Germany and the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, Romania and Hungary, Romania and Ukraine, as well as Italy and Slovenia, among others. Their unprecedented efforts to cooperate among themselves and to jointly consolidate peace and security in that region must be strengthened, not undercut. 
Third, a mandated pause created by this amendment would prompt a new dividing line in Europe. If Central European countries not invited into NATO conclude that the process of enlargement has not only stalled, but stopped, a key incentive behind the aforementioned regional cooperation, including their current participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, will be seriously undercut. Thus, a freeze on enlargement would impede, if not reverse, the remarkable development of European security around an Alliance-determined agenda. 
Fourth, Mr. President, an arbitrary freeze on NATO enlargement would harm Russia's historic reconciliation with NATO and the United States. A freeze would appear to give Moscow a veto over enlargement. It certainly would be interpreted as a victory--proof of their own legitimacy--by those who still advocate a Russian sphere of influence over its neighbors. Worse yet, it could lead others to draw the same conclusion. A freeze would undercut the basic principle that all of Europe's states have a right to choose their own security arrangements--a principle that must be one of the cornerstones of Russia's relationships with the United States and NATO. 
While I am sure the intentions behind this amendment are admirable, we must recognize that its consequences would be potentially disastrous. It would undercut U.S. leadership and influence within the Alliance. It would contradict the founding document of the Alliance. It would threaten the historic progress we have witnessed in Central Europe--progress from which we all benefit. And It would reject a principle fundamental to establishment of a constructive relationship with a democratic Russia. 
I suspect, Mr. President, that one false premise behind this amendment is that NATO enlargement has been a rushed process. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The velvet revolutions that restored democracy and independence to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary took place in 1989. Nearly a decade will have passed before these three countries become NATO members in 1999. 
Moreover, the Senate has not rushed, and is not being rushed, into endorsing NATO enlargement. This chamber and its committees have been examining and promoting this initiative since 1993, if not earlier. Anyone concerned about the future enlargement process can be assured that the same careful study, debate, and oversight that has attended this past effort will attend those to come. Read the resolution of ratification carefully. It explicitly requires extensive consultation between the Senate and the President about any such initiative. 
It states that the `United States will not support the admission of, or the invitation for admission of, any new NATO member, unless (I) the President consults with the Senate consistent with Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States (relating to the advice and consent of the Senate to the making of treaties); and (II) the prospective members can fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of membership, and its inclusion would serve the overall political and strategic interests of NATO and the United States.' 
Before, I yield the floor, Mr. President, let me reiterate a key point to those who fear a rushed process of further NATO enlargement. The bottom line, is that further expansion of the Alliance will always be contingent on careful study, public debate, high-level consultations, political consensus, and the strategic interests of NATO and the United States. Any further expansion will also be contingent on Senate ratification--the difficult hurdle of securing 67 votes. 
For these and other reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against any proposal that undercuts the founding document and basic principles of the NATO Alliance. The ratification of the accession of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to NATO will erase destabilizing lines, which are relics of the Cold War. This amendment portends only be a step toward new, divisive lines in Europe--and, that is something we should never accept. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. I fully recognize that the sponsors of this amendment are motivated by the desire to preserve the vitality of NATO and the central priority of its collective defense mission. These are goals that I fully endorse. However, the motivations behind this amendment and its real and potential impact upon the Alliance are leagues apart. Mr. President, this amendment would do great damage to the Alliance and to the interests of the United States. 
First, it intends to unilaterally impose for the first time in the history of the Alliance new restrictions on NATO's roles and missions. And it would do so, in absence of serious consultations within the Alliance. 
Second, such a unilateral move by the Senate runs counter to the spirit and traditions of the Alliance. It would invite other allies to unilaterally impose their own restrictions and definitions on the terms of the Washington Treaty. We must not set the Alliance upon such a slippery and divisive slope. 
Third, by imposing such restrictions, this amendment would undercut the ability of the United States to prompt NATO to take actions necessary to protect and defend the interests of the North Atlantic community. Worse yet, the language of this amendment would undermine the ability of the United States to call NATO to action in defense of American security interests. 
Fourth, this chamber has repeatedly called upon our Allies to stop the decline of their defense establishments and do more to bear burdens of the Alliance. This amendment directly undercuts those efforts to attain more equitable burden-sharing within the Alliance and the transatlantic community. It would do by granting our European allies yet another excuse to not improve their defense forces. 
At its best this amendment in unnecessary to achieve the goals of its sponsors. At its worst, the amendment would undercut the Alliance's will and capability to defend the security interests of the North Atlantic community of democracies. 
This amendment is unnecessary to attain the goal of preventing the United States from being drawn into dangerous peace-keeping operations that the countries of Europe should handle on their own. The United States already reserves the right to veto any such initiative within or by the Alliance. Moreover, Article 5 of the Washington Treaty makes U.S. Participation in a NATO mission strictly a national decision. It is not an obligation. That has always been the case and will always remain the case in NATO. 
It is quite evident that not everyone in the Senate supports the decision of the United States to have NATO lead the effort to bring peace to the Balkans. Nonetheless, it was a national decision by the United States and the United States Congress to support the NATO mission in Bosnia. And, the fact is that this military operation is completely consistent with the Washington Treaty. We should not allow disagreements with the foreign policy of the executive branch, as serious as they may be, to prompt dangerous revisions or restrictions upon a treaty that has been an unprecedented success for the deterrence of aggression and the preservation of peace. Yet, that is exactly what this amendment would do. 
I understand that one key intent of the amendment is to express the opinion that the Alliance must remain first and foremost an institution of collective defense. That goal is already accomplished through the resolution of ratification. Just read it. 
Section 3.1.A of the resolution of ratification declares clearly that the `core purpose of NATO must continue to be the collective defense of the territory of all NATO members.' The resolution makes crystal clear that the Senate firmly believes that NATO's first priority must be the mission of collective defense. 
Unfortunately, this amendment is not only unnecessary, it is dangerous. By attempting to define and restrict the missions that NATO can and should undertake, it risks foreclosing the ability of the United States to seek NATO's assistance in confronting future threats to the transatlantic community of nations. 
Ironically, this amendment's current construction would not keep the United States from becoming engaged in any future `Bosnia-type contingencies'--a core intent of its authors--because such contingencies as Bosnia can be defined as meeting its requirements. Indeed, the U.S. Congress has done just that by supporting our troops in Bosnia. But, this amendment, could serve as an excuse for our allies to avoid sharing the risks and burdens of such contingencies with the United States. 
In a world of rogue states with biological, chemical and nuclear weapons increasingly at their disposal, why would we, the United States Senate, want to undercut NATO's willingness and ability to defend the common interests of the North Atlantic community of democracies? Why would we, the United States Senate discard one of the best vehicles through which to prompt allied support for U.S. security interests?

Mr. ROTH. The fact is that the policy of the United States and the policy of NATO have always permitted actions by the Alliance that go beyond the narrow scope of territorial defense. Yet, this amendment clearly attempts to constrict the interpretation of the Washington treaty rendered by its founding fathers. 
And, let us not underestimate what kind of example passage of this amendment would set for our Allies. It would encourage our European Allies to impose their own unilateral reinterpretations or restrictions upon the Washington treaty. Imagine our reaction, if one of the parliaments or governments of our allies were to attach such conditions to NATO enlargement. How would we react, if for example, one ally were to prohibit the use of NATO-designated units against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq? Judging from recent events in the Persian Gulf, I imagine the reaction in this chamber would be one of complete outrage. 
Mr. President, we must also be aware of the message this amendment would send to our European Allies should the Senate make the profound mistake of accepting it. 
For years, the United States, and especially the United States Congress, has worked arduously to make our European Allies more outward looking in their security policies and to assume a greater share of the risks and burdens in addressing common challenges and threats. We have repeatedly called upon them to stop the decline of their defense establishments and to devote the resources that will enable them to better contribute to the transatlantic security. 
Yet this amendment, perhaps inadvertently, would signal that the business of NATO is only territorial defense, and no more. It would thereby eliminate any motivation for the Allies to field the forces necessary for post-Cold War missions. It would serve as an excuse to let the military establishments continue an over decade long decline. 
Worse, this amendment would infer that the United States views the Alliance as having limited value in the post-Cold War era. This is an important point made by David Gompert, and I fully agree. Passage of this amendment could be interpreted by our allies and the detractors of the Alliance that the United States no longer regards its vital interests as being best secured through the fabric of the transatlantic community and the NATO alliance. That would be a dangerously counterproductive message--a message that would ignore the lessons of two world wars and the Cold War. I just don't believe that our memory is so short. 
Mr. President, the Senate must reject this amendment. As I stated earlier, at its best, this amendment is redundant and unnecessary. At its worst, it is a radical and dangerous departure from the Washington Treaty of 1949 and the way in which the United States has over the years used the Alliance to advance our own national interests.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, while I have great respect for the distinguished Senator from Texas, I strongly oppose this amendment and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
Last month, when we first addressed this amendment, I stated the reasons for my opposition. In the intervening time, nothing has changed my perspectives. Indeed, my opposition has only hardened. 
This opposition is based on four very clear and simple points: 
First, the establishment of a formal dispute resolution mechanism within the Alliance would undercut the authority of the North Atlantic Council, the Alliance's supreme decision-making body. 
Second, the proposal would change the focus of the Alliance from collective defense to dispute resolution. That would fundamentally transform the very culture of the Alliance, one that is now primarily derived from its mission of collective defense. 
Third, the establishment of a dispute resolution mechanism would introduce into NATO a dangerous catalyst for inter-Alliance tensions. It would serve as a magnet for disputes that exacerbate tensions within the Alliance. 
And fourth, by inviting and exacerbating tensions and disputes into the Alliance, this proposal would weaken the Alliance's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense. 
When it comes to formal dispute resolution, we should look toward the United Nations or the OSCE--an international organization in Europe dedicated to preventing, mediating and bringing an end to disputes between countries. But, I don't think that we want to transform NATO, the most successful military alliance in history, into another OSCE. 
I fear that this proposal implies that the NAC--and the Alliance--has failed in fostering cohesion among its European members over the last fifty years. I do not believe any of us would say that is true. 
Let us not forget that in its current form, NATO has proven itself to be a remarkable forum through which differences between Allies have been mitigated and managed. The clearest example of this influence is the alliance's positive contributions to relations between Turkey and Greece. This success is very much due to the trust this fostered through the Alliance's focus on war-fighting. We must be careful to not undercut this success. 
Yet that is exactly what this proposal would do. If the Alliance were to follow through on this proposal articulated by the good Senator from Texas, it would establish a new body possibly independent from the NAC. That is a major change to the Alliance. It will create a process that in no small way will distract members of the Alliance from the core mission of collective defense. It will serve as an incentive for them to use the Alliance as a means to pursue a laundry list of other matters--many of a strictly national, and not Allied, concern. 
That's how this proposal would invite tensions within the Alliance. That's how it would undercut its mission of collective defense. That mission requires cohesion and it requires focus. This amendment portends to undercut both. 
Moreover, offering this amendment implies that the United States regards Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as unstable and more contentious than other members. I do not believe that is the sense of the Senate. 
As well intentioned this amendment may be, it contradicts its own objectives and would severely damage the vital interests of the Alliance. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Judge Gregory Sleet, who was confirmed by the Senate earlier today as a District Judge for Delaware. Unfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to personally greet him or his family when they came to the Capitol for his hearing before the Judiciary Committee just over a month ago. But today, it is my pleasure to congratulate Judge Sleet, his wife Mary and their two children on this achievement. 
Since 1994, Greg Sleet has served Delaware as our U.S. Attorney. From that post, he was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to serve as the Vice-Chair of her Advisory Committee. 
While his record of public service is impressive, so, too, is his previous work in the private sector. You see, Judge Sleet served Hercules Incorporated, an outstanding Delaware company, as legal counsel before becoming our U.S. Attorney. Having worked in the same capacity with Hercules some years earlier, I know first-hand that they hire only the sharpest young lawyers to handle their legal affairs. 
Mr. President, the Senate needed not even four months to complete our work on Judge Sleet's nomination. I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman Hatch  for his efforts to review the nomination in such an expeditious manner. Such prompt action speaks to the quality of the nominee, and I am happy to again congratulate Judge Sleet on the occasion of his confirmation by the Senate.

Mr. ROTH. First, let me express my gratitude and thanks to my colleague, the junior Senator from Delaware, for his effective leadership in this most important foreign affairs matter. He, of course, speaks as an expert, as one who is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and, of course, cochairs with me the Senate observer group. 
I just want to publicly acknowledge the strong leadership role he is playing in what I consider the most important foreign policy matter that will come before this Congress.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as the Senate resumes consideration of the resolution of ratification for NATO enlargement, I would like to commend my colleagues for the debate that has occurred thus far. 
In the few days that the Senate has already dedicated to this important issue, and I speak before the debate today, some 21 Members of this Chamber have expressed their views. I have listened intently to their arguments and I have been impressed by the substantive dialog. This vote on NATO and its future is perhaps the most important foreign policy decision we will make since the end of the cold war. I appreciate the efforts my colleagues have dedicated to this matter. 
I have long felt that NATO enlargement is a policy whose time is past due. The case for NATO enlargement is indisputable. The accession of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, the only three countries that are the focus of the resolution before us, will, without a doubt, strengthen the alliance. It will eliminate the stabilizing and immoral dividing lines imposed upon Europe by dictators of the past. It will consolidate peace and stability on that continent. A stable and peaceful Europe will benefit the entire transatlantic community, as well as Russia. 
I could elaborate on these points and other important benefits of NATO enlargement, but I have done that on many occasions in the past. Today, instead, I wish to address a number of arguments that I have heard made directly against this important policy. For example, in the course of our debate it has been incorrectly asserted that the Senate is rushing this important debate and that it remains inadequately prepared to address this issue. 
This is wrong. Few issues of national security have been as extensively examined by the Congress as well as the public. NATO enlargement has been the topic of countless editorials and opinion pieces in national and local papers. By one estimate, over 1,000 scholarly article opinion pieces and editorials on NATO enlargement have been published in leading journals since 1994. A quick count of editorials and opinion pieces in the New York Times found that it has run some 72 such articles over the past 3 years. A quick survey of the Washington Post found another 90 over the same period of time. In other words, these two nationally syndicated papers have published articles on NATO enlargement at a rate exceeding one every 10 days. This does not take into account the other important national, local journals. 
I might suggest that those who believe this issue has not been well vetted may not be reading the right papers. Either that or they have not been interested enough in the issue to be aware that a debate concerning this policy has been waged for 3 years. Over the last 2 years, some 15 States--including my first State, Delaware--have passed resolutions endorsing nuclear enlargement. Moreover, this policy has been endorsed by countless civic public policy, political, business, and veteran organizations. 
I point to a chart beside me, the number of organizations that have supported NATO enlargement. All of our outstanding veteran organizations, the AMVETS, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars--just to mention a few--have all endorsed NATO enlargement. We could point to the many other organizations that have done exactly the same. 
Congress itself has been deeply engaged in NATO enlargement from the very beginning of this policy initiative. In fact, Congress has not only done its homework on this matter, Congress Has led the charge for NATO enlargement. I think that is particularly important to understand, that Congress has been in the lead on NATO enlargement. 
Its committees have examined in detail the military, intelligence, foreign policy and budgetary implications of this long overdue initiative. 
Since last July alone, thirteen hearings have been conducted on NATO enlargement by the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Appropriations, and Budget. 
The Senate NATO Observer Group, which I chair with Senator Joe Biden, has convened seventeen times with, among others, the President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, NATO's Secretary General, and the leaders of the three invitee countries. 
In support of these Congressional initiatives, the Congressional Research Service and the General Accounting Office have produced some 30 objective, non-partisan reports and countless memos on the subject of NATO enlargement. 
As I said when we began this debate, it is no surprise--indeed, for me, it is a matter of pride--that Congress has legislatively promoted NATO enlargement every year since 1994. Perhaps a good question is how can we ensure that all dimensions of U.S. national security policy benefit from this much public attention and endorsement. 
The second argument that one often hears falsely asserts that the extension of NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will dilute the Alliance because their military capabilities do not match those of Allied nations. 
It is true that the militaries of these three countries must be modernized. They do not deny that. That is why these three countries have embarked on military modernization programs that involve regular increases in their defense budgets. And, these programs have been endorsed by NATO's political and military authorities. 
Earlier this year, I and a few members of the NATO Observer Group met with General Klaus Naumann, a highly respected German military officer who is Chairman of NATO's military committee. He stated that because Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are so committed to modernizing their militaries they may sooner rather than later find themselves better equipped and more technologically advanced than some of the current Allies. 
To see the level of contribution that these countries will make to the Alliance, we need only look at what they have done and are doing today. Already, they are enhancing the Alliance's military capabilities. They contributed forces to Operation Desert Storm. They have forces serving by the side of U.S. Forces as part of S-FOR in Bosnia. They were among the first to commit forces to stand by the United States in the recent stand-off against Saddam Hussein. 
NATO commanders, including those from the United States, have stated clearly that the admission of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will increase the capabilities of the Alliance. And this view is shared by some sixty retired four-star admirals and generals, including former Chiefs of the Joint Staff, former Supreme Allied Commanders of Europe, and numerous former Service Chiefs. 
Mr. President, the facts before us today, and the endorsements of these military leaders, can only leave one fully confident that the admission of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO will leave the Alliance stronger. We can be confident that these three democracies will not only be model members of the alliance but also pro-American Allies. 
A third argument that has been voiced by some of my colleagues falsely asserts that NATO enlargement threatens Russia, or that we should abandon this policy because Russia perceives it as threatening. 
The reality is that NATO is a defensive Alliance of democracies. Its decision-making process is consensual, and I find it hard to believe that any one of its members--all democracies--would ever advocate aggression. 
The fact is that NATO poses no immediate military threat to Russia. U.S. force deployments in Europe, arguably the Alliance's most mobile component, has been reduced by two-thirds since the Cold War. Allied force structures and defense budgets have declined steadily over the last decade. The Alliance has stated that it has no intention to permanently station foreign forces or deploy nuclear weapons on the territories of new member states. Where is the threat to Russia? 
Those who argue that NATO enlargement threatens Russia have also asserted that this policy directly contradicts efforts to reduce the risk of nuclear confrontation with Russia and to ensure that Russia's nuclear arsenal does not leak out to rogue states. 
The evidence however shows that this assertion is false. Since 1994, when NATO first announced its intentions to open its membership to the democracies of Central Europe, the risks of nuclear war have not increased, but been reduced. There is no evidence that NATO enlargement has hurt cooperation with Russia on nuclear matters. 
First, the actual number of Russian and American operational strategic nuclear weapons have continued to decline. In 1990, that number was about 24,000 warheads. Today, that number is in the vicinity of 14,000 warheads, and Moscow is dismantling its strategic nuclear forces at a rate faster than that required by the START I treaty. 
Second, the Russian government has again reiterated its commitment to ratify the START II treaty, which will further reduce these two strategic nuclear arsenals. Those who note that the Russian parliament, which has voiced its opposition to NATO enlargement and continues to block the ratification of START II, should recognize that the same Duma has blocked START II long before NATO enlargement was formally endorsed by the NAC. 
And, let me add that the Russian government has agreed to pursue a START III accord once START II enters force. 
Third, the Nunn-Lugar Threat Reduction Program continues to improve the Russian's control and security of their nuclear arsenal. Indeed, this program has been enthusiastically received by Russia. It stands out as one of the true success stories of Russian-American partnership in the post-cold-war era. 
Our policies toward Europe must focus on these objective strategic realities and must be structured to enhance economic, political, and military stability in all parts of Europe. That is exactly what NATO enlargement does. That is in our national interest and in Russia's national interest. 
For those who are still concerned about Russia's fear of NATO enlargement, let me share with you a recent poll conducted in Moscow. 
Earlier this year, a branch of the Gallup Organization, found that among respondents in Moscow: 53 percent said that Poland should be allowed to join NATO; 57 percent said that the Czech Republic should be allowed to join NATO; and 54 percent said that Hungary should be allowed to join NATO. 
These polling results are not surprising if one takes into account the fact that NATO enlargement is facilitating unprecedented reconciliation between Russia and its neighbors. The reconciliation now occurring between Warsaw and Moscow and Moscow and Kyev are positive developments for Russian citizens, and they understand this. They also understand that such developments would not be occurring with NATO enlargement. 
And, let us not forget the open and inclusive manner in which Nato and the West has approached Russia. The Alliance has extended the hand of partnership through the NATO-Russia Founding Act, and today Russian troops serve with NATO forces in Bosnia. The West has extended some $100 billion in assistance since 1991, to help Russia's democratic and economic reforms, and over $2 billion in weapon dismantlement and security assistance. On top of that, Russia has regularly been invited to participate in the G-7 or G-8 meetings. This is hardly--as some detractors might try to persuade--a policy of punishment and isolation. 
It is false and even misleading to assert that Russia is being surrounded by a ring of isolation. Rather, NATO's policies have been more like a strong magnet drawing Russia out of its historically self-imposed isolation into a growing web of political and military cooperation. Such cooperation holds out the prospect of an entirely new and constructive relationship with a reforming and democratic Russia. 
Mr. President, I hope that these three points have added clarity to the Senate's consideration of NATO membership. There are few policy initiatives as important as this one. There are few that stand to offer peace-living people throughout the transatlantic community and in Central and Eastern Europe so much hope--hope for greater stability, increased security, enhanced cooperation, and even a collective vision for the future. I encourage my colleagues to support NATO enlargement. History is being made, and for the sake of those who have long-awaited this moment, we must not keep it waiting. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I'm pleased that we are moving toward passage of this significant bill. The importance of giving American families the resources and means they need to educate their children must be above politics. 
Before I get into the specific benefits of the bill, let me remind my colleagues that with the exception of several school construction bond provisions--which were newly added this year--all of the concepts in this bill should be very familiar. 
Mr. President, these concepts should be familiar because we have already endorsed them. The base provisions in the bill--which include the increase in the maximum allowable contribution to an education IRA, the use of the IRA for elementary and secondary school expenses for public and private schools, the tax-free treatment of state sponsored prepaid tuition plans, and the extension of tax-free treatment for employer provided educational assistance--all received bipartisan support from the Senate as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Despite this Senate support, these provisions were dropped from the bill during conference negotiations. Because of opposition from the Administration, these particular elements failed to be included in the final version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Today we will show our commitment to these provisions--and to enact what this body has already determined makes good sense for American families. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that this tax bill is not designed to answer all of the education-related issues that face this country. Those issues are too varied and complicated to be addressed by the federal government. They need to be solved at the state and local level--by schools, teachers, and parents working together. 
Instead, this bill is designed to build on the innovative concepts that have been introduced in the last few years. Our goal is to improve the tax code so that it provides the necessary incentives to help American families help their children. These are much needed tools. 
Over the past 15 years, tuition at a four year college has increased by 234%. The average student loan has increased by 367%. In contrast median household income rose only 82% during this period and the consumer price index rose only 74%. 
Our students--our families--need these resources to help them meet the costs and realize the opportunities of a quality education. The Senate recognized the importance of these provisions less than one year ago, voting in favor of them. I hope that my colleagues continue to recognize just how important they remain. The American people are counting on us. 
The various provisions of this bill are important measures that will aid our students and parents. 
The first major change in this bill increases the maximum education IRA contribution from $500 to $2,000. That increase is important on two levels. First, with the well-documented increase in education costs, it is essential that we provide American families with the resources to meet those costs. 
I have long argued that it is essential to change the savings habits of the American people, and there are few things more important than the education of their children. Not only will saving in this way increase our investment capital, it will increase American's education capital as well. Anything that thwarts either of these objectives is short-sighted. 
By using the tax code to encourage individual responsibility for paying for educational expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the education IRA will result in greater opportunities for individuals to save for their children's education. 
Mr. President, the next major change that this bill makes to education IRAs is that it allows withdrawals for education expenses for elementary and secondary schools and for both private and public schools. 
As we recognized last year, it is a fundamental principle that a parent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about his or her child's education--to decide basic questions such as how the child should be educated and where the child should attend school. 
This bill recognizes that just like for secondary schools, we should not establish a priority system where some elementary and secondary schools are favored over others. We should not forget that it is the taxpayer who funds the education IRA--that it is the parent who puts his or her hard-earned money into the education IRA. 
Mr. President, it seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the parent should be able to choose how to spend that money. 
Mr. President, another provision in this bill makes state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans tax-free, not simply tax-deferred. This is a significant distinction, because it allows students to withdraw the savings that accumulate in their pre-paid tuition accounts without paying any tax at all. It means that parents have the incentive to put money away today and their children have the full benefit of that money, without any tax, tomorrow. 
As I have already mentioned, forty-four states have pre-paid tuition plans in effect, and the other six are in the process of implementing such plans This means that every member of the Senate has parents and students back home who either benefit from this plan right now, or will benefit from this plan soon. 
Mr. President, the Coverdell bill also extends tax-free treatment of employer provided educational assistance for graduates and undergraduates through the year 2002. 
This particular program is a time-tested and widely used benefit for working students. Over one million workers across America receive tax-free employer provided education. This allows them to stay on the cutting edge of their careers. It benefits not only them, individually, but their employers and the economy as a whole. With the constant innovations and advancing technology of our society, it is vitally important that we continue this program. 
The various provisions that I have just described are all ones that members of this body approved last year. They made sense then. They certainly continue to make sense today. 
Mr. President, the Coverdell bill does even more than address the costs of attending school. In response to concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, the Finance Committee agreed on some measures to provide targeted relief in the area of school construction. 
The first provision is directed at high growth school districts. It expands the tax-exempt bond rules for public/private partnerships set up for the construction, renovation, or restoration of public school facilities in these districts. In general, it allows states to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per state resident. Each state would be guaranteed a minimum allocation of at least $5 million of these tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to $600 million per year in new tax exempt bonds would be issued for these innovative school construction projects. 
This provision is important because it retains state and local flexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the states and it does not force the federal government to micro-manage school construction. 
Mr. President, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That provision is designed to simplify the issuance of bonds for school construction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on investments unrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated to the Federal government. However, there is an exception--generally referred to as the small issuer exception--which allows governments to issue up to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for governments that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds during the year. 
The provision in the Coverdell bill increases the small issuer exception to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the bonds are issued to finance public schools. 
Mr. President, it is clear that the Coverdell bill contains numerous important provisions for the American family. As I have said already, many of these measures are ones that the Senate passed last year. 
Anyone--students or parents--who is on the front line dealing with the costs of a quality education, must have been disappointed last year when we failed to give them all the tools that they needed. American families understand the need for these measures. They have now been waiting for a year. I am pleased today that we will, once again, address the needs of American families and students. I urge my colleagues to support the Coverdell bill.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes. 
I rise in opposition to this amendment. As I stated yesterday, it strikes at the heart of the Coverdell bill. It takes away the ability of parents to use educational IRAs to pay for expenses related to the schooling of their children between kindergarten and 12th grade. 
Allowing parents greater resources to meet the educational needs of their young children is what the Coverdell bill is all about. Senator Levin proposes to take those resources away. Instead, he wants to expand the lifetime learning credit for those who participate in technology training. No one can argue against the proposition that helping teachers become more capable in technology is a good thing. We want our students to understand the technology of the 21st century. We certainly need to ensure that our teachers are proficient as well. 
But this amendment is not the way to reach that goal. First, expanding the lifetime learning credit for teachers at the expense of expanding the IRAs for our children runs contrary to the needs and objectives of American families. Mothers and fathers need increased wherewithal to support their children's educational goals. Mothers and fathers need stronger, more useful IRAs. They need the ability to use more of their own hard-earned money to take care of family priorities. 
The Senate recognized this fact last year when we gave parents with children in grades K through 12 the ability to use educational IRAs. Our objective was to strengthen moms' and dads' ability to get the best education possible for their children. Our objective made sense then, and it certainly makes sense today. 
The Coverdell bill empowers families to make decisions that are in their best interests. It allows them to use their own resources for their own benefit. Remember, the money in question here belongs to the taxpayers. They earned it, it's theirs, they will save it, and they should be able to choose how it will be spent. Let them use it where it serves them best--on their children. 
Mr. President, despite what some in this Chamber continue to argue, the education IRA is not a boondoggle for the rich. The education IRA phases out for high-income taxpayers. Because of these phaseouts, the vast majority of the benefits will go to middle-income taxpayers. According to the National Catholic Education Association, almost 70 percent of the families with children in Catholic schools have income below $35,000, and almost 90 percent of those families have incomes below $50,000. These families, along with virtually all of the 38 million American families with children in public or private elementary and secondary schools, are the families that the Coverdell bill is designed to help. 
At the same time, we should all take note that two-thirds of the individual income taxes in the United States are shouldered by taxpayers earning over $75,000 per year. So one can see that the Coverdell bill is focused on those families most in need of help. 
As my colleagues know, the lifetime learning credit is a provision that was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It allows anyone pursuing postsecondary education to take a tax credit each year equal to 20 percent of their qualified expenses. The lifetime learning credit is available to anyone who meets the income requirement. Full-time students can take the credit, as can any professional who wants to continue his or her education. And this includes teachers, engineers, or research scientists. 
What Senator Levin proposes is to single out teachers and increase their lifetime learning credit to 50 percent for technology training. Not only would this come at the expense of students and their families, but it would be inequitable among the professions. Why should a teacher receive an increased credit for his or her additional education when an engineer is limited to the current 20 percent? More important, it emphasizes one type of teacher continuing education over another. And what is the basis of claim, for instance, that we should give a 50 percent credit for teachers to become more proficient in using and teaching technology, but only give 20 percent to those who take courses to become better reading or math instructors? Those skills are also vital to function in a society. 
It is important to note that the Coverdell bill already includes a provision that allows an employee, such as a teacher, to receive, tax-free, employer-provided education assistance. In other words, the bill already encourages a school to pay for its teachers to receive training such as contemplated by the Senator from Michigan. I believe we should leave this type of policy decision to the local schools. If a school attaches a high priority to the use of technology in the classroom--and we hope they do--the school can send its teacher to a training class. The best part of all is that the teacher would not have to pay anything at all--no expenses, no taxes. Under the Levin proposal, a teacher would still end up paying half the cost of this additional education. 
In summary, the Levin amendment takes the means to use expanded IRAs to educate children and it creates a more distorted and, I must say, much more complex learning credit. This is not what we want to do, Mr. President. If you ask the families of America how they would choose to use the financial resources in question, I believe the vast majority would make it clear that they want the opportunity to use their money to give them greater flexibility and power to meet the educational objectives of their family. 
Mr. President, I oppose the Levin amendment. The educational IRA is the foundation of the Coverdell bill. This modification guts the bill at the expense of the children. For this reason, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor and reserve any time that I may have left.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Levin amendment as it takes away the ability of parents to use educational IRAs to pay for K through 12 school expenses. It runs contrary to the whole purpose of the Coverdell bill, which is to allow parents greater resources to meet the educational needs of their young children. 
Instead, Senator Levin wants to take these resources and expand the lifetime learning credit from 20 percent to 50 percent for those teachers who participate in technology training. A 20 percent lifetime learning credit is already available to teachers for continuing education, just as it is for members of other professionals. Let me remind my colleagues that the Coverdell bill already contains a provision that allows teachers to receive tax-free technology training provided by their employer, the school. 
We all agree that it is vitally important for teachers to be proficient in the use of technology in the classroom, but this is not the way to do it. This amendment takes the resources of an expanded IRA from our families, our children, and creates a more distorted and complex learning credit. 
For these reasons, I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment to increase the charitable deduction to 110 percent of any contribution made to an educational institution if the contribution is used to provide scholarships for low-income families. 
Education is paramount to the future of our children and nation, and contributing toward the education of another is certainly one of the finest forms charitable giving can take. 
Let me also say that I know the distinguished Senator from Indiana has the best intentions with this amendment. I generally believe that charitable giving serves disadvantaged people much better than government programs. 
However, there are several concerns that I believe need to be fully examined and addressed before we consider moving down a road that provides a charitable tax deduction in excess of the amount donated. This is a serious departure from settled tax policy principles. 
Once we begin to offer charitable tax deductions that are more than the amount donated for low-income scholarships, what comes next? 
What other kinds of tax benefits will be proposed where the amount of the deduction exceeds the cost to the taxpayer? 
Should these kinds of scholarships be the only charitable activities enjoying this benefit? And, if not, are we prepared to move forward with such a precedent? 
There are other concerns I have about the Senator from Indiana's proposal. On what basis does one decide that the percentage should be 105, 120 percent, or a percentage 
lower than 100 percent? Should we be in the position of choosing among charities and assigning percentages? 
Another concern I have is the proposal's attempt to single out one kind of charitable activity and offer it special tax advantages. Why is this kind of charitable activity better than other charitable activities? To do so is a step towards complexity in the tax code. 
Mr. President, I believe charitable giving is an activity that we must continue to encourage with tax benefits. For instance, most taxpayers do not itemize, and therefore, cannot deduct their charitable contributions. This is a feature of our tax policy that concerns many members. 
This issue, along with other proposals in the charitable giving area, such as the one from the Senator from Indiana, should be reviewed when the Finance Committee holds hearings on fundamental tax reform. 
Mr. President, Senator Coats' amendment is well-intended, but raises too many questions to be hastily considered in a Senate floor vote. Let's pass the Coverdell bill, and deliver to taxpayers education tax incentives we have previously debated and approved. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I rise in opposition because it takes away the ability of parents to use educational IRAs to pay for expenses relating to the schooling of their children between kindergarten and 12th grade. Allowing parents greater resources to meet the educational needs of their young people is a very important part of the Coverdell legislation. Senator Levin proposes to take those resources away and give them to teachers by expanding the lifetime learning credit for those who participate in technology training. 
No one can argue that helping teachers become more proficient in technology is not a good thing. It is vitally important. It will have a positive influence on their ability to teach our children. However, to increase the lifetime learning credit for teachers at the expense of expanding the IRAs for our children runs contrary to the needs and objectives of American families. 
Mothers and fathers need increased wherewithal to support their children's educational goals. Mothers and fathers need stronger, more useful IRAs. They need the ability to use more of their own hard-earned money to take care of family priorities. The Senate recognized this last year when we gave parents with children in grades K-12 the ability to use educational IRAs. 
Our objective was to strengthen mom and dad's ability to get the best education possible for their children. Our objective remains the same today. This is what the Coverdell legislation is all about, empowering families to make decisions that are in their best interests, allowing them to use their own resources for their own benefit. 
Remember, Mr. President, the money in question here belongs to the taxpayers. They earned it. It is theirs. They will save it, and they should be able to choose how it will be spent. Let them use it where it serves them best--on their children. 
Senator Levin's amendment is well intentioned. A lifetime learning credit is a provision that was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It allows everyone pursuing postsecondary education to take a tax credit each year equal to 20 percent of their qualified expenses. Those expenses are limited annually to $5,000 through the year 2002, and starting in the year 2003 they will be annually limited to a total of $10,000. The lifetime learning credit is available to any taxpayer who meets the income requirements. Full-time students can take the credit, as can any professional who wants to continue his or her education. And this includes teachers, engineers, or research scientists. 
What Senator Levin proposes is to single out teachers and increase their lifetime learning credit to 50 percent for technology training. Not only would this come at the expense of students and their families but it would be inequitable among the professions. Remember, teachers can already receive a 20 percent credit for any additional education in which they engage. The fact is, Senator Levin's amendment goes too far too fast and it comes at the expense of the children. 
This amendment takes the means to use expanded IRAs to educate children, and it creates a more complex and distorted learning credit. Not only will meeting the criteria to qualify for the credit create a bureaucracy to determine what conditions qualify, but it emphasizes one area of study over another. For example, why give a 50 percent credit for teachers to become more proficient in using and teaching technology but only give a 20 percent credit to those who take courses to become better reading instructors? Or we could ask the same question. What about the teacher who takes courses to enable them to better teach those who are disabled? All worthy goals. And the problem here is that we would single out one to benefit over the others, which only adds to the complexity of this matter. 
This is not what we want to do. Ask the parents of America. Ask our families. Ask our students how they would choose to use the financial resources in question. I believe the vast majority would make it clear that they want the opportunity to use their money to give them greater flexibility and power to meet the educational objectives of the family. 
Mr. President, I must oppose the Levin amendment. The educational IRA is the foundation of the Coverdell bill. This modification guts the bill at the expense of the children. For that reason I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. First of all, I want to point out again that we have no quarrel with respect to the importance of technology and technical training. We think that it is of key interest. But at the same time we think its critically important to recognize that other types of training for teachers are equally important. For example, taking programs to better learn how to teach the disabled is certainly a top goal and desire, or to teach math or English to our children. All of these are worthy goals, and our concern is that by singling out technology we would be hurting others who have interests of similar importance. 
I am also concerned about the complexity this proposal writes into the Tax Code. One of the constant complaints--and I think a justified complaint--is that we are always making the Federal code more difficult, more complex to administer.

Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 1 more minute. 
So, I say that one of the problems with this proposal is that it adds an additional complexity that is going to be harder to administer and require the creation of a new bureaucracy. 
Let's keep and treat all people in this situation the same. 
The other point I want to make is that the benefits of the Coverdell amendment do not go to the wealthy. I point out that 70 percent of the benefits of the Coverdell education IRA go to families making $75,000 or less. I point out that a blue-collar worker can easily be making $40,000 with overtime; his spouse or her spouse working as a teacher, or otherwise, can be within this range. I defy anyone to go out and ask any of these people whether they consider themselves to be wealthy. The answer will be no. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I believe that, in the normal order of things, as the manager of the bill, I would be next to address the amendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Illinois. 
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 10 minutes. 
Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Illinois for two reasons. First, it is important to understand that the amendment strikes section 101 of the Coverdell bill. This section is the very heart of the legislation, for it is the provision that provides the most widespread benefits for American families. This section increases the maximum contribution to an education IRA from $500 to $2,000. It permits the education IRA to be used for elementary and secondary school expenses, and it permits the education IRA to be used for public and private schools. 
I have already spoken numerous times about the importance of making these changes to the education IRA. In fact, the Senate has already endorsed these changes as they were all included in the Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The provisions made sense at that time, and they continue to make sense today. Our students and our families need these resources and the benefits of an education IRA to help them meet the cost and realize quality education. I hope my colleagues continue to recognize just how important this tool can be for the American people. 
Mr. President, a second reason I oppose this amendment is that, in effect, it would create a massive Federal mechanism whose stated purpose is to spur the construction and rehabilitation of public schools. It appears to be the same proposal contained in the administration's fiscal year 1999 budget, and it would create a new type of bond called a `qualified school modernization bond.' Unlike regular tax-exempt bonds, like those already in the Coverdell bill where holders receive tax-exempt interest payments, the holders of these new `qualified school modernization bonds' would receive a Federal tax credit in an amount to be set by the Treasury Department. This amendment provides that a total of $19.4 billion worth of these school modernization bonds could be issued around the country over the next 2 years. It also increases the amount of qualified zone academy bonds by $2.4 billion over 2 years. 
Even more massive than the amount of bonds to be issued under the proposal is the bureaucracy that would be created to administer this program. The Treasury would need to establish a formula to allocate the school modernization bonds. The amendment calls for half of the bonds to go to the 100 largest school districts with the largest number of low-income children. The other half of the bonds would go to the States and Puerto Rico divided in proportion to their share of Federal assistance. This would be according to the basic grant formula of the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965. Then all of this would be readjusted for allocation to the 100 largest school districts. 
This runs contrary to President Clinton's promise that the `era of big government is over.' It runs contrary to our objective to strengthen schools by empowering families and communities. It consolidates ever-increasing power in the hands of a few Federal bureaucrats while it robs our families and communities of local control over their schools and precious financial resources. 
Not only does the Moseley-Braun amendment create more bureaucracy in the way that it requires the Federal Government to sift through the criteria and bond allocation process, but it calls on the Federal Government to oversee another massive program. 
According to this amendment, a bond would only be deemed to be a qualified school modernization bond if the Federal Department of Education signs off on it. The Federal Department of Education would have to approve the school construction plan of the States or eligible school districts. By giving its OK, the Federal Department of Education is supposed to consider whether--I am quoting from the administration's description of its proposal: 
The school construction plan must, one, demonstrate that a comprehensive survey of a district's renovation and construction needs has been completed; and, two, describes how the jurisdiction will assure the bond proceeds are used for the purposes of this proposal. 
If we are to meet the education needs of our children and the challenges of the future, we need less bureaucracy, not more. We need greater involvement in oversight from our parents and communities, not less. We need a Federal Government that supports the best and most innovative programs and policies implemented by our States and local school boards, not one that takes them over. 
The bond proposals in this amendment are modeled after a much more limited measure that was included in the 1997 tax bill at the request of Congressman Rangel and the administration. The 1997 bill created `qualified zone academy bonds.' The purpose of these bonds was to provide additional incentives for private entities to get involved in school construction. 
Holders of the qualified zone academy bonds, all of whom have to be in the business of lending money, are to receive a tax credit instead of an interest payment, and the amount of qualified zone academy bonds for 1998 and 1999 was capped at $400 million per year. 
The qualified zone academy bond program was deliberately kept small for several reasons. First, there was a fundamental concern about the Federal Government taking on the traditional State and local responsibility for school construction. Second, it was unclear whether the academy bond program would place funds where they need to be, in the hands of local schools. 
Nevertheless, here we are, less than 1 year later and the push is on for a massive expansion of what is nothing more than an untested proposal. 
The attempt with this amendment is to authorize almost $22 billion in all-school bonds, and this attempt is being made without any data that the bond mechanism in the amendment is the most efficient or beneficial way to help States and localities deal with school modernization. It is simply unclear whether issuing a new type of bond, no matter how catchy its name, will ultimately result in schools being modernized. What is clear is that it once again falls back on the failed notion that Washington knows best. It assumes that creating layer upon layer of unneeded bureaucracy within the Department of Education is a far greater solution than giving parents and local communities greater control over the education of their children. 
Under the proposal, the Department of Education would be required to approve the school construction plan of a State or eligible school district. This means that the bureaucrats from Washington would be micromanaging a local school district's renovation plans--in effect, second-guessing and even directing the decisions of State and local officials. It also means that parents, local leaders, and school districts would have to watch as their vital financial resources are commandeered by Washington, DC, and sent out to build and renovate schools elsewhere despite the fact that they themselves might desperately need improvements in their own community schools. 
This amendment strikes right at the heart of local control. It gives the Department of Education the final say about how a school district should address its construction and renovation needs. It allows the Department of Education in Washington to tell local officials that they have misjudged the needs of their district. This is wrong. Local officials are the people who are on the front lines every day. They know the needs of their students. They are directly accountable to parents. It seems 
only a matter of common sense that they are the ones who best understand the need of their district and the best ways to fix any problems. 
Yet this amendment would set up a structure whereby the availability of this Federal tax benefit is controlled by Washington and not by the localities. As the Department of Education would be required to monitor whether the bond proceeds were being used for the stated, appropriate renovation plan, Washington bureaucrats would have an ongoing supervisory role. 
It just does not make sense for the Department of Education to get involved at this level. President Clinton himself stated in 1994 that `the construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State and local governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers.' And in that respect I agree with the President. 
I remind my colleagues that the approach in the Moseley-Braun amendment is not risk free. The costs are substantial. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the revenue loss to the Federal Government for a program like this would be about $3.26 billion over 5 years and $9 billion over 10 years. 
The Coverdell bill offers better government. I oppose the Moseley-Braun amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me. 
I yield back the floor.

Mr. ROTH. First of all, I think it is important to point out that we have not been graced with a copy of the amendment so that we are not in a position to state specifically what it says. But my comments are based on the administration's proposal, which specifically spells out these requirements and would result in a major buildup of a Federal bureaucracy. I would just like to point out that this local approach is, indeed, contrary to what the President himself said in 1996. I point to this chart here which says: 
The construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State and local governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers. 
It goes on to say: 
We are opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant program for school construction. 
With that I 100 percent agree, and it is because of that kind of thinking I think it is important that this amendment be defeated.

I have since then, for the first time, received a copy of the amendment.

Mr. ROTH. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that we have entered into a unanimous consent agreement with respect to H.R. 2646, the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act. It is good to see us moving at last toward passage of this significant bill. The importance of giving American families the resources and means they need to educate their children must be above politics. 
As I have said before, this bill empowers families--not the federal bureaucracy. It gives resources to the children, not to a monolithic establishment that has grown overbearing and antiquated on a diet of government subsidies. 
This bill is a much needed change in the way Washington looks at the education of children. It returns parental involvement to where it should be--at the very foundation of their children's education. It lets them use their money to educate their children, allowing them to put their own money into their own Parent and Student Savings Accounts.' 
This bill acknowledges that the best thing taxpayers can do with their hard-earned money is to earmark it for the education of their children. 
It allows them to increase their contributions from $500 per year to $2,000 per year. It allows for withdrawals to be used for elementary and secondary education expenses. And it covers public and private schools. 
The bill also makes state-sponsored prepaid tuition programs tax-free, not tax-deferred, meaning that students will be able to withdraw on a tax-free basis the savings that accumulate in their pre-paid tuition accounts. Parents will have the incentive to put money away today and their children will have the full benefit of that money tax free tomorrow. 
Toward promoting these important objectives, the federal government must lead, follow, or get out of the way. Our states and communities--our families--are embracing innovative educational programs. They realize the old way isn't working. Already, forty-four states have pre-paid tuition plans in effect, and the other six have legislation to create a state plan, or they have implemented a feasibility study. 
Many cities and states are offering families the power of choice when it comes to selecting what school their children will attend. Others are embracing programs that make private schools more accessible. 
These measures are having a positive impact, but there is much more to be done, and the federal government must demonstrate its leadership. Let's be bold, Mr. President. The National Center for Education Statistics states that in our children's pre-school years, parents are active in preparing them for school. Almost three-quarters of all parents read to their children regularly. A full 60 percent are active in teaching them to recognize letters and numbers. 
Interestingly enough, this active parental involvement begins to fall off once the child has entered school. Perhaps this is because government has put itself in the position over the years where it has come to assume parental responsibility, and even frustrated parental participation. `Give us your money,' government has said. `We'll educate your children. We'll make decisions concerning how your precious resources are spent, concerning what will be emphasized--how it will be taught, and by whom.' 
This has led to a condition where--according to one of the most extensive studies ever conducted on the forces that affect youth and their performance in school--nearly one in three parents in America is seriously disengaged from his or her adolescent's education. How can it be that while three-quarters of all parents are active in preparing their pre-school children for their educations, only one-third remain active when their child enters adolescence? 
The answer is simple: parents have become disenfranchised. They have been robbed of the resources they need to make the kinds of decisions that will keep them active in the educational attainments of their children. 
According to Lawrence Steinberg, the educator who conducted the extensive study of more than 20,000 teenagers and their families in nine very different American communities, `The failure of our educational policies is due to our obsession with reforming schools and classrooms, and our general disregard of the contributing forces that, while outside the boundaries of the school, are probably more influential.' 
These influential forces, Mr. President, include the family. They include the educational resources families are given to provide their children with an environment for learning. They include the flexibility parents have to decide where their children will attend school and how it will be paid for. 
Our policies must offer Dad and Mom the resources they need to actively re-engage in Junior's education. The Coverdell bill does this. It is a very important step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to support it. It's time for innovation. It's time to empower parents. It's time to prepare for the future. This is what the Coverdell bill is all about. 
I will take a few minutes to walk through the various provisions of the bill. But before I get into the specifics, let me remind my colleagues that with the exception of several school construction bond provisions--which were newly added this year--all of the concepts in this bill should be very familiar. 
Mr. President, these concepts should be familiar because we have already endorsed them. The base provisions in the bill--which include the increase in the maximum allowable contribution to an education IRA, the use of the IRA for elementary and secondary school expenses for public and private schools, the tax-free treatment of state sponsored prepaid tuition plans, and the extension of tax-free treatment for employer provided educational assistance--all received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Despite this Senate support, these provisions were dropped from the bill during conference negotiations. Because of opposition from the Administration, these particular elements failed to be included in the final version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
We are here today to show our commitment to these provisions--and to enact what this body has already determined makes good sense for American families. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that this tax bill is not designed to answer all of the education-related issues that face this country. Those issues are too varied and complicated to be addressed by the federal government. 
They need to be solved at the state and local level--by schools, teachers, and parents working together. 
Instead, this bill is designed to build on the innovative concepts that have been introduced in the last few years. Our goal is to alter the tax code so that it provides the necessary incentives to help American families help their children. These are much needed tools. 
Over the past 15 years, tuition at a four year college has increased by 234%. The average student loan has increased by 367%. In contrast median household income rose only 82% during this period and the consumer price index rose only 74%. 
Our students--our families--need these resources to help them meet the costs and realize the opportunities of a quality education. The Senate recognized the importance of these provisions less than one year ago, voting in favor of them. I hope that my colleagues continue to recognize just how important they remain. The American people are counting on us. 
Now let me take a few minutes to describe the various provisions of this bill--to provide an overview and to highlight some reasons why these measures are so important. 
As I have already mentioned, the bill increases the maximum education IRA contribution from $500 to $2,000. That increase is important on two levels. First, with the well-documented increase in education costs, it is essential that we provide American families with the resources needed to meet those costs. 
I have long argued that it is essential to change the savings habits of the American people, and there are few things more important than the education of our children. Not only will saving in this way increase our investment capital, it will increase American's education capital as well. Anything that thwarts either of these objectives is short-sighted. 
By using the tax code to encourage individual responsibility for paying for educational expenses, we all benefit. The expansion of the education IRA will result in greater opportunities for individuals to save for their children's education. 
Besides being too low to give parents the necessary resources to pay for the costs of education, the current $500 limit fails from another practical perspective. 
As we all know, any broker or bank that provides an IRA account faces assorted administrative costs for each account. To ensure that they can adequately cover their administrative costs, most brokers or banks impose a minimum account balance. In many cases, the minimum balance has been set well higher than $500. 
That reality of the marketplace has the effect of limiting the availability of the education IRA to American families. 
Another reality is that confronted by a $500 limit, many mutual fund companies find that it is not worth their while to spend money on marketing the education IRA. It is a fact of life that regardless of what we say and do in Congress, many families will only know about the benefits of an education IRA through the marketing efforts of their local mutual fund companies and banks. These businesses have been very successful in marketing IRAs with a higher contribution limit. If we want to maximize the involvement of American families in education IRAs, Mr. President, we need to ensure that the accounts make economic sense from the perspective of the companies offering them. 
Mr. President, the next major change that this bill makes to education IRAs is that it allows withdrawals for education expenses for elementary and secondary schools and for both private and public schools. 
As we recognized last year, it is a fundamental principle that a parent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about his or her child's education--to decide basic questions such as how the child should be educated and where the child should attend school. 
Last year, for example, when Congress passed a variety of provisions targeted to higher education, we made no distinction between private and public schools. 
We did not say, for instance, that an education IRA or a Hope scholarship would only be available if a student attended public school. We did not say that a student who attended the University of Maryland would receive a tax benefit and a student who attended George Washington University would receive nothing. 
This bill recognizes that just as with secondary schools, we should not establish a priority system where some elementary and secondary schools are favored over others. We should not forget that it is the taxpayer who funds the education IRA--that it is the parent who puts his or her hard-earned money into the education IRA. 
Mr. President, it seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the parent should be able to choose how to spend that money. 
Moreover, parents with students in elementary and secondary schools need our help to cope with the costs. It is simply not true that only rich kids attend private elementary or secondary schools. For instance, according to the National Catholic Education Association, almost 70% of the families with children in Catholic schools have incomes below $35,000 and almost 90% of those families have incomes below $50,000. 
Another provision in this bill makes state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans tax-free, not simply tax-deferred. This is a significant distinction, because it allows students to withdraw the savings that accumulate in their pre-paid tuition accounts without paying any tax at all. It means that parents have the incentive to put money away today and their children have the full benefit of that money, without any tax, tomorrow. 
As I have already mentioned, forty-four states have pre-paid tuition plans in effect, and the other six are in the process of implementing such plans. This means that every member of the Senate has parents and students back home who either benefit from this plan right now, or will benefit from this plan soon. 
Mr. President, the Coverdell bill also extends tax-free treatment of employer provided educational assistance for graduates and undergraduates through the year 2002. 
This particular program is a time-tested and widely used benefit for working students. Over one million workers across America receive tax-free employer provided education. This allows them to stay on the cutting edge of their careers. It benefits not only them, individually, but their employers and the economy as a whole. With the constant innovations and advancing technology of our society, it is vitally important that we continue this program. 
The various provisions that I have just described have already been embraced by members of this body, and they were approved last year. They made sense then. They certainly continue to make sense today. 
Mr. President, the Coverdell bill does even more than address the costs of attending school. In response to concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, the Finance Committee agreed on some measures to provide targeted relief in the area of school construction. 
The first provision is directed at high growth school districts. It expands the tax-exempt bond rules for public/private partnerships set up for the construction, renovation, or restoration of public school facilities in these districts. 
In general, it allows states to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per state resident. Each state would be guaranteed a minimum allocation of at least $5 million of these tax-exempt bonds. In total, up to $600 million per year in new tax exempt bonds would be issued for these innovative school construction projects. 
This provision is important because it retains state and local flexibility. It does not impose a new bureaucracy on the states and it does not force the federal government to micro-manage school construction. 
The provision also is important because it promotes the use of public/private partnerships. Many high-growth school districts may be too poor or too overwhelmed to take on a school construction project themselves. With these bonds, those districts can partner with a private entity--and still enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing. 
Mr. President, it is worth noting that there already is a significant federal subsidy for school construction. Under current law, states and localities can issue debt that is exempt from federal taxation. This benefit allows them to finance school construction by issuing long term bonds at a lower cost than they otherwise could. 
Moreover, the evidence shows that states and localities are taking advantage of this benefit. In the first six months of 1996, voters approved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of more than $4 billion over the first six months of 1995. The bottom line is that many states and localities are doing their homework, passing bonds, building and renovating schools, and enjoying favorable treatment under the existing tax code. They are doing all this without significant federal involvement. 
I do not have to remind my colleagues that school construction has always been the province of state and local governments. President Clinton himself stated in 1994 that `the construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local governments financed primarily by local taxpayers.' In that respect, I agree with the President. 
Mr. President, there is a second bond provision in this bill. That provision is designed to simplify the issuance of bonds for school construction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on investments unrelated to the purpose of the borrowing must be rebated to the Federal government. However, there is an exception--generally referred to as the small issuer exception--which allows governments to issue up to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement. We recently increased this limit to $10 million for governments that issue at least $5 million of public school bonds during the year. 
The provision in the Coverdell bill increases the small issuer exception to $15 million, provided that at least $10 million of the bonds are issued to finance public schools. This measure will assist localities in meeting school construction needs by simplifying their use of tax-exempt financing. At the same time, it will not create incentives to issue such debt earlier or in larger amounts than is necessary. It is a type of targeted provision that makes sense. 
It is clear, Mr. President, that the Coverdell bill contains many important provisions for the American family. As I have said already, many of these measures have already been passed by the Senate. 
Anyone--students or parents--who is on the front line dealing with the costs of a quality education, must have been disappointed last year when we failed to give them all the tools that they needed. American families understand just how important these measures are. They have now been waiting for a year. Let's not disappoint them any further. Let's not keep them waiting any longer. Let's move forward. Let's pass the Coverdell bill now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would not permit educational IRAs to be used to pay the expenses of kindergarten up through 12th grade. This proposal to limit the use of educational IRAs would dramatically--I want to emphasize `dramatically'--reduce the benefits of an educational IRA for American families. 
I believe that it is a fundamental principle that a parent should have the right and the ability to make decisions about his or her child's education --to decide basic questions, such as how the child should be educated and where the child should attend school. The rich should not be the only ones that too often have this choice--although there are many, many children from middle-class families who attend private schools at great personal sacrifice of their families. 
What we seek here is to give a choice to all families as to where their child will attend school. We should not try to control that parental right by providing tax benefits only to those parents who make what some Members of this body consider to be the correct choice. We should all remember that last year, when the Senate passed a variety of provisions targeted towards helping American families cope with the costs of a quality education, we made no distinction between public and private schools or between higher education and secondary or elementary schools. 
For example, we did not say that an educational IRA would only be available if a student attended public school or college. We did not say that a student who attended the University of Maryland would receive a tax benefit, but a student who attended George Washington University would receive nothing. We did not say that a student who attended college would receive a tax benefit, but a student who incurred costs in connection with secondary or elementary school would receive nothing. 
The bottom line was that we treated all schools the same. And the reason for that treatment is that we did not consider it our business to set up a system where some schools were favored over others. 
Mr. President, we should also not forget that it is the taxpayer who funds the education IRA. It is the parents--the parent who put his or her hard-earned money into the education IRA. And it seems a matter of common sense, therefore, that the parents should be able to choose how to spend that money. 
To fully receive the benefits of an education IRA, parents should try to establish accounts for their schoolchildren as early as possible. If the parent can afford to make contributions early in a child's life, the benefits of the education IRA will increase dramatically through the magic of tax-free compounding within the IRA. At this early stage in a child's life, parents may not know whether they will send their children to a private or public school. Parents also may not know whether they will need the benefits of an education IRA for elementary and secondary school or for higher education. 
There are many, many factors that go into these important decisions. The needs of the child may change. The family may move into a different school district. The quality of the neighborhood schools may rise or fall. It is simply unfair to make the parent look into a crystal ball and predict what type of school their child may attend or how much that school may cost. This places too great of an unnecessary burden on the parent. 
The side effect of that burden of making parents look into the future is that parents may be reluctant to fully utilize the education IRA. The parents may not contribute the maximum amount of money that they can to these accounts. That, Mr. President, would be most unfortunate because it would defeat the whole purpose of the education IRA concept. 
Moreover, Mr. President, the existing provisions of the bill do not favor the wealthy, as some here have argued. 
First of all, there is an adjusted gross income phaseout. In other words, only parents with incomes below a certain threshold can take advantage of the tax savings in the education IRA. 
Second, it simply is not true that only rich kids attend private schools. As I said earlier, many, many children from middle-class families attend private schools at great personal sacrifice on the part of their parents. For instance, according to the National Catholic Education Association, of the families with children in Catholic schools, almost 70 percent of those families have incomes below $35,000; almost 90 percent of those families have incomes below $50,000. 
If we adopt this amendment, all of those families will be shut out from receiving the tax benefits in the education IRA, as would all of the roughly 38 million families who have children in either public or private elementary and secondary schools. 
Mr. President, limiting the education IRA is not good policy, and it does not make sense for American families. Accordingly, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce five bills to suspend temporarily the imposition of duties on certain products. 
I am pleased to introduce these bills to suspend temporarily the imposition of duties on imports of pigments. These high quality coloring materials are imported for sale in the United States by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation (Pigments Division), a company located in Newport, Delaware. By temporarily suspending the imposition of duties, these bills will reduce significantly the cost of coloring materials that are used in a wide variety of finished products, including automotive parts, vinyl flooring, carpet fibers and utensils.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on behalf of the Finance Committee, I am joining with Senator Moynihan and others today to bring H.R. 3130, the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998, before the Senate. This important bill passed the House of Representatives earlier this month by a vote of 414 to 1. 
When a bill passes the House by that wide of a margin, it is either noncontroversial, of limited national significance, or an extremely important piece of legislation with broad and deep support. H.R. 3130 clearly falls within this last category. 
The work on this legislation began shortly after the `Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996' was signed into law. The 1996 welfare reform act required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recommend to Congress a new, budget-neutral performance-based incentive system for the child support enforcement program. H.R. 3130 incorporates those recommendations which were developed in consultation with 26 representatives of state and local child support enforcement systems. The new incentive program is the centerpiece of this bill. 
Under current law, the Federal Government returns more than $400 million per year in child support collections to the states as incentive payments. But this incentive structure has been criticized for years as weak and inadequate. All States, regardless of actual performance, receive some incentive payments. But for more than a decade, performance has not been tied to the national goals of the program. 
H.R. 3130 breaks with the past and creates five categories in which state performance will be evaluated and rewarded. 
The States will be measured according to their performance in paternity establishment, establishment of court orders, collections of current child support payments, collections on past due payments, and cost effectiveness. 
The legislation also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a future recommendation on adding another performance measure on medical support orders. Let me particularly thank Senator Rockefeller for his work in designing a strategy to overcome the inherent barriers to medical support orders. 
The new incentive structure is an important development not only for the child support enforcement system but also as a model for improving accountability and performance in government. 
The second important feature of this bill is to provide for an alternative penalty procedure for those states that have failed to meet federal child support data processing requirements. Less than half of the States have been certified as in compliance. Without this change, states face not only the loss of their entire child support grant, but all of their funds in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program as well. 
Such a result would obviously be crippling to a state and would ultimately hurt the very families these programs are intended to help. 
Under the new alternative penalty procedures, those states which will not come into compliance this year will face a penalty of four percent of their child support funds. 
This penalty would double each year in the following two years and would reach 30 percent in the fourth year a state failed to come into compliance. These penalties are tough but fair. 
Under the Finance amendment, states will not face a penalty in the year in which they come into compliance. And states which come into compliance with the first two years after penalties have been imposed can have the penalty from the prior year reduced. 
H.R. 3130 also provides additional flexibility to the states in how they design their automated systems. 
In looking back over the history of automation, we find there were a number of mistakes made at both the federal and state levels which contributed to the delay in getting these systems operational. The child support enforcement system is a prime example of what can happen when regulations fail to keep pace with real world practices. 
H.R. 3130 recognizes the advances in technologies and allows states to take advantage of these improvements. It properly refocuses federal policy on function and results rather than on rigid rules. 
All of these changes will work together to get the states in compliance as quickly as possible. This will mean the child support enforcement system will work better for the families who depend on child support. 
H.R. 3130 also makes a correction in how penalties are applied under the new `Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997' which became law last November. It is vitally important that the states be held accountable for assisting the children in foster care. 
A child should not be denied the opportunity to be adopted into a loving and caring family simply because the prospective parents live in the next county. 
When the Department of Health and Human Services issues regulations on how the new penalties are enforced, it should, of course, provide the states with the opportunity to present evidence of how it complies with the new law. The review of this new requirement must be a fair and complete assessment of whether the law is being met. 
Mr. President, this is indeed an important, bipartisan bill which will prove itself to pay dividends for America's families. I urge its adoption.

Mr. ROTH. Yes, that is correct. In addition, the adoption law establishes a new requirement that States must initiate termination of parental rights proceedings in specific cases that are outlined in the law. However, the law only requires States to initiate such proceedings and does not mandate the outcome. Moreover, the law provides that States are not required to initiate termination of parental rights in certain cases, including when there is a compelling reason to conclude that such proceedings would not be in the child's best interest. Thus, the State retains the discretion to make case-by-case determinations regarding whether to seek termination of parental rights.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this budget resolution contains some provisions that I applaud, but it falls short in several areas: first, the proposed tax cuts are too small to provide the relief that taxpayers need and deserve; second, it does not adequately restrain the growth and reach of the Federal Government. Third, it is not what the hardworking men and women of America desire nor deserve. They deserve better. 
The current economic expansion is now 84 months old, the third longest on record. Overall growth rate has been relatively steady and moderate. In the last three months alone, more than one million new jobs have been created, while the unemployment rate has been reduced to a 24-year low. In addition, inflation as measured by the CPI is only 1.6 percent. 
In the midst of this prosperity our citizens are burdened by levels of taxation that are increasingly oppressive--all to satisfy the appetite of the Federal behemoth. This condition runs contrary to counsel handed down from President Jefferson--counsel we would do well to heed as we move forward with the budget debate. 
In his First Annual message to the Congress, President Jefferson wrote that the object of congressional efforts should be `to preserve the general and State governments in their constitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain peace abroad, and order and obedience to the laws at home; to establish principles and practices of administration favorable to the security of liberty and prosperity, and to reduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of government.' 
These are among the core principles which have thus far separated our nation from the rest of the world. 
It is up to this Congress to apply President Jefferson's principle to `reduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of government.' All else should remain in the hands of our citizens. 
Today, revenue levels are at all time highs, approaching 20 percent of GDP in both this fiscal year and the next. Not only are these levels high in historical terms, they are unprecedented for a peace-time economy. In fact, the only time in this century that revenues were higher was during World War II. 
Unfortunately, this does not appear to be an anomaly; the Congressional Budget Office projects that unusually high levels of revenue will continue to be extracted from taxpayers for the foreseeable future. 
It is worth noting, Mr. President, that these very same revenues are largely responsible for the budget surplus that has generated so much excitement here in Washington. In fact, the current surplus is mainly attributable to additional unanticipated revenues of about $72 billion in 1997, rather than the effect of spending cuts. It is also worth noting that these revenues have been fueled mainly by our strong economic growth in the last year. 
Yet, despite the record high level of revenues that the Federal Government now collects to feed its appetite for spending, we are told that we need additional Federal programs! Over the past 2 months, President Clinton has engaged in a well orchestrated campaign to secure approval for spending billions of dollars more on new and expanded government programs. He has set a trap for the American people by promising to do more for them in exchange for higher taxes on their capital and labor. 
We have balanced the Federal budget. But that is only one of the steps to be taken to meet Jefferson's objective. We must go on to examine whether the current size and breadth, let alone further expansion, of the Federal Government for these purposes justifies the taxation on the toil of our fellow citizens. Let's never forget that the revenue collected by Washington does not belong to the Federal Government; it belongs to the hard-working men and women of this country. 
Mr. President, the budget resolution should allow for immediate and significant tax relief for American taxpayers. However, the $30 billion of tax cuts proposed in the current resolution are not sufficient to provide this relief. 
I would like to see this budget resolution contain total tax cuts of at least $65 billion over 5 years. These cuts could take a number of forms, including marriage penalty reforms, family tax relief, and savings and investment incentives. 
For example, half of American families face the marriage penalty. The Congress proposed to phase out the marriage penalty for non-itemizers as part of the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, but the proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. In addition to marriage penalty relief, consideration could be given to tax relief for families such as a child care credits for both stay-at-home parents and working parents. 
Ultimately, whatever the final form that tax cuts take, the crucial consideration is that they be substantive and immediate. 
However, we are limited in the ways that we can offset these tax cuts. While the President's Fiscal Year 1999 budget contains a number of revenue raisers, many are rehashed, or controversial proposals that have failed before due to opposition on both sides of the aisle. 
We also cannot look to the spending programs within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee for savings. We are all firmly committed to protecting the reforms we have made to the Medicare, Medicaid and welfare programs, and should make no further changes at this time. In my opinion, the best option is for the cuts to be offset through the use of a portion of the tobacco settlement revenues. 
While the lack of meaningful tax relief is my main objection to this budget resolution, I am also disappointed to see that there is no provision to make better use of the budget surplus. 
We should not simply spend this surplus, or set it aside; we can do better for our families and the future. I strongly believe that the most productive use of thee surpluses is to fund individual Social Security investment accounts for all workers who contribute to the payroll tax. Therefore, Mr. president, I will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to instruct the Finance Committee to report a Social Security bill this year. The bill would dedicate the budget surplus to fund Social Security personal retirement accounts. Equally important, my bill will place the Senate on record for putting these surpluses to work for the American taxpayers, and not simply setting them aside to be spend on other less important priorities than social security. 
Finally, Mr. President, I must express my concern over some of the methods for shifting funds around under the budget resolution. Budget rules should not be invented to give authority to one committee to achieve budget savings under the jurisdiction of another committee. More specifically, this resolution gives control over the Medicaid program and welfare programs to the Appropriations Committee. Moreover, savings are to be achieved through administrative reforms which may prove to be unfair and unworkable with our partners, the states. Reforming Medicaid and finding program savings in the child support enforcement system or finding other alternatives should be a task for the committee of jurisdiction--namely the Finance Committee. 
Mr. President, the American people expect more from us. And it is incumbent upon us to see that they get it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment deals with a vital national issue--Social Security reform. This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Breaux, Gregg, Robb, Hatch, Nickles, Gramm, Gordon, Smith, and Santorum. 
Let me say first that as the chairman of the Finance Committee I am acutely aware of Social Security's future financial problems. I am sure these problems are familiar to most members, but nonetheless they bear repeating. 
In just 14 years, in 2012, revenues to the Social Security trust funds will no longer cover benefits. Social Security will then cash in Treasury bonds that are now accumulating in the trust funds. This will place major pressure on the Federal budget and crowd out other important spending. 
By 2029 the bonds will be gone. Social Security will then be able to cover only 75 percent of benefits directly from revenues. The long-term debt of the Social Security system--the difference between revenues and benefit through 2075--is estimated to be an astounding $121 trillion. 
The purpose of my amendment is simple. Nevertheless, it is important and urgent. The amendment instructs the Finance Committee to dedicate the budget surplus to establishing Social Security personal retirement accounts. 
Despite its simplicity, I know that many of my colleagues will have at least two questions about this amendment. First: `Why establish personal retirement accounts this year, rather than wait until next year?' And second: `Why not begin with comprehensive Social Security reform, rather than start with personal retirement accounts?' 
Mr. President, the easy course would be to wait until next year to begin Social Security reform. But the fact is, Social Security reform will be a big job. I am very concerned that trying to do it all in one year--in 1999--will simply not be possible. 
Americans have learned that big, comprehensive proposals, with many parts, often run into problems in Congress and can easily take several years to enact. Particularly proposals that deal with an important, sensitive program like Social Security. 
The place to start with Social Security reform is to establish a program of personal retirement accounts--funded by the budget surpluses. Dedicating the surplus to personal retirement accounts allows us to get started on reform without running into controversies over changes to the traditional program. 
Personal retirement accounts themselves would be a big, new feature of Social Security. We will need to explain these accounts to the American people, and writing a bill will require thoughtful action by the Finance Committee. 
Mr. President, let me note for the record that there is a growing bipartisan consensus that personal retirement accounts must be an essential feature of Social Security reform. And I want to emphasize the word `bipartisan.' 
In the Senate, Senator Bob Kerrey, another member of the Finance Committee, was an early and vocal advocate of personal retirement accounts. In the last Congress, he and Senator Alan Simpson, now retired, introduced a ground-breaking Social Security reform bill with personal retirement accounts that grew out of their experience on the 1994 Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. 
Other Democrats support this concept. For example, Senator Robb, another cosponsor of my amendment, proposed a sense-of-the-Senate to last year's budget resolution that would have funded Social Security retirement accounts. 
And just two weeks ago, Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee and a recognized expert on Social Security, introduced a comprehensive Social Security reform package that included personal retirement accounts. 
On the Republican side of the aisle, there is strong support as well. Senators Judd Gregg, Don Nickles, Phil Gramm, Rick Santorum, and Rod Grams, among others, have been enthusiastic advocates of Social Security personal retirement accounts. 
Let me explain why Social Security personal retirement accounts find so much support--not only in Congress, but among the American people. While proposals differ, the basic objective of this program is to provide each working American with funds to be deposited into personal retirement accounts. 
With even conservative investment, such accounts have the potential to grow to provide a secure and generous retirement nest egg. Indeed, for the first time Americans could look forward to having real personal wealth in old age, not just enough to keep body and soul together. 
A recent report by the Congressional Research Service provides many illustrations of what Social Security personal accounts may offer. For example, for an individual who is 28 years old today and earns an average wage--about $27,000, just 1 percent of an amount equal to his or her wages invested over the next 37 years in the S&P 500 would grow to $132,000, which would be worth about 20 percent of his or her Social Security benefits. By the way, CRS assumed a 10-percent rate of return for the S&P 500. In fact, over the past 10 years, the compounded annual return on the S&P 500 has been 18 percent. 
Mr. President, using the budget surpluses to create retirement accounts represents an opportunity to get these accounts up and running. Once in place, we can then begin looking at Social Security benefits for the long run. It will help insure that Social Security benefits continue to provide a secure foundation of retirement income. Establishing these accounts this year--as a new program in addition to the current Social Security program--would allow us to demonstrate their value in providing retirement benefits for working Americans in the years to come. 
Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic growth, because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. More Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers. 
Creating these accounts will help Americans to better be prepared for retirement, generally. According to the Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement program other than Social Security; this, in spite of the fact that Social Security was never intended to be the sole source of retirement income. 
Mr. President, could there be a more important use of the budget surplus? Some may believe that the budget surplus should be used to reduce the debt, not dedicated to personal retirement accounts. That is exactly what we will do by using the surplus to create these accounts. Social Security, a $121 billion unfunded liability over the next 75 years, is a huge debt and we need to recognize it as such. 
Retirement accounts and other solvency proposals would be a critical first step in reform. At the same time, it would tackle that debt and protect benefits. Most observers expect a surplus upwards of $60 billion this fiscal year, enough to get started on retirement accounts and to begin reducing the Federal debt. Some may be concerned that the President and others have called for a year-long national dialog on Social Security reform. They may be erroneously believing that doing reform this year might undermine the national dialog. On the contrary, I can think of no better way to focus it than with specific proposals and action by a U.S. Senate committee. 
Mr. President, Congress has talked for a long time about the need to do something to shore up Social Security. The time has come for action. It is indeed a blessing that we have a surplus to work with. Now let's put that surplus to work. The Finance Committee must get started on Social Security reform this year. The place to start is by dedicating the budget surplus to fund personal retirement accounts. This amendment will get the ball rolling. I urge Members to support it.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Moynihan and I introduce a bill to limit the tax benefits of so-called `stapled' or `paired-share' Real Estate Investment Trusts (`stapled REITs'). Identical legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Archer. 
In the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (`1984 Act'), Congress eliminated the tax benefits of the stapled REIT structure out of concern that it could effectively result in one level of tax on active corporate business income that would otherwise be subject to two levels of tax. Congress also believed that allowing a corporate business to be stapled to a REIT was inconsistent with the policy that led Congress to create REITs. 
As part of the 1984 Act provision, Congress provided grandfather relief to the small number of stapled REITs that were already in existence. Since 1984, however, almost all the grandfathered stapled REITs have been acquired by new owners. Some have entered into new lines of businesses, and most of the grandfathered REITs have used the stapled structure to engage in large-scale acquisitions of assets. Such unlimited relief from a general tax provision by a handful of taxpayers raises new questions not only of fairness, but of unfair competition, because the stapled REITs are in direct competition with other companies that cannot use the benefits of the stapled structure. 
This legislation, which is a refinement of the proposal contained in the Clinton Administration's Revenue Proposals for fiscal year 1999, takes a moderate and fair approach. The legislation essentially subjects to the grandfathered stapled REITs to rules similar to the 1984 Act, but only to acquisitions of assets (or substantial improvements of existing assets) occurring after today. The legislation also provides transition relief for future acquisitions that are pursuant to a binding written contract, as well as acquisitions that already have been announced (or described in a filing with the SEC).

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to make a technical correction to the diagonal measurement of video displays in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). 
During the Uruguay Round negotiations, the United States agreed to phase down U.S. tariffs on `13-inch' television receivers, monitors, and picture tubes, and on combination TV/VCRs, over the period from 1995 to 1999. The tariff on receivers and monitors was to be reduced from 5 percent to zero, on picture tubes from 15 percent to 7.5 percent, and on combination TV/VCRs from 3.9 percent to zero. The `13-inch' designation historically has included television products whose picture tubes are approximately, but not exactly, 13 inches by diagonal measurement. The 1997 HTSUS, however, converted the diagonal picture tube measurement into 33.02 centimeters or exactly 13 inches. With the implementation of the 1997 HTSUS, the former `13-inch' televisions have been classified as larger than 13-inches and assessed a higher rate of duty. 
I am proposing this technical correction to amend the HTSUS to allow television receivers, monitors, and picture tubes, and combination TV/VCRs with a diagonal measurement of up to `34.29 centimeters' (or 13.5 inches) to be classified as `13-inches'. This action is consistent with our Uruguay Round commitments.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, earlier this week, I addressed an audience at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on the Asian financial crisis and the critical role Japan needs to play in bringing that crisis to an end. While Japan has made bilateral assistance available to the countries most affected, Japan clearly is not facing up to the challenges presented by its own economic problems, let alone those of the region as a whole. 
Japan still constitutes more than two-thirds of East Asia's GDP. Regional recovery, therefore, is impossible without economic growth in Japan. Quite simply, the countries of the region in most dire condition need markets for their goods, and the United States alone cannot serve as the world's only major engine of growth. For Japan's own good, and for the good of the region and the global economy, Tokyo must serve as a second engine of growth.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I second what the distinguished Senator from Oregon has just said. First, let me repeat what he said about the distinguished Senator from Texas. I know of no one for whom I have greater respect than the junior Senator from Texas. Ever since she has been a Member of this august body, she has contributed greatly to the debate and discussion of all issues, including those of security and defense. When she speaks, I listen with great care. It is my hope that she will not raise this amendment. 
As I understand, her proposal is to establish, not study, a binding dispute resolution within the NATO current structure. Frankly, it is my concern that the effort to establish such a mechanism would have the unfortunate impact of reducing U.S. influence, weakening the alliance, and undercutting the North Atlantic Council, NATO's supreme decision-making body. Above all, I think it would increase, increase--not reduce--tensions in the alliance. 
It is important that we remember NATO is first and foremost a war-fighting institution. It is not and it was never intended to be a mechanism for dispute resolution. That is a charter for the OSCE. I cannot emphasis too much the importance--we already have an international organization in Europe dedicated to mediating and bringing to an end disputes between countries. As an institution of collective defense, it is true NATO, for 50 years, has fostered trust among parties, trust that has provided the foundation for dispute resolution among allies. 
In its role as an institution of collective defense, NATO's currently flexible methods for handling differences among allies maximizes U.S. influence. Frankly, this is most visible in the alliance's effort to mediate disputes between Turkey and Greece. We should not tinker with this success, the success that NATO has had in resolving differences because of the trust in which it is held by the members of this great alliance. I fear that the proposal would create the impression that the NAC has failed in its realm. I do not believe any of us would say that is true. 
By introducing the proposal on this resolution of ratification, we would be communicating that the Senate regards Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as more disputatious 
than NATO's current 16 members. I do not believe that is the sense of the Senate. 
We should never, never in any way, undermine the supremacy of the NAC over all alliance matters and all alliance bodies. Yet, I fear that is what this proposal would do by creating a new body independent from the NAC. 
Finally, this proposal would undercut its very own objectives. It would create the very tensions I assume it is intended to diffuse. Members of the Alliance will no longer focus primarily on the Alliance's core mission of collective defense, but will address the Alliance as a means to pursue their own strictly national interests. And, that will change the very culture of the Alliance. 
How do you think Greece and Turkey are going to respond to this proposal? More importantly how will such a proposal affect their attitudes toward the Alliance? 
It would certainly change the ways in which these two countries view their membership in NATO and their bilateral relationship within NATO. It will prompt them to become suspicious of the NAC. It will introduce greater tensions between them. 
As well intentioned this amendment may be, it is nonetheless totally counterproductive. 
In brief, Mr. President, this amendment would diminish U.S. influence in the Alliance. It would undercut trust between Allies. It will direct the very focus of our Allies away from NATO's core mission of collective defense. It will undercut trust within the Alliance. Ultimately, this proposal will weaken the Alliance. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
Therefore, I urge, first of all, my distinguished colleague from Texas not to raise the amendment. But if she does, I urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first, let me say there is nothing more important than for this Congress to enact legislation to make the IRS taxpayer friendly. This has become a critical issue, primarily because of the hearings held in the Finance Committee that have shown abuse of taxpayers. That must be changed. 
Now, as I have said many times, the House version of reform is a good beginning. But I have to emphasize, that is all it is--it is a good beginning. But it does not go far enough to make the kind of changes, the kind of reforms the American taxpayer deserves. 
The Finance Committee has been working hard to improve that legislation. It is legislation that we will take up with the committee, full committee, in the next 2 weeks. We expect to mark it up and report it out. But I want to emphasize that I will not be satisfied, and I am not going to push forward legislation that does not help the taxpayer as they so fully deserve. 
Now, Mr. President, as for the Coverdell bill, there is no question where I stand. The fundamental responsibility parents have is to raise children who are prepared for adulthood, children who will themselves become nurturing parents, productive citizens, and vital leaders in the future. Toward achieving this objective, there are few things as important as education. 
Mr. President, family is the foundation of our children's education. And family is at the heart of the Coverdell bill. The objective here is simple--to empower fathers and mothers to be proactive in directing the educational endeavors of their children--to give them the resources they need to make decisions consistent with their unique needs and determined goals. 
This bill allows us to join hands with parents everywhere--to let them use their money to educate their children. This bill allows them to increase their contributions from $500 per year to $2,000 per year. This money will be available tax free for college expenses. It allows for withdrawals to be used for elementary and secondary education expenses. And it covers public and private schools. 
The bill also makes state-sponsored prepaid tuition programs tax-free, not tax-deferred, meaning that students will be able to withdraw on a tax-free basis the savings that accumulate in their pre-paid tuition accounts. Parents will have the incentive to put money away today and their children will have the full benefit of that money tax free tomorrow. 
Already, forty-four states have pre-paid tuition plans in effect, and the other six have legislation to create a state plan, or they have implemented a feasibility study. Many cities and states are offering families the power of choice when it comes to selecting what school their children will attend. Others are embracing programs that make private schools more accessible. 
Those who disagree with these important measures are really suggesting that the money earned by these parents does not belong to them, that government is best at determining how their money is spent, that there is no need to change business-as-usual in our effort to improve the way we educate America's children. Clearly, this is not the message we're hearing from home. Our states and communities--our families--are embracing innovative educational programs. They realize the old way isn't working. Many cities and states are offering families the power of choice when it comes to selecting what school their children will attend. Others are embracing programs that make private schools more accessible. These measures are having a positive impact. 
These measure are an important step forward, and the Senate can demonstrate its leadership on education by adopting this legislation. Let's be bold, Mr. President. Our policies must offer Dad and Mom the resources they need to actively guide Junior's education. The Coverdell bill does this. It is a very important step in the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
It's time for innovation. It's time to empower parents. It's time to prepare for the future. This is what the Coverdell bill is all about. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, peace and stability in Europe are among America's most vital security interests. In support of these interests, NATO has been the cornerstone of American leadership in Europe and the foundation for security and peace on that continent. 
The Alliance serves the transatlantic community not only as a proven deterrent against aggression, but also as an unmatched instrument of integration and trust--two key pillars of peace and stability. Through NATO, old enemies have not only been reconciled, but now stand side by side as allies; national defense policies are coordinated between nations that half a century ago were at war; and, on a day to day basis, consultation, joint planning, joint training and cooperation between these countries reinforce the trust and commitment to the shared values that underpin this alliance of democracies. 
Nearly a decade ago, `velvet revolutions' championed by the likes of Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel renewed freedom in Central Europe. These remarkable and peaceful revolutions tore down the Iron Curtain that divided the continent and provided the basis upon which democracy is now flourishing. 
Today, nearly a decade after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, we begin formal consideration of a resolution of ratification that would extend NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Few votes before the Senate have as much far-reaching significance as this. 
This vote concerns not only the integration of these three democracies into the Alliance, it is also very much about the strategic relationship between the United States and Europe. It is about America's role in Europe and the ability of the transatlantic community to respond to challenges of the future--both of which hinge on whether the United States wishes to remain a European power and whether we desire a unified, democratic, and larger Europe to remain linked to America. 
The case I would like to make today is that NATO enlargement is consistent with the moral and strategic imperatives of the Euro-Atlantic relationship. It is central to the vitality of the trans-atlantic community, to the future of a stable and peaceful Europe and, thus, to the ability of America and Europe to work together effectively in promoting common interests in the 21st century. 
Inclusion of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary into the Alliance will strengthen NATO. It will make NATO militarily more capable and Europe more secure. These three democracies have demonstrated their commitment to the values and interests shared by NATO members: human rights, equal justice under the law, and free markets. Each has a growing economy and a military under civilian control. 
It is important to note that they also contributed forces to Operation Desert Storm, as well as to our peacekeeping missions in Haiti and Bosnia. They were among the first countries to commit forces to serve side by side with the United States in the stand-off against Saddam Hussein. The admission of these three democracies will add an additional 200,000 troops to the Alliance, thereby strengthening its ability to fulfill its core mission of collective defense. 
NATO enlargement will eliminate immoral and destabilizing lines in Europe, a division established by Stalin and perpetuated by the Cold War. The extension of NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is an imperative consistent with the moral underpinning of U.S. foreign policy and the North Atlantic Treaty that established the Alliance in 1949. Indeed, Article 10 of the Treaty states that membership is open to `any other European state in a position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.' 
Mr President, this powerful statement reflects the emphasis the Alliance places on democracy and inclusivity. 
But NATO enlargement is not driven just by moral imperatives. It is also a policy rooted in strategic self-interest and driven by objective political, economic, and military criteria. 
Indeed, for these reasons, NATO has expanded three times since its founding, and continued enlargement will expand the zone of peace, democracy, and stability in Europe. This benefits all countries in Europe, including a democratizing Russia. 
Throughout its history, Europe has been a landscape of many insecure small powers, a few imperialistic great powers, and too many conflicting nationalist policies, each creating friction with the other. Twice in this century, these dynamics pulled America into wars on the European continent. They contributed directly to a prolonged Cold War. And the potential for them to create conflict in the future is all too real unless we seize opportunities like the one before us. As Vaclav Havel put it, `If the West does not stabilize the East, the East will destabilize the West.' Every time America has withdrawn its influence from Europe, trouble has followed. This we cannot afford. 
Mr. President, NATO enlargement is the surest means of doing for Central and Eastern Europe what American leadership, through the Alliance, has done so well for Western Europe. This includes promoting and institutionalizing trust, cooperation, coordination, and communication. In this way, NATO enlargement is not an act of altruism, but one of self-interest. 
Allow me to reemphasize that NATO enlargement benefits all democracies in Europe, including Russia. I say this because there are still those who assert that NATO enlargement is a policy that mistreats Moscow, thereby repeating mistakes made in the Versailles Treaty. That argument is dead wrong. It ignores the hand of partnership and assistance that the West, including NATO, has extended Russia. Last May, the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed, providing the foundation for not only enhanced consultation, but also unprecedented defense cooperation. Today, Russian troops serve with NATO forces in Bosnia. And, unlike the punishing economic retribution carried out under the Versailles regime, the West has extended some $100 billion since 1991 to help Russia's democratic and economic reforms, including over $2 billion in weapon dismantlement and security assistance. 
Others suggest NATO enlargement endangers a positive relationship between Russia and the West. The United States and its NATO allies will not always share common interests with Russia, irrespective of NATO enlargement. Differences over Iraq, Iran, the Caucasus, arms sales, and religious freedom are not related to NATO enlargement. Moscow will always have its own independent motivations. Unfortunately, there are still those in Moscow who reject NATO enlargement out of a desire to preserve Russia's sphere of influence. Let us not give credibility to the likes of Vladimir Zhirinovsky by acceding to these demands. 
As I have written with my colleague Senator Lugar, the bottom line is that if Russia cannot accept the legitimate right of its neighbors to choose their own defensive security arrangements, then NATO's role in Central and Eastern Europe is even more important. 
Keeping the above arguments in mind, it follows that the costs of enlargement are insignificant to the costs of rejecting NATO enlargement. I urge my colleagues to consider three severe costs that would be incurred should the Senate fail to ratify NATO membership for Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary: 
A rejection of NATO enlargement would prompt a massive crisis in America's role as the leader of the transatlantic community. NATO enlargement is a policy that has been championed by the United States, including the United States Senate. Rejection of the resolution before us would vindicate those in Europe who express doubt and who resent U.S. leadership. 
Rejection of this resolution would spread massive disillusionment across Central Europe. It would stimulate a pervasive feeling of abandonment and rekindle a sense of historic despair. This could prompt political crises. It would surely prompt a turn to more nationalist policies--including nationalist defense policies. A rejection of enlargement would reverse the remarkable development of European security around an Alliance-determined agenda--a development in no small way facilitated by the process of NATO enlargement. 
Rejection of this resolution would undercut Russia's democratic evolution, stimulating Russian imperialist nostalgia. It would give great credibility to those in Russia who argue that Russia is entitled to a sphere of influence in Central Europe. That would be at the expense of those who desire Moscow to focus on the priorities of economic and political reform. 
NATO enlargement is a critical, non-threatening complement to the hand of partnership that the West and NATO have extended to Russia. It ensures the secure and stable regional context in which a democratic Russia will have the best prospects for a normal, cooperative relationship with its European neighbors. 
Indeed, there would have been no German-French reconciliation without NATO. And, the ongoing German-Polish reconciliation would not be possible without NATO. In fact, as one thoughtful thinker on these matters, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, has written `with NATO enlarged, a genuine reconciliation between former Soviet satellites and Russia will be both truly possible and likely.' 
Finally, Mr. President, NATO enlargement is fundamental to Europe's evolution into a partner that will more effectively meet global challenges before the transatlantic community. An undivided Europe at peace is a Europe that will be better able to look outward, a Europe better able to join with the United States to address necessary global security concerns. A partnership with an undivided Europe in the time- and stress-tested architecture of NATO will enable the United States to more effectively meet the global challenges to its vital interests at a time when defense resources are increasingly strained. 
Mr. President, allow me to close by pointing out that NATO enlargement is a policy validated by unprecedented public and Congressional discourse on a matter of national security. 
Over the last five years, NATO enlargement has been the topic of countless editorials and opinion pieces in national and local papers. Over the last two years some fourteen states, including the First State, Delaware, have passed resolutions endorsing NATO enlargement. This policy has been endorsed by countless civic, public policy, political, business, labor and veterans organizations. 
NATO enlargement has also been repeatedly endorsed by the North Atlantic Assembly, an arm of the Alliance that convenes parliamentary representatives of NATO's sixteen countries. Congress has always been an active player in this organization and I have the honor today of serving as President of the NAA. 
Congress, in particular, has led the charge for NATO enlargement. Its committees have examined in detail the military, intelligence, foreign policy, and budgetary implications of this long overdue initiative. Since last July alone, twelve hearings have been conducted on NATO enlargement by the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Appropriations, and Budget. The Senate NATO Observer Group, which I chair with Senator Joseph R. Biden, has convened seventeen times with, among others, the President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, NATO's Secretary General, and the leaders of the three invitee countries. 
For me, it is no surprise--indeed a matter of pride--that Congress has legislatively promoted NATO enlargement every year since 1994. To be exact, this chamber has endorsed NATO enlargement some fourteen times through unanimous consent agreements, voice votes and roll call votes. I only wish all dimensions of U.S. national security policy would receive this much public attention and endorsement. 
Mr. President, these arguments make it clear that America's best chance for enduring peace and stability in Europe--our best chance for staying out of war in Europe, our best chance for reinforcing what has been a strong, productive partnership with Europe--is to promote a Europe that is whole, free, and secure. What better organization to do this than the North Atlantic Alliance--an organization that has kept the peace for more than fifty years and remains unmatched in its potential to meet the security challenges of the future. The extension of NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is a critical step to ensure that the Alliance remains true to the values of the Washington Treaty, to consolidate the gains in democracy, peace, and stability in post-Cold War Europe, and to ensure that the transatlantic community is fully prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the next century. 
Mr. President, we should all commend the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms, for producing an outstanding resolution and ratification. He has been a true leader in the effort behind NATO enlargement. He has ensured that all Members of the Senate have had ample opportunity to be fully engaged on this important matter. I applaud his leadership. Senator Helms and his colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee have produced, as I said, an outstanding resolution of ratification. I urge my colleagues to give it their unqualified support. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for unanimously adopting this resolution. I believe this vote of 100 to 0 lets Thailand and the Thai people know the heartfelt sentiments of the Senate and the American people toward bilateral friendship and partnership. It also makes clear our recognition of the strides Bangkok has been making in executing its responsibilities under its arrangements with the International Monetary Fund. Only last week, for example, Thailand deepened its commitment to economic reform by pledging to speed up privatizations and the reorganization of its banking system. 
This week the new Prime Minister of Thailand, Chuan Leekpai, will visit the United States. Many of us will have the chance to meet him when he comes to visit Capitol Hill. While Prime Minister Chuan faces many challenges in the coming months and years, I hope and trust the support for Thailand that he will find in this country will help him in overcoming those challenges. 
As I have said before, I believe that all of us in this Chamber--and Americans all across this land--are great admirers of Thailand and Thai culture. I remain optimistic about Thailand's future. Given the Thai people's energy and initiative, the country's remarkable history, and its record of economic success, I look forward to seeing Thailand's return to prosperity in the not-too-distant future.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to send to the desk the Finance Committee's amendment to the pending legislation. The work of the Finance Committee complements the work undertaken by the Environment and Public Works Committee. In general, the Finance Committee amendment updates the current Tax Code provisions to correspond to the purposes of the pending legislation. There are several additional provisions contained in the Finance Committee amendment that I would like to highlight in my remarks today. 
In particular, the Finance Committee amendment extends the current expiration date of the highway fund excise taxes and the authority to spend revenue from the highway fund for 6 years. It also extends current law transfers of revenue on motorboat and small engine gasoline taxes from the highway fund to the aquatic resources trust fund for 6 years. 
The Finance Committee amendment also extends the alternative fuels tax provision for 6 years. These provisions are extended at reduced rates. They are identical to the provisions that were included in the Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
The Finance Committee amendment clarifies a provision relating to the taxability of employer-provided transportation benefits. The amendment clarifies employees who have the choice of either receiving cash compensation or receiving one of three nontaxable transportation fringe benefits. The nontaxable transportation fringe benefits are employer-provided parking, employer-provided transit passes and employer-provided van pooling services. This provision would give all employees the flexibility to determine the type of employer-subsidized transportation benefit that they want to use or whether they want to receive cash instead of using these employer-provided benefits. 
This provision also provides that the value of tax-free employer-provided transit passes and van pooling services would be increased from $65 per month to $100 per month in the year 2002. Both of these changes are offset by delaying the cost-of-living increase and the amount of tax-free employer-provided parking that would have been made in 1999. 
The Finance Committee also extends the highway trust fund expenditures authority through September 30, 2003. This provision is important because without it, States would not have access to highway trust fund monies. 
With regard to another issue, railroads are unfairly burdened under current law. They are required to pay a higher deficit reduction tax than other modes of transportation. The Finance Committee amendment helps to remedy this unfairness by repealing the $1.25 gallon deficit reduction rail diesel tax as of March 1, 1999. 
The committee amendment also clarifies the tax treatment of funds received under the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Program. The Finance Committee amendment includes a proposal to allow public-private partnership to use tax-exempt bonds to fund highway toll roads and bridge construction projects. 
Finally, the amendment also includes language that would provide for a 2-year moratorium on the fuel terminal registration requirement concerning kerosene. Senator Chafee and Senator Nickles have worked hard to reach this compromise. It is their hope that the market will work properly to ensure the availability of both dyed and undyed kerosene. If not, then the provision would be implemented as originally enacted. 
The amendment includes a supplement through the technical explanation of the Finance Committee amendment that was printed in the Congressional Record on October 8, 1997. Mr. President, the Finance Committee amendment was approved on a voice vote. All members of the Finance Committee support the amendment. It is my hope that this Senate will proceed swiftly to enact this amendment.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the author of this amendment. But as the distinguished Senator from Virginia has so ably stated, this amendment, if adopted, would be a killer amendment. So I rise in opposition to this amendment. Under current law, the 4.3-cent tax is transferred to the highway trust fund. And that tax is being proposed to be used to fund important highway programs. 
I point out, as the Senator from Virginia has already mentioned, months of hard work have gone into the development of this legislation. 
The bill has been considered for several days on the Senate floor. I think it is important that we move forward as expeditiously as possible. 
As I said, this amendment, if adopted, would have the effect of killing the ISTEA legislation. It would be most regrettable to have that happen. It is time, in my judgment, to pass the legislation and give States the necessary highway funding without further delay. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, we live in an era of great events--a moment when opportunity seized in a thoughtful and timely manner will allow us to make history. Today I want to show how conditions that have been created by our efforts to strengthen the economy and bring down the deficit can not only save Social Security in the short term, but begin today to strengthen it for our children and for generations yet to come. 
Saving Social Security is a promise we have made to Americans--both young and old. It's a promise that President Clinton reiterated in his most recent State of the Union Address. And it's a promise that we can keep, despite the challenging demographics and declining trend lines that currently point to a bleak future for a program that many would say is the most important contract our government has ever entered into with the American people. 
Social Security has saved countless men, women and children from poverty. It protects our elderly, our disabled, their families, and dependents of workers who have died. In its 63-year history--and despite pressing challenges--Social Security has been a success. More than 40 percent of our seniors are kept out of poverty because of Social Security. In fact, our seniors today have the lowest rate of poverty among all age groups. Forty years ago, more than one of every three elderly Americans lived in poverty. Today it's one in ten. 
But Social Security is much more than protection in retirement. Because of congressional efforts to expand the program, one out of every six Americans--or some 44 million people--receive a monthly Social Security check. 
But today, Social Security faces insolvency. It is a pay-as-you-go, inter-generational transfer of money. Money received by Social Security beneficiaries is paid by taxes coming from today's workers. And the benefits today's workers will receive will be paid by their children. And this, Madam President, is the root of the problem, because those who are supporting the system are declining in relation to those who depend on Social Security. In the early days of the program, there were as many as 42 workers per beneficiary. Today, there are 3.2. And in 2030, just 2 workers will support each individual receiving Social Security. 
Given current trends, tax revenues to the Social Security trust funds will no longer cover benefit payments beginning in 2012. Social Security will need to call upon assets that are just now accumulating in the trust funds and invested in U.S. Treasury bonds. Cashing in those bonds will put major pressure on the Federal budget--crowding out other important spending. Even so, by 2029 the bonds will be gone. Social Security will then be able to cover only 75 percent of benefit payments directly from revenues. 
This, Madam President, does not need to happen. We can save Social Security, and we can strengthen it well into the future. A part of the solution is as simple as it is powerful. 
Dr. Martin Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard University and the President of the prestigious National Economic Research Bureau, has proposed using budget surpluses to fund personal retirement accounts for working Americans. In November of 1997, and then again last month, Dr. Feldstein published two op-eds outlining his proposal in the Wall Street Journal. I ask unanimous consent that the February op-ed be entered into the Record.

Mr. ROTH. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton promised to `Save Social Security First' with the budget surpluses. At the time, he said that the surpluses were at least 2 years off. The good news--what makes now such a timely moment in history--is that the surpluses are not two years off, but will begin this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
In other words, we have the opportunity to begin almost immediately to use budget surplus to fund personal retirement accounts for Americans. How far will this go? CBO estimates that the cumulative budget surplus over the next eleven years--from 1998 though 2008--will be $679 billion. That equals about 1.4 percent of the taxable payroll that would be collected over this same period. 
Now, 1.4 percent of a person's wages might not sound like much. But look at what happens if we follow Dr. Feldstein's recommendation and use the budget surpluses to create retirement accounts for Americans. According to a report published by the Congressional Research Service on March 4, for an average wage worker--someone who is 40 today and making about $27,000 in 1998--just 1 percent put annually into a stock account based on the historical return of the S&P 500 could equal 10 percent of that individual's projected Social Security benefit over the next 25 years. 
Let me repeat that. Investing just 1 percent of a 40-year-old worker's income in a retirement account will grow to equal a full 109 percent of his or her Social Security benefit! For someone younger--say 25 and who has even more time to earn interest--1 percent could equal almost 27 percent of their future Social Security benefit. 
Indeed, all Americans can figure out what 1.4 percent of their wages will be over the next 10 years, and then ask themselves how that might grow in 10 or 20 years. 
Using budget surpluses to create retirement accounts represents an excellent first step toward shoring up Social Security for the long run. This would be a new program in addition to the current Social Security program. By establishing these accounts this year, it will allow us to demonstrate their value--their potential--in providing retirement benefits for working Americans in the years to come. 
Creating these accounts will give the majority of Americans who do not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic growth--because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. More Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers. 
Creating these accounts will demonstrate to all Americans the power of saving--even small amounts--and how savings may grow over time. Americans today save less than people in almost every other country. And even this low private savings rate has declined from 4.3 in 1996 (as a share of after-tax income) to 3.8 percent in 1997. 
And creating these accounts will help Americans to better prepare for retirement generally. According to the Congressional Research Service, 60 percent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement program other than Social Security. A recent survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute found that only 27 percent of working Americans have any idea of what they will need to save in order to retire when and how they want. Personal retirement accounts will help Americans better understand retirement planning. 
Lastly, these accounts may point the way to a permanent solution to Social Security's problems. We do not need fixes for a few years or a few decades--but solutions that have more permanent promise. It was just 15 years ago--in 1983--that we fixed Social Security for 75 years--to about 2058. But again Social Security is in trouble. 
Madam President, let me also note that other choices will be far less attractive to keep the promise of Social Security, for example, we cannot count on tax hikes. To fix Social Security would require a huge, 50-percent increase in the payroll tax over the next 75 years. And today's tax is already a burden for many families. Forty-one percent of families pay more in Social Security taxes than income taxes, and if you factor in employer Social Security taxes--which economists tell us are really forgone wages--80 percent of Americans pay more in Social Security than income taxes. And let us remember Social Security taxes are on the first dollar of income--no deductions, no exemptions. 
Indeed, in a speech last month at Georgetown University on Social Security, the President promised not to unfairly burden the next generation--who will be supporting tomorrow's Social Security beneficiaries. Tax hikes would do that. 
One way to establish and manage these new personal retirement accounts is to follow a proven model--the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Back in 1983, when I was then chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the retirement program for Federal employees needed to be revamped. 
One of the new elements we added was the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), managed by a Board of Trustees. TSP is a unique institution. Each Federal employee has an account, and can allocate their investments among three options--a stock index fund that mirrors the S&P 500; a bond fund, largely invested in corporate bonds; and a Government bond fund that invests in T-bills. The Thrift Board is now planning to add two other funds. 
Last year, we looked closely at the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) as a model to reform Medicare by providing more private choices in health insurance. The lessons of FEHBP were invaluable. So, too, I believe we can adapt the Federal Thrift Savings Plan as a model for Social Security personal investment accounts. 
Mr. President, I want to respond to two specific concerns I have heard raised about personal investment accounts. First, that some people will have great investment performance, others miserable. We can surely avoid that. The funds of the Federal Thrift Savings plan have had excellent performance, while remaining conservative investments. Indeed, I am very sensitive to the issue that investments should be handled in a responsible fashion--and I think we do that with even more choices than offered by the Federal plan. 
The second concern is that the progressive nature of Social Security benefits will be lost with personal investment accounts. I believe we can construct a system that benefits low-wage workers, and I am committed to that. The bottom line is that by using the budget surplus to create personal investment accounts, we will go a long way toward providing a workable and very attractive solution to the challenges facing Social Security. We will do it without compromising the current system. And we will do it in a way that places us square on the course to long-term opportunity for all Americans. 
Promises made are promises that should be kept. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I feel the responsibility of making sure Social Security remains strong and viable in the lives of those who depend on it. Today, we have an irreplaceable opportunity to do this. 
Personal retirement accounts--funded by budget surpluses--can both return real benefits to working Americans and demonstrate how to fix the problems of Social Security. There are still a number of technical questions we need to answer in developing personal retirement accounts legislation that can pass Congress this year. Toward this end, I will continue to work with my staff, and I welcome the views and advice of colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I rise today to respond to the charge that has been made in a number of newspapers over the last week--and particularly by the New York Times--that the public, Congress, and the Senate, in particular, has paid inadequate attention to the policy of NATO enlargement. 
Few issues of national security have been as extensively examined as NATO enlargement. It has been the topic of countless editorials and opinion pieces in national and local papers. Over the last two years some fifteen states, including the First State, Delaware, have passed resolutions endorsing NATO enlargement. This policy has been formally endorsed by countless civic, public policy, political, business, labor, and veterans organizations.

Mr. ROTH. Congress, in particular, has led the charge for NATO enlargement. Its committees have examined in detail the military, intelligence, foreign policy, and budgetary implications of this long overdue initiative. Since last July alone, twelve hearings have been conducted on NATO enlargement by the Senate committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services Appropriations, and Budget. The Senate NATO Observer Group, which I chair with Senator Joseph R. Biden, has convened 17 times with, among others, the President, the Secretaries of State and Defense, NATO's Secretary General, and the leaders of the three invitee countries. 
Madam President, allow me to single out Senator Helms, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, for his outstanding set of eight hearings on this initiative. He and his colleagues on the Committee have produced a hearing report of some 600 pages addressing all the pro and con argument over NATO enlargement. And, I urge my colleagues to take time to examine the committee report released last week. 
This examination, in my view, has yielded unambiguous conclusions: The extension of NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary will make the Alliance stronger. It will eliminate immoral and destabilizing dividing lines in Europe--divisions imposed by Stalin and perpetuated by the cold war. And, it will expand an inclusive zone of peace, democracy and stability in Europe to the benefit of the United States and to all countries of Europe, including Russia. 
It is no surprise--indeed a matter of pride--that the Senate has legislatively recommended NATO enlargement some fourteen times over the last 4 years. Perhaps, we should be asking ourselves how can we ensure that all dimensions of U.S. national security policy receive this much public attention and endorsement? 
Before I yield the floor, I want to echo these conclusions on NATO enlargement by sharing with my colleagues a letter I recently received from Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former National Security Advisor. In part, Dr. Brzezinski wrote: 
Without the security that the Euro-Atlantic Alliance has provided, the Franco-German reconciliation--so central to Europe's peace--would never have taken place. Without NATO, the ongoing German-Polish Reconciliation would not be happening. With NATO enlarged, a genuine reconciliation between the former Soviet satellites and Russia will be both truly possible and likely. 
The fact is that a larger NATO--by resolving the fateful European dilemma posed by the disproportionate power of Germany and of Russia, a dilemma the Europeans have not been able to resolve on their own--will create a secure framework for a more comprehensive reconciliation in Europe. 
Denmark, Norway and Canada have already ratified NATO enlargement. Germany is poised to do so very soon. Hesitation or delay by America, not to speak of rejection, would gravely undermine confidence in U.S. Leadership while strengthening those who want to cut down U.S. Influence in Europe. . . . 
And Dr. Brzezinski added, 
I hate to think what message it would send to the 100 million Central Europeans who only recently recovered their freedom.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, the NCAA tournament is called by some the `Big Dance' because only 64 teams are invited each year. This year, I am proud to say one of those teams is the Fighting Blue Hens from the University of Delaware--the 1998 champions of the America East Conference. The Blue Hens put together a remarkable 20 win season culminating last Saturday in a win over Boston University to clinch a spot in the tournament. 
Coach Mike Brey and his team should be proud of their excellent season. 
Now some will say that the odds are long because the Blue Hens are seeded 15th and their opponent is seeded 2nd. But I remind you, more than 200 years ago, another group of men from Delaware faced some steep odds themselves. Back then, the number one seed was the Red Coats. 
Facing off against the Red Coats was a company of men from Delaware recruited by Captain Jonathan Caldwell. They quickly became known as the Blue Hens because their fighting ability was said to rival that of a famous fighting blue hen. They fought well and hard in battles from Long Island and White Plains to Trenton and Princeton. 
Two hundred years ago somebody picked a fight with the Blue Hens and they were sent home packing. Don't be surprised if it happens again.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, few have had as distinguished a career in the Senate as Howell Heflin, our former colleague from the great state of Alabama. One of the ways through which I came to know and appreciate the indomitable optimism and warmth of Senator Heflin was through our work together as chairmen of the Senate Delegation to the North Atlantic Assembly. 
The NAA brings together on a regular basis parliamentary and legislative leaders of NATO's 16 nations to discuss matters of transatlantic concern, generate initiatives addressing key challenges, and reinforce this strategic partnership. 
Senator Heflin was not only an outstanding representative of the Senate to the Assembly and an ardent supporter of the NATO Alliance, but he was also an energetic and persuasive leader on an important initiative before us today, NATO enlargement. 
I recently corresponded with Senator Heflin. He brought to my attention a speech on NATO enlargement by Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre delivered on Veteran's day before an audience in Birmingham.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, I rise to state my unequivocal support for a federal ban on human cloning. However, I am uncomfortable with the hurried pace with which this issue is being considered in the Senate. 
The issue before us is both extremely complex and consequential. Regulating the very cutting edge of medical science will impact our fights against nearly every category of disease, including cancer, heart disease, blindness, Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases to name but a few. 
The United States must maintain its preeminent position as the international leader in biotechnological research, but do so while adhering to the highest moral and ethical standards. Any prohibition of cloning needs to be very carefully constructed and tested by public hearing to assure that both of these goals might be fulfilled. 
The Food and Drug Administration has claimed authority to regulate this technology now, eliminating the need for immediate legislative action. Knowing this, and with lives at stake, I believe all Senators should have the opportunity to benefit from a thorough public examination of this proposal. 
For these reasons, I will not support cloture on the motion to consider S. 1601 in hopes that this matter will be further evaluated at the committee level.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce nine bills to suspend temporarily the imposition of duties on the importation of certain products. 
I am pleased to introduce six bills to suspend temporarily the imposition of duties on imports of certain chemicals used in the production of pesticides. These chemicals are deltamethrin, diclofop-methyl, piperonyl butoxide, resmethrin, thidiazuron and tralomethrin. By temporarily suspending the imposition of duties, these bills would help AgrEvo USA, a company located in Wilmington, Delaware, lower its cost of production and improve its competitiveness. 
I am also pleased to introduce three bills to suspend temporarily the imposition of duties on imports of Pigment Yellow 109, Yellow 110 and Pigment Red 177. These high quality coloring materials are imported for sale in the United States by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation (Pigments Division), a company located in Newport, Delaware. By temporarily suspending the imposition of duties, these bills will reduce significantly the cost of coloring materials that are used in a wide variety of finished products, including automotive parts, vinyl flooring, carpet fibers and plastic utensils.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Lugar, to submit a Resolution to state the sense of the Senate that Thailand remains one of America's most important partners and closest friends, and that Bangkok has been making important strides in executing its responsibilities under its arrangements with the International Monetary Fund. 
Mr. President, America's friendship with Thailand is our longest-standing in Asia. Our first Envoy to Thailand negotiated a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with that country in 1833. 
Thailand was the first country afflicted with the so-called Asian contagion, and the first to receive IMF assistance. However, at the time the IMF put the package together for Thailand in August, 1977, Asia's regional economy looked far different than it does today. Let me give one compelling example of how things have changed: Last year, both Korea and Indonesia were economically secure enough to pledge so-called `second line of defense' contingency loans to Thailand. 
The point is, Mr. President, many of the assumptions that the IMF used in formulating the conditions for Thailand's package are no longer applicable. 
Despite the changes, however, the new Government of Thailand has been making important progress in fulfilling its IMF obligations. Already Thailand has taken steps to improve financial and economic transparency and cut its budget. 
I recently visited Thailand and was very impressed by the new leadership in Bangkok, by the steps they have taken thus far and by their resolve in fulfilling their IMF obligations. 
Mr. President, I believe I am safe in saying that all of us in this chamber--and Americans all across this land--are great admirers of Thailand and Thai culture. I remain optimistic about Thailand's future. Given the Thai people's energy and initiative, the country's remarkable history, and its record of economic success, I hope and expect to see Thailand's return to prosperity in the not-too-distant future.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, a little over a week ago, I stood to introduce the Finance Committee's fast track bill. On that occasion, I made it clear that fast track authority is important to America's future. I advocated the need for American leadership if we are to make progress in expanding economic opportunities for individuals and families here at home. 
I emphasized that America has always been a trading nation. From colonial times to the creation of the post-World War II international economic order, the United States has pressed for open commerce, free of discriminatory preferences and trade-distorting barriers. 
From battles with Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli to the arduous negotiations that led to the signing of the Uruguay round agreements in Marrakesh, Morocco, we have promoted and defended open, fair, and unfettered trade. 
The United States has been a driving force for expanding world trade and the prosperity it yields, particularly over the last six decades. From the creation of the GATT, to the initiation of each successive round of multilateral trade negotiations, to the political will to conclude the Uruguay round, America has taken the lead. 
We have pursued this course in our own economic and political self-interest. In purely economic terms, the United States is the world's largest trading state and the largest beneficiary of the international trading system. We lead the world in both exports and imports. 
Thirty percent of our current annual economic growth depends on exports. Eleven million jobs are directly tied to those export sales. 
According to the Federal Reserve, our two-way trade, both exports and imports, have played a major role in the 7 years of sustained, noninflationary economic growth we enjoy today. And no other nation in the world is so well positioned to bless its citizens through open trade than America. Our Nation, better than any other, is situated to succeed in a global economy. 
We have the diversity of cultures, the most advanced technology, the most efficient capital markets, and a corporate sector that is constantly innovating and has already gone through substantial restructuring that is necessary for global competition. We have a single currency, a common language, and the important blessing of geography: we are a nation--a continent--that looks both to Europe and to Asia. 
No other nation is so well positioned to reap the blessings of a global economy. As Thomas L. Friedman suggested in the New York Times, America, as a nation, almost appears to have been designed to compete in such a world. 
Having said this, let me be clear that we have not pursued the goal of liberalizing trade solely because it is in our own economic interest to do so. We have pursued that goal because it is in our political and security interests as well. 
It is worth noting, in the shadow of the Veterans Day remembrance, that conflicts over trade in the 1930's deepened the Great Depression profoundly and fostered the political movements that gave us the Second World War. Our own revolution was fought in large part because of the constraints Great Britain imposed on the colonies' trade. Indeed, it is difficult to recall any great conflict in which trade did not play a part. 
In my view, prosperity is the surest means to secure peace, both because it strengthens our capacity to maintain our defense and because it reduces the causes of conflicts that lead to war. 
In this Chamber, we have had a spirited debate that has raised a number of significant issues--from alleged flaws in our trade agreements, to the causes and consequences of the trade deficit, to the issues of labor standards and the environment. We have benefited from this exchange of views on both sides. And, I was heartened by the vote in the Senate to move to proceed to debate the Finance Committee's bill extending fast track negotiating authority--a vote that commanded a majority of Members from both sides of the aisle. 
As heartened as I was by our vote, I was as disappointed in the President's decision to ask that the measure not be put to a vote in the House. It is clear, from all reports, that the President was unable to move a sufficient number of Members of his own party to join in the effort to promote American economic and political interests abroad. 
My first thought on hearing of the President's decision, however, was not about the past. My first thought was for the future. 
I say this because I happen to believe that we are on the edge of an era of unparalleled prosperity, not just in the United States, but throughout the world. But the realization of such prosperity will depend on conditions. It will depend on our making the right kinds of choices. 
It will depend on our ability to advance the cause of open markets and the freedom to compete fairly throughout the world. 
Walter Lippman coined the term the `American Century' to apply to the decades from the turn of the century during which the United States grew to a position of unrivaled economic, political, and cultural strength. I happen to believe that we are now entering a second `American Century,' if we have the courage to embrace the challenges and opportunities of international leadership that our greater destiny offers us. 
We will not advance our own cause if we shirk that responsibility. Nor will we serve the generations of Americans that follow us if we shrink from an expansive vision of what we can accomplish together if we, as Americans, remain united in a common purpose. 
In the abstract and arcane world of international trade, there is little that is not subject to debate and differing points of view. One exception, however, is that for the world to make progress, the United States must lead. 
This is the essence of the fast track debate--whether we would offer the President the means by which he can exercise American leadership on the trade front. Absent fast track, he will not have a seat at the table. The rules of the road will be written without our full participation. History tells us that, when that happens, the world does not move in the direction of open, unfettered commerce, but in the direction of preferential trading systems often designed to exclude the United States. 
There are a series of negotiations on the horizon within the WTO and other forums. They will redefine the rules in areas like agriculture, financial services, and basic customs rules applicable to every product imported into, or exported from, the United States. 
They will proceed without us and in a direction we will not like if the President lacks the authority to engage and lead. And if that is the case, we are certain to lose a great deal. For example, Charlene Barshefsky reminds us that in the area of negotiating market access to government procurement, there is over a trillion dollars at stake in Asia alone. In services, there is over a $1.2 trillion global market, and in agriculture over $600 billion. 
I doubt whether the farmers of America will believe that it will be a sufficient response to say that we failed to act on fast track because we did not understand the true cause of our trade deficit and therefore left it to others to define the rules that will govern our agricultural trade into the 21st century. 
For that reason--for what is at stake for Americans, for our families, for jobs--high paying jobs--I want to see us return to the issue of trade negotiating authority in the coming session of Congress. I want to see both Houses of Congress move on as broad a front as possible to secure our economic future. 
Because of what is at stake, we must make progress where we can, regardless of how broad a consensus we can ultimately achieve. We need to address the reality of these impending items on the international agenda and define the strategy the United States will promote in each. That does not give us the luxury of waiting until a final consensus has been reached on every issue raised in our recent debates. We need to be able to make an impact now and I will be working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we do. 
As for building a stronger bipartisan consensus for the long run on trade, my sense from our debates is that there are a number of important issues that need to be examined. They need to be examined in a way that would excise the politics and help us all understand the dynamics at work in an increasingly global economy. We need to develop a mechanism for addressing these issues, helping us resolve our collective concerns, and allowing us to move forward in a way that will benefit all working Americans. I intend to work closely with my colleagues toward this end in the coming months. 
Let me conclude with words of praise for each and every Member of this body. I believe that we have shown incredible leadership ourselves on an issue of the utmost importance to America. 
I know we share a common goal of a stronger American economy that benefits all working men and women. In the months ahead, let us unite in an effort to resolve the differences between ourselves in order to remove the roadblocks that stand between us and that common goal. Let us pull together in this coming session of Congress to redefine the debate in terms of the progress we can make together toward our ultimate objective. 
Based on the Senate's record in the past, I have great confidence that we can and will take that step forward to embrace a brighter American future. I thank my colleagues for their efforts over the recent weeks, and look forward to the opportunity to rejoin them in pursuit of the greater good for all Americans in this coming session. 
Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to object to the unanimous-consent request made by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey. The process of his seeking a UC agreement and my objecting is into its fourth day now. I do want to say publicly that I appreciate the civil and courteous manner in which the process has unfolded. 
It is my opinion that what unites Senator Kerrey and me is more significant than what divides us. His successful commission has done essential work in uncovering weaknesses and shortcomings within the IRS. The 3 days of hearings we held in the Finance Committee disclosed others. Both of us are well aware of the changes that must be made within the agency. 
Senator Kerrey is right when he says the vast majority of our colleagues would vote to pass the legislation which passed the House by a vote of 426 to 4. Indeed, when one looks at the abuses and inefficiency of the IRS, it is hard to resist the argument that any reform is better than no reform at all. Senator Kerrey is correct in saying that the legislation he proposes would make important reforms to the IRS, but he is also right in saying that the legislation is not complete. It has weaknesses, and I must emphasize very, very serious weaknesses. 
Mr. President, the simple truth is that I am not willing to compromise on real reform. I am not willing to rush into legislation that does not go far enough to address the changes that must take place within the agency, especially when rushing in will adversely impact the potential of passing real reform later. The fact is, this reform falls short of what we need to accomplish. 
The New York Times reports that `tax experts across the country say the practical benefits of the [legislation advocated by Senator Kerrey] will be minor.' According to Stuart E. Seigel, a former chief counsel of the IRS, `Most of the bill's provisions are very limited and will not have a significant impact on most taxpayers.' 
Senator Kerrey suggests that each day the Senate delays in passing what the New York Times calls minor changes, some 150,000 people will be affected as they continue to receive notices from the IRS. Yet, another report in the Times makes it clear that `the provisions in [this `watered down'] bill are [so] narrowly drawn [that it] would affect relatively few people.' 
Senator Kerrey himself has made it clear that `this [bill] doesn't go far enough.' The Wall Street Journal of November 3, 1997. And Newsweek reports that the strong measures aimed at reform have been eviscerated. 
The question all of this begs is simple: Why compromise? If Senator Kerrey suggests this bill doesn't go far enough, if we have a growing consensus among tax practitioners, taxpayers, and the media that the bill is deficient, and if we have the conviction in Congress and the sentiment at home that something significant must be done, why are we willing to compromise? 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that I am not willing to compromise. Some would suggest that half a loaf is better than none; that we can come back and stiffen up this legislation later. 
Well, we know where that will lead. If we pass this reform legislation, then those who are not anxious to pass further reforms will resist a new bill. The truth is that we will get 
only one real chance to reform the IRS, and we had better do it right. 
There are several significant issues we need to address. We should begin by giving the oversight board called for in this legislation, and if we adopt such a board, the authority to look at audit and collection activities. More than 70 percent of Americans think poor treatment in audits occurs fairly regularly, yet this legislation expressly prohibits the oversight board from having jurisdiction over audits and enforcement. 
This is just the beginning, Mr. President. Let's include a provision to ensure that all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure authority. Let's give the taxpayer advocate greater independence. Likewise, the IRS should have the benefit of an independent inspector general. Let's strengthen the legislation to require signatures on all IRS-generated correspondence, and let's curb the use of false identifications by agency employees and ban the use of statistics and goals in determining their performance. 
These changes are only a beginning of what needs to be done. Yet, the legislation advocated by my distinguished colleague does not address even these most fundamental needs. If we are unprepared at this time to add these things, then let's be patient. Let's not pass a bill that Senator Kerrey has already suggested `doesn't go far enough.'

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, it is my pleasure to support and urge passage of the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act or the PASS Act for short. This legislation contains the right combination of reforms to dramatically change the child welfare system for the better. 
The foster care system reflects a part of modern society which prompts us to ask many questions of ourselves and each other. It is a mirror which can be troubling to look into. 
Today, we join the tens of thousands of loving foster care and adoptive families and dedicated professionals who are daily witnesses of the successes and failures in a system through which millions of people pass each year. Each report to a child protective service agency involves a victim and a perpetrator--in most cases, a child and his or her parent. A case may take a single day or many years to close. 
Many of these cases are complex and that the length of time in foster care has an effect on the child. Between 1985 and 1995, the number of children in foster care increased from 276,000 to 494,000, an increase of nearly 80 percent. 
Much of this increase is due to the hurricane-force waves of drug abuse which continue to unleash their destructive powers on communities and families. Those who believe for even a foolish moment that drug use is a victimless crime are proven wrong by the recent trends in the child welfare system. One need only to look inside the hospital crib of an abandoned crack baby to understand the truth. 
The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 100,000 children currently in foster care cannot return home without jeopardizing their health, safety, and development. 
There is great concern that more children are staying in foster care for longer periods of time. The very laws which are intended to protect children may in practice work against their best interests. 
The child welfare system itself is complex and is composed of many parts and programs. Although the Federal Government has assumed a greater share of the cost of these programs in recent years, State and local governments still provide the majority of the resources for the child welfare system. 
In fiscal year 1997, the Federal Government contributed approximately $5 billion to the child welfare system. 
Of this amount, 85 percent was spent through title IV-E programs. 
CBO estimates that under current law, outlays for foster care and adoption assistance will increase by more than 50 percent from $3.9 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $5.9 billion in 2002. 
Federal funds are used to subsidize about half of the children in foster care and about two-thirds of the children receiving adoption assistance payments. 
The Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act includes much needed reform to the child welfare system. 
The PASS Act provides that in determining `reasonable efforts,' the child's health and safety shall be the paramount concern. 
It clarifies circumstances, including murder, voluntary manslaughter, and felony assault under which `reasonable efforts' to reunite families are not required. 
It requires the States to initiate or join proceedings to terminate parental rights if a child has been in foster care for 12 of the most recent 18 months. 
The PASS Act strengthens the `permanency plan' for children in foster care. 
It requires criminal background checks for prospective foster care and adoptive parents and any other adults residing in the household and employees of foster care institutions. The amendment specifies circumstances when approval shall not be granted. 
The PASS Act provides adoption incentive payments to the States to increase the number of children which may total $6,000 per child. 
It expands the number of child welfare demonstration projects. 
The amendment also reauthorizes and expands the Family Preservation and Support Services program and includes reforms to this program. 
It renames the program to the Promoting Adoptive, Safe, and Stable Families program. 
Funding is increased by $50 million. 
The amendment adds adoption promotion and time-limited family reunification services to the program. 
It removes geographic barriers to adoption. 
The PASS Act requires States to provide for health insurance coverage for adopted children with special needs. 
It continues eligibility for adoption assistance payments for children whose initial adoption has been disrupted. 
It provides for an annual report on the State performance in protecting children. 
The PASS Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recommend to Congress a new incentive system based on State performance within 6 months. 
The PASS Act once again calls upon our State partners to address the problems of a system in much need of reform. This will be the first significant reform of the child welfare system since 1980. 
We have enacted sweeping welfare reform and Medicaid reform legislation. 
We have created a new partnership with the States through the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The PASS Act calls upon the States to channel their efforts to the child welfare system with the same commitment, creativity, and innovation which led to last year's historic welfare reform legislation. 
Last year we worked to free millions of families from the trap of welfare dependency. Let us now work together to ensure that no children will be left without the opportunity to be a part of a loving, safe, and stable family. 
There are a number of Senators who deserve our special thanks and recognition for their tireless efforts to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor today. 
Without naming them all, let me just thank them and congratulate them for a job well done. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is the third day in a row that the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, has asked for a unanimous-consent agreement to pass the House IRS restructuring bill. And for the third day in a row, I have, again, objected. 
Moving this bill today by unanimous consent is the politically expedient thing to do. It is the easy thing to do, and if we approve this legislation now, we could all go home and try to convince our constituents that we solved all the problems with the IRS and they wouldn't have to worry again. 
But this would not be true. This bill, while it is a good start, does not address the very egregious problems that the Senate Finance Committee exposed in our September hearings. The most significant reform in this bill is the creation of an 
oversight board. But, Mr. President, the board does not have the power to look at audit and collection issues where the most help is needed for the taxpayer. It falls short on many accountability issues that were raised at our hearings, basic issues such as requiring employees to sign correspondence to taxpayers. It does not alter the power that agents have to abusively slap liens and levies on taxpayers. It does not ensure taxpayers their due-process rights. 
Those are only a few of the missing links. The restructuring commission and the Ways and Means Committee did good work, but what they have done is only a beginning. We need to go further. 
Some have said let's pass this now and then come back and do more next year. Well, Mr. President, we know where that will lead. If we pass this reform legislation, legislation that even Senator Kerrey admits has important omissions, those who are not anxious to pass it will rise up and cry that we have already passed reform legislation. When we attempt to strengthen it, they will say that we need no further reform or that we must give this effort a few years to see that it works. The truth is, we will basically get only one real chance to reform the IRS, and for the taxpayer, we must get it right. I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, and I do so for two principal reasons. But before I discuss those reasons, I would like to point out that in my judgment the truth is that trade policy has very little to do with our trade deficit. My esteemed colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has made that point himself. Our trade deficit is a function of simple arithmetic. We consume more than we produce and save, and the difference is basically our trade deficit. 
It is also true that when we are growing as rapidly as we are, and our trading partners are not, we are likely to import more and export less. Because they prefer to hold dollars as a hedge or as an investment, our trading partners are essentially financing our ability to live beyond our means. 
Now, I do not mean to underestimate the need to get our economic house in order. Getting our budget deficit under control is a significant step in that direction. 
What I have said does not mean that we should not do everything we can to ensure that our trade policy does not contribute to our trade deficit. We should and must insist that our trading partners open their markets to our goods. The defeat of fast track would do nothing but hinder that effort. It would offer our trading partners an excuse not to negotiate with us. It would offer them an excuse to maintain their barriers to trade and exacerbate whatever impact our trading policies may in fact have on our trade deficit. We should instead be looking for every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that we open markets and keep them open. Fast track is one of those weapons. I do not see the point of unilaterally disarming if you are seriously concerned about doing something about the trade deficit. 
Now, Mr. President, as I said, I do oppose the amendment by the Senator from North Dakota, and I do so for two principal reasons. First, we face many challenges on the international economic front. The trade deficit is one of them but certainly not the only one, nor even necessarily the most significant in my view. 
To me, the broader question, and, frankly, the one that is most likely to affect our economic future, is how we come to grips with the increasing globalization of the world economy. The world economy is undergoing fundamental changes that have deep importance for our economic future, and we must decide whether we embrace that challenge or try to hide from it. 
While I do not disagree that it would be useful to look at the underlying causes of the trade deficit in that context, there certainly are many other issues of greater significance that have been raised in this debate alone that would deserve similar attention by such a high-powered group as that described in the Senator's amendment. 
Second, we should also understand that the amendment will require a hard look at whether we have our own economic house in order. Since the root cause of the deficit includes our domestic economic policies, we will be asking the commission to delve deeply into our fiscal and monetary policies. My point is that there already are a number of governmental institutions that are involved in these processes where there is expertise on these matters such as the Treasury, the Commerce Department, the Federal Reserve, as well as our congressional committees. I wonder whether the commission is needed given the resources we already have available. 
Third, I am always concerned when we raise a proposal for a commission or another advisory board that we not use them as a reason to avoid the responsibilities we have in Congress for addressing these issues. Plainly, we have the resources here in Congress to examine these questions in depth, and I am certain we would want to explore those possibilities before establishing yet another blue ribbon commission. If the question is how do we 
eliminate the trade deficit and our trade policy is part of the answer, then the first step we should take is to pass this legislation. This bill is, after all, about breaking down trade barriers abroad, and that is undeniably a step in the right direction in eliminating trade deficits. 
As a consequence, while the concept may have merit in some sense, I oppose the amendment as offered and will ask my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. President, I yield back the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to see if it is possible for us to reach agreement on your amendment. I think in general principle we can work with you. But I do think there are some significant changes that have to be made, including the makeup of the commission itself. So it would be my understanding that tonight, at the staff level, we could probably work and see if we cannot reach agreement and try to do that so we can complete it at the earliest possible time. 
But my understanding is that the distinguished junior Senator from Rhode Island would seek to introduce his amendment, but it would be with the understanding that there would be no votes on that amendment tonight but merely to introduce it.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me start out by saying that I am a strong supporter of the environmental laws. Frankly, I would be willing to put my record as such up against any other Member of the U.S. Senate. And, as a supporter of environmental laws, I am, of course, anxious to see other countries, especially the developing countries, adopt similar policies to protect and strengthen the environment. But, having said that, I must say that I am forced to oppose the amendment offered by our distinguished junior Senator from Rhode Island. 
His proposal would include authority, under fast track, to negotiate environmental standards and enforce those standards through trade sanctions. Fast track was never intended as a means to rewrite fundamental aspects of our domestic laws, such as the environmental laws. I would point out that the basic rule of international trade is, of course, one of nondiscrimination. Where our laws fail to meet that test, and do not otherwise benefit from an exception to a trade agreement, we are obliged to eliminate the discriminatory aspects of our law. That does not mean we have to weaken our laws. It does not mean that we have to lower our standards. It simply means that our laws have to treat imported goods and services as they do competing U.S. products, in terms of the applicable taxes, the regulatory standards, and the other conditions of sale. 
Fast track was designed solely for the purpose of allowing, when needed, the conforming of our laws to our trade agreement obligations and the basic rule of nondiscrimination. The purpose of fast track is not to craft legislation or regulatory standards from whole cloth, and then run them through the legislative process under the guise of a trade agreement. 
I would have thought that all sides in the debate over trade and the environment could agree on that much. This bill would not allow the President to negotiate trade agreements that either raise or lower our environmental standards. 
I would, of course, point out that the President does have that general authority. And of course any agreement reached by his negotiation is subject to the normal process of the Congress.

Mr. ROTH. Let me point out to the distinguished Senator from Maryland that since 1974 it has been the practice and policy of the Congress to give the President authority to negotiate agreements with the assurance that whatever he negotiates, so long as it meets the goals, the objectives of the legislation, can be brought to the Congress to be acted upon without amendment. So it is a special exception that has been used for purposes of trade negotiation. 
And there is a very good reason for that. The good reason for that is, if we go way back, I think it was in 1974, it became obvious that if we were going to continue to lower barriers to open the opportunity to trade, that some device had to be made to make certain that what the President negotiated would be considered by the Congress and that there would be a vote upon it. And that is exactly what has been done, down through the years since 1974. It has been the practice to give the President authority to negotiate, setting forth the goals and objectives of those negotiations and with the assurance that he could tell the other countries that that agreement would come to the Congress and be voted. 
So, yes, it is an exception, a special process to meet the conditions. I would point out that it seems to me, with all the problems we have, our economy is doing extraordinarily well today, and has been for the last 7 years. We have the lowest unemployment. Inflation is down. I think something like 30 percent of our growth is dependent upon exports. So I think it has been a worthwhile policy and one that ought to be continued. 
In the past, Democratic Congresses have given it to Republican Presidents and I propose that this Republican Congress give a Democratic President the same authority.

Mr. ROTH. I would just say to my distinguished colleague, that our economy has been doing extremely well and has been for the last 7 years. So we must be doing something right. 
Yes, the deficit joint account has risen in amount. But at 
the same time, we are enjoying a growth, a prosperity without inflation, with very low unemployment. So I think we are doing something right and I think it is important to ensure that the economy continues to grow and prosper. I think that means it is important that we give this President, as we have past Presidents, the necessary authority for fast track. 
Let me point out once again that fast track was designed solely for the purpose of allowing us, when needed, to conform our laws to our trade agreement obligations and the basic rules of nondiscrimination. 
The purpose of fast track is not to craft legislation or regulatory standards from whole cloth and then run them through the legislative process under the guise of a trade agreement. As I said earlier, I would have thought that all sides in the debate over trade and environment could, indeed, agree on that much. This bill would not allow the President to negotiate trade agreements that either raise or lower our environmental standards. I believe that ensures that fast track will only be used for the purpose for which it was originally intended, implementing trade agreements, and not authorizing a departure from the ordinary course of Senate deliberations that is absolutely necessary to achieve that end. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me start out by saying that any agreement that raises environmental standards in a foreign country does not, of course, need fast-track authority because it does not need any authority. To make environmental standards subject to fast track, therefore, means that changes to United States environmental laws would be subject to an up-or-down vote with no amendments. Frankly, I am too much of a supporter of our standards to allow them to be changed in this manner. 
Let me point out that, in any event, as I did make some mention, the President does have authority now to negotiate whatever he chooses in the area of environmental laws. Of course, under the Constitution, he is responsible for negotiating international agreements, or he could negotiate agreements that raise standards abroad or at home, or lower, such as he chooses. 
But once he reaches an agreement with another country or countries, if it affects domestic law he, of course, has to bring it to Congress for action. Of course, under the ordinary process, that legislation can be amended. It does seem to me that, as a general rule, whether it is environmental, health, 
safety or whatever, we do want to have the process be the normal process where a matter comes up in both Houses and can be amended according to the rules of either House. 
I point out that if someone wants to have fast track in a particular area beyond trade, that can be done. We had, as a matter of fact, given what is, in effect, fast track to base closing, because it was decided that it was important in order to close any bases that the executive branch propose what bases would close and Congress could vote it up or down but not amend. So we made another exception in that case. 
It can also be pointed out that somewhat the same was done in respect to the Budget Committee. The budget has to be acted upon within a certain number of hours. There can be some amendments, but it is very limited compared with what normally is the process in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I wish to address the great efforts that this Chamber has undertaken on the matter of NATO enlargement--the extension of the alliance membership to the democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. 
It is sometimes charged that Congress has provided serious consideration to this matter. Anyone who makes this argument has not paid attention to the legislation Congress passed on this matter over the last 3 years and have clearly ignored the activities of our committees, particularly the extensive amount of hearings that have been held over the last 2 months. Our leadership on both sides of the aisle is to be commended for the time and effort they have dedicated to this important matter. 
Allow me to quickly review the highlights of Congress' role in the NATO enlargement issue. It is important to remember that Congress, in a most bipartisan manner, has led the charge for NATO enlargement. 
In 1994, the 104th Congress, then led by a Democratic majority, passed the NATO Enlargement Participation Act, an initiative of then-Senator Hank Brown. This act not only endorsed NATO enlargement, but also called upon the President to establish programs to assist selected Central European democracies prepare for the burdens and responsibilities of alliance membership. This was a bipartisan initiative, one that found strong support in both parties. I might add that NATO enlargement was even a key pillar in the GOP's Contract With America. 
In 1996, the Senate passed by recorded vote of 81-16 the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act, a bill that explicitly endorsed NATO membership for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia. 
This summer the alliance finally heeded the urging of Congress. Last July, at the Madrid summit, the North Atlantic Council invited Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to accession negotiations that will culminate in protocols of accessions that should be approved and signed this December at the annual NAC ministerial. 
I might add that I had the honor serving as a member of the President's delegation to the Madrid summit along with Senators Joe Biden, Gordon Smith, and Barbara Mikulski. We attended in our capacity as members of the Senate's NATO Observer Group. Our role in this historic summit reflected the bipartisan support behind NATO's policy of enlargement and the degree of consultation and communication occurring on this issue between Congress and the administration. 
Since the Madrid summit, and particularly over the last 2 months, this Chamber has focused on NATO enlargement in a manner I believe unprecedented for any realm of issues. I and Senator Joe Biden have had the privilege of facilitating 16 NATO Observer Group meetings with administration officials, experts, and foreign officials including NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana. 
I want to especially commend the leadership of the Senate committees, whose statutory jurisdictions are far broader, for directing so much of their energies to this matter. 
Over the last 2 months alone, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Senate Budget Committee have held a total of nine hearings on NATO enlargement. They have addressed such issues as the geopolitical rational behind this initiative, the affect it has on Russia's evolution as international actor and as a democracy, the financial costs, and the military implications, among other issues, and the pro's and con's that one hears on these matters.

Mr. ROTH. These hearings have been conducted to the highest standard. They have addressed the most contentious and potentially divisive dimensions of NATO enlargement. They have provided a powerful podium for skeptics and for those who simply want to be sure that all the `i's' have been dotted. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that NATO enlargement will yield a stronger alliance, a more peaceful and more stable Europe, and a Europe that will be an even more effective partner for the United States in a world where our shared interests are increasingly global in nature. 
I am not going to burden this Chamber with another rendition of why I support NATO enlargement. 
However, I have followed these hearings closely, and I would like to address what I think one should draw from their deliberations on three of the most important issues of NATO enlargement: the cost; its relationship to America's global interests; and, the future of Russia. 
Costs has been the most debated dimension of NATO enlargement. However, the Senate's examination of this issue so far leaves me even more confident that this will be a most worthwhile investment. 
Earlier this year, the President, at the request of Congress, estimated that NATO enlargement will cost the United States some $100-200 million per year over the next decade. 
Last month, Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright testified to the Appropriations Committee that the costs to the United States may be less because some if not much of the infrastructure existing in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is more capable than previously estimated. 
More detail on the costs of NATO enlargement is an urgent priority. NATO will soon complete its own estimate of the costs of integrating the three nations. This report is due before the December NAC ministerial. It is imperative that this study is fully transparent, clear, and specific. 
With that said, even if NATO enlargement were to cost the United States some $500 million a year over the decade, that yearly cost would still amount to about a quarter of the cost of one B-2 bomber. That is not a bad deal considering the gains we will attain in solidifying peace and stability in post-cold-war Europe. 
The Senate hearings have also reaffirmed my confidence that NATO enlargement will enhance America's ability to secure its vital interest around the globe--not just those in Europe. 
NATO enlargement is critical step toward a more unified and more peaceful Europe. It is, thus, fundamental to Europe's evolution into a partner that will more effectively meet global challenges before to the transatlantic community. An undivided Europe at peace is a Europe that will be better able to look outward, a Europe better able to join with the United States to address necessary global security concerns. A partnership with an undivided Europe in the time-tested architecture of NATO will enable the United States to more effectively meet the global challenges to its vital interests at time when our defense resources are increasingly strained. 
This was a, if not the, central theme of former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski's recent presentation before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To use his words: 
NATO expansion is central to the vitality of the European-American connection, to the scope of a secure and democratic Europe, and to the ability of the America and Europe to work together in promoting international security. 
European instability, which is inherently more likely should we fail to extend Alliance membership to the democracies of Central Europe, portends to be the greatest of drains upon U.S. defense resources, energy, and effort. This has already proven to be the case in Bosnia. We must take the pro-active steps necessary to consolidate and widen the zone of security and, thus, peace and stability in Europe. NATO enlargement is the most effective step we can take toward this end. 
Third, these Senate hearings have constructively and aggressively addressed concerns that have been voiced about the potential impact of NATO enlargement upon Russia's future. 
Testimony from Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, our former Ambassador to Moscow, emphasized that NATO enlargement has not produced a revanchist Russian foreign policy nor undercut democracy in Russia. In fact, let me quote directly form Ambassador Pickering's testimony. 
He stated:  
Over the last 18 months, precisely, when NATO enlargement has been a salient point of our agenda, Russian reform and security cooperation have moved forward, not backward. 
This former ambassador to Russia added that in the course of NATO enlargement, Yeltsin was reelected as Russia's president and that since then he has elevated reformers in his government. Moreover, Yeltsin has appointed a new defense minister, one who publicly supports START II. Most importantly, last May Russia signed the Founding Act, an agreement that offers an unprecedented opportunity for a new era of cooperation and partnership between the Alliance and Russia. 
Mr. President, too many times this year Congress has been accused of paying inadequate attention to the policy of NATO enlargement. The fact is that Congress has aggressively addressed this matter. Congress has not only been engaged in this policy its bipartisan leadership on this matter has actually been a catalyst of action. 
Much commendation is due to the Senate leadership and the Chamber as a whole for the sustained attention that has been directed to the many facets of this issue. The amount of consultation that has occurred between the administration and Congress makes NATO enlargement a model of how to approach the executive-legislative dimension of U.S. security policy. 
I fully recognize that our deliberations on NATO enlargement are far from over. More hearings are sure to be held on this important policy, as they should be. However, I thought it important to highlight the tremendously effective efforts that this Chamber has already directed to this matter of national security.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, our colleague, Senator Joe Biden, addressed the Permanent Representatives to the North Atlantic Council, the so called NAC, during their visit to the United States last month. His speech was an impressive overview of the state of debate here in the United States on NATO enlargement and how that debate is being affected the debate in Europe on issues of transatlantic security. Among these are, of course, the effort to foster reconciliation and peace in the Balkans. 
The next coming months will feature a number of important events concerning NATO enlargement, including the NAC ministerial in mid-December which will yield protocols of accession into NATO for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
Keeping in mind the debate that we will have early next year on NATO enlargement, I encourage my colleagues to read Senator Binden's statement. It is one that should also be closely read by our colleagues in the executive branch.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to object to the unanimous-consent request made by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey. In doing so, let me be clear that I applaud Senator Kerrey's tremendous work and leadership, and I am grateful for the groundwork he and the commission he has chaired have laid in the important effort to reform the Internal Revenue Service. 
What concerns me, Mr. President, is that the legislation which is being advocated at this time is--as the Washington Post pointed out--a measure that has not been subject to the kind of scrutiny and debate that must attend such an important issue. The fact is that Congress will get only one good opportunity to pass necessary and meaningful reform to the IRS. The work accomplished by the commission chaired by Senator Kerrey and Congressman Portman disclosed a number of shortcomings within the agency. A near year-long investigation by the Senate Finance Committee and hearings that we held in September disclosed even more issues that need to be addressed. And our on-going investigation continues to turn up others on what has nearly turned into a daily basis. 
IRS reform must be complete. It must be accomplished thoughtfully, methodically, thoroughly--with Congress, the administration, and the taxpayers working together. Everyone knows that the last great attempt at reform, the King Commission in the 1950's, led to a major overhaul of what was then known as the Bureau of Internal Revenue. But within only a few years, the agency was once again whacked by abuse and misuse of authority. 
We need complete reform, Mr. President. This time, we must get it right. 
Among those things that we must analyze and address are: 
Giving the oversight board--called for in this legislation--the authority to look at audit and collection activities; 
Insuring that all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS does not abusively use its liens and seizures authority; 
Making the taxpayer advocate within the agency independent and responsible to the oversight board; 
Establishing an independent inspector general within the IRS, and requiring the IG--like the taxpayer advocate--to report to the oversight board; 
Requiring signatures on all correspondence; 
Banning the use of false identifications; 
Banning the use of Bureau of Labor Statistics as a mechanism to determine taxpayers' income; and, 
Banning the use of statistics and goals in determining performance of IRS employees. 
Mr. President, each of these represents an area where we need to make reform. And the truth is, they are only a sampling of the needed changes that emerged from our first series of hearings. I know that there will be others. They, as well as these, will have to be examined, debated and--where and when appropriate--adopted as part of a major overhaul. 
For these reasons, I object to the unanimous-consent request made by Senator Kerrey.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend from Nebraska that, as he knows, we are beginning to hold hearings on the important problems of reconstructing the IRS. I think that the House legislation is good legislation. It's a good beginning, but, frankly, it does not address all the problems that were uncovered in the hearings held by the Finance Committee a few weeks ago. 
We will proceed very expeditiously with the hearings on this matter. We will seek to respond to all of the problems that were raised in our hearings. We think it is important to strengthen the authority, that there is nothing more important to reorganizing and reforming the IRS than providing for independent oversight. 
So, while I think it is a good beginning in that action that was taken by the House, much remains to be done to reform the IRS in a manner that it will provide true service to the American taxpayers.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, at the outset of this debate I set out my reasons for supporting fast-track authority. Having heard the debate and the point made by my esteemed colleagues, I want to distill what, I believe today, our vote is about. 
First, I submit that the question before this body is whether we will shape our own economic future or leave our fate in the hands of others. We must decide whether we will allow the President to take a seat at the negotiating table or force him to stand outside the room while others write the rules for the international economy. 
A vote for fast track is a vote for a brighter American future. Toward that end, this bill arms the President with the authority to open foreign markets and allow our firms to do what they do better than anywhere else on Earth: That is, compete. 
Second, the making of trade policy must be a full partnership between Congress and the President. The bill before this House ensures that Congress is, in fact, a full partner in the process. Indeed, it is difficult to concede of any other measure where we subject the President's action to such scrutiny and constraints. The bill requires the President to notify us in advance of his intent to make use of this authority. He must then consult prior to and throughout the negotiations up to and including comprehensive consultations immediately before initialing an agreement. If the agreement is signed, we then proceed to develop the implementing legislation in consultation with the President. 
After all that, Congress still exercises a veto over the President's action by voting on the agreement and implementing bill. Those conditions are necessary to ensure the President fulfills the objectives set by Congress. They are also needed to ensure that Congress and the President do, in fact, speak with one voice on trade matters. 
I firmly believe that bill strengthens the role of Congress and the trade agreements process to an unprecedented extent and lets our trading partners know that the President is answerable to Congress for any agreement he may reach. 
Third, laying the foundation for our economic future will require a partnership here in Congress, as well. We will not make progress toward our common goal of providing for America's economic future without strong bipartisan support for our trade policy. 
I was extremely heartened by the vote yesterday and expect to see the same bipartisan support for the motion under consideration and for the bill itself. At the same time, the debate identified important issues that must be fully examined in order to sustain that bipartisan future. 
As chairman of the Finance Committee, I intend to ensure that the committee addresses those issues of critical importance to the well-being of every American. I look forward to working with my colleagues toward this end. Nonetheless, I believe we must take the first step now to exert the leadership on trade that only the United States can provide. The President must have fast-track negotiating authority. I urge my colleagues strongly to support the motion to proceed.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is unthinkable that the Senate would not revive the fast-track trade negotiation authority enjoyed by previous Presidents. 
Since its inception, the United States has been a trading state, and from the Jay treaty that ended the Revolutionary War to the Uruguay round agreements that established the World Trade Organization, we have, in the main, pursued a policy of free and open commerce with all nations. 
That legacy has helped bring us unrivaled prosperity. We are in the seventh year of sustained economic expansion, and during that same period, the United States has registered the greatest rise in industrial production of any developed nation, an increase over the last decade of 30 percent. 
It is no coincidence that our economic growth has taken place at a time when we have struck a series of international agreements that have sharply lowered barriers to American trade abroad. The opponents of trade and economic growth do not want you to hear that the United States has been a significant winner in those agreements. 
In the Uruguay round, we cut our tariffs an average of 2 percentage points, while trading partners cut theirs between 3 and 8 percent. 
In NAFTA, while we eliminated the average 2-percent tariff on Mexican imports, Mexico eliminated its 10-percent average tariffs, as well as a host of nontariff barriers that inhibited United States market access. 
That job is not done. In most developing countries which represent the markets of the future for U.S. goods and services, tariffs on many products range up to 30 percent and higher. Developed countries continue to maintain high barriers in sectors where the United States has a tremendous comparative advantage. In Europe, for example, tariffs on our dairy products exceed 100 percent. In Japan, the tariffs on United States dairy products exceed 300 percent, and tariffs on our wheat exports, most of it grown in Midwestern States such as North Dakota, remain above 150 percent. In other words, we have vastly more to gain from trade than we do to lose. 
Let's agree on this much: We cannot legislate reduction in foreign tariffs or market access. That has to be done at the negotiating table. For that, the President needs negotiating authority. Simply put, a vote for fast track recognizes the fact that today, more than ever, our economic well-being is tied to trade. 
Exports now generate one-third of all economic growth in the United States. Export jobs pay 10 to 15 percent more than the average wage. In the last 4 years alone, exports have created 1.7 million well-paying jobs and, by some estimates, as many as 11 million jobs, and this country now depends directly on exports. 
As a result, when asked why the Senate would extend fast-track authority to the President, I offered a very practical answer. In 1989, General Motors exported three automobiles to Mexico. This past year, the third full year after we reached a trade agreement with Mexico that many have criticized, General Motors exported over 60,000 vehicles. That amounts to $1.2 billion in sales and paychecks for workers in General Motors' facilities and those of their U.S. suppliers. 
I also explained that trade benefits all of us in many other ways. By producing more of what we are best at and trading for those goods in which we do not have a comparative advantage, we ensure that every working American has access to a wider array of higher quality goods at lower prices. In that respect, using the fast-track authority to liberalize trade acts just like a tax cut; we leave more of each consumer's paycheck in their pocket at the end of each month by ensuring that they get the highest quality goods at the lowest price. 
I think it is also worth underscoring that trade does not mean fewer jobs. By increasing the size of the economic pie, trade means more jobs and better pay, as the figures I noted attest. Higher wages depend on rising productivity, a growing economy and rising demand for labor. Each of those factors depend on expanding our access to foreign markets, and to expand our access to foreign markets, the President needs fast-track authority. 
I do not, therefore, view the question before this body as simply whether another, in a long line of bills, will pass. The question before this body is whether the United States will maintain its leadership role as the world's foremost economic power and assure our future economic prosperity. 
Some might ask why the United States should continue to bear that responsibility. The answer lies in our own history. It relates those times when we have forsaken our traditional policy of open commerce in favor of protectionism, as some would have us do now. 
The Smoot-Hawley tariff and the retaliation it engendered among our trading partners gravely deepened the Great Depression. Economic deprivation left citizens in many countries easy prey for the political movements that led directly to the Second World War. And it is worth remembering that the foundations of the current international trading system were built on the ashes of that great conflict. America led the way in establishing the current economic order as a means of ensuring that the trade policies of the past would not--and I emphasize would not--lead to similar devastating conflicts in the future. 
It was, in fact, the effects of the Smoot-Hawley tariff and the Depression that led to the original grant of tariff negotiating authority and the namesake of this bill: Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934. 
On the strength of that grant of negotiating authority, President Roosevelt and his Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a distinguished former Member of this body and a member of the Finance Committee, created the trade agreements programs that reversed the protectionist course of trade relations and laid the groundwork for the post-war economic order. Five decades and eight multilateral rounds of trade negotiations have helped us to build this burgeoning economy. 
The lessons of the postwar years are easy to forget. It is easy to forget that Congress' grant of trade negotiating authority to the President was one of the key components of our economic success, 
and led to reduction in tariffs among developed countries from an average of over 40 percent to just 6 percent at the end of the Uruguay Round. 
It is easy to forget that on the strength of those grants of negotiating authority, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike helped forge economic relationships with our allies that have seen us through the succeeding decades to the dawn of a new era. 
American firms and American workers now compete in a global marketplace for goods and services, and the economic future of each and every American now depends on our ability to meet that challenge. The changes we see in the marketplace and in our daily lives represent the benefits and costs of technological change. We should not make trade a scapegoat, as some do, for that process. 
Progress brings dislocation and requires adjustment. Indeed, with every expansion of our economy there are dislocations. This is an inevitable part of the economic process. Every expansion exposes inefficiency. 
At its most basic and personal level, economic progress occurs when an individual worker shifts from an inefficient way of doing things to a more efficient one, from stage coach driver, the original teamster, to railroad engineer, to truck driver, to pilot for an overnight air delivery system. 
Such transitions, of course, are not always easy. I firmly believe that the many who benefit from expanding trade and economic growth must help those who do not. But that adjustment is the inevitable effect of technological progress and economic growth, not the grant of fast-track authority. 
There are some who argue that the cost of these transitions is too high, that we are doing just fine economically without further trade agreements, and that there is no need for fast-track negotiating authority. My reply is simple and straightforward. We need fast-track authority now more than ever. Without the ability to take a seat at the negotiating table, we will be giving up the ability to shape our own economic destiny. If we leave it to others to write the rules for the new era of international competition, we will be leaving our economic future in their hands, and we will lose the ability to shape the rules of the new global economy to our liking. 
The evidence of that is already mounting. Our trading partners are proceeding without us and giving their firms a competitive advantage over American businesses in the process. Canada and Mexico have, for example, negotiated free-trade arrangements with Chile while we have debated the merits of fast track. And because Chilean tariffs average 11 percent, our firms now compete at an 11-percent disadvantage against Canadian and Mexican goods in the Chilean market. 
The same holds true more broadly in the rest of the rapidly growing markets of Latin America and Asia. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal described the efforts of European trade negotiation to steal a march on the United States and Latin America while the debate on fast-track authority continues here. 
There is even more at stake in upcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organization. We are scheduled to complete talks on opening foreign markets to our financial services, a sector in which the United States has a strong comparative advantage. 
Without fast-track authority, the President is unlikely to be able to conclude these terms or these talks on terms most favorable to the United States. In a little over a year, the World Trade Organization will once again take up the difficult and contentious issue of barriers to trade and agriculture. 
I know of no one in the agricultural sector who was entirely satisfied with the outcome of the Uruguay round talks. It is difficult, as a consequence, to conceive of a more harmful message to send our own agricultural community than derailing fast-track negotiating authority that will allow the United States to participate fully in those talks. 
Thus, we in this body face a simple choice--we can reject our heritage as the world's greatest trading state, or we can vindicate the faith of our forefathers and America's ability to compete anywhere in the world where the terms of competition are free and fair. We can focus only on the possible economic dislocations that occur when trade barriers are lowered, or we can look at the common good that results from economic growth. We can leave our economic fate in the hands of others, or we can step forward to shape our own economic destiny. 
For me, the choice is clear. We must move forward to maintain our economic leadership in the eyes of the world, as well as provide the fruits of an expanding economy to our citizens. Enacting the pending legislation is indeed essential to that effort. Our trading partners will not negotiate trade agreements with us unless we as a nation can speak with one voice. 
That is what this bill does. It allows two branches of the Government, the President and the Congress, to speak with one voice on trade. This bill creates a partnership between two branches that allows us to speak with one voice and does so to a degree greater than previous fast-track bills. 
As it has since the original grant of fast-track authority, Congress establishes the negotiating objectives that will guide the President's use of this authority. The negotiating objectives also serve as limits on the Executive, since the bill ensures that only agreements achieving the objectives set out in the bill will receive fast-track treatment. 
In that regard, I want to emphasize the effort we have made to ensure that the negotiating objectives restore the proper focus of the fast-track authority. This authority is granted for one reason alone, to allow the President to negotiate the reduction or elimination of barriers to U.S. trade. 
Authority granted in this bill is not designed to allow the President to rewrite the fundamental objectives of our domestic laws. Rather, the fast-track process applies solely to those limited instances in which legislation is needed to ensure that U.S. law conforms to our international obligations. 
There is one trade negotiating objective that has drawn particular attention. It relates to foreign government regulations. It includes labor and environmental rules that may impede U.S. exports and investments in order to provide a commercial advantage to locally produced goods and services. 
Indeed, in this provision is the concern that foreign governments might lower their labor, health and safety or environmental standards for the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports. I want to emphasize that this negotiating objective is limited to affecting conduct by foreign governments in these areas. It does not authorize the President to negotiate any change in U.S. labor, health, safety or environmental laws at either the Federal or State level, nor does it authorize a negotiation of any rules that would otherwise limit the autonomy of our Federal or State governments to set their own health, safety, labor or environmental standards as they see fit. 
I view these provisions of the bill as protecting everyone's interests in these areas. I know of no one who is an advocate of labor or environmental interests that would want the President to be able to negotiate international trade agreements that effectively weaken U.S. standards and then submit the implementing legislation on a fast-track basis. Under this bill, no President can negotiate an agreement that raises or lowers U.S. labor or environmental standards and then submit an implementing bill for consideration on a fast-track basis. 
Beyond setting the specific negotiating objectives, we have also strengthened Congress' role in the trade agreement process in several ways. 
First, we have ensured the right of the two committees of the Congress that have general trade jurisdiction to veto at the outset any negotiation that might ultimately rely on fast-track authority if those committees disagreed with the President's objective. This check on the Executive applies to all negotiations, not merely bilateral free trade negotiations as under prior law. The only exceptions are for negotiations already underway, such as financial services negotiations in the World Trade Organization, those anticipated with Chile. 
Second, the bill strengthens Congress' role and the partnership with the President by requiring greater consultation by our trade negotiators than has ever occurred in the past. 
The bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to consult closely and on a timely basis throughout the process and even immediately before the agreement is initialed. The bill obliges the President to explain the scope and terms of any proposed agreement, how the agreement would achieve the policy purposes and objectives set out in this bill, and whether implementing legislation on nontrade items would also be necessary since only trade provisions are entitled to fast-track treatment. 
Any nontrade items would be handled under the regular practices and procedures of the Senate, which allow for amendment and unlimited debate. Clearly, many in the Congress have been displeased in the past with cursory and nontimely consultation. The legislation in our report makes clear that this will no longer do. 
The bill provides an explicit provision allowing Congress to withdraw the fast-track procedures with respect to any agreement for which consultation has not been adequate. So not only does the legislation exhort the trade negotiators to consult; it provides sanctions if they do not adequately do so. 
Third, the bill carefully circumscribes the scope of the implementing legislation that can be considered under fast-track procedures. Basically, to qualify, the implementing legislation must be a trade bill. It must be limited to approving a trade agreement, which is defined to include only, one, reducing or eliminating duties and barriers and, two, prohibiting or limiting such duties or barriers. 
Moreover, the implementing legislation may only include provisions necessary to implement such trade agreement and provisions otherwise related to the implementation, enforcement, and adjustment to the efforts of such trade agreement that are directly related to trade. 
Examples of such provisions would include amendments to our antidumping laws and extensions of trade adjustment assistance such as those reauthorized with this bill. 
Finally, the implementing bill may include pay for provisions needed to comply with budget requirements. Since this component of the implementing legislation does not address the agreement and its implementation but is included only to satisfy interim budget requirements, some have suggested that this portion of the implementing legislation be fully amendable. 
The Finance Committee decided to follow previous fast-track legislation out of concern that allowing amendments to this portion would make passage of the implementing bill more difficult. There was concern about turning every implementing bill into a general tax bill, that pay for provisions might be offered by opponents to cause mischief, and that adopting amendments would create the need for conference with the House and would invite deadlock over nontrade issues. 
In sum, the terms of the partnership between Congress and the President are these: If the President adheres to the trade objectives expressed in the bill to which fast-track procedures apply, if he provides us an opportunity to disapprove of a specific negotiation at the outset, if he consults with us closely throughout the negotiation right up to the time the agreement is to be initialed, if the agreement is a trade agreement as defined in the bill, and if the implementing legislation contains only the trade-related items I noted, Congress agrees to allow an up-or-down bill after 30 hours of debate on the implementing legislation. 
Now, I think for Congress that is a very good deal. I fully appreciate the important role and responsibility this body has in American Government: The right to offer amendments, to debate the merits of an issue as long as necessary, are rights not to be laid aside lightly. That is why at every juncture we have sought to refocus the fast-track procedure on reducing trade barriers. 
We have done our best to make sure that matters of domestic policy remain outside the limited scope of the fast-track procedure. Such matters of domestic policy should and will remain subject to the traditional practices and procedures of the U.S. Senate. I would not support this limited exception to our Senate traditions were it not absolutely essential to our continued economic leadership around the world. This is a critically important accommodation. It is not unprecedented. Grants of similar authority for the President, in effect, exceptions to our Senate rules, have been provided in the past, dating back to the Trade Act of 1974. 
As recently as 1988 a Democrat-controlled Congress provided a Republican President the legal assurance that America would speak with one voice on trade. I hope that a similar spirit of bipartisanship envelops us today. 
Let me say in conclusion that if in 1988 my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do, for the good of this country, see fit to entrust a President from another party with this authority, that today it would help us in extending this authority to President Clinton. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as we consider the nomination of Charles O. Rossotti to become the new Commissioner of the IRS, it's appropriate that we pause to take a good look at that agency as a whole. Let me say from the beginning, that Mr. Rossotti--who came before the Finance Committee just a little over 1 week ago--is uniquely suited to this confirmation. I am impressed by him and his background. Mr. Rossotti is a successful businessman--in touch with the needs, concerns, and risk-taking mindset of entrepreneurs. He has made his mark as a management consultant and expert on computer systems--a vital background at a time when one of the agency's major setbacks is its dysfunctional information system. I intend to vote for Mr. Rossotti's confirmation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
Having said this, I also want to say something about the Internal Revenue Service and its current condition. September 23 to 25, the Finance Committee held what will be the first in a series of hearings to probe an agency that is cloaked in more secrecy than the FBI and the CIA. What we learned in our initial hearings was so disturbing that the IRS--its stories of abuses, mismanagement, lack of accountability and perverse incentives--continues to captivate the attention of taxpayers everywhere. 
As last month ended, the House Ways and Means Committee, with the support of the White House, moved legislation to restructure the IRS. Chairman Archer is to be commended for his work. I compliment him on the job he has done in reversing the White House's position on the issue. 
The growing effort to restructure and reform the IRS reflects the growing concern about the agency. Congressional switchboards have been inundated with calls from Americans who have their own tales of IRS-induced woe. Likewise, we have received thousands of letters, faxes, e-mails and notes--some of them hand delivered--each detailing another story of power run amok. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 21 percent of Americans report to have had some dealings with the IRS, in addition to simply filing their taxes. Of these Americans, a full 42 percent felt they were treated unfairly. Forty-two percent. And as if these statistics aren't compelling enough, the poll found that 70 percent of Americans believe that the incidents of abuse and mistreatment by the IRS that we uncovered in our hearings occur on a regular basis. 
Mr. President, our hearings, these statistics--and the growing consensus we're witnessing in Washington--make it clear that something must be done to rechart the course of this powerful agency. On the Tuesday following our hearings, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service held a joint press conference to introduce what has been called a list of mini-initiatives. These included: keeping offices and telephone lines open one Saturday a month to address taxpayer grievances; giving taxpayers `customer feedback surveys'; and, rewriting taxpayer notices in plain language. 
Beyond these reforms, the agency, itself, has suspended four IRS managers, demonstrating an increased awareness of the abuses disclosed in our three-day hearings. 
Each of these measures is a welcomed change. As Acting Commissioner Michael Dolan told the committee--that the IRS has made mistakes, handled taxpayer cases very badly, and caused Americans to suffer in ways they should not have. Acting Commissioner Dolan testified that the Internal Revenue Service has disrupted . . . lives without excuse. 
My concern, Mr. President, is that these initiatives--though welcomed--may still be insufficient to meet all the problems that affect the IRS. To understand how the Government can collect the necessary and proper amount of taxes in a way that does not harass, abuse or overly burden the American taxpayer will take a thorough examination--one that engages not only Congress, but the agency and the administration. 
Such a thorough examination will require 6103 authority--the authority granted to only two Members of Congress. Only by appropriately using that authority can we have a complete understanding of what must be done to properly restructure and reform the IRS. 
The hearings we held a few weeks ago were intended as a solid beginning in a process that must be comprehensive. It is likely that we will get only one shot at restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. We must make certain that reform legislation addresses all the problems that we are in the process of discovering. 
The problems--administratively and culturally--within the agency are the culmination of a history where power has been left unchecked, where objectives have been misapplied and priorities misplaced. They exist despite past reform efforts. And unless they are appropriately addressed this time around, they will continue to plague the agency. 
Despite past efforts at reform, Lord Acton's phrase about absolute power is still given frightening clarity in an agency that--as we have shown--resorts to unethical or illegal tactics in dealing with taxpayers. Our hearings showed how IRS employees use pseudonyms, despite the fact that they are prohibited according to the agency's manual. We showed how blue sky assessments are made against Americans--assessments that have no basis in fact or tax law. We showed how they are used to hurt the taxpayer, or simply to raise the individual statistics of an IRS employee. We showed how statistics and quotas are used to rate employees, despite the fact that such usage is strictly prohibited, and how levies and seizures are used to measure employee performance. 
We listened to heartbreaking testimony by courageous witnesses--private citizens whose lives have been torn apart by the IRS, as well as current employees of the agency who speak of horrific tactics and practices within the agency. One witness has disclosed how IRS abuse led to suicides, the break up of families, the destruction of businesses, and loss of financial credit and personal reputation. 
Employees testified concerning a culture of secrecy, vindictiveness, abuse, and retribution that exists within the agency, itself--often targeted against employees, themselves. And let me say here, Mr. President, the vast number of IRS employees are good, hard-working, honest men and women. Without the help of the employees themselves, our hearings would have been impossible. We discovered that IRS employees want change. They understand that change is necessary. They are performing an extremely difficult duty--an important duty--under extremely difficult circumstances. 
We heard of false allegations of wrongdoing against targeted employees. We learned about one senior agent who discovered an electronic listening device in the IRS employee break room, the area where agency employees are supposed to be able to relax and hold informal conversations. The room, Mr. President, had been bugged. Buttons were found under the desks of several IRS managers who were listening to their employees--violating their privacy. And as if this discovery wasn't bad enough, the senior agent who had discovered and reported the bugging devices was the one who was investigated. Our hearings, Mr. President, struck a chord with the American people. They struck a chord because Americans fear the IRS. It touches the life of every family--of every business. And our hearings struck a chord because Americans believe Congress is serious about reforming the agency--reform that must be thorough enough to address the problems that we are continuing to uncover. 
As I said when I opened the hearings, Congress has given the IRS awesome power in an effort to help the agency carry out its tremendous responsibility. In that Congress has given such power, it is also Congress' responsibility to ensure that it is being used prudently, constructively, and with regard for the taxpayer and employees of the agency. Working together, we must help the IRS get back to its mission statement--to collect the proper amount of tax revenue at the least cost; serve the public by continually improving the quality of our products and services; and perform in a manner warranting the highest degree of public confidence in [the IRS's] integrity, efficiency, and fairness.' 
Toward achieving this, we must answer three fundamental questions that I posed during the Committee hearings: 
First, does the IRS have too much power? 
Second, if Congress were to limit that power, what expectations do we have that the new limits will be more effective than the old limits? 
And, third, how do we go about changing the culture of the IRS? 
With the painful disclosures still lingering weeks after the hearings, I believe it is safe to say that we have an answer to the first question. The IRS does have too much power. The very manner by which seizures, liens, and levies can be imposed--often without due process, and the manner in which the agency has now been shown to abuse those methods of tax collection-- suggests that the IRS's power is beyond what would be considered necessary and prudent. 
Now, Mr. President, we must focus on the latter two questions: How can Congress effectively limit the agency's power while allowing it sufficient authority to carry out its important responsibility? And what can we do to change the culture of the IRS? 
As we turn our attention to these issues and consider possible legislative remedies, I want us to keep the following four criteria in mind: 
First, we must restructure the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS--like many Federal departments and agencies--was created in the industrial age. While its mission is necessary to collect the revenue Government needs to run legitimate programs and services, its organization, administration, and infrastructure must be engineered to meet the needs, demands and expectations of the information age. The IRS must be dedicated to service. It must be responsive to taxpayer needs and above political influence. 
Second, in restructuring the IRS, we must build into its system a mechanism that promotes accountability and continuous improvement. Our hearings raised serious problems about the lack of accountability of IRS employees. We found there to be little accountability for their actions--against taxpayers and internally, against employees of the agency. There is a need for a zero tolerance policy for improper and abusive behavior. There must be zero tolerance for failure to follow procedures and regulations. Accountability must also contain appropriate restraints on powers--especially the use of liens, levies and seizures--to assure that taxpayers are treated fairly. It must include a top to bottom review of employee evaluations, and make certain that such evaluations are not based on goals, quotas or statistics. There must be no promotion in spite of abusive behavior. And accountability certainly includes the ability to identify IRS employees. The IRS must include signatures on correspondence and do away with false identifications. 
Third, comprehensive reform must address the issue of due process for taxpayers. Our investigation and hearings disclose cases where innocent taxpayers had liens placed against their homes, where they had their automobiles seized and bank accounts frozen without notification or the right to appeal. Restructuring and reforming the agency must include strengthening and implementing fundamental procedures for due process, and those procedures must be followed to protect and serve the taxpayer. 
Fourth, and finally, reform and restructuring the IRS must result in more timely results for taxpayer problems. Our hearings showed that the IRS does not fix problems within a reasonable time frame. Change in this area must go beyond the systemic to embrace the culture within the IRS, as well. 
Just as in the private sector, an employee's promotion should be based on his or her ability to serve the client--to resolve problems, not create them--to assure that a fair and appropriate tax has been paid, and not to harass or intimidate the client into paying more than is due. 
These Mr. President are changes that can be made. Service must be the hallmark of the IRS. It is certainly the hallmark of America's finest corporations. Each day they become more effective and efficient, more service oriented and customer friendly. If they do not, they are quickly overtaken by other concerns, or they go out of business altogether. A mechanism that establishes self-sustaining improvement within the IRS is critical to the future of that agency. 
As I said during the hearings, just as the IRS is quick to say that no honest taxpayer should ever fear an agency audit, the IRS itself should never fear congressional oversight. Congress must continue its oversight. One discovery from our first series of hearings is that it was the first time the full Senate Finance Committee--which has IRS oversight authority--has ever held such hearings. Congress must be vigilant. Our current efforts must lay a foundation for systematic oversight. 
These four recommendations that have come immediately out of our hearings lay a strong foundation for the reform process. We have a consensus that something must be done. What we do must build on this momentum to assure that our effort at reform and restructuring is based on a complete understanding of the problems and necessary remedies. 
Toward this end, the Finance Committee will continue to investigate and hold hearings. When Congress returns next year, the Finance Committee will hold additional hearings and work to act on reform and restructuring that addresses all the problems and concerns disclosed thus far. We will work with the House, the President, and Commissioner Rossotti--once he's been confirmed--to ensure that not only is there a complete understanding of the challenges and problems currently plaguing the IRS. We must ensure that such efforts at restructuring and reforming are complete, workable, and effective in making this powerful agency more efficient, more service oriented, and less frightening to honest Americans. 
Mr. Rossotti has a background and the experience that will be invaluable in helping us bring about the kind of changes we believe are needed in the agency. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I assure my distinguished colleague I will be very brief. 
I want to point out that the hearings we held earlier this year were the result of the close cooperation between the minority side and majority side. I appreciate very much the full cooperation and assistance that the distinguished Senator from New York provided us. 
We look forward to bringing about reform that has nonpartisan support. I think the Senator is perfectly correct. It is not a Republican, it is not a Democratic, it is a nonpartisan solution that we seek. 
I have to say that I do think we are very fortunate in having a distinguished individual like Mr. Rossotti to be available. I think you made a very strong case as to why he should be confirmed because he has the very qualities and the very experience that I think are essential at this particular juncture. 
You talked about the layered lives within the IRS. Mr. Rossotti is, fortunately, an expert on management. He is an expert on high technology. As I understand, much of his experience is giving advice and consulting with large firms as to how to become more effective, more efficient. So I think you made the point very well. 
I think next year, I say to my distinguished friend and colleague, it is critically important that we begin some steps to simplify the Code. That is something I want to consult with you at the staff level because it is complex. It is going to be a multiyear effort. But there is no time better suited to start this than next year. I look forward to working with you on this important matter.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the respected historian and biographer, David McCullough, recently reminded us of the importance of education. Quoting John Adams, Professor McCullough wrote: `Laws for the . . . education of youth are so extremely wise and useful that to a humane and generous mind no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.' 
Today we consider a law that will go a long way toward helping parents provide educational opportunities for their children--a law that will benefit students, whether they attend public schools or private. 
This bill, which is sponsored by our distinguished colleague Senator Coverdell, and which has broad bipartisan support, expands the education savings IRA. It allows families to save up to $2,500 a year, and to use this money to pay for educational expenses for their children attending school, from kindergarten to 12th grade. 
This, as John Adams would say, is a wise bill. It is one that will go a long way toward helping our families meet the rising costs associated with schooling. It will go a long way toward helping our children receive quality educations. And it will pay dividends to America, itself, as these children--better educated and more prepared--become the parents, educators, scientists, businessmen, and businesswomen of tomorrow. 
Not too long ago, the Finance Committee held hearings to look into the rising costs associated with education, and the pressure those costs place on parents and families. What we found was rather alarming. Today, parents are under an enormous burden when it comes to paying for education. And the costs continue to rise. 
We designed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to help parents and students offset some of these costs. For example: 
We created an education savings IRA to allow parents to save for higher education. 
We expanded the tax-deferred treatment of State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans. 
We restored the tax deduction on student loan interest. 
And, we extended the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance. 
Each of these measures will go a long way toward helping our students and their families handle the burden associated with education. Personally, I would have liked to see stronger measures in each of these areas. The Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act actually contained stronger provisions, and I introduced them as a separate bill the very day that we passed the Taxpayer Relief Act. 
The legislation we're considering today--which Senator Coverdell has introduced in the Senate--is in keeping with the spirit and emphasis of our efforts. It expands the education savings IRA that we passed in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It allows the IRA to be used to help families finance school-related needs for their children beginning in their kindergarten years and covers them all the way through high school. It raises the yearly 
contribution amount from $500 to $2,500. 
It allows savings from the IRA to be used for both public and private schools. For example, money could be withdrawn to pay for tuition, fees and books for children attending private school. It could also be withdrawn to pay for computers, uniforms, instruments, books, supplies, and other educational needs for children in public schools. In addition, Mr. President, this expanded IRA can be used for children with special needs throughout their lives. 
This legislation does not engender a public versus private debate. It is fair and good for families and children who elect either form of education. It is focused on middle-income families--those who are most pinched by the rising costs of education. It provides these families with the tools they need to have the freedom to select whichever form of education they feel is best for their children. 
According to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the vast majority of withdrawn funds from these expanded IRAs will go for public school children. Over 10 million families with children in public schools will use these educational savings accounts, as opposed to a little over 2 million families with children in private schools. The expanded education savings IRA's are completely paid for, as revenue loss will be fully offset by repealing an abusive vacation and severance pay accrual technique. 
Again, Mr. President, this legislation has strong bipartisan support. It is good for families, good for children, and good for the future of America. It builds on the foundation we set with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It provides flexibility as well as opportunity, and it is a necessary step toward providing parents with the tools and resources they need to help their children prepare for the future.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senators Hagel, Thomas, John Kerry, and Akaka to introduce legislation that will grant normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China on a permanent basis when China accedes to the World Trade Organization. 
Today, President Jiang arrives in Washington for the first bilateral summit in 8 years. Exchange at the highest levels is critical to the maintenance of any of our important bilateral relationships. It is even more crucial in our relationship with the world's largest country, fastest growing economy, and most important rising power. 
Mr. President, this body has spent a great deal of energy debating United States policy toward China, cresting each year with the struggle over renewal of normal trade relations. I have always supported such renewal, and viewed the annual debate as a singularly unproductive means of moving the United States toward a coherent China policy. I say that because, besides regular high-level exchange, normal trade relations with China are essential to any coherent China policy, one that keeps our economy strong and engages Beijing in constructive reform. 
Currently, the United States is negotiating with China over the package of measures Beijing must implement to comply with the strict market-based rules of the World Trade Organization. Until the United States is satisfied with commitments from China on such issues as lower tariff levels and enhanced market access, and assured that Beijing can and will carry out those commitments, China will not gain entry to the WTO. 
The concessions China must make to gain United States approval are significant and will dramatically affect large segments of China's economy. The single most important economic benefit Beijing will derive from membership in the World Trade Organization is permanent normal trade relations--also known as most-favored-nation trading status--with every other WTO member. As a practical matter, however, every member economy of the World Trade Organization, except the United States, has already conferred on China permanent normal trade relations. Moreover, the United States has provided normal trade relations to China 1 year at a time for more than 15 years. However, until China is specifically removed from the limitations of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, Beijing cannot receive permanent normal trade relations from the United States, whatever China's status in the WTO. 
The resulting ambiguity over China's trade status with the United States hinders Beijing's willingness to make the significant concessions necessary to complete a commercially viable WTO accession package. A clear signal from the United States that China will, in fact, gain permanent normal trade relations upon its accession to the World Trade Organization will provide Beijing an incentive to make those concessions. 
Mr. President, it is crucial that we understand that China's membership in the WTO under commercially viable terms is wholly in the interest of the United States. That is because China will be forced to open its markets significantly to American trade and investment. And more fully open markets represent the best approach to reducing our current trade deficit with China. China's membership in the World Trade Organization will also make Beijing fully subject to the market-oriented disciplines of the WTO. Finally, our bilateral trade disputes with China will be subject to multilateral resolution mechanisms, in addition to the means we already have available under United States trade law. 
China is the world's 10th largest trading country. It is the largest economy not in the World Trade Organization. Regardless of its WTO status, China will have a major influence on the future development of the world trading system. I believe the time has come for Congress to recognize the importance of integrating China into the global economy. 
Our bilateral economic relationship is the most important means we have of integrating China fully into the world economy and the international political order. The United States is one of the top five sources of foreign investment in China. That investment is not limited to the special economic zones, but now takes place throughout China and across every major industry. Our businesses are linked in investment and in trading relationships that provide a vehicle for common effort and common understanding at the most practical and personal levels. 
China also represents a growing economic and political influence in a region of critical importance to the United States. The Asia-Pacific region now represents over 40 percent of world trade and 53 percent of world gross national product. Trans-Pacific trade is more than twice as large as trans-Atlantic trade. The Asia-Pacific region economies, including the United States and China, are becoming increasingly interdependent. The region now represents the largest market for United States exports--over $130 billion by some estimates. The predicate to our ability to encourage China to play a constructive role in the region is our willingness to redefine our bilateral economic relationship through the WTO accession process and the normalization of our trade relations under United States law.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation conference report. Due to a provision added in conference, the Treasury Department will be forced to reduce the Amtrak tax refund by $200 million. This conference report violates the budget agreement, amends the recently enacted tax bill, and unnecessarily straps Amtrak as it is facing a possible strike in the next few weeks. 
 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a strong Amtrak supporter, I find this action by the Appropriations Committee to be outrageous. 
As my colleagues in the Senate know, one of my top priorities has been to create a dedicated source of capital funding for Amtrak. Congress has voted time and time again that capital funding is critical to Amtrak's survival. For that reason, a tax provision was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to provide Amtrak with a tax refund of $2.3 billion for capital expenses. 
The bottom line is Amtrak desperately needs capital. According to GAO, Amtrak must have the capital funding that was provided in the Taxpayer Relief Act as well as what is provided through the normal appropriation's process. Without both Amtrak faces bankruptcy. 
The language the conferees included in the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation conference report would undermine the efforts Congress has already taken to give Amtrak the capital funding it needs to survive. 
 Mr. President, I fully intend to reverse this provision as soon as the next opportunity arises. It is a clear violation of the spirit and intent of the budget agreement and of the tax bill signed into law in August. If this is not reversed, I believe this provision may be the final straw that finally breaks the financial back of Amtrak.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, last week witnessed a crucial development in United States-Japan relations: the new guidelines for defense cooperation between the United States and Japan were promulgated. This development will require further action before it become meaningful, however, as the Japanese Diet must pass legislation to make the guidelines operational. 
The United States and Japan have maintained a strong and vital security relationship for a half century. Since 1960, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security has been at the center of that relationship. That treaty also forms the core of our overall security strategy for the Asia Pacific region. 
For historical reasons, and reasons having to do with constitutional interpretation, however, Japan's precise role in a regional crisis has been left largely undefined. With the end of the cold war and with raised tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the room for such ambiguity has narrowed significantly. A scenario in which American and Korean troops suffer casualties in a second Korean war while Japan debates what it could and could not do to assist in the effort would be a sure recipe for a collapse in the United States-Japan relationship. 
Therefore, I am pleased that the new defense guidelines provide us a clearer understanding of Japan's role in the event of a regional crisis. Still, Japan must enact authorizing legislation to implement the guidelines. In addition, I believe Japan should move to resolve problematic constitutional issues having to do with collective self-defense to ensure even greater clarity in the country's security role. As I often said, the drafters of Japan's Constitution held that the document in no way undermined Tokyo's ability to participate in regional security arrangements or U.N. activities.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the work of an unsung hero, a man whose unparalleled sense of duty to a free and democratic Poland contributed immeasurably not only to that country's freedom from Soviet domination but also to the security of the United States. I refer to Col. Ryszard Kuklinski. 
You see, during the height of the cold war, when NATO and Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces confronted each other in a divided Europe, Colonel Kuklinski risked his life to help free Poland from foreign oppression. 
This risk came in the form of over 35,000 pages of secret military documents he turned over to the United States Government, documents that detailed Soviet operational plans for surprise attacks on Western Europe, scenarios for a nuclear launch, specifications for more than 200 advanced Soviet weapons systems, and details of Soviet plans to impose Marshal law on Poland. His information was an invaluable asset to the West, and contributed immensely to the alliance's success in deterring Soviet aggression in Europe. 
Colonel Kuklinski asked for nothing in return for his information. Instead, he was forced to flee his country with his family when his actions were discovered by Soviet authorities sometime in 1981. 
After the Warsaw Pact realized what had happened after his departure from Poland, Colonel Kuklinski was issued in absentia a death sentence by a military tribunal. 
On Monday, the Polish Government--the government of a free and democratic Poland--took the step of dropping espionage charges against this hero and formally recognized that his actions served the highest interests of Poland. I commend the Polish Government and its military for taking this much needed step. 
I decided to raise the heroic story of Colonel Kuklinski for two reasons. First, to thank him and to express my admiration for the sacrifices he made for a free and democratic Poland. Second, as the Senate will soon be considering Poland's application for NATO membership, it is important to remember that Poland is not a former foe, but was once a captive nation whose people were ready to risk anything in order for their country to be free and to be full member of the transatlantic community of democracies.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Mr. Thomas, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Grams to a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Khmer Rouge and other participants in the Cambodian genocide should be brought to justice before an international tribunal. 
Just a couple of months ago, we witnessed the grotesque spectacle of a Khmer Rouge show trial of Pol Pot, the Leader of the Khmer Rouge during its genocidal reign in the 1970's. In July, Cambodian People's Party leader and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a bloody coup against the First Prime Minister and leader of the FUNCINPEC Party, Norodom Ranariddh. 
Hun Sen has claimed the coup was necessary because Norodom Ranaridhh was attempting to gain Khmer Rouge support for his party. 
Norodom Ranaridhh, on the other hand, has labeled Hun Sen's allegations a false pretext for the coup. Norodom Ranaridhh has also asserted that Hun Sen fears an international tribunal on the Cambodian genocide would implicate Hun Sen for atrocities he committed during his tenure as a senior Khmer Rouge official. 
Finally, troops loyal to Norodom Ranariddh now appear to have formed a military alliance with troops loyal to the Rhmer Rouge leadership, thus reinforcing the fears of the Cambodia people that the Khmer Rouge will use any means necessary to regain power. 
These events and the assertions of the two Prime Ministers demonstrate that while the Khmer Rouge have been weakened since the Paris Peace Accords of 1991, they remain central to the continuing conflict in Cambodia. Recent events also demonstrate that the objectives of bringing peace, democracy, national reconciliation, and the rule of law to Cambodia are likely to remain out of reach until the Khmer Rouge are brought to justice. 
What this resolution does, Mr. President, is make it clear that an international tribunal is essential if we are to achieve these objectives. It also points out that before the coup and before their allegations against one another about their respective involvement with the Khmer Rouge, Norodom Ranariddh and Run Sen wrote a joint letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asking for U.N. assistance in convening such a tribunal. 
We should take them up on their request because removing the Khmer Rouge as a military and political force in Cambodia is essential if we are to avoid another slide toward authoritarianism and war. I believe an international tribunal will also prevent the Khmer Rouge from succeeding in their transparent attempt to emerge as a legitimate political force in Cambodia. Indeed, at the show trial of Pol Pol they staged, the Khmer Rouge loudly proclaimed their support for liberal democracy. Other members of the Khmer Rouge have been promoting the National Solidarity Party to give Khmer Rouge a legitimate voice in Cambodian politics. 
According to the Yale Cambodian Genocide project, the principal organization documenting atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, such a tribunal `would soon return indictments against all or most of the current Khmer Rouge leadership. 
Mr. President, the Cambodian tragedy will never end until the Khmer Rouge are brought to justice. I offer this resolution to move us closer to that goal and to demonstrate this body's continued interest in the development of a free, democratic, and peaceful Cambodia.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the McCain amendment on graduate medical education, amendment No. 1091. I oppose it, although I am sure it is well-intentioned. I believe this amendment is not appropriate on this bill. I also believe the amendment is based on some misunderstandings. 
But first, as a general rule, I do oppose any amendments on appropriations bills designed or related to Medicare or any other matter that we dealt with in the Balanced Budget Act. Some of these amendments may seem noncontroversial or even desirable; however, it is simply not appropriate to begin loading up important appropriations legislation with amendments unrelated to the underlying bill. 
Let us remember the ink is hardly dry on the Balanced Budget Act. If we begin the process of reopening this legislation, I assure you there will be no end to other amendments. 
Many of these amendments will likely affect matters important to other Members and their States. 
Then there is the matter of good faith. A provision in the McCain amendment would strike a House provision we accepted in the conference on BBA. I am sure there are many Senate provisions the House would like to strike. 
Mr. President, I will briefly comment on the substance of the McCain amendment. The McCain amendment eliminates funding for a program that would provide assistance to teaching hospitals that voluntarily choose to downsize their residency programs. The funds provided through this program will partially cushion the financial losses teaching hospitals will incur as they reduce the number of doctors in training. 
Members should know that Medicare does not simply pay teaching hospitals for training but rather for care given to Medicare patients. These funds do not reimburse hospitals for doing nothing, as some claim. Far from it. Hospitals will use their funds to hire staff doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other personnel to replace the residents. These funds will also help teaching hospitals, often the Nation's best hospitals, to adjust to a highly competitive health care marketplace and develop alternate means of caring for vulnerable uninsured patients. 
One last point. The provision that the McCain amendment would strike saves at least $380 million in Medicare over the next 5 years, according to CBO. Let me emphasize this important point. Medicare will actually save money as we help the Nation's teaching hospitals. The McCain amendment would add to the deficit by almost $400 million because no offset is provided. 
Mr. President, once again, I urge Members to oppose the McCain amendment on graduate medical education. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I should now like to turn to Amendment 1076, offered by the Senator from Washington. I must oppose this amendment which alters the complexion of the newly created State children's health insurance program. The appropriations bill is simply not the vehicle for reopening the Balanced Budget Act. The amendment raised issues which should be addressed for all States, not just a few. Barely a month has passed since the bill was enacted. This is not the time to reopen the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, as reported out of the conference with the House, it is clear that the fundamental purpose of the new $24 billion children's health program is to expand health insurance coverage for children who do not presently have health insurance. 
Under the new children's health program, the Federal Government will increase its share of the cost of providing public insurance in some States by as much as 30 percent. This so-called enhanced match is to act as an incentive to expand coverage to more children. And, indeed, that is what we all expect will happen. 
At the same time, we do not want to simply shift new costs to the Federal Government to provide services to individuals who are already covered by insurance whether through the private sector or the public sector. Nor should these funds be used to merely supplant State funds. At the very least, we should try to minimize this from happening. 
As the Senate considered the children's health legislation over the summer, it limited eligibility to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Senate was gravely concerned, and rightly so, about the crowding out effect in which public insurance would replace private insurance. 
But States which had already expanded eligibility above 200 percent of poverty argued that they would not be able to use their new child health allotment because of this limitation. There would be no children to cover, they argued. 
In deference to those States, we agreed to raise the eligibility limit to 50 percentage points above a State's Medicaid standard in the conference with the House. We also provided States with options for participating in the program above their current levels. 
The Gorton amendment is not about States expanding coverage for children beyond their current commitment. It is about claiming additional Federal dollars to do what the States have already agreed to do. 
This is an important issue which should not be determined after a few minutes of debate on an appropriations bill. 
Furthermore, the amendment would create another inequity which should be carefully considered and addressed, if necessary. 
The Gorton amendment applies to only a handful of States which have previously expanded coverage to children. The Gorton amendment applies only to those States which have expanded Medicaid at least up to 200 percent of the poverty level and up to age 17. These States are to be congratulated for their leadership. But there are also at least 20 other States which have also expanded Medicaid eligibility, which would not gain the advantage extended by the Gorton amendment. 
While the amendment provides the enhanced match for total expansion, it does not provide the same advantage for those States which have made only a partial expansion. For example, a state which has expanded to 185 percent of the poverty level would not be eligible for the enhanced match for new children up to that level. 
Creating such inequities illustrates a fundamental problem with using the appropriations process for legislating in place of the authorizing committees. While perhaps a problem might be solved for a few States, that solution might create new inequities among several more States. 
If the policies in the new children's health program should be changed, then let us examine the issue in a thorough and complete manner which is equitable for all States. But we cannot and should not attempt to do so today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to express my sincere interest in establishing a Job Corps campus within my home State of Delaware. Today, the Senate considers legislation increasing our commitment to the Job Corps program--a program to educate and provide job training to youth at high risk of falling into government dependent or criminal lifestyles. Most of the young people who benefit from the Job Corps' services live at residential centers in their home States. In some cases, students enrolled in Job Corps can even commute from their homes. Currently, Delaware's young people do not have either of these options available to them. This situation potentially limits the number of my young constituents able to take advantage of the Job Corps, cutting off a path to self-reliance and a brighter future for many. 
My office has worked in concert with a host of Delaware's other elected and appointed officials on this issue. It is my hope that a small portion of the funding this legislation dedicates to this program can be used to begin establishment of a Delaware Job Corps facility. I applaud Senators Stevens and Specter for including an acknowledgement of our efforts to bring a Job Corps campus to Delaware in S. 1061's accompanying committee report. I look forward to working with the administration on this important matter.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
Mr. President, when the 105th Congress began, a promise was made to the American people. They were concerned about Washington's addiction to spending, and the high deficits that were a consequence of that spending. We promised to give them a balanced budget. They were overburdened by rising taxes. They had been shackled with a record-setting increase in 1992, and were paying more to government than they were for their own food, shelter, and clothing. We promised them relief. Our American families were concerned about the education of their children--about the rising costs of post-secondary schools, and their ability to help their children enter our colleges and universities to learn and to prepare for productive futures. We promised to make education more accessible. 
Young Americans, just out of school--many of them starting families--were finding it increasingly more difficult to buy a home. As a proportion of their income, they discovered that a mortgage today is twice as much as it was for their parents. Valiant small businessmen and -women were finding it increasingly more difficult to build successful companies. They had lost their home office deductions, the deductibility of their health insurance, and then--when their company, despite these and other challenges, proved successful--they had to fear losing it to death taxes. Again, we promised relief. We promised peace of mind to senior Americans who were worried about Medicare and its future. We promised to provide future generations the opportunity to become more self-sufficient through enhanced individual retirement accounts, and less dependent on government for their support in the years to come. And we promised that we would do something to increase health care coverage for America's children--for America's future. 
These, of course, Mr. President, were bold promises. For years, the Republican Party had advocated these measures, but in a city built on promises--the majority of which unfortunately go unfulfilled--it was reasonable that Americans felt that these, too, would remain empty. But today, Mr. President--today, we can say that these promises made, are promises kept. 
For the first time since 1969, Americans have a balanced budget--a balanced budget that will be realized within 5 years. For the first time in 16 years, Americans have real and meaningful tax relief. For the first time ever, our families will have tax-free education savings accounts, and for the first time in a decade, we are bringing back the student loan interest deduction. And these, Mr. President, are not our only firsts. We are allowing penalty-free withdrawals from IRA plans to make first-time home purchases. 
We are eliminating the capital gains taxes on $500,000 of gain for a couple that sells their home. We are strengthening and preserving Medicare by introducing choice and competition to that program. We are giving States greater flexibility and authority to administer Medicaid, and we are increasing health care coverage for millions of children. 
These are all firsts, Mr. President, but there is another first--one that is more philosophic in nature. For the first time since President Johnson's Great Society exploded the size and costs of Federal programs, Americans have a government that is focused on doing more with less. 
When historians look at what has been accomplished here these past few months, I believe our work will mark the beginning of a new era--an era which the Republicans have long promised and which President Clinton articulated when he said that the days of big government are behind us. 
This budget reconciliation package is a strong first step toward realizing that promise. It is a bipartisan effort--one that could not have been accomplished without a spirit of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, between the Senate and the House, and between Congress and the President. I'm proud of what we've accomplished. Members in both Houses of Congress, and on both sides of the aisle, have reason to be proud, as does Bill Clinton. 
Certainly, there are differences between the parties--those differences can be valuable in the battle of ideas. But this package represents a collective effort, an effort that is a far cry from the acrimony, Government shutdowns and the vetoes that attended past budget debates. I believe our work here demonstrates a coming together on fundamental issues. Taxes have been too high. 
They are still too high. In fact, as a percentage of our GNP, they haven't been higher than they are right now since 1960. Government has grown too big, become too inefficient, too overbearing and costly. Too much power has been taken from our people--from our States--and it's been centralized here in Washington. 
Yesterday we addressed the changes that will take place in Government programs--especially in entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid. We explained how this reconciliation package will deliver greater flexibility to the States for them to administer Medicaid in a more cost-effective, a more efficient manner. 
Today, we focus on the major tax provisions included in our plan, and how those provisions will provide relief for Americans of all ages--for our youth, going away to college, for our young families looking to buy their first home and raise their children, for older families running small businesses and preparing for retirement, and for those Americans who are already retired and looking to find comfort and security on fixed incomes. 
This reconciliation package provides relief for all of these. It includes a $500-per-child tax credit for families with children under the age of 17. The credit will be available to the working poor through an enhanced earned income credit. It will cover middle-class families, couples earning up to $110,000 a year. At $110,000 it will begin to phase out. And this tax relief will begin next year with a $400 per child credit in 1998, and the full $500 credit in 1999 and thereafter. 
We also provide relief to hard-working, middle-class Americans by enhancing the individual retirement account. We raise the income limits on traditional IRA's and create a new back-loaded IRA. In this back-loaded IRA, the contributions are not tax deductible, but the build-up and withdrawals are tax-free if the account is held for 5 years and the account holder is at least 59 1/2 . The income limits for the new back-loaded IRA will be $95,000 for singles and $150,000 for married couples. Our new IRA will allow penalty-free withdrawals for first-time home purchases. Another very important change to the IRA is that we allow homemakers--below certain family income--to save a full $2,000 annually in an account, regardless of their spouse's pension plan. 
Mr. President, I have worked for years to strengthen individual retirement accounts for working Americans. These changes will go a long way toward helping Americans prepare for retirement. They will encourage self-reliance and provide incentive for saving. 
This is, indeed, an idea whose time has come. It will be a blessing to countless Americans as they prepare for the future. And beyond helping individual families, these expanded IRS's will promote investment, capital formation and economic growth. 
Another important provision of this reconciliation package--one that will not only provide tax relief, but will, along with our IRA's, promote investment and jobs, is our capital gains tax cut. 
Here, we drop the top rate to 20 percent on investments that are held for at least 18 months. The rate will drop to 18 percent for assets purchased after 2000 and held for at least 5 years. For joint filers with incomes less than $41,200, the top capital gains rate will be 10 percent of assets held for at least 18 months, and 8 percent for assets held for at least 5 years. Our package does away with capital gains taxes on the sale of a home, as long as the home is $500,000 or less for joint filers and $250,000 or less for single filers. 
The benefit of capital gains tax relief will be felt not only by our families, but by America at large. According to economist Lawrence Kudlow, in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial,  
The budget's lower capital gains tax rate will help maintain U.S. global economic leadership in the 21st century. This is especially important in relation to the fast-growing economies of the Pacific rim, with China looming not far behind. Most of the Asian tigers have lower tax burdens on capital formation that the U.S. 
America, Mr. President, needs this capital gains tax relief. It is long overdue. 
However, the tax relief contained in this package does not end here. Families will also benefit by the way that this bill offers relief from the estate tax--the tax that can rob a family of its farm or business when a father or mother passes away. 
To help these families, we raise the unified credit to $1,000,000 per estate by 2006; and we provide tax-free treatment for family-owned farms and small businesses for up to $1.3 million. I can't overstate how important this estate tax relief will be to our families and small businesses. In 1995, delegates to a convention on small business survival, ranked killing the estate tax among the top five priorities on a list of 60 recommendations to the President. This is because many small business men and women fear the enterprises they have worked their lives to create won't be around to pass on to their children. The estate tax relief provided in this package offers a strong first step toward allaying that fear and providing families the protection they deserve. 
Beyond offering relief for estate taxes, this package also benefits America's small businesses by accelerating the phase in of the self-employed health insurance deduction, raising that deduction all the way to 100 percent, and by clarifying the deductibility of the home office business deduction. These, Mr. President, are important provisions. They will promote economic growth, jobs, and family security. They naturally complement the overarching objective of this legislation to provide immediate tax relief and to create conditions that will prepare America and Americans for a bright and prosperous future. 
Just how important this objective is can be seen by the fact that a full 80 percent of the tax relief we offer in this package is directed at the $500 credit for children and provisions that will promote education. These education-related measures will go a long way toward assisting students and their parents in affording the cost of post-secondary education. 
They include the Hope scholarship tax credit, a $2,500-per-year student loan interest deduction, and penalty-free withdrawal from IRA's. We can't overstate just how important these measures will be to American families, to America's students, and to our future. I had hoped that we could have gone even further in promoting the educational aspects of this bill. For example, I wanted to maintain a provision that would offer tax-free treatment for State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, a permanent extension of employer provided education assistance, and a comprehensive education IRA, but in these areas the White House was unwilling to compromise. 
And this brings up a point I would like to make--a point I touched upon yesterday. No one received everything they wanted with this package. That, Mr. President, is the nature of compromise. Another lesson we learn from compromise is that it tends to add complexity to the package under consideration. 
We learned how when you have three parties involved in the process--the Senate, the House, and the administration--each compromise made in negotiations rendered the final product that much more complex. 
Having said this, let me be clear that I am generally pleased by the outcome. Certainly, I could be more pleased. But the bipartisan effort that produced this reconciliation package is something to be appreciated. We accomplished what we set out to do. We provided tax relief for middle-income families; we provided tax relief to promote education; and, we provided tax relief that will stimulate economic growth, opportunity, and jobs. 
Let me show just how that relief will affect typical American families. When I first brought the Senate Finance Committee tax relief package to the floor--about 6 weeks ago--I introduced three hypothetical families from Delaware: a single mother named Judy Smith, a farming family--the Wilsons--and a young professional couple, John and Susan Jones. Let me show you how this package--in its final form--will benefit them: 
Let's begin with Judy. She has two young children and works as a legal secretary in Wilmington, making $35,000 a year. Currently she pays over $3,000 in Federal income taxes--over $3,000. When President Clinton signs this bill, Judy's taxes will be cut by $800 next year and by $1,000 the year after. Why? Because of the child tax credit. Judy will be able to spend that savings as she wants, or she can put it in an enhanced individual retirement account for her future. 
Jim and Julie Wilson, our farming family with three children and an income of $55,000, now pay over $5,500 in Federal income taxes. When President Clinton signs this bill, their taxes will be cut by $1,200 in 1998, and by $1,500 in 1999 and beyond, as they will receive $500 for each child. Julie Wilson will be able to set up a homemaker IRA to save for her retirement. Looking far ahead, if the farm prospers, Jim and Julie will be able to pass it on to their children free of the burden of the estate tax--all because of the middle-income tax relief contained in this bill. 
Finally, Mr. President, let's look at John and Susan Jones. They live and work in Dover, DE. College graduates, John is a veterinarian and Susan is a physical therapist. They make $75,000 and have one young child. Under current law, the Jones family pays about $11,500 in Federal income taxes. Because of this legislation, they will receive a $400 tax credit next year, and $500 each year thereafter. 
Susan will be able to take the home office business deduction, as her practice is located within their home, and she will be able to accelerate the phase-in of the self-employed health insurance deduction. John and Susan will also be able to deduct a portion of the interest on their student loans, and they'll be able to set up new back-loaded IRA accounts for their retirement. 
This is how our work will affect these three families, Mr. President. It will provide relief--much needed relief. As I have said, today the taxes paid by our families are higher as a percentage of GNP than they've been since 1960. This bipartisan tax relief effort will do something about that. It will provide relief as part of a budget reconciliation package that will lead our Nation to a balanced budget in 2002. Having said that, however, I want to add that I consider this only a beginning. Americans not only need tax relief; they need tax reform. They need tax reform that really does simplify the Tax Code. 
They need reform that focuses on fairness. They need reform that maintains and promotes strong economic growth--growth that will lead to continued job creation. And they need reform that promotes American exports and our competitiveness in the global economy. 
This is what we will turn our attention to next. And it is my hope that the same level of cooperation that sustained us in this debate will attend us as we move from tax relief to tax reform. I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been active, involved, and given to a spirit of willingness throughout this process. I am particularly grateful to Senator Moynihan--my friend and a thoughtful, well-esteemed leader. 
And again, Mr. President--as I did yesterday--I thank the professional, capable staff of the Senate Finance Committee for their countless hours and lost sleep. This was, indeed, a heroic effort. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Yes, I will be very brief. First of all, I just want to publicly recognize and thank Senator Moynihan for the role he has played. I think his statement today is another example of his towering intellect. We are very fortunate to have an individual who is renowned throughout this country for his ability to analyze, to study, and come up with constructive proposals. Certainly, we have all benefited from his rare intellect. 
I would just like to comment on two or three things that he spoke about in his opening remarks. First of all, I share the pride and satisfaction in our higher educational system. I have often thought there are few countries that have anything like ours. They may have one or two outstanding schools--Oxford and Cambridge in the British Isles; in Japan they have the University of Tokyo. But we have so many outstanding schools. My only criticism of what Senator Moynihan said is he failed to mention the University of Delaware which, I must confess, is really a hidden jewel. But I share the pride, and I think it is important that we do everything that we can to strengthen this, both the private and public sector, in these days where knowledge and technology is of even greater importance than any other time. 
I would also like to speak very briefly about Amtrak, because it seems to me we have our last clear chance to do something about it. I have to tell you that for the last several months, I have fought tooth and nail to try to bring about a solution. Mr. President, I cannot imagine the leading industrial nation of the world, the only superpower not having a modern passenger rail system. It is just unconscionable for that to happen, particularly in these times when we are running out of--I don't know about the State of New York, but I can tell you, in my little State of Delaware, we are running out of land. How many highways can we build? How many planes can fly over? What are we going to do about the environment? This is a critical matter, not only to the Northeast but to the entire country. 
I couldn't agree more with Senator Moynihan than when he calls upon the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Labor to provide some leadership. This can still be salvaged, it still can be saved, but it means that the parties that are involved and interested are going to have to get together and bring about the kind of reform that assures a sound future for our rail system. 
This, again I say, is our last clear chance. We have the funds in there. They are available. Now it is up to those who have the voice on reform to get together and compromise and work together, just as we did in our committee. 
I again express my appreciation to the distinguished Senator for his contributions and cooperation.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it's time to move beyond the tax and spend ways that for far too long have marked business-as-usual in Washington. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, as part of the budget reconciliation package, signals a new beginning for Congress--the beginning of a trend that puts Americans first. 
To argue that the tax relief contained in this package is too high--or that the cuts are too big--is to argue that government simply doesn't tax American families enough. This is absurd. Today, Americans are paying higher taxes, as a percentage of our gross national product, than they have since 1960. Today, American families are paying more in taxes than they are for food, clothing, and shelter combined. High taxes are forcing parents who would rather be at home with their children to work longer, or to hold down a second job. 
Many, who would rather be homemakers, are forced by high taxes to enter the labor market, as Americans are finding it impossible to support their families and the government on one salary. 
Despite all of this, we're hearing now that taxes aren't high enough. Well my question, Mr. President, is just how high is high enough? How much more would satisfy my colleagues? I'm afraid that Congress could tax 100 percent of all the wealth in America, and it still wouldn't be enough for those who refuse to change their tax and spend ways. 
You see, I come from another school of thought. I believe that the money Americans earn belongs to them. I believe our families know best what to do with their checkbooks. I believe that money earned by an individual belongs to the individual--that it does not belong to government--and that government is arrogant to assume that it can decide how much a hard-working man or woman can keep. 
You see, Mr. President, unlike my distinguished colleagues, my disagreement with this bill is exactly the opposite. My disagreement with this bill is that the tax relief contained within it doesn't go far enough. The tax cuts aren't deep enough. That's why I can assure those who are listening that we will be on this floor again, some time in the near future. We will be here addressing real tax reform--tax reform that is structured from the taxpayer's point of view. 
But for now, I'm willing to accept this compromise. It was crafted in a spirit of bipartisanship, with willing and cooperative leaders on both sides of the aisle. I will vote for this tax relief. But again, I assure you--I assure the American people--that this relief is only a first step in an effort that will continue--a bipartisan effort that will deliver the kind of tax reform Americans deserve. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my colleague's argument brings to mind a letter from a fellow Delawarean who reminded me of the wisdom of President Abraham Lincoln. 
Quoting our 16th President, Mr. Robert Hall, of Hockessin, DE, reminded me that: 
You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. * * * You cannot establish sound security by spending more than you earn. You cannot build character and courage by taking away man's initiative and independence. 
Only by keeping the economy strong can we balance the budget. And one certain way to strengthen the economy is to keep our burden of taxation reasonable, keep it at a level that provides initiative and incentives for risk-taking and thrift. History has proven that tax cuts stimulate economic growth. 
The Mellon tax cuts at the turn of the century created incredible prosperity for America. President Kennedy's cuts stimulated the economy in the 1960's, and in the 1980's, Kemp-Roth led to the longest peacetime economic expansion in history. Eighteen million new jobs were created, along with 4 million new businesses. Family income rose and homeownership boomed as interest rates and inflation fell. At the same time, Treasury revenues more than doubled, not because Americans were paying a higher percentage of their income to taxes, but because Americans had higher incomes. 
The truth is, Mr. President, that had Congress held the line on spending, the windfall to Treasury created by the Kemp-Roth tax cuts would have put a stake in the heart of the deficit. However, instead of controlling its appetite to spend--something we're trying earnestly to do, now, Congress shackled America with the 1990 tax increase. Then, 2 years later, President Clinton imposed the largest tax increase in history on Americans. 
With this package, we begin to reverse these trends, and history is on our side. A responsible tax cut will strengthen the power of an expanding economy for our families and Nation. 
At the moment, the average American family pays 40 percent of its income to taxes, and the current Federal system is counterproductive to economic growth. It double-taxes savings, thwarts investment, hinders productivity, increases prices, stifles wages, and hurts exports. It is complex and places disincentives on work. 
As chairman of the Finance Committee, I intend, to see this reconciliation package through, and then, in coming months, I intend to turn our attention to comprehensive tax reform. We will work for a fairer, simpler plan that does away with the negative consequences of the current system--a plan that encourages savings and promotes American exports. But first we must keep our promise of the tax cuts we've proposed for the American people. 
This legislation keeps that promise. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to waive all points of order against the bill that lie under section 313 of the Budget Act. I do so because I rise in opposition to this point of order. The provision in question was agreed to at the leadership level in the context of the budget negotiations, and I have to point out that if this point of order succeeds, it will delay the bill and, once again, Congress and the Senate, in particular, would send the wrong message to the American people. 
By delaying the action, if this point of order were to succeed, it would mean the legislation would have to be returned to the U.S. House of Representatives, acted upon there, before it could return here. I think that is a delay that the Senate does not seek to choose. 
I do not believe that we should delay this historic opportunity that is within our grasp and, for procedural reasons, I intend to vote against this point of order and urge my colleagues to do the same.

With grant funds, States, if they wish, may provide additional benefit coverage, but they must provide at least the coverage described in section 2103(a). For example, a State may supplement the benchmark-equivalent package of the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan for Federal employees by expanding vision, dental, and hearing services benefits.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns expressed by my distinguished colleague, but I feel that a little history will readily help us understand exactly why we have done what we have done with Amtrak. 
We are in complete agreement that Amtrak is in a serious financial crisis. 
It may not survive through next year, and according to the GAO, the most important measure Congress can take to help Amtrak through this crisis is to provide a stable capital funding source. 
In an effort to provide this funding, I introduced legislation that would have created a dedicated trust fund for Amtrak. 
This fund would have been financed by transferring one half-cent-per-gallon of the excise taxes imposed on all motor fuels currently going to the general fund to a new rail fund for Amtrak. This would have provided $2.3 billion in capital funding over the next 3 1/2 years. 
By a vote of 77 to 21, the Senate overwhelmingly approved this funding source. 
However, during the conference on the tax bill, the House conferees demanded that the secure funding source for Amtrak be contingent on a reform bill being enacted. And the House conferees demanded that the funding must be provided through the Tax Code in place of the reserve fund mechanism contained in the Senate-passed version of the tax bill. 
This is why the conference agreement now includes a tax refund for Amtrak. And while this is not my first preference in providing capital funding for Amtrak, it provides the necessary capital to keep Amtrak alive. The conference agreement gives Amtrak the benefit of electing no more than $2.3 billion in net operating losses over 2 years. 
Amtrak must use the benefit for capital expenses and provide a portion of this benefit for non-Amtrak States for their transportation related expenditures. 
This relief is based on the fact that Amtrak has incurred billions of dollars of losses as a result of inheriting revenue losing passenger rail service since its formation in 1971. 
The tax provision contained in the conference report merely provides the same type of tax relief that would have been available to its predecessor railroads had Amtrak not been formed in that year. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that Amtrak desperately needs this relief. 
The current path Washington is taking to address our transportation needs is to spend more money on highways and airports. In doing this, we must not overlook the vital importance of passenger rail. Last year Washington spent $20 billion for highways, while capital investment for Amtrak was less than $450 million. 
In relative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, transportation outlays for highways increased 73 percent, aviation increased 170 percent, and transportation outlays for rail went down by 62 percent. In terms of growth, between 1982 and 1992 highway spending grew by 5 percent, aviation by 10 percent, while rail decreased by 9 percent. 
The time has come to invest in our rail system. The money Amtrak needs to survive is in this tax bill, but it can't be spent until a reform bill is enacted. The bottom line is without a reform bill none of this money will be available to Amtrak. I have done my part, it is now time for all the parties to work together on a reform package. Without reforms, Amtrak won't have the resources it needs to survive. 
I just want to make it clear that we are about to have the last clear chance to save the American railroad passenger system. I point out that in the legislation there is a requirement that there must be reform. Make no mistake about that. But the fact is I think it would be a serious mistake that the greatest, sole superpower in the world does not have a passenger system. It is bad from the standpoint of transportation, it is bad from the standpoint of environment, and I hope that we are able to get the job done so that we have this modern, clean transportation. 
I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation package we have passed--and again, I congratulate my colleagues on such a tremendous bipartisan effort--that reconciliation package contains important measures to promote education. A full 80 percent of the tax relief we offered goes to a $500 credit for children and provisions that will promote education. 
As I mentioned in my statement, I strongly supported those measures to help our young people--to help our families--pay for college. These youth are our future, and investing in them is fundamental to keeping that future bright and prosperous. 
However, as I also mentioned earlier, I had hoped that we could have gone further in promoting the educational aspects of the tax relief bill. 
There were a number of very innovative and very effective provisions that were contained in the Senate Finance Committee bill, but that were excluded during the conference. 
For example, there was a provision to offer tax-free treatment for State-sponsored prepaid tuition plans. There was a provision for a permanent extension of employer provided education assistance. And there was also a comprehensive education IRA. Unfortunately, these were knocked out of the reconciliation package by the White House. 
What I want to do now, Mr. President, is introduce these measures as a bill--a bill that will expand education IRA's to permit families to invest up to $2,000 per year toward education. These IRA's would permit withdrawals for expenses incurred during elementary and secondary school. 
Second, this bill will allow employers to assist their employees' in their graduate and undergraduate education without the employees having that assistance taxed as income. 
It will expand State-sponsored prepaid tuition and savings programs to permit tax-free savings for educational needs. And finally, this bill will allow universities to develop prepaid tuition and savings programs that will permit tax-free savings for tuition, fees, book, school, supplies, room, and board. 
These are much needed tools to promote education. Over the past 15 years, tuition at a 4-year college has increased by 234 percent. The average student loan has increased by 367 percent. In contrast, median household income rose only 82 percent during this period, and the consumer price index only rose 74 percent. 
Our students--our families--need these resources to help them meet the costs and realize the opportunities of quality education. And I encourage my colleagues to support this effort.

Mr. ROTH. There are many people who are responsible for bringing together this important piece of legislation, and I strongly agree with what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico said about the Speaker and the majority leader. They provided not only strong leadership but ideas, were able to move ahead, and I have to say I could not agree more that the Speaker showed every ability of providing the kind of leadership we needed from the House in order to get this complex piece of legislation through. 
I would just like to say to my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Domenici, that the legislation would have gotten nowhere if it had not been for him. I know no one in the Senate, or House for that matter, that has a better understanding of the budgetary process, knows the issues with which we are dealing and who has devoted, what is it, 7 or 8 months' time to getting this job accomplished. 
I would also like to say in the same context I think Bill Hoagland has been a tremendous strength for this whole process. 
I, too, join the Senator in congratulating the ranking member, my colleague and friend from New Jersey, for his outstanding work.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation conference between the Senate and House has come to an end. All sides have weighed in. The process has been long and involved, around the clock, through the weekends. But I must say the result is well worth the exercise. 
What we have achieved is a balance, a carefully crafted compromise between the Senate and the House, between Republicans and Democrats, between Congress and the White House. I can say with certainty that no Senator, no Congressman, not even the President got everything he or she would have liked. Undoubtedly there are specifics in this final package that I would prefer to have seen written differently. But I can say that, while there were necessary compromises to achieve balance and to deliver the budget reconciliation to the American people, there was no compromise on principle. Differences? Certainly, but I cannot remember the last time I saw such a positive, bipartisan willingness to work together in a budget effort. 
This, I believe, is because there has been a profound change in the nature and character of Washington. Two recent proclamations demonstrate this change. The first was President Clinton's declaration in his State of the Union Address that the era of big Government is over. And the second came from our distinguished colleague, Senator Daschle, when, during this debate, he agreed that the question in Congress is no longer whether or not taxes should be cut, rather a question of how much they should be cut. 
Cutting taxes and achieving a balanced budget have long been Republican objectives. For years now, we have advocated the need to change the way Washington does business. Now President Clinton and the distinguished minority leader demonstrate the growing bipartisan consensus on these objectives, objectives that underscore this reconciliation package. 
It is a strong first step. It signals that the era of big government is over. Certainly government has its place. There are moral and contractual obligations that the Federal Government must maintain with the American people. Many are enumerated in the Constitution. Others, like Medicare and Medicaid, are more recent and have become critically important to those who depend on them now and to those who rely on them for the future. 
Having said this, I believe a clear and growing majority realizes that the Federal Government is not the answer to all that challenges us. In fact, in some cases, the Government is shown to be the problem, particularly when it comes to waste, fraud, abuse, inefficiency, and a top-heavy, unresponsive bureaucracy. The ability of both sides to compromise on this bill demonstrates that Washington acknowledges this reality and that Washington is responding to the attendant frustration and legitimate concerns felt by Americans everywhere. 
Beyond signaling an end to big and inefficient government, this package meets several other shared criteria. It places us squarely and honestly on the road to a balanced budget by the year 2002. We all know how important this is. The United States has not balanced a Federal budget since 1969. This, despite the fact that our Founders made it clear that saddling future generations with debt is immoral. According to Thomas Jefferson, the question of whether one generation has a right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. Jefferson said that we should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts; we are morally bound to pay those debts ourselves. 
This budget reconciliation package is the first in years that puts us back where we must be. It is balanced. It begins to address the dilemma of big government's licentious legacy, a legacy that burdens every man, woman, and child with almost $20,000 in public debt. I am happy to say that our majority leader, Senator Lott, made it clear at the beginning of the 105th Congress that balancing the budget in 5 years would be one of our top priorities. Mr. President, we have delivered on that promise. 
Our third objective has been to strengthen the programs that would be influenced by our actions. The reforms to entitlement that are contained in this package are, indeed, historic. We make significant and important changes to Medicare and Medicaid. We strengthen assistance to children. We return authority and means to our States so they can better meet the needs of their citizens. It was not enough to simply change entitlement programs to reduce their rate of growth. We sought in the process to improve, to strengthen them, to preserve them, and, again, we succeeded. 
Let me give you the specifics. But before I do that, let me reiterate that we were able to accomplish these significant objectives because of a growing consensus on both sides of the political aisle, and because of our willingness to compromise, compromise not on principles but for principles. 
In our effort to control spending, the largest program we addressed was Medicare. Our objective here was not just to control its spending, but to strengthen the Medicare Program for the long term, and we did this. We did this by increasing choice and competition within the program. Choice within the Medicare Program will give beneficiaries myriad options. It will allow them to participate in HMO's, PPO's, PSO's and private fee-for-service programs. We have based our expansion of choice in the Medicare Program on the successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Through these options, seniors will be able to obtain important benefits, like prescription drugs, that are not covered by traditional Medicare. 
These changes and the money they will save also allow us to expand Medicare coverage for certain important preventive services, including mammography, prostate colorectal screening, bone mass measurement, and diabetes management. Beyond increasing choice and competition within Medicare, we strengthen and preserve the program by slowing its rate of spending growth. Our measures save Medicare for another 10 years, while still increasing program spending per beneficiary from $5,500 this 
year to $6,800 in the year 2002. 
Beyond encouraging choice and competition, this bill introduces important innovations into the Medicare Program, innovations that could go a long way toward strengthening the program for future generations. 
One very important innovation is the creation of a demonstration project that will explore the advantages of having medical savings accounts available within the Medicare Program. This demonstration project will allow up to 390,000 Medicare beneficiaries to opt into an MSA program, a program that will allow them to choose a high-deductible Medicare choice plan. 
I believe medical savings accounts will be an important component of Medicare's long-term viability, and to study and recommend other innovations, our legislation creates a national bipartisan commission on the future of Medicare. Senator Moynihan and I called for this commission back in February as we realized that to realize long-term solutions for the program, we needed a commission that would be above politics. This will be a 17-member commission established for a little more than a year. Its task will be to make recommendations to Congress on actions necessary to ensure the long-term fiscal health of the Medicare Program. It will report back to Congress on March 1, 1999, and these changes to Medicare will result in a net savings of $115 billion over 5 years, savings that will not only help us balance the budget, but savings and reforms that will preserve the Medicare Program while ensuring that it continues to serve those who depend on it now. 
Concerning Medicaid, we were able to achieve a total savings of $13 billion. This savings will come largely from a reduction in disproportionate share, or DSH payments, and by giving our States more flexibility in how they run the program. 
For more than a decade, there has been a tug of war between the Federal Government and the States over Medicaid. Each side has tried to assert its will over the other. From the mid-1980's and through the early 1990's, the Federal Government imposed mandates on the States and, in turn, the States shifted costs to the Federal Government. The result was devastating to all of our budgets as Medicaid routinely grew at a double-digit pace, reaching as high as a 29-percent increase in 1992. 
This legislative package marks a new beginning, a new trend. It marks a change in the Washington mindset that has sought, since the days of the New Deal over 60 years ago, to centralize power in this city. With this substantive change in the Medicaid Program, we are offering our Governors the tools they need to control this program. This, I believe, is the way things should be done. 
With this bill, they will be able to move more individuals into managed care without waiting years for waivers from the Federal Government. They will be able to contract with selected provider for services. The States will be able to ask families to take some responsibility for the decisions they make when seeking health care services. This power at the State level will go a long ways toward stretching Government health care dollars. 
As I said, beyond making significant and important changes to Medicare and Medicaid, we have strengthened assistance to our children to meet the health care needs of the most vulnerable among us. It became clear through the conference that both sides of the aisle are equally committed to increasing access to health care for as many children as we can. Both sides of the aisle are committed to finding an answer to the problem of uninsured children in this country, and this legislation represents an important agreement in this area. It creates a new program, a program that covers low-income, uninsured children. The process of providing insurance and health care coverage to vulnerable American children is complex. As I have said before, of the 71 million children in the United States, more than 86 percent are already covered by some type of health insurance. Two-thirds of our children are covered by insurance through the private sector. Twenty-three percent of all children in the United States under age 18 are covered by Medicaid, and another 3 percent are covered by other public insurance programs. 
Our plan provides $24 billion over the next 5 years to be used by States in a manner that provides them flexibility in how they will expand health care coverage to our children. 
Our States will have two mechanisms of establishing programs. They can expand their Medicaid coverage or they can create their own program to address the particular needs of the children in their States. 
And while the Governors are given certain flexibility in the way they can use this money, our bill requires that they meet specific standards regarding health care coverage for children. 
Expanding Medicaid is certainly a choice States have made. Thirty-nine have expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children beyond the Federal requirements. But States are also developing other strategies for increasing coverage of children as well. There are already public-private partnerships in more than half of our States. There are successful programs such as New York's Child Health Plus and Florida's Healthy Kids. These innovative programs and programs like them can grow with these additional resources provided by this legislation. 
These, Mr. President, are the major provisions of this legislation. They signal a new beginning in Washington--real reforms to make programs more cost-effective, more efficient, more responsive to the needs of our people and our States. Great care has been taken to assure that the most vulnerable among us are protected, and this includes our provision to restore benefits to all legal noncitizens who were receiving Social Security when last year's welfare bill was signed into law. 
With this legislation, we also restore the ability to receive benefits to legal noncitizens who were residing in the United States as of that date should they become disabled in the future. These protections, however, are handled appropriately and in keeping with our overarching goal of restoring fiscal responsibility to Government. 
With this reconciliation package, we have establish the first balanced budget since 1969. We have met the criterion given us in the May 2d budget compromise, and we will give Americans the first real tax relief package that they have had in 16 years. 
Did we accomplish everything I would have liked to accomplish? No. I would have preferred to see some deeper, more significant fiscal restraint. I would have preferred to see a few other major reforms to Medicare, reforms that would have gone a long way toward strengthening the program, and these include the provisions that were in the original Senate package. 
But recall, Mr. President, the history of the balanced budget debate; recall Congress' effort in November 1995 to balance the budget by the year 2002; recall the consequent Government shutdown and Bill Clinton's veto; recall the President's 10-year balanced budget plan and Congress insisting that balance could be achieved 5 years earlier. 
Keep the history in mind, and the success of this legislation becomes clear. We have a balanced budget. That balanced budget will be achieved in 5 years, not 10. And we have achieved it without acrimony, without Government shutdowns, and without vetoes. 
This is a bipartisan effort. It is an excellent beginning. And I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work, for the spirit of cooperation that existed on the Finance Committee, on the floor of the Senate, and throughout the conference. 
I am especially grateful to my friend, Pat Moynihan, for his wise counsel, his leadership, and cooperation in helping to bring about the success of this package. I am also grateful to the professional staff members on the Senate Finance Committee, as well as the Senate Budget Committee.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to suspend the duty through December 31, 1999, on a product commonly known as ACM or [3-(Acetoxy)-3-cyanopropyl] methyl-phosphinic acid butylester, which falls under subheading 2931.00.90 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. ACM is an essential ingredient in the production of glufosinate ammonium, a patented nonselective, broad-spectrum herbicide, manufactured by AgrEvo USA under the brand name Liberty and used primarily in corn and soybean cultivation. 
The cost to import ACM currently comprises roughly 90 percent of the total cost of manufacturing glufosinate ammonium. Suspension of this duty will substantially lower AgrEvo's cost of production and thereby improve the company's competitiveness.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as the Senate moves toward concluding its business before the August recess, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the circumstances surrounding the Finance Committee's consideration of legislation to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. 
This vital agreement has already been the subject of a hearing in the Finance Committee in December 1995, and, in May 1996, the Committee voted unanimously in favor of the legislation to implement the Agreement. 
I understand my Finance Committee colleagues, Senators Lott and Breaux, have made substantial progress in resolving the controversial issues surrounding some parts of the legislation originally reported by the Finance Committee. I expect that their work on the implementing legislation and the resolution of certain procedural issues will be concluded shortly so that we can complete committee consideration and congressional passage of this bill as soon as possible after we return in September. 
I trust the other signatory countries to the Shipbuilding Agreement will understand that the recent delay in the Finance Committee's consideration of the implementing legislation was unavoidable--that it was simply a result of the committee's need to complete its work on the hallmark legislation to balance the U.S. budget and need to resolve certain parliamentary questions. This delay should in no way be interpreted as a lack of resolve to bring the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement implementing legislation to closure. 
I strongly urge other signatory countries not to take any action that might forever compromise our long-held goal of achieving free and fair trade in the global shipbuilding sector. It is my view that the United States is very close--closer than it has ever been--to enacting the legislation necessary for completion of U.S. ratification of the agreement. It would be terribly counterproductive and inappropriate for other signatory countries to abandon this important agreement at this juncture in reaction to this relatively minor and unavoidable delay. 
With that clarification, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee and in the Senate as a whole in moving this critical legislation forward to ultimate passage by Congress as quickly as possible.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we need to do something about our savings rates. Americans are saving less now than they did than at almost any time since World War II. The universal IRA Plus is our best bet to bolster our fledgling savings rate. In fact, expanding IRA's is the only prosaving provision in the budget. The universal IRA Plus account compliments the tax deductible IRA because it offers a long-term predictable savings program for millions of families with fluctuating incomes, and who do not have employer retirement plans. 
Senator Bingaman's chart is misleading because the taxpayer must be at least 59 1/2 years old before withdrawals are tax free. It is particularly important for the self-employed like farmers and young families who hopefully will be successful and grow out of the tax-deductible IRA into the IRA Plus. With all these advantages, the backloaded IRA must be included in the budget bill. Fifty-one Senators have cosponsored my super-IRA legislation and agree with me.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, at the completion of my remarks I yield 10 seconds to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. 
There is no truth that this has any impact on tax cuts. The important point to understand is that this point of order is to kill Amtrak. 
This is very important, both to Senator Moynihan and to myself. Passenger rail is extremely important to the entire country. What we have done is fully paid for. We do not ask for any special treatment. The rail fund is consistent with the budget resolution agreed to by both Chambers. It has the support of Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg. GAO has testified that Amtrak will not survive past 1998 without this crucial funding. 
We could not wait any longer. I first wanted to say, I therefore ask for your votes to this point of order.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Colorado on offering this amendment. It is unfortunate that I must vote against it. 
The Senator may not be aware of this, but in 1993 I introduced a bill that called for the indexing of capital assets. But today, we are not only dealing with economic issues, President Clinton has said he will veto any tax bill that includes indexing of capital gains. 
I have an article from last Thursday's Wall Street Journal. The title of the article is `Clinton Rules Out Indexing of Capital Gains in Tax Bill.' The first paragraph says the President `will not sign a tax bill that includes indexing of capital gains for inflation.' 
We have a historic opportunity today to deliver badly needed tax cuts to Americans. I would like to provide greater tax relief, but we cannot, and `half a loaf' is better than `no loaf.' 
So I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct. The committee thought it was appropriate to provide prospective application for the codification of standards which must be met for tax exemption. However, the committee expressly acknowledged the fact that a number of States had established entities that were operating as tax exempt organizations. The motivation for codifying the standards as part of the Internal Revenue Code was to help these entities and the Internal Revenue Service more easily apply the law. However, our report expressly states that tax exemption may be available to many such State-sponsored entities under present law and no interference was intended to be drawn from our action that the income of those entities was not already tax-exempt.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my colleagues and good friends who have been instrumental to the successful culmination of this important budget reconciliation process. I am gratified by the results. I think we have indeed made history. We have passed a reconciliation package that balances the budget, while offering American families their first real tax cut in 16 years. 
I am happy to say that we have done it in a bipartisan way. It never could have happened, in my humble judgment, without the good will, cooperation, and intelligence of the many Members who have contributed to this important piece of legislation. 
In the process, Mr. President, we have made significant progress in our ongoing efforts to preserve and strengthen the Medicare Program, a program of critical importance to our senior citizens, and to give State governments greater voice and authority in the administration of Medicaid. We have increased the ability of families and individuals to save their money, to become more self-reliant, and to invest in the future of America. We have passed significant proposals to help our youth and their families with their education. And we have saved who knows how many family small businesses and farms from extinction wrought by death taxes. 
We can go home during this Independent Day recess with our heads held high. We have done what our constituents sent us here to do. As I said, we have accomplished these important objectives in a bipartisan spirit. 
Mr. President, the Senate's success of the last few days would not have been possible without the leadership and example of my distinguished colleague and close friend, Senator Moynihan. He is a scholar, a statesman and--perhaps, most important--a gentleman and trusted friend. 
I appreciate the other Members of the Senate Finance Committee. It was interesting to watch the process as the cooperative spirit on that committee worked to refine and build rather than denigrate and destroy. The cream indeed rose to the top through our days, weeks, even months of hearings, conferences, meetings, and debates. I am proud of every member and, if time permitted, I would give specific examples of how each one of them rose to the challenge that has resulted in the success we produced today. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank, again, the many professional staff members whose work and expertise made this possible. No one appreciates these men and women more than those of us who watch their tireless efforts and depend on their support. Our gratitude to them as individuals, and for their work, is perhaps best demonstrated by the incredible trust we place in their judgment and by the way we depend on their advice and support. 
Particularly, Mr. President, among our professional staff, I would like to thank: 
Lindy Paull, Frank Polk, Mark Prater, Rosemary Becchi, Doug Fisher, Brig Gulya, Sam Olyck, Tom Roesser, Joan Woodward, Ashley Miller, Mark Patterson, Nick Giordano, Patricia McClanahan, Maury Passman, Bill Fant, David Podoff, and also Ken Kies and his capable staff at Joint Tax. 
These men and women, along with the leadership of the members on the Finance Committee, share in the tremendous success, a success for which I give them my most sincere thanks and a success, Mr. President, that will bless the lives of all Americans. 
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 949, the Tax Relief Act of 1997, and begin another lengthy series of rollcall votes. As previously ordered, the series of stacked rollcall votes will begin on or in relation to the Nickles amendment, followed by the Gramm amendment and the Kerry amendment. Following the disposition of the aforementioned stacked votes, the Senate will proceed to a vote on a number of process amendments under the control of Senator Domenici. After those amendments have been disposed of, Senators will have the right to offer an amendment to the bill, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the proposed amendment. 
However, it is hoped, and I would like to emphasize, that Members will refrain from offering amendments so that the Senate may complete action on this bill at a reasonable time.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the substitute amendment proposed by the distinguished minority leader. The proposal that passed the Senate Finance Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support is simply a better package. The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997 is fair, it is bipartisan, and, most importantly, it provides long overdue tax relief for middle-income families. 
It makes clear that the consensus which is, indeed, developing on Capitol Hill is that the days of big, intrusive, overbearing Government are coming to an end. I am, indeed, pleased by the work and cooperation exhibited by the members of our Finance Committee. Our bill contains the best thinking and the most workable policies from both sides of the political aisle. 
Mr. President, from the very beginning, I asked for ideas from all members of the Finance Committee, Republican and Democrat alike. We asked that they put their ideas in writing, and these were reviewed carefully and many incorporated into the initial draft. Again and again, we consulted with each other, met informally and discussed, and I can say I think the end product, our bill, was, indeed, the best thinking and most workable policies from both sides of the political aisle, and I might add, as well, from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, because we carefully reviewed and considered the proposals of the White House as well as those of the Congress. 
It was put together constructively with an eye to providing American families the tax relief they need to encourage education, something that everybody wants for their children, and, most importantly, creating economic conditions that will promote jobs, opportunity, and growth for all the American people. Finally, let me point out the Finance Committee proposal meets the guidelines of the budget agreement. 
The substitute amendment introduced by the distinguished minority leader today is not, in my humble opinion, a reflection of the growing consensus and bipartisan spirit that is reflected in the Finance Committee proposal. And it contains several major flaws which I would like to address. It does not--and I emphasize the word `not'--provide immediate tax relief for middle-class American families. 
It does not. Again, I emphasize the word `not,' it does not effectively address the need to promote and improve educational opportunities for American youths. It does not promote meaningful savings, investment, economic growth. 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said that the most important need of this country is to encourage savings, savings on the part of the American people. I regret that the substitute amendment was not drafted in such a way that draws the best each party has to offer in the debate over tax relief. 
Let me address each of these concerns a little more specifically. A major distinction between the child credit in the proposed Daschle amendment and the Finance Committee bill is the way the credit is phased out. The minority leader's amendment would phase the child credit out over a fixed dollar amount. The way he does this, families earning over $70,000 would actually see an increase in their share of the tax burden. While these families under current law have a marginal tax rate of 28 percent, Senator Daschle's amendment would increase their rate up to 41 percent. That is a tax increase, not tax relief. 
Beyond this, the Senate Finance Committee child credit gives a larger credit sooner, whereas the minority leader's credit phases in over time. Let's ask the American families, which one do they prefer? 
Another major concern that I have with the minority leader's amendment is that it makes the child tax credit refundable. In other words, individuals who pay no income tax will receive a check from the Government. The Senate Finance Committee, in a bipartisan effort, considered and rejected the idea of making the credit refundable. Even the credit included in the administration's budget proposal was nonrefundable. Frankly, there are, indeed, very, very serious compliance problems associated with trying to administer a refundable tax credit. This was shown clearly by the administration in the package of reform proposals they released earlier this year to address fraud and error rates with respect to the Earned Income Tax Credit program. Frankly, it has been estimated that the fraud and error in that program is as high as 20 percent. It is obvious from the performance of IRS in this area that they are not equipped, at least at this stage, to administer a refundable program, at least another one, since they are already having such difficulties with the one already on the books. Our tax system works much more effectively when we reduce the amount of taxes people have to pay, rather than when the Government tries to give money back to Americans. 
These are just a few of my concerns with the Daschle amendment regarding the child tax credit. There are other major concerns with this alternative proposal. For example, concerning education, the minority leader's alternative will result in tuition inflation, the last thing parents need. The education tax proposals contained in the Finance Committee tax bill represent the very best ideas from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. In studying the administration's HOPE scholarship tax credit, frankly the Finance Committee was very concerned about tuition inflation. In the past 15 years, college tuition has increased 234 percent--234 percent. For this reason, we carefully, and again in bipartisan cooperation, Republicans and Democrats working together, crafted a proposal that will help keep tuition costs down. The Finance Committee proposal provides a 50-percent tax credit for the first $3,000 of tuition expenses; 75 percent of the first $2,000 of tuition expenses for students attending a community college. This will not encourage tuition inflation. 
I cannot emphasize too much the importance of discouraging tuition inflation. In the Finance Committee we had a number of hearings where young people came and testified about the problem they had in paying for college tuition and expenses. One young lady, who was the daughter of a single parent, put herself through dental school with the help of her mother, and ended her college with a debt of something like $90,000. There is something wrong when our hard-working young students have to end their college careers and start their adult careers with that kind of debt overhanging them. So I cannot emphasize too much the importance of discouraging tuition inflation. 
In addition to the HOPE scholarship tax credit and the education tax proposals contained in the Finance Committee bill, our design is to help families through all stages of education. These proposals include a permanent extension of employer-provided education assistance for undergraduate and graduate education. This is a proposal that has long been endorsed, sponsored jointly by my distinguished colleague Senator Moynihan and myself. Our proposals include a student loan interest deduction as well as tax-free savings for graduate and undergraduate education. Our proposal also provides penalty-free IRA withdrawals for postsecondary and graduate education, a deduction for teacher training course work, a repeal of the tax exempt bond cap for new construction projects, and it helps in the construction of elementary and secondary school building. 
As I have said, the educational proposals in the Finance Committee bill were crafted carefully. They had strong support 
on both sides of the political aisle as well as throughout the education community. A letter I received from the Association of American Universities and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities demonstrates this strong support. In part, that letter reads:  
The higher education related tax provisions being considered by the Senate Finance Committee will make higher education more accessible for undergraduate and graduate students. 
Let me repeat that. The Association of American Universities and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities wrote the committee that our education-related tax proposals `will make higher education more accessible for undergraduate and graduate students.' And it goes on to say it will `help ensure that the Nation has the highly educated, well trained work force it will need for the 21st century.' 
Speaking of the 21st century, an analysis of the alternative plan introduced by my distinguished colleague, Senator Daschle, shows it does not contain nearly the kind of policies that are needed to keep America's economy strong. The incentives to save and invest that are contained in the Finance Committee bill are seriously weakened if not abandoned in the Daschle alternative. In the area of capital gains, for example, the Finance Committee tax relief bill was a bipartisan measure that passed by the overwhelming majority of 18 to 2. It received this broad support because of its fairness and the understanding by Members on both sides of the aisle that America needs capital for a bright and prosperous future. 
The capital gains proposal in the Finance Committee bill is fair. According to recent IRS statistics, about 13.2 million individual taxpayers reported capital gains in 1994. Over 11 million of these taxpayers had gross incomes of less than $100,000, and over 7 million had incomes of less than $50,000. In other words, 50 percent of individuals with capital gains had incomes of less than 50,000 and reducing the capital gains tax to 20 percent will represent a real and significant tax break for millions of middle-income taxpayers. 
It will create capital formation for jobs, opportunity and growth, most important objectives for the future. This, after all, remains our objective. It reflects what the American people have asked us to do. I am proud of the way Members of the Senate have come together from the right and from the left to give their best efforts to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Let us not undermine such a positive consensus with an amendment that does not reflect the bipartisan spirit we achieved with the Finance Committee legislation. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that the Daschle amendment does not--does not spell relief. The incentives to save and invest that are contained in the Finance Committee bill are seriously weakened, if not abandoned, in the Daschle alternative. 
Let me say in conclusion, again, that we urge the Senate to reject the Daschle amendment and support the Senate Finance Committee bill which was endorsed by a vote of 18 to 2. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

<DOCNO>105-roth-de-14-19970626</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment includes the $8 billion additional funds for the children's health initiative. As we have discussed earlier, the children's health initiative is a critical piece of the legislation before the Senate. Members on both sides of the aisle, both ends of the political spectrum, and everyone in between are committed to addressing the issue of reaching our Nation's children. 
Each morning, more than 10 million children wake to face a day without health insurance. Clearly, this situation has weighed heavily upon us. 
Throughout the first quarter of the 105th session of Congress, a number of Members have contributed to various proposals for reaching these children. I thank all my colleagues for their hard work and effort. At this hour, we have now reached a bipartisan agreement on the structure of how to help the States reach more of these uninsured children. Now that we have a structure, we must also ensure that it is adequately funded. 
The committee amendment will provide an additional $8 billion for the children's health initiative, will secure that final necessary piece to make this bipartisan agreement work. Some Members may argue that $16 billion is too much money for the children's health initiative. Other Members will argue that $24 billion is not enough. The Finance Committee, which has carefully considered this issue, has agreed on a bipartisan basis that it is just right, and with this committee amendment we will inject $24 billion into reaching the goal of providing health insurance to more children. 
Let me remind my colleagues that the States will also be required to provide matching funds. So the total amount will rise even higher. Of the 10 million children without health insurance, about 60 percent are either eligible to be enrolled into the Medicaid Program or they live in families with incomes about 250 percent of the poverty level. For a family of four, that is more than $40,000. 
We do not, of course, want to displace the role of the private sector in providing health insurance for children. So this new initiative is really meant to be targeted for those approximately 3.8 million children who live in families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to pay for private insurance. The committee amendment will ensure that there are sufficient funds to meet the goal of reaching these children, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the Finance Committee provisions on this critical issue.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment that is offered by my good friend and colleague from North Dakota, but I do first want to commend him for his perseverance on this issue. I know it is a matter of great interest to him, a matter that he feels very strongly about. As he said in yesterday's statement, he has been sponsoring this type of legislation for many years. 
Mr. President, I must oppose this amendment for several reasons. First of all, let me point out that the principle purpose for reducing the capital gains tax is to encourage more investment. In this competitive world of today and in this global economy, it is critically important that we make the best utilization of the capital we have so that we are in a strong competitive position. A lower capital gains tax will encourage greater investment. It will encourage better utilization of our assets. 
Why would we want to impose some kind of arbitrary limit that will have the effect of limiting investments? We are trying to free up hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars to the best investment available to help ensure that we are creating in this country an environment of growth, jobs, and opportunity. 
Let me just look at this matter from another point of view; from the standpoint of small business. I know my distinguished friend from North Dakota is, indeed, a friend of small business. The tax laws currently provide a 50 percent capital gains exclusion from investments in qualifying small business stock. Currently, the tax laws provide that an investor who has gained from qualifying small business stock can exclude up to $10 million of capital gains from a single investment--10 times more than the $1 million cap. I understand that in the Democratic substitute amendment that is ultimately going to be offered, it is provided that we should double this limit; this $10 million limit should become $20 million from a single investment. So the question I must ask my friends on the other side of the aisle who argue a $20 million capital gains exclusion is appropriate from a single small business investment yet, at the same time, argue to limit capital gains from all other investments to only $1 million over a taxpayer's lifetime--the two provisions are totally inconsistent, in my judgment they make no sense, and I hope the Senate will agree with my concern. 
Let me make one further observation. This amendment also raises some very significant administrative problems. Under the amendment, individuals will have to keep track of all their investment gains, not for 1 year, not for 5 years or 10 years, but for decades--a tremendously burdensome matter. Think of how this amendment would affect the Internal Revenue Service. I doubt the IRS has adequate resources to administer the voluminous information that would have to be maintained if this amendment becomes law. It would be an administrative nightmare for the IRS to have to try to enforce this provision. 
But let me go back to the first point which I think is most important, that the reason we are reducing the capital gains tax is to encourage more investment. To try to limit it to $1 million makes no sense and is in conflict with the basic purpose of the agreement that was reached by the Senate Finance Committee. It makes no sense. It is inconsistent with the provisions now contained in the law for small business stock, which can be excluded for up to $10 million of capital gains; and, as I already pointed out, it is proposed in the so-called Democratic substitute that this limit be doubled to $20 million. 
So I oppose this legislation and hope the Senate agrees with this opposition. 
Mr. President, at this time I am happy to yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Utah.

Mr. ROTH. Yes, I am happy to explain to my distinguished friend from West Virginia. It includes two Medicare hospital-related provisions. The first is a modification to the Medicare PPS, exempt hospital payments, and the second is a hospital wage index classification. 
The second makes three additions to the Medicaid provisions. These include a Grassley amendment that was adopted in committee on the effect of managed care on individuals with special needs, a clarification on the definition of provider taxes, and continuation of certain 1115 waivers. There are four provisions on welfare, clarification of the language on SSI, and Medicaid benefits of certain Indians. It makes a conforming amendment on work activities, and it confirms the maintenance-of-effort requirement to the existing welfare block grant. It also requires that half of the payments for job placement be provided after an individual has been placed in the work force for at least 6 months. 
Finally, the modification to the managers' amendment also modifies the formula for achieving savings in the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program. The amendment provides a smoother transition for the States and delays the restrictions on payment to mental health facilities. 
As I said, Mr. President, all these amendments have been cleared by both sides of the aisle. I urge their adoption.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, if I may say so, I am encouraged very greatly by the news that the Senator from New Mexico will stay as long as possible, as does our distinguished friend and leader from West Virginia. 
I say to my good friend from West Virginia, as he well knows, in every major piece of legislation there are a lot of 
technicalities and complexities involved in the legislation. In the efforts to draft them and put them in final shape, it becomes necessary to have a number of technical modifications at the end. 
I would also say that in developing this legislation, it has been my intention to work with everyone, both in committee and on the floor. We have tried to include everybody--Republican, Democrats, senior Members, and junior Members. 
So I think the process has been all-inclusive. Basically, what we have here in the so-called managers' amendment is sort of a cleanup of a number of matters that had to be modified to make them technically correct to take care in some cases of some of the concerns of individual Members. Each of these have been reviewed very carefully by the technicians who understand it. 
I think part of the problem is that these are very complex matters that aren't easy to explain or even to understand. But let me point out, for example, that in the managers' amendment, the first section that deals with what is known as `PPS-exempt' hospital changes, it deals with technical changes as to how they are reimbursed. 
For example, the first says strike the update formula and substitute with a zero; update for fiscal years 1998, 2001, and market basket, minus 3 percent in 2002. 
In trying to reach the $115 billion savings that we are supposed to make in Medicare, we reduce payments to the providers. Normally the reimbursement each year reflects the cost-of-living or inflation. But in this particular case, in order to make savings and because the hospitals are doing reasonably well, we are reducing the reimbursement. 
It is that kind of technical change that much of this deals with. 
In another situation, we are--again in efforts to save money--reducing what is known as disproportion payment and we have based the recommendations on what an independent commission has recommended, and I might say that is what the administration has recommended as well. These, again, are all basically very technical. 
But going back to the reduction of the disproportion, because both Democrat and Republican Members were concerned about reducing as much as was recommended by this independent board, we have slowed that phase-in a little bit to make it easier for those organizations to adjust. 
So essentially I would say it is this kind of technical change that we are trying to deal with here rather than major policy. 
I assure you that we have dealt with both managers--the Republican manager, the Democrat, and, of course, I might say that we have been working very closely with my good friend and colleague, Pat Moynihan.

Mr. ROTH. So I don't have any disagreement with our distinguished friend and leader as to the whole process, but we have in good faith tried to deal with the process and meet the time schedules that everybody has wanted us to achieve. 
I could go on and read all of these, if you like, sir. But I will say they are highly technical. 
The first one, I might point out, included two Medicare hospital-related provisions. As I said, the first is a modification as to how we reimburse what are called Medicare PPS-exempt hospitals. A PPS hospital is paid on a prospective payment basis. That was a means that was adopted many years ago to try to gain better control of expenditures than you have when you have cost reimbursements. The hospital knows that for a certain kind of function, they will be able to receive so much money--say, $1,000. And they know they have to live within that. So they have an incentive to try to keep those costs down. But now we are cutting because we have to make greater savings. The hospitals, according to our independent panel, are doing relatively well, and we are trying to cut it more. 
The second is a hospital wage index classification and reimbursement. We deal or address the wage index, and a highly technical modification takes place there. 
So, as I say, they are this kind of technical change basically in an effort to make legislative language accurate and achieve the goals that were intended by the policy.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object to the amendment. We are transferring, over 7 years, home health care to part B, but we want to do it in seven segments because it is agreed that the beneficiaries should continue to pay 25 percent of the cost of the part B services. We do not want to put it all over the first year because we do not want to raise the premiums that rapidly. 
So in order to be consistent, what we provide in the legislation is that the home health care will be transferred over 7 years. Each year an additional seventh will be included in the cost of the premium, so that will make the phasein much lower.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, earlier this month I read an article by Dana Mack, a mother and the author of a new book, `The Assault on Parenthood: How Our Culture Undermines the Family.' It was powerfully persuasive. Her thesis was that parents today love their families as much as, if not more than, ever--that today's parents are attentive and even more committed than those of an earlier generation but that they are pressed economically. 
In her studies, Ms. Mack discovered that the most serious challenges faced by parents today are economic challenges. 
Listen to her statistics. It costs the average American couple today twice--twice--the proportion of their yearly household income to pay the mortgage than it cost their parents; average Federal income payroll taxes rose from 2 percent of family earnings in 1950 to 24 percent in 1990; health costs have skyrocketed in the past 20 years, sending 4 to 5 million women to work for medical insurance alone. 
Consider these statistics along with the one that has been repeated often in the debate over real tax relief--that American families pay more in taxes than they do for food, clothing, and shelter combined--and it becomes apparent how important this Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is. Tax relief is no longer a partisan issue, and I was encouraged by the spirited cooperation that was exhibited in the Senate Finance Committee as we deliberated and then reported this bipartisan bill out of committee. 
Such a bipartisan effort allows me to stand on the floor and say without hype or hyperbole that today is, indeed, a historic day. It is historic because this proposal is truly bipartisan, and, as a consequence, Americans can look forward to their first significant tax cut in 16 years. It is historic because the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is part of a budget reconciliation that will lead our Nation to a balanced budget in 2002. 
And because of our efforts to ensure bipartisan cooperation, the Finance Committee bill we consider today contains a balanced and fair package of tax relief measures. It includes proposals important to both Democrats and Republicans, and it is structured to provide major tax relief--relief to America's hard working and overburdened families. 
There were three criteria that guided our work. We wanted tax relief for middle-income families, tax relief to promote education, and tax relief to stimulate economic growth, opportunity, and jobs. 
With these objectives in mind, we crafted a bill that includes a $500 per child tax credit, and an increase in the exemption amount for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, a provision that will save millions of middle-income families from experiencing the headaches of AMT. 
We crafted a bill that contains tax measures to assist students and their parents in affording the cost of postsecondary education. These include the $1,500 Hope scholarship tax credit, a $2,500 student loan interest deduction, and a permanent extension of the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational assistance. 
We also included the tax-free treatment of State-sponsored prepaid tuition assistance plans, a new education IRA serving both education and retirement needs, tax incentives for teacher training and school construction, and a repeal of the tax exempt bond cap. 
To promote savings, investment, and economic growth, we expanded IRA's. We did this by doubling the income limits on the tax deductible IRA so that more families can set up an IRA. We expanded the spousal IRA. For the first time, homemakers will be able to save up to $2,000 annually regardless of their spouse's participation, in an employer pension plan. And we also created a new nondeductible IRA Plus account. A very important part of this IRA Plus is that it will allow penalty-free withdrawals for first-time home purchases and periods of long-term unemployment. And to promote investment and jobs we included a capital gains tax cut, dropping the top rate to 20 percent. This will create new incentives for venture capital. 
For families, this bill offers relief from the estate tax, the tax that can rob a family of its farm or business when a father or mother passes away. To help these families, we raise the unified credit to $1 million per estate by 2006, and we provide tax-free treatment for family-owned farms and businesses for up to $1 million. 
Each of these is an important step, Mr. President. The fact that these were included in a bipartisan proposal indicates that business as usual is changing in Washington. The Senate is willing to lay aside partisan politics to provide Americans with the kind of tax relief they need. 
As with any bipartisan effort, not everyone will be fully satisfied with this proposal. For my part, I would like to see greater tax relief, and I consider this the first in a series of steps that I hope will lead to deeper tax cuts and eventual long-term reform. But this bipartisan effort signals an important beginning, one which is built upon a foundation of 
principles we share, whether we be Republican or Democrat. 
Eighty-two percent of this tax relief is made up by our family tax cut and education assistance, priorities that we all share. As I have said, it represents the biggest tax cut in 16 years, tax relief that is focused on middle-income families. 
But beyond these major tax cuts, our proposal contains a number of important smaller items. These include the extension of certain expiring tax provisions. For example, we extend the R&D tax credit, a credit that helps our exporters compete in world markets to maintain our leading edge in several key industries. 
We make the orphan drug credit permanent and allow for contributions of full value of appreciated stock to charitable foundations. We also extend and expand the work opportunity tax credit to assist welfare recipients and others in getting jobs. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contains a package of measures to help the District of Columbia get on its feet, including a reduced capital gains tax rate and a first-time homebuyer tax credit. It contains a guaranteed and secure source of funding for Amtrak to enable our national rail passenger system to move to privatization. And it also has a measure allowing taxpayers to expense the cost of cleaning up brownfields, as well as several measures to help taxpayers who have been victims of floods in the Upper Midwest. And finally, we offer tax simplification in the pension, individual, foreign, and small business areas. 
Mr. President, this package includes several revenue raisers that partially offset the cost of the tax cut. The most prominent is an extension and improvement of the funding stream for our national aviation system and a 20-cent tax on cigarettes. Beyond these, we close loopholes in the foreign tax area, as well as in the area of corporate-owned life insurance and tax shelter reporting. 
I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the spirit of bipartisanship that prevailed as we crafted this tax relief package. It has been a successful, productive experience because we have worked together, taking the recommendations and concerns of each member of the Finance Committee, as well as the recommendations of our colleagues outside of the committee, and we have put together a package that is workable, a package that will go a long ways toward offering relief, especially to America's overburdened middle class. 
Now, I realize that in the course of debating this proposal in the Chamber there will be those who stand against this bipartisan bill. In a partisan effort, there will be those who attack this tax relief bill. Before they begin their arguments, however, I want to put them on notice. I want them to understand that the lion's share of the tax package--82 percent--goes for the family tax credit and the education package. Eighty-two percent is directed to middle-income families. 
I want them to understand that according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, at least three-quarters or 75 percent goes to families making $75,000 or less, and at least 90 percent goes to families making $100,000 or less. 
These are the facts, and they are understood on both sides of the aisle. They are understood by those who believe that the time has come to provide real, meaningful tax relief to hard-working families that have been overburdened for too long. 
They are understood by those who realize, as President Clinton has said, that the era of big Government is over and now Washington must promote an environment where the genius of enterprise and the market economy can sustain long-term economic growth and bring jobs and security to families everywhere. 
I began my remarks by quoting an article that highlights the economic strain placed on families today, and let me close by using three hypothetical Delaware families and show how the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 will benefit each of them. 
Let's begin with a single mother whom we will call Judy Smith. Judy has two young children. She works as a legal secretary in Wilmington making $35,000 a year. Currently, she pays over $3,000 in Federal income taxes--over $3,000. Now, to put that into perspective, $3,000 is what her family of three will pay all year to buy the food they eat at home. In other words, Judy's paying the Federal Government what it costs to feed her family. 
Now, when the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 becomes law, Judy's taxes will be cut by $1,000--$500 for each child. A third of her Federal tax liability will be gone. And what can Judy do with that extra $1,000? 
I am sure she can think of a number of good uses, but if she wants--again thanks to the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997--Judy will be able to set up education IRA's for her two children. 
The second hypothetical family I want to introduce you to is a married couple, Jim and Julie Wilson. The Wilsons own a farm in Sussex County. They have three children. Jim works the farm and Julie is a homemaker. They earn $55,000 per year from their farm. Of that $55,000, they pay over $5,500 in Federal income taxes--fifty-five hundred dollars. That, Mr. President, is more than they will pay for all the food they consume at home during the year. After the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997, however, the Wilson's taxes will be cut by $1,500--$500 for each child. Julie Wilson will be able to set up a homemaker IRA to save for her retirement. 
If Delaware adopts a State-sponsored prepaid tuition plan, the Wilsons will be able to participate in the plan and save for their children's college education. Looking far ahead, if the farm prospers, Jim and Julie will be able to pass it on to their children free of the burden of the estate tax. All of these benefits to this middle-income family are contained in the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997. 
Finally, Mr. President, let's look at a young two income couple. We'll call then John and Susan Jones. They live and work in Dover, DE. College graduates, John is a veterinarian and Susan is a physical therapist. They make $75,000 and have one young child. Under current law, the Jones family pays about $11,500 in Federal income taxes. After we pass the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997, the Jones will be able to deduct a portion of the interest on their student loans. They will receive the $500 per child tax credit, and they will be able to set up IRA Plus accounts for themselves and an education IRA for their child. 
It is for families like these that we have created the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997. It is because of its fairness that this bill received strong bipartisan support in committee. I believe the Finance Committee fairly reflects the Senate as a whole--as well as the broad interests and concerns of the constituents our Members represent. This is their package. It delivers to the American people what they asked us to do in the last election--a bipartisan and fair return of the fiscal dividend accruing from a balanced budget. 
I am grateful to all who worked so long as so well to draft this bill. I am grateful for Senator Moynihan's leadership, as well as for the other members of the committee who allowed bipartisan cooperation to prevail throughout the process. And again, Mr. President--as I did yesterday--I thank the professional capable staff of the Senate Finance Committee for their countless hours and lost sleep. This was, indeed, an heroic effort, and it is my honor to bring it to the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment would strike the $5 coinsurance payment, and I think that would be a mistake. Let me start out by pointing out that home health care has exploded in cost over the recent years. It has been a serious problem that this particular aspect of Medicare has become extraordinarily expensive. 
As I said yesterday, according to the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, which is commonly called PROPAC, Medicare spending on home health services was only 1 percent of Medicare spending in 1968. By 1996, Medicare spending on home health care had increased to 14 percent of Medicare part A spending. In other words, it had gone from 1 percent to 14 percent. This is an increase that cannot be permitted in a program that is in financial difficulty. 
As we all know, Medicare is an extraordinarily successful program in providing health care to senior citizens. But we do face a serious problem with respect both to part A and part B if we do not bring the cost of these programs under control. As is well understood, part A will be in bankruptcy by 2001. If we don't correct it, it will be in debt to the tune of one-half 
trillion dollars by 2007. And we face the same kind of serious problems with part B. Part B--it is predicted--will increase in cost roughly 8 percent a year in the coming year. So we have to bring these costs under control, and that is what we are seeking to do. 
As I said, home health care has exploded in cost. Just let me point out what has happened to the cost of this part of the program in the last several years. From 1989 to 1990, the cost went up 53 percent--in 1 year, the cost of home health care went up 53 percent. The pattern has been a little better since then. In 1990-91, it went up 44 percent; in 1991-92, 40 percent; in 1992-93, 30 percent; in 1993-94, it went up 30 percent; and in 1994-95, it went up 19 percent. 
Now, the reason home health care has exploded is because there are no adequate controls. For example, there has been a major increase in the number of beneficiaries using home health care. There has been an increase in the number of visits per beneficiary. I must also say that there has been a tremendous increase in the number of agencies providing home health care, and the Medicare payment system does not control the utilization of home care. 
So that is the nub of the problem. There is no reason for the beneficiaries to be concerned as to how they utilize this program because there are no copayments in the part B program, as there are in others. Let me point out that the cost growth of home care, due to the increase in visits per beneficiary, has indeed been very substantial. In 1983, 45 Medicare enrollees--let me put it this way. There were 45 Medicare enrollees per thousand that used this program, an average annual of 28 visits. This was in 1983. In 1995, the number of Medicare enrollees per thousand jumped to 97--that is, from 45 to 97--and they used this program for an annual of 70 visits. That is 70 visits as compared with 28 visits in 1983. 
So the question is, Why has the utilization of Medicare's home health benefit grown so rapidly? Essentially, there are two factors explaining the growth. First, the home health benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, for all practical purposes, have been unlimited since 1980. Prior to 1980, home health benefits were limited to 100 visits per beneficiary per year following a hospitalization. But in 1989, as a result of an agreement reached in a class action suit, Dougan versus Bowen, virtually all regulatory limitations on coverage were eliminated. And even today, based on Dougan, a beneficiary only needs to be homebound and under the supervision of a physician in order to receive home health care. 
Now, the cost growth in home care is partly due to the Medicare cost-based payment system. Medicare pays home care companies the cost of each home care visit up to a per visit cost limit. Medicare does not limit the total number of home care visits. 
And the cost results are predictable. There is a great incentive for agencies to get into the business. That is one of the reasons we see the explosion of the number of agencies now in the home health care business. 
Medicare payments per visit are estimated to have increased by 1.6 percent from 1993 and 1994, and the total number of Medicaid certified home health care agencies grew in 1991-95 by 52 percent from 5,949 agencies in 1991 to a total of 9,040 in 1995. 
So, Mr. President, this is the reason it was felt necessary that there be a copayment on the part of the beneficiary so that there is more prudent use of this care than has taken place in recent years. 
Beginning in 1998, financing for the home health benefits will begin to be transferred from the part A to the part B trust fund. This will establish 100 visits--after the hospital stay--for home health benefits under part A with all other visits considered part of a new part B home health benefit. Consistent with Medicare's treatment of other part B services, the mark establishes cost-sharing for part B home health service at $5 per visit billable on a monthly basis, and capped at an amount equal to the annual hospital deductible. 
I point out to my colleagues that creating this copayment is consistent with the way we handle part B. As a general rule, there is copayment of roughly 20 percent for services under part B. Five dollars per visit is substantially less than 20 percent. But it means that as beneficiaries utilize home health care they are going to be more careful in its utilization. 
Beneficiaries, I point out with respect to those who are under 100 percent of Federal poverty, will not have to pay this $5 copayment fee. They will not have to pay this copayment fee because it will be covered by Medicaid. Our Medicaid Program has been structured to protect the poor and impoverished. And under that program he or she who is under 100 percent of Federal poverty will be covered by Medicaid. So there will be no payment of the $5 fee by those who are impoverished under Federal standards.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I said, the purpose of the $5 copayment fee is to bring some balance into this program. 
I obviously cannot support the Kennedy amendment. I do not believe that the home health care copayment is a barrier to care nor that it is unreasonable. 
As I have already pointed out, from 1988 to 1996, spending on home health care grew an average of 37 percent per year. That is a growth that cannot be sustained if we are going to maintain Medicare as a program not only for those on it now but for the future. Medicare is going bankrupt. And this rate of growth is without question unsustainable. I cannot say too loud nor too clear that we need to assure that Medicare is preserved and protected. It is our responsibility to make certain that costs do not run out of control. 
Under current law, all Medicare benefits, except for home health and laboratory services, are subject to some form of beneficiary cost-sharing. Let me reemphasize that. Under current law, all Medicare benefits, except home health and laboratory services, are subject to some form of beneficiary cost-sharing. 
The $5 home health copay will have beneficiary share--in some degree, financial responsibility for services with the program. Five dollars is not an unreasonable amount to ask beneficiaries to pay for a visit. 
The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, which advises Congress on Medicare policy, supports--I underscore the word `supports'--a modest beneficiary copay subject to an annual limit. That is exactly what this bill proposes to do. 
I also point out that a report recently issued by the Commonwealth Fund supports the idea of a $5 copay. The report claims there is a sensible approach--a sensible approach which would make beneficiaries sensitive to use but not form a barrier to care. That is exactly what we want. We want this program to be used on a prudent basis; a sensible basis. But, of course, we do not want it to be a barrier to those who need this form of care. 
As I have already indicated, those who cannot afford the $5 copay, those who are under 100 percent of Federal poverty, will be covered by Medicaid. They will not have to pay the $5 copay. Medicaid will pay it. 
So they are protected. Beneficiaries will not have to pay any copay for the first 100 home health cares after a hospital stay. Only those visits in excess of 100, or that do not follow a hospitalization, will have a copay. And the amount is limited every year to the hospital deductible, which is what 
beneficiaries who have home health after a hospital stay would have to pay the hospital. 
Mr. President, this is a modest proposal where according to the Congressional Budget Office only about one-third of home health users--that is about 1.2 million beneficiaries--are likely to be subject to more than $100 in copays in a year. And only about 11 percent of home health users--that is roughly 380,000 beneficiaries--are likely to reach the annual cap. 
The copay for home health is not an untested idea. Until 1972, Medicare required a 20-percent copay for all part B home health visits. During health care reform, President Clinton's Health Security Act included a 20-percent copay on home health care. 
So the proposal that we have in the legislation before us is far more modest. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
Mr. President, I asked for a waiver because I oppose the point of order on the age of eligibility in the bill. What we are proposing to do is to make the age of eligibility for Medicare conform with Social Security. 
The age of eligibility will change from 65 to 67, which will be phased in over a 24-year period beginning in 2003 and ending in 2027. This is a very, very modest approach to an extremely serious problem. What we are concerned about is the solvency of Medicare. The solvency of Medicare is of critical importance as part A is seen going bankrupt by the year 2001. By the year 2007, if we do not make significant change, the program is at a loss of one-half trillion dollar. What we are seeking to do here, by making the age of eligibility for Medicare reform conform with Social Security, is to take a modest step forward to assure the solvency of this most important program. 
The bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare will be required to analyze and report back the feasibility of allowing individuals between age 62 and Medicare eligibility the option to buy into Medicare. As I said, our provision will help us extend solvency in the program. It is, I think, the very least we should do. The average life expectancy for a man or a woman over age 65 has been steadily improving. People are living longer, they are leading more vibrant lives, and this means that changing the eligibility age for Medicare will follow our natural demographic progression. In fact, around the time Medicare was enacted, the average life expectancy for men at age 65 was about 13 years, for women about 16 years. In 2030, when this provision is fully phased in, average life expectancy at age 65 for men is anticipated to be about 17 years, and 20.5 years for women. This is a very modest step to bring about significant reform. It is critically important that we show that we have the courage to take these steps on behalf, not only of our senior citizens of today, but the increasing number that will join this group in 2010 and later. 
It is, in a way, very ironic that a point of order was made on this matter, because while it is true that it will not have a significant impact on revenue in the early years because of the very, very compassionate way we are introducing changing the age of eligibility, the fact is that this very modest approach will do a very, very great deal in the long term in helping the solvency of this program. 
I cannot emphasize too much the importance of this change. As I pointed out, it merely conforms to what already has taken place in respect to Social Security. It is a change that will make the program significantly more solvent in the long term, and I hope the Senate will assure that this language continues as part of the agreement. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as you can imagine, drafting a piece of legislation this large in such a short timeframe and having to incorporate over 50 amendments resulted in some technical errors and omissions. The items contained in this amendment are those which are technical in nature, and replace inadvertent omissions or are necessary to bring the legislation into compliance with the committee's budget instructions. 
The amendments accepted or adopted in the committee markup were done so with the proviso they would not bring the committee out of compliance with its instruction. 
Therefore, now that the Congressional Budget Office has completed scoring of the entire package, certain revisions to these amendments are necessary. A description of the items contained in this amendment is located on each Senator's desk. 
I ask this amendment be adopted and be considered original text for the purpose of amendment. 
The question is on agreeing to the amendment. 
The amendment (No. 431) was agreed to.

<TEXT>
Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I was saying, regarding the income-related premium, the amendment would reduce the Federal subsidy of part B premiums for some seniors. Today, the Federal Government pays 75 percent of the cost of the part B program and Medicare beneficiaries pay just 25 percent. The Federal Government funds part B, which is a voluntary program, and pays for such things as doctors' bills out of general tax revenues which are raised from all taxpayers, rich, poor, and middle income. This amendment would require those single seniors with incomes of $50,000, to pay a bit more for part B; single seniors with incomes over $100,000 paying all of their share of part B costs. 
The corresponding income range for couples would be $75,000 to $125,000. But, even under this proposed increase, the cost of participation in part B will remain relatively modest. Next year, it would cost a senior with an income of $100,000, paying his or her entire share of part B costs, an additional $1,620. The savings from this amendment would go into part A trust fund, helping to ensure its continuing solvency. In addition, the amendment would provide premium assistance for more low-income 
seniors. Today, for poorest seniors, those individuals with incomes below 120 percent of poverty, part B premiums are paid by Medicaid. The amendment would give States additional funds to help seniors with incomes between 120 and 150 percent of poverty. This amendment meets the terms of the budget agreement which provided for $1.5 billion in additional premium assistance for low-income beneficiaries over the next 5 years. In short, this amendment helps protect the most vulnerable seniors and keeps our word with the President. 
Mr. President, I ask this amendment be adopted and considered original text for purposes of amendments.

Mr. President, if a means test is fair in 2 years, then it is fair today. I see no reason for the delay. Let me remind my colleagues that the premium increase is very modest, given the part B benefits.

Following the remarks by Senator Stevens, the Senate will resume consideration of the reconciliation bill. At 9:30 a.m. the Senate will proceed to a series of back-to-back rollcall votes on or in relation to a number of amendments which have been offered this evening, beginning with Senator Gramm's amendment No. 444 and ending with final passage of S. 947 as previously ordered. 
Also, by consent there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on each amendment prior to each vote. Therefore, Members can expect a lengthy series of back-to-back rollcall votes as the Senate disposes of all the amendments in order to the budget reconciliation bill. 
Following final passage of S. 947, the Senate is expected to proceed to the consideration of S. 949, the Tax Fairness Act. All Senators wishing to offer amendments to S. 949 should be prepared to offer them during Wednesday's session of the Senate. Furthermore, Members can be expected to vote on amendments offered to the Tax Fairness Act beginning Wednesday afternoon. As previously announced, the next couple of evenings will be late ones as the Senate works to complete action on the Budget Act prior to the July 4 recess.

What we did in committee is agree that there should be outreach, that we do want to ensure that all children that are not currently insured have the opportunity of having such insurance. But there is a lack of precision in the information, and that essentially creates the problem. I think all you have to do is listen to the discussion that we are having here this evening and it shows you that you don't have hard figures on this. But it was agreed upon, in a bipartisan way, that we wanted to develop a program that would assure all children health care with the enactment of this legislation.

Mr. ROTH. The problem that has been faced in Medicare is the explosion of costs in home health care. It has been going up something like 30 percent a year. Obviously, that kind of increase cannot be permitted if we are going to salvage and strengthen the Medicare Program. 
Just let me point out that Medicare spending on home health services increased most dramatically in the last decade. In 1989-90, it went up 53 percent; 1990-91, it went up 44 percent; 1991-92, it went up 40 percent again; 1992-93, 30 percent; 1993-94, 30 percent; 1994-95, 19 percent. So, basically, it has been going up roughly 30 percent. 
There has been an increase in beneficiaries using home health care. There has been an increase in the number of visits per beneficiary. There has been an increase in the number of agencies providing care. So the payment system has not controlled the utilization of home care. There is the reason that we have put this $5 copayment. 
Let me point out that it is particularly important to understand that those who are 100 percent of poverty or less will have this $5 fee paid by Medicaid. So those who are under poverty are protected. 
And that is the idea of the program. We want those who are over 100 percent of poverty to be careful in their utilization. The program is there. It is a good program. In many cases, it can save money because it is better to have home health care than to put a person into a hospital. 
But the problem is that the costs have exploded. Somehow we have to make sure that the beneficiaries are more careful in their utilization of this program. And that is the reason for this change. 
Again, I want to stress the fact that those who are 100 percent of poverty or less will have this copayment of $5 paid by Medicaid. And they will not be out of pocket. So they are protected.

Mr. ROTH. I would just point out that the Senator is absolutely correct. The proposal was adopted unanimously by the committee, both Democrat and Republican. As I said, it was done in such a way as to try to make the beneficiaries be more careful in its utilization. 
I would point out that the question was raised, why did we use the $760 limitation? The reason for that is that under part A, many people, after being in a hospital for 3 days, will utilize home health care. They do not pay the $5 fee, but instead they pay $760. So that was the ceiling that was set under part A, and we carried that over to part B. There the beneficiary pays $5 per visit but not in excess of $760.

Mr. ROTH. I yield myself such time as I may take. I say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia I will be brief so that he can be recognized. 
Again, I want to emphasize what the factual situation is. The fact is that home health care has been exploding at roughly 30 percent a year or more, and this kind of increase in cost cannot be permitted if we are going to strengthen and preserve Medicare for the long term. So the proposal has been made to put a $5 copayment fee on each health care up to a limitation of $760, which is what is paid as a deductible under part A. 
This matter was discussed and unanimously agreed to in the Finance Committee by Republicans and Democrats alike. The reason it was agreed to is because it is important that these visits be available but they be used prudently and not without consideration to the cost. That is the reason we added it. 
Again, I want to emphasize that those 100 percent under poverty will not pay this $5 fee. It will be paid by Medicaid for them, so they are protected. But again, in reforming and restructuring Medicare, we are trying to do it in such a way that it strengthens and preserves the program for the long term. That in turn means it is essential that the utilization be done carefully, and that is what we seek to do and that is what the Finance Committee unanimously adopted.

Mr. ROTH. I point out to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts we have added a number of preventive services for the sick. For example, we now permit mammography testing to be made, 
colorectal testing or screening; we also permit diabetes home care matching. So we have added a number of things. But again, overall, we are trying to put this program in such shape that it will survive in the long term. Unfortunately, in the area of home health care, the costs have exploded. Let me mention again that home health care in 1989-90 went up 53 percent; 1990-91, it went up 44 percent; 1991-92, 40 percent; 1992-93, 30 percent; 30 percent again in 1993 and 1994; 19 percent in 1994 and 1995. 
Let me point out further that other groups, such as the Commonwealth Fund, support the idea of a $5 copay. In a report issued by the Commonwealth it says that `this is a sensible approach which would make beneficiaries sensitive to use but not form a barrier to care.' 
I yield back the floor.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased by the work and cooperation that was exhibited last week in the Senate Finance Committee. It was an encouraging display of bipartisanship--both sides of the aisle working together to craft a proposal that meets the guidelines of the budget agreement and achieves needed reforms in spending programs while protecting America's vulnerable. 
Out of this tremendous effort that went into the Finance Committee markup of the budget came two distinct themes that we would do well to keep in mind as we take this issue up to the floor. First, that the time has come, as President Clinton expressed in an earlier State of the Union Address, to end big Government as we know it. This is no longer an objective held by one side of the aisle over the other. It is a necessity. 
We are blessed with the greatest Nation on Earth. We have the most productive citizens, the finest resources and materials, and we have the ingenuity and spirit of enterprise. We realize, however, that our resources are finite and Government's role is limited. Yet, we are willing, on both sides of the aisle, to make certain that Government efficiently and effectively provides for those with whom Government has a contractual or moral obligation to provide. Medicare is contractual. Medicaid, when it serves the most vulnerable, particularly America's children, is moral. And these feelings are shared mutually by Republicans on the committee as well as Democrats. This became obviously clear last week. 
Second, we demonstrated the power of bipartisanship. I can safely say that no one, but no one, on the Finance Committee got everything he or she wanted. No one was completely satisfied with everything, as it is a compromise between differing political philosophies and between deeply held views. So while what we have passed and addressed on the floor today is not the budget package that any of us would have drafted, it represents a major step forward, a step forward that, through balancing the budget, can help assure continued growth, jobs and opportunity. 
As we worked on the committee to report out this budget, I was led by two primary goals. First, to implement the budget agreement in such a manner that we not only balance the budget but that we do so in a manner that preserves and strengthens the programs impacted. As I said during the committee markup, `It is not enough to reduce the cost of such critical programs as Medicare and Medicaid, but it must be done in a way that provides better service to beneficiaries of these programs.' 
My second objective was to implement the budget agreement in a manner that assured bipartisan support for the program. I believe we have accomplished both of these. What we offer today is a workable balance, a critical balance that protects our most vulnerable populations while addressing necessary reforms in important entitlement programs. 
Let me give some specifics. The largest program we concerned ourselves with was, of course, Medicare. Much has been written and said about the future of this program and the need to strengthen it for the long term. We did this. We took a critical first step towards addressing the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program while at the same time making certain that the program meets the needs and expectations of its current beneficiaries. The changes we made in Medicare actually allow us to expand Medicare coverage for certain important preventive services including mammography, colorectal screening, bone mass measurement and diabetes self-management. We are able to offer 
this expanded coverage and protect and preserve Medicare by incorporating choice and competition into the current program, and by slowing Medicare's rate of spending growth. Our measures will save Medicare from bankruptcy for another 10 years, while still increasing Medicare spending per beneficiary from $5,450 this year to $6,950 in the year 2002. 
In expanding choice in the Medicare Program, we have used the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefit Program as a model. Under our new Medicare Choice Program, seniors will have the opportunity to choose from a variety of private health plan options and select the health care plan that best suits their needs and preferences. These choices will include the whole range of health plan options available to the under-65 population--fee-for-service, varieties of managed care, and medical savings accounts. Through these options, seniors will be able to obtain important benefits, like prescription drugs, that are not covered by traditional Medicare. 
It is clear to see how these commonsense and, again, I want to say, these bipartisan solutions will preserve and strengthen the program. We were not content to stop there. The Finance Committee proposal calls for a National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. This will be a 15-member commission, established for 1 year, charged with making recommendations to Congress on actions necessary to ensure the long-term fiscal health of the Medicare Program, something of great concern to the ranking member, Pat Moynihan, and myself. 
The Finance Committee report also creates a demonstration project within the Medicare Program for medical savings accounts. This demonstration project will allow up to 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries to opt into an MSA program, a program that will allow them to choose a high-deductible Medicare Choice plan. 
These changes to Medicare will result in a net savings of $115 billion, savings that will not only help us meet the budget compromise but savings and reforms that will preserve the Medicare Program while ensuring that it continues to serve those who depend on it now. Again, these important reforms were made possible only through sincere bipartisan efforts, and it is my hope that such bipartisanship will continue as we address these reforms on the floor. 
Such bipartisanship also marks our treatment of Medicaid. Working together, we passed reforms that will control the growth of the program, resulting in a net savings of over $13 billion. For more than a decade, there has been a constant tug of war between the Federal Government and the States over Medicaid, as each side has asserted its will over the other. From the mid-1980's through the early 1990's, the Federal Government imposed mandates on the States and, in turn, the States shifted costs to the Federal Government. The result was devastating to all of our budgets as Medicaid routinely grew at a double-digit pace, reaching as high as a 29-percent increase in 1992. This Finance Committee proposal signals an important change in the program. 
Having said this, let me be clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. Under this proposal, Medicaid spending will continue to grow. The Federal commitment to Medicaid will grow from $99 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $140 billion in 2002. The President originally proposed $22 billion in savings in the Medicaid Program. We achieved approximately $14 billion in savings. 
The first part of our Medicaid reform is to give the Governors the tools they need to control this program. This will be able to move more individuals into managed care without waiting years for waivers from the Federal Government. They will be able to contract with selected providers for service. The States will be able to ask families to take some responsibility for the decisions they make when seeking health care services. 
In short, our plan gives the States many of the same tools that the private sector has in stretching health care dollars. The fact is, health care as a whole has changed, and the Medicaid Program needs to catch up. Our proposal gives the States the tools necessary to act as many large employers do, to get the greatest value for Medicaid dollars. So we are taking the important next step to move both the States and the Federal Government out of the waiver process. 
But we also want to ensure that as the old program requirements are replaced, quality is still assured. As I have said, in addressing the Medicaid Program, we also provided many of the reforms requested by the bipartisan National Governors' Association. These include repealing the Boren amendment provision. The history of the Boren amendment is a classic example of unintended consequences as it has been used to increase the costs of the program, rather than control costs. 
The Governors and the administration agree on the repeal of this provision. It will take the providers and the States out of the Federal courts and put them back at the contract negotiating table. 
As we repeal the Boren amendment, we must be very careful that we do not simply create a new round of lawsuits over what Congress means in terms of Medicaid payments to facilities. 
Another major provision of our plan to control the growth of Medicaid is the reduction in spending on the Disproportionate Share Hospital Program. This DSH Program provides funding for indigent individuals who are not enrolled in Medicaid. Under current law, DSH spending is projected to increase from $10.3 billion in fiscal year 1998, to $13.6 billion in 2002. In 1990, Federal and State DSH spending combined totaled less than $1 billion, and in 1995, Federal and State DSH payments totaled nearly $19 billion. 
Without reform, Federal DSH payments alone will total nearly $60 billion over the next 5 years, and we need to exert some discipline in this program. 
This bill reforms the DSH Program through a combination of controls. 
First, a State which spends less than 3 percent of its Medicaid Program on DSH will be frozen at its 1995 level. For these States, there will be no reduction, but also no growth. 
Second, beginning in 1999, high-DSH States and low-DSH States will be reduced from their 1995 actual spending levels. A high-DSH State or a State that spends more than 12 percent of its Medicaid dollars on indigent hospital costs will be reduced from its 1995 spending levels for inpatient hospitals only. It will not be allowed to count spending on institutes for mental diseases. These high-DSH States will be reduced from 1995 spending by 14 percent in 1999 and by 20 percent in the years thereafter. 
Low-DSH States are those that spend less than 12 percent, but more than 3 percent of the Medicaid dollars will be reduced from their 1995 spending by 2 percent in 1999. In the year 2000, they will be reduced 5 percent from the 1995 level. In 2001, the reduction will be 10 percent, and in 2002, it will be 15 percent. 
As I mentioned, our proposal places restrictions on the States' ability to fund their State mental health facilities with Federal funds. Over the past few years, the States have shifted the cost of these facilities to the Federal Government. As you check with your State, many will find huge increases in Federal costs associated with these facilities. It is time to close this loophole. 
Let me say that the President proposed $22 billion in savings from the Medicaid Program. Two-thirds of these savings were to be realized out of the DSH Program and one-third from per capita caps. The savings target has been reduced, but the potential reforms for achieving these savings are also limited. 
I believe there is general agreement that through the DSH Program, the use of DSH payments had been expanded well beyond the original intent. The DSH formula has been developed with consultation and in bipartisan cooperation. The formula has been carefully designed, based on past problems in this program and with input from Members. 
Concerning the steps which we take in this package to address children's health, let me begin by saying that we all share the same goal of increasing access to health care for as many children as we can. And it is clear that Members on both sides of the aisle are committed to finding an answer to the problem of uninsured children in this country. 
Of the 71 million children in the United States, more than 86 percent are covered by some type of health insurance; two-thirds are covered by insurance through the private sector; 23 percent of all children in the United States under age 18 are covered by Medicaid, and another 3 percent are covered by other public insurance programs. 
Of the 9.8 million children who are not insured, 2.9 million children live in families with incomes above 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Half of these children live in families 
with incomes of about 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. Mr. President, 300 percent of the poverty level is over $48,000 for a family of four. This tells us that insurance coverage is more than an issue of family income. It is, in fact, a complex issue which does not yield easy to Washington-knows-best solutions. 
The proposal we offer today provides the States with a choice concerning how they will expand coverage to more children. They can expand their Medicaid coverage, or they can offer a package of benefits which is actuarially equivalent to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
Our intention is to build on the successes the States have been realizing. This year, the States will be increasing coverage to more than 800,000 children through initiatives proposed by the Governors. 
We should learn from these initiatives and encourage the States to develop them. This proposal will allow the States to choose how best to extend coverage to children. 
Expanding Medicaid is certainly a choice States have made. Thirty-nine States have expanded Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and children beyond the Federal requirement, but States are also developing other strategies for increasing coverage of children as well. There are already public-private partnerships in more than half the States. 
There are successful programs, such as New York's Child Health Plus and Florida's Healthy Kids. These innovative programs, and programs like them, can grow with additional resources. 
The Children's Health Initiative that we include in our committee proposal is a bold new approach to support the States in the drive to provide coverage for more of our Nation's children. As I have said, the States will be given a choice to expand coverage through the existing Medicaid Program or through a new initiative in which they can subsidize private programs for children or provide a new benefit package which is actuarially equivalent to what Federal employees receive. 
Under either choice, the Federal Government will provide the same matching rates to the States. A State would pay the same rate as it does currently in the Medicaid Program. We recognize this may not be enough to encourage States to participate. Therefore, under this proposal, the Federal Government would send to the States an additional incentive bonus for each child who is covered in this new initiative. We call this an enhanced match. The State will receive a 10-percent bonus for each new child they cover and 5 percent for a child who is already covered under a State health program for children. These bonuses will be provided for children who are receiving health care coverage from the State that is beyond Federal Government requirements for Medicaid. 
A critical component of this agreement is what type of health insurance coverage is provided. Let me stress that this truly is insurance. A State would be required to provide either its current Medicaid benefits package or one which is equal to what the children of Federal employees receive. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will review these plans to ensure that they meet this test. 
The welfare of our children was a critical component in the bipartisan plan we achieved in the Finance Committee. The result of our work will be to cover more children and to provide them with real health insurance. Again, this children's health care initiative will build upon the leadership in the States. It passed the Senate Finance Committee with strong bipartisan support, and I thank all the Members who made a contribution to this special effort. 
As you see, Mr. President, each of these reforms is necessary. Together they meet the requirements and responsibilities that were given to us. During the next 5 years, we reduce deficit spending by $100 billion, including Medicare reductions of $115 billion, and net Medicaid reductions by $13.6 billion. 
At the same time, we increase spending for children's health care in this bill by $16 billion, SSI support for elderly and 
disabled immigrants by $10.4 billion and welfare to work by $3 billion. We extend the solvency of the part A trust fund for Medicare for at least 10 years, while introducing structural reform to give beneficiaries more choice among competing health plans. 
Our goal is to give the Medicare beneficiary the same choices that Federal employees have within our Federal health program, including the traditional fee-for-service, and this is an excellent beginning. 
We were able to produce such a strong bipartisan package because of the spirit of cooperation shared by members of the Finance Committee. Views were solicited actively, from all members of the Finance Committee. They were asked to submit in writing the recommendations as to how the budget agreement should be implemented, and their ideas were incorporated in the initial chairman's mark. Informal meetings were then held to seek the further advice and recommendations from Members. These, in turn, were incorporated into the proposal we address today. 
As chairman of the Finance Committee, I say with certainty that this proposal has substantial support on both sides of the political aisle and it is, again, my sincere hope that the spirit of bipartisanship that existed within our committee will prevail as we move forward. I hope the objectives that guided us will remain those that carry us through the next few days as we consider this budget. I particularly express my sincere appreciation to Senator Moynihan for his leadership in this monumental effort, as well as my appreciation to all the members of the committee who reported this proposal out of the Finance Committee unanimously. Senator Gramm provided invaluable leadership on the Medicare Subcommittee, and I thank all the committee staff members who worked around the clock day after day to ensure that the objectives we were given to meet would be met in the most efficient and effective way possible. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Mr President, it is no coincidence that the first balanced budget agreement in a generation has come about at a time when the economy is red hot and when joblessness has dropped below 4.9 percent. The expanding economy has been shrinking the deficit as well as the gulf between both sides of the budget debate. 
Any lingering distance between Congress and the administration was swept away on the eve of the budget agreement when the Congressional Budget Office predicted that a tidal wave of new money would flood the treasury in the next 5 years. 
These new CBO estimates project that even without a budget agreement, increased revenues and decreased outlays would shrink the deficit an additional $225 billion. 
Perhaps even more important than the first balanced budget in a generation, this tidal wave of new money has washed away the ground underneath opponents of growth. Nothing signified the victory of growth over zero-sum, class-warfare politics more clearly than the words of President Clinton's former Labor Secretary Robert Reich when he told the New York Times a few weeks ago, `The fact is, a lot of the deficit solved itself. It was the one solution that no one thought of.' 
Actually, it was the guiding philosophy of the Kemp-Roth tax cut. If I may quote Jack Kemp, `Even with spending restraint, we cannot balance the budget consistently without economic growth.' 
Mr President, on this point the record is quite clear. Following the tax cuts in the early eighties the economy did soar. But so did the deficit. The problem was, while revenues to the Federal Government doubled during the decade, spending more than doubled. 
In short, growth did its job--we just asked too much of it. The amount of wealth produced by our country was astounding and continues to be astounding. However, it is not limitless. So neither can our spending be limitless. 
We can protect the elderly and offer a helping hand to the poor, but only with solid growth in the economy. Without growth, the poor and elderly are pitted against each other in competition for meager resources, while the rich are vilified for their success. Left unchecked, these battles corrode the American dream. 
Mr President, I believe this budget represents a new coalition, bound by the common objective of higher growth. Because growth is the key to funding worthwhile social programs without unfairly burdening middle-class families. It is the key to providing a strong defense and a clean environment. It is the key to rebuilding the American dream. 
Growth has won the debate because it has proven itself. Even the more ardent opponents of growth oriented policies must realize that to raise $225 billion from taxpayers would require a typical middle-class family to pony up an additional $450 per year 
Some will argue that the huge Clinton tax increase of 1993 is responsible for the low deficit, high growth, low unemployment economy we now enjoy. But that ignores the fact that this economic expansion began during the Bush administration. Others say it is the information age, along with deregulation and corporate restructuring that strengthened our economy. 
Regardless of who is right, and I do have some thoughts on the subject, I relish such a debate about the connection between taxes and growth. What is no longer debatable is that growth is the key to higher income for all Americans as well as higher revenues for the Federal Government. 
Look how far we have come in just 5 years. When President Clinton took office, he offered a $19 billion dollar stimulus package predicated on the notation that private enterprise could not produce the jobs our country needed. We no longer harbor fears about the ability of America to produce for her citizens. 
Some make the point that this budget will only be balanced for 5 years. And this is true. It is also true that we face additional challenges beyond 2002 in both Social Security and Medicare, especially when the baby boom begins to retire. But the seeds of a solution to these long-term problems can also be found in this budget. Explicitly it restrains spending. Implicitly, it acknowledges that growth is the key to finding revenue for popular programs. 
Both sides of the American political conversation are now committed to playing within the bounds of fiscal restraint, while searching for ways to promote growth. This formula has served us well in the past and it will serve us well in the future. 
The old bromide is true. A rising tide does lift all boats. And the same tidal wave that has lifted millions of Americans to unprecedented new heights of prosperity in the past 6 years has also finally sunk that leaky old boat, class warfare. 
There are only two roads we can travel. One is to downsize the American dream and learn to live in a slow growth world; the other is to grow the economy up to level that makes the American dream possible. With this budget agreement, Congress and the President have decided its better to grow up.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I support Senator McCain's Sense of the Senate. I agree with my colleague from Arizona that Amtrak needs reforms. Amtrak must be able to operate more like a business. Senator Hutchison has recently introduced a major reform package which I support. Amtrak needs these reforms and they must be enacted this year. It is also very clear that Amtrak needs an adequate and reliable source of capital funding. Amtrak is currently borrowing to meet payroll and if additional capital funding is not provided, GAO and Amtrak have testified that the company will not survive past mid-1998. The key to Amtrak's future is both a legislative reform package and a secure source of capital funding. 
Given the immediate financial crisis Amtrak is facing, Congress cannot wait a moment longer. To be viable Amtrak will need both a secure source of capital funding and a reauthorization and reform bill this year. It is my goal to see both bills enacted this year. I do not doubt Senator McCain's ability to get the reform bill passed in the Senate and enacted this year. And, as I have stated on the floor many times, it is one of my priorities to give Amtrak a secure source of capital funding this year. Both bills are essential and I believe both should be implemented in conjunction with each other. We cannot lose our national passenger rail system. If something is not done to give Amtrak the capital funds and the reforms it needs, Amtrak will not survive. This is not an idle threat. GAO has testified before my committee that this is the case. Amtrak President Tom Downs has testified that the company would not survive past 1998. Amtrak's financial report proves it. The question before us is whether or not we want this country to have a national passenger rail system. If we want a national system, we must give Amtrak a secure capital funding source to allow it to operate more like a business. 
Let me take a few minutes to explain why I fought to include the Amtrak reserve fund in the budget resolution. And may I also say at this time that Senators Domenici and Lautenburg have been extremely helpful in securing this compromise language for me. 
Senator Domenici and I have worked together to develop a compromise on how to finance a secure source of funding for Amtrak. Out of these discussions we developed an Amtrak reserve fund which would allow for the spending caps for Amtrak to be raised by the amount of revenue raised to finance this fund. It is the first step, and a very critical step, for ensuring that Amtrak receives the capital funding it needs to survive. 
Mr. President, all major modes of transportation have a dedicated source of capital funding, except for intercity passenger rail. Amtrak needs a similar capital funding source to bring its equipment, facilities, and tracks into a state of good repair. Much of Amtrak's equipment and infrastructure has exceeded its projected useful life. The costs of maintaining this aging fleet and the need to modernize and overhaul facilities through capital improvements to the system are serious financial challenges for Amtrak. This provision is the first step in helping to reverse these problems and give Amtrak the resources necessary to meet its capital investment needs. 
I believe that it is time for Congress to reverse our current policy that favors building more highways at the expense of alternative means of transportation, such as intercity passenger rail. Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency, and reliability in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere, intercity passenger rail remains severely underfunded in the United States. In fact, over half of the Department of Transportation's spending authority is devoted to highways and another quarter to aviation; rail still ranks last with roughly 3 percent of total spending authority. 
If this Congress wants a national passenger rail system, we will have to properly fund the system. Amtrak has not been able to make sufficient capital investments in the past through annual, but inadequate appropriation. I am pleased that the Senate now recognizes that a new funding mechanism is needed for Amtrak. Under this budget agreement, Amtrak would finally receive similar treatment as other modes of transportation.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased that this budget agreement includes my proposal to give Amtrak a capital fund. My proposal creates an Amtrak reserve fund which would give Amtrak the capital funds that it needs to survive. Amtrak is currently borrowing to meet payroll and if additional capital funding is not provided, Amtrak President Tom Downs, has testified that the company will not survive beyond mid-1998. 
Let me be clear. This reserve fund is not my first preference. Amtrak today needs funding that I would prefer to do through direct spending. However, this reserve fund language is a compromise with the chairman of the Budget Committee to ensure that the Appropriations Committee will continue to have complete control over the funding of Amtrak. 
Our compromise language would allow spending caps for passenger rail to be raised by the amount of revenue raised in the Senate Finance Committee. It is the first step, and a very critical step, for ensuring that Amtrak would be able to receive the capital funds, subject to the appropriations process, it needs to survive. 
This provision does not create a trust fund nor ensure the creation of a trust fund for Amtrak. It is merely a placemark in the budget which provides that should money be raised for Amtrak, the spending caps would be raised by that amount. 
Three more steps are required if Amtrak is to see a capital fund: 
First, legislation must be enacted to create a fund; second, legislation must be enacted which pays for the fund; and finally, once all these steps have been accomplished, the appropriators must act to fund Amtrak. Let me reiterate, that the fate of Amtrak will continue to be in the appropriators' hands. 
Again, this is the first significant step to allow for a creation of a fund for Amtrak this year. This provision is necessary so that the creation of such a fund would not be in violation of the Budget Act. It merely creates room in the budget to allow spending from the rail fund, provided money is raised to finance this fund. 
Let me also say that this provision does not in any way put funding ahead of legislative reforms for Amtrak. Many Senators supporting this provision also support legislative reforms. I believe Amtrak must be able to operate like a business. Amtrak needs these reforms and they must be enacted this year. Senator Hutchison has recently introduced a major reform package which I generally support. I believe any additional capital funding must be done in conjunction with this reform package. This Amtrak reserve fund would not prevent this from happening. Again, the provision we are debating today merely says that should a trust fund be created and funded, there would be room in the budget. 
Also, this provision does not rely on the transfer of a half-cent from the 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax. It has nothing to do with the 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax. This reserve fund would be financed without such a transfer. My goal, however, would be that total capital funding for Amtrak would equal the revenues derived from a half-cent. 
 Mr. President, we cannot lose our national passenger rail system. If something is not done to give Amtrak the capital funds it needs, Amtrak will not survive. This is not an idle threat. GAO has testified before my committee that this is the case. Amtrak President Tom Downs has testified that the company would not survive past 1998. Amtrak's financial report proves it. The question before us is whether or not we want this country to have a national passenger rail system. If we want a national system, we must give Amtrak a secure capital funding source. This provision is the first step in creating such a fund. 
 Mr. President, all major modes of transportation have a dedicated source of capital funding, except for intercity passenger rail. Amtrak needs a similar capital funding source to bring it's equipment, facilities and tracks into a state of good repair. Much of Amtrak's equipment and infrastructure has exceeded its projected useful life. The costs of maintaining this aging fleet and the need to modernize and overhaul facilities through capital improvements to the system are serious financial challenges for Amtrak. This provision is the first step in helping to reverse these problems and give Amtrak the resources necessary to meet its capital investment needs. 
Mr. President, GAO, Amtrak, and the National Commission on Intermodal Transportation have called for a secure source of capital funding for Amtrak. I believe that now is the time for this Congress to reverse our current policy that favors building more highways at the expense of alternative means of transportation such as intercity passenger rail. Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency, and reliability in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere, intercity passenger rail remains severely underfunded in the United States. In fact, over half of the Department of Transportation's spending authority is devoted to highways and another quarter to aviation; rail still ranks last with roughly 3 percent of total spending authority. 
Last year we spent $20 billion for highways while capital investment for Amtrak was less than $450 million. In relative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, transportation outlays for highways increased 73 percent, aviation increased 170 percent, and transportation outlays for rail went down by 62 percent. In terms of growth, between 1982 and 1992 highway spending grew by 5 percent, aviation by 10 percent, while rail decreased by 9 percent. 
A problem that is going to increase is the congestion on our roads. Between 1983 and 1990, vehicle miles traveled increased nationwide by 41 percent. If current trends continue, delays due to congestion will increase by more than 400 percent on our highways and by more than 1,000 percent on urban roads. Highway congestion costs the United States $100 billion annually, and this figure does not include the economic and societal costs of increased pollution and wasted energy resources. 
Air travel is equally congested. Commercial airlines in the United States presently transport over 450 million passengers each year. A recent transportation safety board study revealed that 21 of the 26 major airports experienced serious delays and it is projected to get worse. Again, the costs are enormous. A 1990 DOT study estimated the financial cost of air congestion at $5 billion each year, and it expects this number to reach $8 billion by 2000. 
Congestion is a problem and it must be addressed. However, the current path we are on directs more money for highways and airports. For us in the Northeast, building more roads is simply not an option. We do not have the land nor the financial resources to build more highways or more airports. For these reasons, we must provide more than just good roads but a good passenger rail system as well. 
Adequately funded passenger rail can successfully address highway gridlock and ease airport congestion. Passenger rail ridership between New York and Washington is equal to 7,500 fully booked 757's or 10,000 DC-9's. Between New York and Washington, Amtrak has over 40 percent of the air-rail market. 
Improved Northeast rail service will also have the same positive impact on road congestion. The 5.9 billion passenger miles were taken on Amtrak in 1994. These are trips that were not taken on crowded highways and airways. Improved rail service in the Northeast is projected to eliminate over 300,000 auto trips each year from highways as well as reduce auto congestion around the airports. 
Improved rail service will also have a positive effect on rural areas. Twenty-two million of Amtrak's 55 million passengers depend on Amtrak for travel between urban centers and rural locations which have no alternative modes of transportation. 
Mr. President, now is the time to invest in our rail system. 
Opponents of this language say that we should stop subsidizing Amtrak. Amtrak needs to be self-sufficient. 
I would like to see that happen, but to date, I am not aware of any transportation system that supports itself without Federal assistance. Further, I am not aware of any transportation system that supports itself through user fees. According to the Department of Transportation, in fiscal year 1994 nearly $6 billion more was spent on highways than was collected in user fees. 
In fiscal year 1995 nearly $8 billion more was spent on highways than was collected in taxes. Transit which is exempted from the motor fuels tax, received $3 billion in revenues in motor fuels revenues last year. I repeat, no mode is self-financed. 
If we want a national passenger rail system, we must fund it properly. This provision is an important step to give Amtrak the capital funds it needs to survive.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, of the 71 million children in our country some 86 percent have health coverage provided by private insurance or Medicaid. This is an impressive statistic. But it masks a problem. There are some 3.2 million children in families whose incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid and too low to afford private insurance. 
This is a problem that ought to be fixed. No child should be without health care because his family can't afford to purchase coverage. 
The basic task we face in fixing this problem is to provide health insurance to these currently uninsured children without jeopardizing the private insurance system that provides care to the rest of our children. The Finance Committee has the responsibility of deciding how to do this. As chairman of that committee I intend to report legislation that will address this problem. 
The issue before us is how much money to dedicate to this activity. The budget agreement allocates some $16 billion to solve this problem. President Clinton supports this amount. The House of Representatives supports this amount. I believe this is the right place to start. 
This budget agreement before us is a delicate compromise of many competing interests. I think it would be unwise for us to jeopardize this agreement by asking for more.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to clarify the meaning of the term, `most-favored-nation trading status.' I do so because the term gives the false impression that MFN is some sort of special privilege or reward. 
In fact, MFN is not a special privilege or reward. It designates the most ordinary, most normal trading relationship among countries. Since the founding of our Republic, the principle of nondiscrimination embodied in MFN has served as the cornerstone of U.S. international trade policy. 
In its most basic trade application, this principle requires a country to apply the same tariff duty rate on a particular product from one country as it applies to imports of the same product from all other countries. 
For example, if the U.S. tariff on imported clock radios is 5 percent, all clock radios imported from countries with MFN status are subject to a 5-percent tariff. Imports from countries that do not have MFN status--and there are only six countries that fall into this category--are subject to far higher duty rates. 
Another important point about MFN is that it is not a one-way street. When we give MFN status to a particular country, that country, in return, gives the United States most-favored-nation status. 
Therefore, because we give Singapore MFN status, the clock radios we import from that country are subject to the same tariff rates as clock radios from Thailand, Spain, or any other country to which we extend MFN. 
In return, when Singapore imports our computer chips, it imposes the same tariff on United States chips as those imported from Japan, Korea, Great Britain, or any other country to which it extends MFN. 
What does the United States get out of all this? American companies get to compete on fair and equal terms with their foreign rivals. 
Let me emphasize again: MFN status does not confer--let alone imply--special treatment. 
In fact, when we decide to give special treatment to imports from other countries--as Congress has expressly chosen to do for certain products from over 130 nations--those imports are subject to tariff rates substantially below the MFN rate. Sometimes we even allow specified countries to export products to the United States duty free. 
In short, MFN status denotes the standard, not the exceptional, trading relationship. Ending this standard trading relationship by revoking MFN is an extreme measure. In fact, because MFN is so fundamental to trade relations among countries, some correctly liken its withdrawal to a declaration of economic war. 
Because of the confusion created by the phrase, `most-favored-nation trading status,' Senator Moynihan and I and virtually all the Members of the Finance Committee have agreed to introduce legislation to replace the phrase wherever appropriate in U.S. trade law with a more suitable term--`normal trade relations'--a term that underscores the unexceptional nature of the MFN concept. I believe that if we adopt this legislation, we will all better understand the issue, and our discussions on extending normal trade relations to various countries will be more constructive. 
It should be clear to our trading partners that creating this new term will not alter our international rights and obligations. Rather, in choosing the term `normal trade relations' we aim to describe more accurately the nondiscriminatory principles underlying U.S. trade law and policy. 
Last year, similar legislation passed the Senate unanimously. I ask my colleagues to do the same again this year.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues who have so eloquently praised China's most prominent dissident and advocate of democracy, Wei Jingsheng, and who have called for his immediate release from prison. Yesterday marked the publication of Mr. Wei's remarkable book, `The Courage to Stand Alone.' The book is a compilation of his valiant prison letters to the Chinese leadership. 
As a result of Mr. Wei's outspoken and articulate views on human rights and democracy the Government of China has imprisoned him--mostly in solitary confinement--for the greatest part of two decades. His personal sacrifices in the name of fundamental freedoms are a testament to his heroic spirit. 
As one who has always supported commercial engagement with Beijing to encourage greater openness and freedom in China, I find China's repression of Wei's views and cruel treatment of Wei himself offensive. 
As we are about to embark on our annual debate on renewing normal trade relations with China, Beijing must realize that its treatment of Mr. Wei in particular, and its repressive human rights policies in general, trouble all of the Members of this body, especially those of us who favor renewal. 
While Mr. Wei has been outspoken in his own support of continuing China's MFN trade status--noting at his trial that the direct victims of MFN revocation `would be the already poverty-stricken Chinese people' rather than the authorities in Beijing--China would do its people and its position in the world well by heeding this brave man's calls for greater freedom and democracy.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday, the Medicare and Social Security trustees released their annual reports on the actuarial status of both trust funds--a report which is actually due on April 1 of each year. The board of trustees has six members: the Secretaries of Treasury and Labor; the Commissioner of Social Security, and two public trustees appointed by the President. 
As expected, there are no surprises in yesterday's reports, and there is no good news. 
As most Americans know by now, the Medicare hospital insurance [HI] trust fund is close to bankruptcy. In fact, the trustees' report confirms that the expected bankruptcy date remains just 4 years away--in 2001. The problem is pretty basic--more money is flowing out of the HI trust fund than is flowing in. Trust fund assets are quickly being depleted. In 2001, they're gone. 
Although most attention is focused on the impending bankruptcy of the HI trust fund, the trustees report that the supplemental medical insurance [SMI] trust fund (Medicare part B) is also a serious problem. SMI spending is a blank check on the Treasury. Over the past 5 years, SMI spending has grown 14 percent faster than the economy. Without savings in part B, we cannot say we have affectively tackled the problem of fixing Medicare. In the words of the public trustees, part B growth is unsustainable over time. 
In bringing about a lasting solution that will protect and preserve the Medicare Program, all the Medicare stakeholders will have a role to play--hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, beneficiaries, and others. The public trustees appointed to represent the public expressed this challenge. They stated that, `Medicare cannot stay exactly as it is and it is misleading to think that any part of the program--beneficiary premiums, providers payments, controls on utilization, covered service or revenues--can be exempt from change.' 
I agree with the trustees' recommendation that a bipartisan advisory group should be put together to craft a long-term solution to Medicare's fiscal crisis. In fact, in February, with Senator Pat Moynihan, I introduced a bill to address Medicare long-term challenges by establishing a national bipartisan commission on the future of Medicare. This Medicare commission would serve as an essential catalyst to congressional action, consolidating bipartisan support, and ultimately lead to a solution that will preserve and protect the Medicare Program for current beneficiaries, their children, and grandchildren. 
Although the financial plight of the Medicare Program is urgent, we must also be mindful of the longer term--but no less serious--problems of Social Security. Beginning about 2012, payroll taxes will no longer cover benefits. We must surely act sooner than later if we are to avoid a crisis in Social Security. 
We need to assure the trust in the trust funds remains, not just for today's beneficiaries, but also for tomorrow's. We must ensure that Medicare and Social Security will be there for our children and grandchildren. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Today, I am proud to join the Republican pension task force chaired by Senator Gregg to introduce the Women's Investment and Savings Equity Act of 1997, known as the Wise bill. I want to commend Senator Gregg for his leadership of the Republican pension task force and his hard work in putting this bill together. 
Of the 63 million baby boomers in America, a full 32 million of them are saving less than one-third of what they will need for retirement. This concerns me. It concerns me even further that the overwhelming majority of these Americans, unprepared for retirement, are women. According to the Census Bureau, retired women are almost twice as likely as men to live in poverty. The poverty rate for elderly single women is about four times greater than the rate for those who are married. 
I consider the Wise bill one of the beginning steps toward creating an environment where Americans can work for self-reliance and a secure future. It will go a long way toward establishing equity in the Tax Code for stay-at-home parents who want to save for their retirement years. And while it's called the women's investment and savings equity bill--because the majority of those who will benefit are women--it covers both mothers and fathers, whichever serves as homemaker. 
The Wise bill of 1997 will allow homemakers and other workers without a pension plan to make a full $2,000 tax-deductible IRA contribution each year, regardless of their spouse's pension plan. In addition, parents who take maternity or paternity leave will be allowed to make catch-up payments to their retirement plans after they return to work. Even homemakers who return to employment after an extended absence, and working parents who cannot afford pension contributions while raising children, will be able to catch-up for the years they were raising children. 
This bill is an important first step of a larger retirement savings and security expansion bill by the Republican pension task force. It will give families the tools for a secure retirement.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, students of history may remember Henry Stimson. He served America as Secretary of War and Secretary of State in the first half of the 20th century. While in office, Stimson tried to close down American counterintelligence sources. His reason, you may recall, was that `gentlemen do not read each other's mail.' 
Today, Mr. President, Henry Stimson would not only be concerned about counterintelligence operations but about the Internal Revenue Service as well. Recent reports disclose that among the abuses and misuses of power and access at the IRS is the ability of IRS employees to snoop in the files of unwitting taxpayers. 
While it's not the mail that these snoops are reading, it is something just as sensitive. I don't know of anyone who wants his or her detailed financial information perused without reason. The millions of Americans who comply with the law and file tax returns each year, should be able to do so without fear or hesitation that someone--for purposes of curiosity, revenge, or even a more avaricious motive--is snooping through their private information. 
If Government has one responsibility to these men and women it certainly must be to ensure their privacy. Current law does prohibit the disclosure of confidential taxpayer information. However, the Internal Revenue Code does not specifically prohibit IRS employees from unauthorized inspection or snooping of confidential taxpayer information. 
I can think of no better day to call for change that today, April 15, when once again those millions of trusting Americans are rushing their returns off to the IRS. 
You may remember, Mr. President, that last year, Congress amended title 18 of the United States Code to make it a crime to use a computer to snoop information of any Federal department or agency, including the IRS. However, last year's legislation did not apply to unauthorized inspection of paper documents. 
The bill we introduce today will correct that. It will require that tax return information be kept confidential by the IRS and it's employees. It will ensure that IRS employees do not snoop confidential taxpayer information. 
This bill will create a criminal penalty in the Internal Revenue Code of up to 1 year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, plus the cost of prosecution for unauthorized willful browsing of confidential taxpayer information. The bill will also require the abusing employee to be fired. 
The bill will allow civil damages for snooping, and, if an IRS employee is indicted for unlawful inspection or disclosure of a taxpayer's confidential information, the bill will require that the IRS notify the taxpayer. 
Mr. President, this bill will provide additional protections and some peace of mind for taxpayers. I want to thank Senator Coverdell and Senator Glenn for their efforts to protect taxpayers by making it a crime for IRS employees to snoop taxpayer data.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I read recently that `the best thing we have learned from nearly five hundred years of contact with the American wilderness is restraint,' the need to stay our hand and preserve our precious environment and future resources rather than destroy them for momentary gain. 
With this in mind, Ioffer legislation today that designates the coastal plain of Alaska as wilderness area. At the moment this area is a national wildlife refuge--one of our beautiful and last frontiers. By changing its designation, Mr. President, we can protect it forever. 
And I can't stress how important this is. 
The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our Earth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete spectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a vital part of our national consciousness. It is a place we can cherish and visit for our soul's good. It offers us a sense of well-being and promises that not all dreams have been dreamt. 
The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness and recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and glaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich with caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, moose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, black brant, and more. In all, about 165 species use the coastal plain. 
It is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give birth, nurse and feed their young, and set about the critical business of fueling up for winters of unspeakable severity. 
The fact is, Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is good that man can come only as a visitor. These are the pristine lands that belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the lands that belong to our future. 
Considering the many reasons why this bill is so important, I came across the words of the great Western writer, Wallace Stegner. Referring to the land we are trying to protect with this legislation, he wrote that it is `the most splendid part of the American habitat; it is also the most fragile.' And we cannot enter `it carrying habits that [are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely excessive.' 
The expectations for oil exploration in this pristine region are excessive. There is only a 1-in-5 chance of finding any economically recoverable oil in the refuge. And if oil is found, the daily production of 400,000 barrels per day is less than 0.7 percent of world production--far too small to meet America's energy needs for more than a few months. 
In other words, Mr. President, there is much more to lose than might ever be gained by tearing this frontier apart. Already, some 90 percent of Alaska's entire North Slope is open to oil and gas leasing and development. Let's keep this area as the jewel amid the stones. 
What this bill offers--and what we need--is a brand of pragmatic environmentalism, an environmental stewardship that protects our important wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and judiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its long-term needs. 
Together, we need to embrace environmental policies that are workable and pragmatic, policies based on the desire to make the world a better place for us and for future generations. I believe a strong economy, liberty, and progress are possible only when we have a healthy planet--only when resources are managed through wise stewardship--only when an environmental ethic thrives among nations--and only when people have frontiers that are untrammeled and able to host their fondest dreams.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there's an old joke that might help us put the current activity surrounding campaign finance reform into some perspective. The joke concerns two men who hire a small plane to go hunting bear. The pilot, as he drops the hunters off, insists that the plane can only carry two passengers and one bear on its return trip. With that warning ringing in their ears, the hunters go off and eventually return with two bears. 
The pilot protests that the huge second animal will overload the plane. The hunters remind him that that was just what he told them last year. They reminded him that they had given him an extra $100 the year before, and that he had let them load both bears. `So here's another $100,' they say and then they pack both carcasses into the rear of the plane. The plane struggles down the runway and lifts uncertainly into the sky. It gets halfway home but then crashes in the forest. The hunters crawl from the wreckage and ask the bruised pilot, `Where are we?' The pilot looks around and replies, `Same place we crashed last year.' 
Today, the debris of scandal associated with campaign financing is strewn all about us. The White House is under siege as one news report after another brings new information about suspected improprieties. The Governmental Affairs Committee has now been asked to probe into the illegal and improper financial practices that may have taken place in this last election. 
What I want to remind my colleagues is that this is not the first time we have addressed this issue. In fact, this is, as Yogi Berra would say, deja vu all over again. 
More than two decades ago, Congress passed legislation on campaign finance reform. That legislation included limits on all contributions and on candidate expenditures. It placed limits on independent expenditures, required disclosure, and set limits on the amount of personal wealth a candidate could spend on his campaign. 
This was done, Mr. President, in 1974. Following that legislation, however, the Supreme Court stepped in and decimated the reforms with its decision in Buckley versus Valeo. 
While the courts upheld limits on campaign contributions, it struck down the limits on independent expenditures and on the use of personal wealth. This, in effect, increased the disparity between the wealthy and the not-so-wealthy in campaigns. It also increased the power and impact of independent expenditures, much of which focuses on negative advertising. 
Each of these serious consequences of the Supreme Court's decision created conditions that were exactly opposite of what Congress had intended. For example concerning independent expenditures, this means that person or group has unlimited ability to spend money for or against any candidate, as long as they do not coordinate their efforts with the candidates. 
Because of the Supreme Court's decision, and the rising costs of political campaigns--costs that can be prohibitive and exclusionary--I remained active in trying to find a remedy, a remedy that would result in the kind of real reform that Congress had intended. Because of Buckley versus Valeo, it was clear that such reform could not be achieved by statute, but that it required a constitutional amendment. In four consecutive Congresses, Senator Hollings and I introduced constitutional amendments that would achieve Congress' goal of complete reform. 
In this Congress, Senator Hollings has reintroduced his constitutional amendment, and once again I intend to support it. I intend to support it because anything short of an amendment will fail to achieve the conditions necessary for real reform. Statutory reforms without a constitutional amendment will create even greater problems as political money will flow elsewhere to get around the statutory limitations. 
In other words, as restrictions are placed on certain channels, money will find its way into other channels--it will flow through independent expenditures and unlimited personal contributions, which are protected by the Supreme Court's decisions. 
Needless to say, this would further damage the ability of a sharp, qualified candidate to win office if he or she did not have the kind of money that a wealthy candidate--a candidate who may even come from out of State--can bring into a race. Small States like Delaware would be extremely vulnerable to the inequities created by these restrictions. 
For over two decades now, reformers in Congress have been seeking to overturn Supreme Court decisions by simple statute even though the decisions were based on the first amendment. That effort is a waste of time for anyone seeking comprehensive reform. Of course, if one's goal is to incapacitate all candidates who are not wealthy and to allow the wealthy and the special interests to determine the outcomes of elections, then perhaps such statutory reforms will do. But if one's goal is to level the playing field, then the solution must effectively address all the players and not only the candidates. 
So unlike some of my colleagues who support the pending constitutional amendment, I cannot support statutory proposals whose effect would be to weaken the role of candidates and to strengthen the role of those whose spending is constitutionally protected. No statute can limit what the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, protects. 
The Constitution gives us, in these circumstances, a simple choice: we can overturn the Supreme Court so that we can reenact the 1974 campaign finance law or we can live under the Supreme Court decision, powerless to enact comprehensive reform. 
I am glad to see that this basic constitutional fact of life has now been embraced by the minority leaders in both Houses. But we need more support than theirs to achieve the supermajority in both Houses required to propose ratification. And that will happen when those organizations espousing reform stop blocking the only path to real reform. 
Last week on the floor, opponents of the pending constitutional amendment argued that adoption of the proposal would allow Congress to do all sorts of unreasonable things, such as outlawing all campaign expenditures so that incumbents would be reelected. It may be helpful to recall that 10 years ago the Hollings proposal did not include the important word `reasonable' modifying the limits Congress could impose on campaign expenditures. At that time, I argued that adding the word `reasonable' would make clear that judicial review of congressional limits was intended. 
Opponents seem to suggest that the pending proposal would give Congress unlimited discretion. That's not true. Courts now under the fourth amendment review what is `unreasonable' search and seizure. Under the pending proposal, courts would review what is or is not a `reasonable' limit on campaign expenditures. 
Opponents also raised the question whether the proposal would authorize Congress to limit editorials. I must say that I never viewed editorials as campaign expenditures, and I believe that most people have the same view. If that point needed further clarification, I would think legislative history could make clear that editorial coverage is not intended to be included within the pending proposal. 
Mr. President, campaign finance reform must be fair. A constitutional amendment will allow us to make it fair. Campaign finance reform must also look at making races less expensive and more accessible to fine candidates who are deterred from running because of money. 
Campaigns can be made less expensive by shortening the campaign season, and by requiring television stations to grant free advertising time as a condition of their Federal licenses. 
It's no secret that the major expense in the electoral process is buying media time. I have long been an advocate of free TV for campaigns--going back to the 1970's--and I have introduced legislation toward this end. 
In 1993, I wrote to President Clinton seeking his support, and I'm now delighted to see that he has suggested requiring broadcasters to provide free time for candidates in exchange for new licenses to provide high-definition television. 
This will be no easy feat. When I first broached this idea, I could only find three Senators who would support me. One was Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. That was many years ago, and I must admit we have seen some progress. The last time I brought this legislation to the floor, a few years ago, I received six votes. But perhaps, in light of the scandal plaguing the White House, as well as the outcry from our constituents, this is an idea whose time has come. 
I have talked to my constituents, Mr. President. I know their feelings on campaign finance reform. They want reasonable limitations on campaign expenditures. They want reasonable limits placed on independent expenditures. And they want shorter campaigns. 
It is my sincere hope that as we move forward in this important debate, we will achieve these three very basic objectives, and, unlike our bear hunters, we will not, in the years to come, find ourselves in the same situation we are in now.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of Senator Moynihan and myself to introduce a bill that would correct a technical error originally contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Specifically, the bill would correct the definition of the term `Indian reservation' under section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. This definition of the term `Indian reservation' applies for purposes of determining the geographic areas within which businesses are eligible for special accelerated depreciation (sec. 168(j)) and the so-called Indian employment tax credit (sec. 45A) enacted in 1993. As I explain in further detail below, the bill corrects the definition of `Indian reservation' for purposes of these special tax incentives so that, as Congress originally intended, the incentives are available only to businesses that operate on Indian reservations and similar lands that continue to be held in trust for Indian tribes and their members. It is my intent to incorporate the provisions of this bill into a larger bill, which I plan to introduce later this session, containing technical corrections to other recently enacted tax legislation. 
Section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the term `Indian reservation' means a reservation as defined in either (a) section 3(d) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452(d)), or (b) section 4(10) of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1903(10)). The cross-reference to section 3(d) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 includes not only officially designated Indian reservations and public domain Indian allotments, but also all `former Indian reservations in Oklahoma' and all land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Thus, contrary to Congress' intent in enacting the special tax incentives for Indian lands in 1993, the reference to `former Indian reservations in Oklahoma' in the Indian Financing Act of 1974 results in most of the State of Oklahoma being eligible for the special tax incentives, even though parts of such `former Indian reservations' no longer have a significant nexus to any Indian tribe. For instance, it is my understanding that the entire city of Tulsa may be located within a `former Indian reservation,' such that any business operating in Tulsa qualifies for accelerated depreciation under present-law section 168(j). Providing such a tax benefit to commercial activities with no nexus to a tribal community would frustrate Congress' intent to target special tax incentives to official reservations and similar lands that continue to be held in trust for Indians. Businesses located on official reservations and similar lands held in trust for Indians were provided special business tax incentives in order to counter the disadvantages historically associated with conducting commercial operations in such areas, which were expressly excluded from eligibility as empowerment zones or enterprise communities under the 1993 act legislation (see Internal Revenue Code sec. 1393(a)(4)). 
The bill I am introducing today would modify the definition of `Indian reservation' under section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code by deleting the reference to section 3(d) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974. Consequently, the term `Indian reservation' would be defined 
under section 168(j)(6) solely by reference to section 4(10) of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which provides that the term `reservation' means `Indian country as defined in section 1151 of Title 18 and any lands, not covered under [section 1151], title to which is either held by the United States in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by an Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation' (25 U.S.C. 1903(10)). Section 1151 of Title 18, in turn, defines the term `Indian country' as meaning `(a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation, (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same' (18 U.S.C. 1151). 
Accordingly, amending section 168(j)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code to define the term `Indian reservation' solely by reference to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 would carry out Congress' original intent in enacting the special Indian tax incentives in 1993 by eliminating from eligibility those areas in Oklahoma which formerly were reservations but no longer satisfy the definition of a `reservation' under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. It is my understanding that, even after amending section 168(j)(6) in this manner, numerous areas within Oklahoma will remain eligible for the special tax incentives because, even though such areas are not officially designated reservations, such areas nonetheless qualify as `Indian country' under section 1151 of Title 18. Similarly, it is my understanding that lands held by Native groups under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act also would qualify as `Indian country" under section 1151 of Title 18. Thus, if section 168(j)(6) were amended to define `Indian reservation' solely by reference to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, lands held under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act would continue to be eligible for the special Indian tax incentives. In this regard, it is my intent that, if it is brought to the attention of the tax-writing committees that there are any Indian lands that technically do not fall within the definition of `Indian reservation' under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 but which could be made eligible for the special Indian tax incentives consistent with Congress' intent in 1993, then consideration will be given to further modifying the bill I am introducing today when it is incorporated into a larger technical corrections bill. 
The technical correction made by the bill would be effective as if it had been included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (that is, the technical correction would apply to property placed in service and wages paid on or after January 1, 1994). As a general matter, I oppose retroactive changes to the Internal Revenue Code. However, technical corrections to fix drafting errors in previously enacted tax legislation traditionally refer back to the original effective date to prevent taxpayers from receiving an unintended windfall. This bill corrects such a drafting error.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is a personal honor for me to once again cosponsor Senate Resolution 56 designating March 25, 1997, as `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy'. 
This resolution honors the anniversary of a single, victorious revolution that occurred 176 years ago. This solitary battle returned to the citizens of Greece their freedom and democracy, rights that had been seized from them centuries before by the Ottoman Empire. Greece is a country possessing an immensely rich heritage, and one from which our own Nation has drawn generously and with great benefit. In times of peace and in times of conflict, Greece has steered a strong and steady course with the United States as a loyal friend and trusted ally. 
This resolution provides me with the opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the nation of Greece, as well as our own Greek American community, for the significant contributions they have both made on behalf of our Nation--and to the inexorable ties which bind our two peoples together.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would create a dedicated source of capital funding for Amtrak. Joining me as cosponsors are Senators Moynihan, Lautenberg, Wyden, Jeffords, Biden, Kerry, DeWine, Leahy, and Specter. 
Mr. President, all major modes of transportation have a dedicated source of capital funding, except for intercity passenger rail. 
My legislation would correct this inequity and create a secure and reliable capital trust fund for Amtrak, no different than what other major modes of transportation now have. 
My legislation would transfer one-half cent of the 4.3 cent per gallon motor fuels tax currently going to the general fund, to a new intercity passenger rail trust fund. 
This rail trust fund would total approximately $3.9 billion dollars over 5 years to be used for capital improvement projects. After the fifth year, the revenues from the half cent would revert back to the general fund. My bill would create contract authority to allow Amtrak to enter into contracts necessary for long-term capital projects. For States that do not have Amtrak service, it would provide funding for qualified transportation expenses. 
This capital funding proposal is critical to Amtrak's future. 
Amtrak needs capital funding to bring it's equipment, facilities, and tracks into a state of good repair. Much of Amtrak's equipment and infrastructure has exceeded its projected useful life. The costs of maintaining this aging fleet and the need to modernize and overhaul facilities through capital improvements to the system are serious financial challenges for Amtrak. My proposal would help reverse these problems and give Amtrak the resources necessary to meet its capital investment needs. 
Mr. President, Amtrak, and the National Commission on Intermodal Transportation have called for a secure source of capital funding for Amtrak. I believe that now is the time for this Congress to reverse our current policy that favors building more highways at the expense of alternative means of transportation such as intercity passenger rail. Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency, and reliability in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere, inter-city passenger rail remains severely underfunded in the United States. In fact, over half of the Department of Transportation's spending authority is devoted to highways and another quarter to aviation; rail still ranks last with roughly 3 percent of total spending authority. 
Last year we spent $20 billion for highways while capital investment for Amtrak was less than $450 million. 
In relative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, transportation outlays for highways increased 73 percent, aviation increased 170 percent, and transportation outlays for rail went down by 62 percent. In terms of growth, between 1982 and 1992 highway spending grew by 5 percent, aviation by 10 percent, while rail decreased by 9 percent. 
A problem that is going to increase is the congestion on our roads. Between 1983 and 1990, Vehicle Miles Traveled increased nationwide by 41 percent. If current trends continue, delays due to congestion will increase by more than 400 percent on our highways and by more than 1000 percent on urban roads. Highway congestion costs the United States $100 billion annually, and this figure does not include the economic and societal costs of increased pollution and wasted energy resources. 
Air travel is equally congested. Commercial airlines in the U.S. presently transport over 450 million passengers each year. A recent transportation safety board study revealed that 21 of the 26 major airports experienced serious delays and it is projected to get worse. Again, the costs are enormous. A 1990 DOT study estimated the financial cost of air congestion at $5 billion each year, and it expects this number to reach $8 billion by 2000. 
Congestion is a problem and it must be addressed. However, the current path we are on directs more money for highways and airports. For us in the Northeast, building more roads is simply not an option. We do not have the land nor the financial resources to build more highways or more airports. For these reasons, we must provide more than just good roads but a good passenger rail system as well. 
Adequately funded passenger rail can successfully address highway gridlock and ease airport congestion. Passenger rail ridership between New York and Washington is equal to 7,500 fully booked 757's or 10,000 DC-9's. Between New York and Washington, Amtrak has over 40 percent of the air-rail market. 
Improved Northeast rail service will also have the same positive impact on road congestion--5.9 billion passenger miles were taken on Amtrak in 1994. These are trips that were not taken on crowded highways and airways. Improved rail service in the Northeast is projected to eliminate over 300,000 auto trips each year from highways as well as reduce auto congestion around the airports. 
Improved rail service will also have a positive affect on rural areas. Twenty-two of Amtrak's 55 million passengers depend on Amtrak for travel between urban centers and rural locations which have no alternative modes of transportation. 
Mr. President, now is the time to invest in our rail system. 
Opponents of my legislation have said that we should not use revenues from our motor fuels tax to pay for Amtrak. I disagree. States are currently using revenues collected from our motor fuels tax for many non-highway uses. For example, Virginia uses its motor fuels tax receipts on mass transit and ports; New Hampshire uses its motor fuels receipts to bolster their Fish and Game Department; Wyoming uses its portion of the motor fuels tax for snowmobile trails and boating facilities; Florida and Arkansas use the motor fuels tax for environmental protection. Like these States have already done, I believe 
Congress should spend the revenues raised by the motor fuels tax on those programs it feels best serve our transportation needs. I think passenger rail should be one of those programs. 
Another argument I often hear is that we should stop subsidizing Amtrak. Amtrak needs to be self-sufficient. 
I would like to see that happen, but to date, I am not aware of any transportation system that supports itself without Federal assistance. Further, I am not aware of any transportation system that supports itself through user fees. According to the Department of Transportation, in fiscal year 1994 nearly $6 billion more was spent on highways than was collected in user fees. 
In fiscal year 1995 nearly $8 billion more was spent on highways than was collected in user fees. Transit which is exempt from the motor fuels tax, received $3 billion in revenues in motor fuels revenues last year. I repeat, no mode is self-financed. 
In closing, our national passenger rail system is important. 
My legislation would provide capital funding to help improve and maintain the corporation's infrastructure. Amtrak will not be able to make it to zero operating subsidies by the year 2002 without it. If we are to adequately fund our passenger rail system like we fund our highways and other major modes of transportation, Amtrak will need this trust fund.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today my good friend, Senator Moynihan, and I are introducing a landmark piece of legislation to create a cost-of-living board that will improve our Government's ability to index Federal programs with a more accurate measurement of inflation. Clearly, there are a number of ways to address the accurate measure of inflation with regard to our indexed Federal tax and benefit programs. In my view, this bill represents one possible way to achieve greater accuracy. It is not the only way, but I believe it is our best effort to create a mechanism to fairly compensate taxpayers and benefit recipients alike. 
One of the most significant issues that faces Congress this year is the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index, and I believe that Congress and the President need to seriously address the economic ramifications of an inaccurate measure of the cost of living. The five-member board created in our bill will meet throughout the year to, first, review the statistical evidence about inflation produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and others, and after careful review of all the evidence regarding inflation, the board will then produce a cost-of-living adjustment by a majority vote of the members of the commission not later than November 1 of each year. 
This inflation adjustment number will serve as a number for which all Federal benefit programs and tax items will be indexed for the coming year without further action by the Congress or the President. If, however, the cost-of-living board fails by a majority vote to produce a cost-of-living adjustment, then current law applies. That is to say, that the BLS-produced CPI will be used to index tax and benefit programs. 
Let me be clear. This cost-of-living board will not--and I emphasize not--study the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index. We have already had the Boskin commission which did just that. The report was widely praised within the Economic Community, including many highly respected economists, such as Dr. Alan Greenspan and Dr. Martin Feldstein. 
One of the roles in Government is to protect American families from inflation. In doing so, it is important that we are able to measure inflation as precisely as possible, and I view this board as our best hope of accurately measuring inflation. 
I cannot emphasize too greatly the importance of an accurate measurement of inflation. If the index is too high, it overcompensates retirees and others and undertaxes many taxpayers. If it is too low, it undercompensates retirees and overtaxes the taxpayer. What we want is fairness to all with as accurate an index as possible. 
I want to stress that any action we take on this issue must be broadly and deeply bipartisan. We must have the full cooperation and leadership by President Clinton. I hope the President will not miss an opportunity to consider this board as one possible option that will `take the politics out of it' and fulfill his goals set out in his State of the Union Address to `do the right thing for the country.' Clearly, this reform will not be successful without the President's leadership.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Her nomination was favorably reported by a unanimous vote of the Finance Committee on Thursday, January 30, 1997. It is evident that the nomination of Ambassador Barshefsky has wide bipartisan support in the Senate. This is not surprising when one looks at the impressive record she has compiled as a trade negotiator at the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, first as Deputy USTR and then as acting USTR. 
During her nearly 4 years at USTR, Ambassador Barshefsky has succeeded in negotiating an impressive list of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements aimed at opening foreign markets to U.S. exports. She has also distinguished herself as a vigorous advocate and defender of U.S. trade interests. For example, most recently, Ambassador Barshefsky concluded an important agreement on insurance with the Japanese--a matter I was actively involved in on behalf of the United States insurance industry. If this agreement is fully implemented by the Japanese Government, it should result in substantial new opportunities for United States insurance providers. 
Similarly, at the World Trade Organization Ministerial in Singapore last December, Ambassador Barshefsky was successful in pushing other nations to conclude a landmark agreement to eliminate tariffs on information technology products. Once put into effect, this Information Technologies Agreement will result in billions of dollars in savings to U.S. companies and consumers. 
However, Ambassador Barshefsky has also shown that she can reject bad agreements. She refused to enter into an agreement on trade in financial services that could have left U.S. financial service providers in a worse position than before. Similarly, during the negotiations on telecommunications services last spring, she had the resolve to walk away from the table when other countries had presented patently insufficient offers to open their telecommunications markets. 
Her hard-nosed stand in the telecommunications talks forced countries to make substantial improvements in their offers, and the result was a historic agreement reached on February 15 to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services. 
The Agreement on Trade in Basic Telecommunications Services will save consumers hundreds of billions of dollars and will allow our telecommunications industry to compete in foreign markets that were previously closed to them. 
Given these accomplishments and her demonstrated toughness and resolve on behalf of U.S. interests, I think there is no question but that Ambassador Barshefsky is extraordinarily well qualified for the position as U.S. Trade Representative. Indeed, her achievements, negotiating skills and professionalism remind me of another able woman USTR, Carla Hills. 
We enter a time when we greatly need as U.S. Trade Representative someone with the qualifications that Ambassador Barshefsky brings to the position. The next USTR will be called upon to manage a number of difficult trade issues, including the increasingly complicated trade relationship with China. 
Specifically with respect to China, we face a ballooning trade deficit and increasing tensions on trade matters with that country. Moreover, we will soon enter again into the annual debate over whether China should continue to enjoy normal trade relations with the United States, at a time when congressional views on this question will be influenced by China's action during the reversion of Hong Kong to the People's Republic this July. 
Ambassador Barshefsky will also be responsible for negotiating with China to ensure that it enters the World Trade Organization on commercially viable terms, which provide for meaningful market access and a commitment from the Chinese to observe the basic rules of the WTO. 
In addition, Ambassador Barshefsky will be the administration's point person with respect to the difficult issue of renewal of fast-track negotiating authority. She will also carry the responsibility to ensure that the trade liberalization initiatives through the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and the Trans-Atlantic Marketplace proceed according to schedule. 
These are all important issues, and I am most confident that they will be handled appropriately working with someone like Charlene Barshefsky. 
I would like to comment on the issue of the Ambassador's work for the Government of Canada and the Province of Quebec while practicing law in the private sector. 
Questions have arisen whether this work may fall within the terms of section 141(b)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended in 1995 by the Lobbying Disclosure Act. 
That provision prohibits the President from appointing any person to serve as Deputy USTR or U.S. Trade Representative who has directly represented, aided, or advised a foreign government or foreign political party in a trade dispute or trade negotiation with the United States. In my opinion, the vagueness of this new law and the fact that there was no debate or legislative history on the provision when it was added to the Lobbying Disclosure Act, make it difficult to determine whether it covers or even should cover Ambassador Barshefsky's work in the private sector. 
In order to resolve this matter, the President formally requested Congress to enact legislation waiving the law in this instance. Senator Moynihan and I agreed that under these circumstances, a waiver was warranted and, therefore, we jointly introduced Senate Joint Resolution 5 to waive the prohibition. 
For those who may have questions or concerns about this waiver, I want to point out that Congress has previously passed legislation to waive a statutory requirement on who may serve in a particular Government position with respect to a specific nominee. For example, in 1989, Congress passed a waiver of the law requiring that only a civilian may be appointed head of NASA, so that Rear Adm. Richard Harrison Truly could be appointed NASA Administrator. In 1991, Congress, once again, passed a waiver of the law requiring that only a civilian may be appointed head of the Federal Aviation Administration so that Maj. Gen. Jerry Ralph Curry could be appointed FAA Administrator. 
I would also like to say specifically with respect to Ambassador Barshefsky that as Deputy USTR, she has been exempt from the prohibition in the Lobbying Disclosure Act. She has been forthcoming in providing information to the Committee on Finance about the nature of her work while in private practice. 
Moreover, in response to a question from me at her nomination hearing, the Ambassador stated that she had never lobbied the U.S. Government on behalf of a foreign government or a foreign political party. 
So under these circumstances, and in the interest of moving her nomination as expeditiously as possible, the entire Senate Committee on Finance agreed that a waiver was appropriate in this case and voted unanimously for the joint resolution. Therefore, I hope that all Members of the Senate will also agree that the waiver is in the best interest of confirming this 
nominee who clearly enjoys broad bipartisan support and has already demonstrated that she is eminently qualified to serve in that position. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROTH. Madam President, on January 30, 1997, the Committee on Finance unanimously reported without amendment Senate Joint Resolution 5, the waiver resolution for Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky's appointment to serve as U.S. Trade Representative. As I said earlier, I strongly support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination. Therefore, in order to expedite the appointment of this nominee, it is my considered opinion as chairman of the Finance Committee, that the waiver should remain clean and should not be amended. 
Now, Senator Hollings has introduced an amendment to the waiver. This amendment would require congressional approval of any trade agreement that `in effect' amends or repeals U.S. statutory law. 
While I am convinced that as a general matter the Senate should not add amendments to the waiver, I have a number of concerns specifically about Senator Hollings' amendment, which lead me to oppose the amendment most strongly and to urge my colleagues to vote against it. 
My primary concern is that passage of the Hollings amendment will seriously jeopardize Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination. I have a letter from Chairman Archer of the House Ways and Means Committee stating that the House would view the Hollings provision as a revenue measure that, under the origination clause of the Constitution, must originate in the House of Representatives. As such, Chairman Archer informs me that he will invoke the constitutional prerogative of the House to refuse to consider the waiver resolution for Ambassador Barshefsky if the Hollings amendment is added.

Mr. ROTH. I want to emphasize one point to those that support the Barshefsky nomination. Regardless of whether one supports the Hollings amendment on the merits, the House will blue slip it. This means that not only will the House kill the Hollings amendment, but the Barshefsky waiver along with it. 
This fact alone is ample reason to vote against the Hollings amendment. 
In addition to this procedural concern, I also have substantive problems with the Hollings amendment. I admit this amendment may have some superficial appeal. Nonetheless, it is completely unnecessary because it is based on a false assumption, implying a problem that simply does not exist. The amendment gives the erroneous impression that the President is currently able to implement international trade agreements calling for changes in U.S. statutory law without the passage of implementing legislation by Congress. That is simply not true. If a trade agreement requires changes in U.S. statutory law, Congress must enact the legislation to implement those changes. Congress must pass that legislation in order for the agreement to have full force and effect with respect to the United States. 
A good example is the OECD Shipbuilding Subsidies Agreement, a trade agreement that was negotiated in 1994. Congress has been unable to pass legislation to implement the changes in U.S. law called for under that agreement. As a result, the agreement has no force and effect with respect to the United States. Absent congressional passage of implementing legislation, there is nothing the President can do to implement the agreement on his own. 
Now, what if Congress and the President have a legitimate disagreement about whether a particular trade agreement calls for a change in U.S. law? My understanding is that this issue is the basis of Senator Hollings' concern--that the President can act to supersede laws passed by Congress. 
First of all, this is not a situation where trade agreements are somehow deemed to be treaties, with the full force of law, but which, unlike a treaty, the President is able to implement without Congressional approval. Trade agreements are executive agreements. And the simple fact is that if there is an inconsistency between an executive agreement and a statute, the statute prevails. In other words, a law passed by Congress remains on the books in full force and effect and cannot somehow be trumped by an executive agreement or any other action by the President. 
In my opinion, the language in the Hollings amendment requiring that Congress approve any trade agreement that `would in effect amend or repeal' U.S. statutory law also suffers from several other defects. 
It is vague, subjective, leaves undefined what `in effect' means, and does not specify who determines whether a law is effectively changed by a trade agreement. 
Trade agreements cannot effectively change or repeal U.S. law. An agreement may call for actual changes in U.S. statutory law, in which case, as I have already explained, Congress must pass implementing legislation in order for it to have force and effect with respect to the United States. Or an agreement does not call for such changes, in which case it can be implemented without congressional action. Indeed, the language in the Hollings provision is so vague and ill-defined, that it could require congressional approval of any and every trade agreement the President negotiates, even those not calling for actual changes in U.S. statutory law. This could immobilize our ability to negotiate trade agreements, even on relatively minor issues, as Congress would be required to approve tens, if not hundreds of such agreements. 
All of these agreements would also be fully amendable. The result would be to shackle our capacity to conduct any trade policy. 
Because the language in the amendment is so vague, I also fear that it could call into question the legal status of previous agreements that have not been fully implemented, including the recently concluded Information Technologies Agreement. This landmark agreement was completed pursuant to authority provided to the President by Congress under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, and currently needs no further congressional action in order to be fully implemented. However, that situation could change under the Hollings amendment, which would seriously jeopardize this historic agreement to provide a market opening for U.S. companies worth $500 billion a year. 
The amendment appears to be driven, in part, by Senator Hollings' concerns about the telecommunications agreement recently negotiated at the World Trade Organization. 
My understanding is that Senator Hollings believes the commitments the administration makes in the telecommunications agreement will change current U.S. telecommunications law without Congress having the opportunity to pass implementing legislation. 
I would like to point out that others disagree with Senator Hollings' view that this agreement will change current U.S. law. Senator McCain, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Senator Burns, along with Congressman Oxley, vice-chair of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, wrote a letter to the President expressing their view that no implementing legislation is necessary.

Mr. ROTH. In conclusion, Madam President, we must keep focused on the task at hand--fulfilling the Senate's constitutional prerogative with respect to Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination. We should not be bogging this nomination down with extraneous and controversial matters, such as the Hollings amendment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to table the Hollings amendment, which will be made at the appropriate time. 
Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Exhibit 1 COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, 
U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC, February 13, 1997. 
Hon. William V. Roth, Jr., Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  
Dear Chairman Roth: I am writing in reference to legislation that would waive the application of section 141(b)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by the Lobby Disclosure Act, with respect to the nomination of Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky as United States Trade Representative. As you know, I fully support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination and urge the Senate to pass quickly legislation permitting her confirmation so that the House may then consider it promptly. 
At the same time, I am concerned that the legislation passed by the Senate may include provisions that contravene the origination clause of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that revenue measures must originate in the House. Specifically, I understand that the Senate may be asked to consider particular provisions, such as one suggested by Senator Hollings, which would change the manner in which Congress considers trade agreements and legislation having a direct effect on customs revenues. Although I strongly support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination, I would have no choice but to insist on the House's Constitutional prerogatives and to seek the return to the Senate of any legislation including such a provision. 
I look forward to working with you on this matter. 
With best personal regards, 
Bill Archer, Chairman.  
Exhibit 2 
Congress of the United States, Washington, DC, February 11, 1997. 
The President, The White House, Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. President: We write regarding inaccuracies in correspondence you reportedly have received from a few of our colleagues regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO) telecommunications talks and restrictions on international investment. 
As you are aware, officials of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) are hard at work negotiating a market-opening agreement in the WTO Group on Basic Telecommunications (GBT). Questions have been raised concerning the Administration's authority to negotiate an agreement lowering barriers to international investment. 
It has been stated that USTR sought amendments to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to clarify legal limits on foreign investment in U.S. telecommunications firms. This is incorrect. As the authors of the Senate and House foreign ownership provisions, we wish to state for the record that we were acting on our own initiative and that no Administration official requested that we legislate in this area. Any discussions we had with the Administration on these issues came at our request. 
We firmly believe that the Administration possesses the authority to negotiate an agreement without implementing legislation. Indeed, the correct legal interpretation of the relevant statute is that private foreign firms are free to invest in American firms without restriction unless `the [Federal Communications] Commission finds that the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation' of a telecommunications license. To allege that implementing legislation is necessary is to misinterpret the law. Indeed, it is the very prevalence of such misreadings that caused us to attempt to reform the ownership rules. 
We wish to state our support for USTR's negotiators. We appreciate their work to promote free trade in goods and services. We believe that a freer flow of capital is a logical extension of this policy. Artificial limits on international investment only harm U.S. firms by denying them access to foreign capital and foreign markets. 
Thank you for your consideration on these thoughts. 
Yours truly,

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we have had a great deal of debate on the Hollings amendment. So, in closing, I will be brief, but I want to make two simple points. First, no trade agreement--I emphasize `no trade agreement'--has the stature to supersede U.S. statutory law. If a trade agreement seeks to accomplish a result not in conformity with U.S. statutory law, the Congress must enact legislation to achieve that result. 
Second, the amendment, whatever its merits, will cause Senate Joint Resolution 5 to be blue-slipped in the House if the amendment is agreed to. The only result that the amendment can accomplish is to derail the Barshefsky nomination. Make no mistake, I have a letter from Bill Archer, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. He says that, `Specifically, I understand that the Senate maybe asked to consider particular provisions, such as one suggested by Senator Hollings, which would change the manner in which Congress considers trade agreements and legislation having a direct affect on customs revenue. Although I strongly support Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination, I would have no choice but to insist on the House constitutional prerogative and to seek the return to the Senate of any legislation including such a provision.' 
So I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on the Hollings amendment. I yield whatever time I have to my distinguished colleague from New York.

Mr. ROTH. The waiver is essential to ensure that the President is able to appoint this capable nominee to the post of USTR. 
I want to make just two points. First, when the Lobbying Disclosure Act was passed, Ambassador Barshefsky was serving as Deputy USTR. As such, the act expressly did not apply to her in that position. 
Second, the Ambassador never lobbied the U.S. Government on behalf of a foreign government or foreign political party. 
Under these circumstances, I strongly feel that passage of the waiver is appropriate to assure the appointment of Ambassador Barshefsky as USTR.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues' attention to an opinion piece by Senator Bob Dole entitled `Medicare: Let's Fix It' that was in last Sunday's Washington Post. 
It is my hope that all my Senate colleagues will read this compelling op-ed. Senator Dole has worked on and observed the Medicare Program for many years, and there is much wisdom to be gleaned from his commentary. He is right--we must address Medicare's problems with real solutions while giving seniors more choices. 
On a personal note, I want to thank my friend for his praise of legislation, S. 341, recently introduced by Senator Moynihan and myself, to establish a bipartisan commission on the long-term solvency problems in the Medicare Program. 
As Senator Dole notes, `a bipartisan commission can recommend sound long-term solutions,' as evidenced by the 1983 Social Security Commission. 
Mr. President, the proposed national bipartisan commission on the Future of Medicare would be this type of commission. 
Currently, the Medicare Program is not in the best of health--its short- and long-term fiscal problems make it increasingly vulnerable. In January, the Congressional Budget Office projected the Medicare trust fund is headed for the emergency room; it will go bankrupt in 2001 with a $4.5 billion shortfall. The trust fund is spending more than it is taking in from revenues; this trend will continue, creating a trust fund deficit of over one-half trillion dollars just 10 years from now. And that's still before the baby-boomers begin to retire in 2010. 
The prognosis is not good. The Medicare trust fund is limping--and soon will be staggering--into the 21st century. 
This national bipartisan commission is the medicine needed to restore Medicare's good health. Its recommendations will help the President and Congress build the consensus needed to enact effective policies to preserve and strengthen Medicare. 
Senator Dole is correct in stating, `Creating a commission won't let--the President and Congress--off the hook to enact needed Medicare changes now to avoid bankruptcy in 2001.' I believe the President and Congress must act immediately to extend the short-term solvency of the program. 
I am encouraged by President Clinton's willingness in his budget package to address the growth of Medicare spending over the next 5 years. However, I'm troubled by the administration's use of gimmicks like the home health transfer and an over reliance on cutting provider payments--such policies are just plastic surgery, masking deeper problems with a pretty face. Senator Dole says he has `never seen a budget gimmick that solved a real public policy problem'--and neither have I. 
In the long-term, Medicare must fight another potentially crippling problem. Retiring baby boomers will challenge our ability to maintain our promises to beneficiaries. Today, there are less than 40 million Americans who qualify to receive Medicare. By the year 2010, the number will be approaching 50 million, and by 2020, it will be over 60 million. Today, there are almost four workers supporting each retiree, but in 2030, there will be only about two per retiree. 
The demographic progression of the Medicare population will not come as a surprise. We know today what is to be expected. 
To be healthy, the Medicare Program is in need of structural reform. Since Medicare's enactment in 1965, there has been a great deal of change in the private health care system in the United States--but Medicare remains fundamentally unchanged. Medicare is too rigid and unable to offer the improvements in delivery of care and technological advances that have been made in the private sector. Medicare is the Model T Ford of health care programs competing in a race car world. 
These are some of the problems the National Bipartisan Commission will address. I believe it will prove to be the intensive treatment needed to cure Medicare's growing symptoms. There is agreement over the diagnosis, but no consensus over the course of treatment. Meanwhile, Medicare's time runs short. 
It is my hope that by working together in a bipartisan effort, we can seriously and responsibly address the Medicare issue. Again, I hope my colleagues will read Senator Dole's essay, and consider the issues he raises. 
The answers to the Medicare problem are not easy and they are not politically popular. The consequences of delaying treatment are much worse, though. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend for future generations to inherit a robust Medicare Program with a clean bill of health. The Commission proposed by Senator Moynihan and myself is just what the doctor ordered.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as part of the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care legislation, passed in the 104th Congress, we provided for a pilot program to explore the potential of medical savings accounts. 
These MSA's represent a significant step forward in our objective to promote an environment where Americans can receive quality and affordable health care in market-based programs. MSA's would allow families to participate in higher deductible, lower premium plans. 
The money saved on premiums would be placed in tax-sheltered MSA accounts. Families could then use this money to pay for health care costs. They would have a greater stake in the health care delivery system. Their vigilance--as they use their own money--would encourage health care providers to keep costs competitive and quality high. 
MSA's would also go a long way toward cutting the high costs associated with health care administration. 
It's projected that as families play a more active role in paying for their health care, because of the high deductible nature of MSA's, that less than 10 percent of those using MSA's would send a bill to their insurance. Insurance company involvement would come only after the deductible has been met, or in the case of a catastrophic illness. 
As we look for innovative and workable programs to help Americans meet the costs associated with health care, MSA's offer a viable and attractive possibility. I anxiously await the results from the pilot program we initiated, as well as response from our health care community. 
Recently, I received a letter and an article from two academics associated with the allied health profession field. Amy B. Hecht, former dean of the Temple University College of Allied Health Professions and James L. Hecht, professor in the political science department at Temple, authored an impressive overview of MSA's.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Finance, to introduce legislation establishing a National Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
This Medicare Commission will serve as an essential catalyst to congressional action, and ultimately lead to a solution that will preserve and protect the Medicare Program for current beneficiaries, their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. 
Mr. President, we have two immense challenges presented by the Medicare crisis. First, we have the short-term problem, the looming insolvency date of 2001. Second, in the not distant future, the vast numbers of baby boomers will challenge the long-term viability of Medicare. Congress must take action immediately on the short-term bankruptcy crisis, where the Commission will help us solve the longer term problem. 
I am encouraged that President Clinton has moved in our direction by offering in his budget package a $100 billion reduction in Medicare spending growth over the next 5 years. I must admit, however, that I was somewhat concerned when the President, in his State of the Union Address last week, devoted only one sentence to discussing his plans for Medicare. And half of that sentence was devoted to expanding the program. 
The President stated that his plan extends the life of the Medicare trust fund until 2007. However, in order to achieve this, the President's budget resorts to a budgetary sleight of hand. If we truly are to consider taking steps to preserve and protect the Medicare Program as a whole for future generations, shifting money from one trust fund account to the other does nothing for its long-term health. It only buys us a little extra time. Instead, we should take steps to extend the short-term solvency without budget accounting gimmicks. 
Relying on a gimmick like the home health transfer has a certain appeal--it buys us some time by extending the short-term life of the Medicare hospital insurance, HI or part A, trust fund which is headed for bankruptcy in 2001. Quite simply, Medicare is spending more than it collects from all sources of revenues. Transferring the majority of the outlays for home health care extends the life of the HI trust fund without having 
to make any real decisions. 
Gail Wilsnsky, a well-known health economist, stated recently `[t]he terms of the transfer of 480 billion of home care should be considered carefully because of the precedent it sets in transferring an obligation into what effectively is the general revenue of the Treasury. Normally, when an expense is brought into part B, a portion of the total spending becomes part of the premium paid by the elderly and the expense itself is subjected to a 20 percent coinsurance charge. This is not being done for the home health care transfer. While an argument can be made that the separation of Medicare into parts A and B, with two separate streams of funding is an archaic holdover from Medicare's inception, removing the limited cost constraints that now exist without reforming the entire program is very risky.' 
The anticipated bankruptcy of the trust fund in 2001 means there will not be money to pay the hospital, skilled nursing care, home health care, and hospice care bills of our senior citizens and disabled individuals who reply on Medicare. If we change current law, Medicare trends will continue on a collision course. 
In 1995, expenditures out of the HI trust fund exceeded all sources of revenues into the trust fund. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that in 2001 Medicare will out spend its revenues and spend down its current surplus, becoming insolvent with a $4.5 billion shortfall. This shortfall grows rapidly to over one half trillion dollars--$556 billion--in 2007. And, this is before the baby-boomers begin to retire in 2010. 
In the long-term, demographic trends will continue to increase financial pressure on the trust fund, challenging its ability to maintain our promise to beneficiaries. Today, there are less than 40 million Americans who qualify to receive Medicare. By the year 2010, the number will be approaching 50 million, and by 2020, it will be over 60 million. While these numbers are increasing, the number of workers supporting retirees will decrease. Today, there are almost four workers per retiree, but in 2030 there will be only about two per retiree. 
The supplemental medical insurance [SMI] trust fund does not have the same solvency problem, as it has an unlimited claim on the U.S. Treasury. The SMI trust fund is financed by a monthly premium paid by beneficiaries, which covers 25 percent of the cost of Medicare part B. The remaining costs are paid by general revenues. The SMI trust fund is solvent because the Federal Government is obligated to make up the difference between beneficiary premium amounts and part B costs. 
Spending for the SMI trust Fund is unsustainable. According to CBO, SMI spending is expected to increase at an annual rate of 
9.1 percent between 1997 and 2007, while its premium receipts will grow by only 4.5 percent a year. Under current law, the percentage of costs paid from general revenues will steadily increase. In recent testimony, Joseph Antos, the Assistant Director for Health and Human Resources at CBO, described this situation precisely, `The SMI program is no more financially sound than the HI program, in the sense that both components of Medicare are growing more rapidly than the economy's capacity to finance them.' 
The Commission should also consider that since Medicare's enactment in 1965, there has been a great deal of change in the private health care system in the United States, yet Medicare has remained fundamentally unchanged. Indeed, Medicare beneficiaries do not enjoy the same benefits private sector plans often offer their enrollees. This rigid 31-year-old program is unable to offer the private sector improvements in alternative systems of delivery of care or many technological advances. If Medicare were a television, it would be a 30-year-old, 12-inch black and white model. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today is modeled after two well-known previous bipartisan, bicameral national commissions. 
First, the mission of the Commission is similar to the 1983 National Commission on Social Security Reform, established by President Reagan by Presidential Executive Order, December 16, 1981. As was the charge to this 1983 Blue Ribbon Commission, the Medicare Commission is directed to thoroughly review Medicare and make appropriate recommendations. The Medicare Commission will review and analyze the long-term financial condition of both the Federal hospital insurance, HI or Part A, trust fund and the Federal supplementary medical insurance, SMI or Part B, trust fund. 
Second, the structure of the 15-member Medicare Commission follows more closely the model established by the 1990 U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, known as the Pepper commission. The Pepper commission was chaired by Senator Rockefeller and issued a report making recommendations on comprehensive health care reform. 
The Medicare Commission will facilitate our ability to address the Medicare crisis. Ultimately, I hope to see the Medicare Commission put forward a proposal after thoroughly analyzing the options that will truly preserve and protect the Medicare Program, not just through the next 5 years, but for the next generation so that we can leave a legacy of a robust Medicare Program for our children and our grandchildren. 
Mr. President, now is the time to put partisanship aside. Time is running short, and we need to work together to avert the crisis. 
Given the very short time that Medicare will remain solvent, and given the demographic facts of the American population, we cannot afford more delay. We need to preserve and protect the Medicare Program. We need to make sure we leave a solid legacy for the next generations. It is no longer time for rhetoric, but time for action. Playing politics with Medicare is simply wrong. Putting off what needs to be done is the cruelest tactic. 
I encourage my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.

 Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senators Thomas, Mack, and Rockefeller to submit a sense-of-the-Senate resolution expressing our gratitude to the Okinawan people for their contributions toward ensuring the viability of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States of America and Japan. My friend and colleague, Rep. Lee Hamilton, is submitting a similar resolution in the House of Representatives today. 
Mr. President, the Security Treaty forms the core of our bilateral security arrangements with Japan and of our overall security strategy for the Asia Pacific region. Those arrangements have helped provide the peace and stability that have undergirded the region's economic success--from which the United States has benefitted directly. 
To help ensure the viability of the Treaty, this past December, the United States and Japan agreed on terms to return roughly 20 percent of the land used by the American military. The Special Action Committee on Okinawa Final Report issued by the United States-Japan Security Consultative Committee sets out timetables for the return of the land. It also calls for training and operational procedures aimed at lessening the intrusiveness of American forces in Okinawa and improvements in certain procedures of the Status of Forces Agreement. 
Even with the coming changes, Japan will continue to provide our forces based in that country with significant amounts of host nation support. And no one in Japan shoulders a more disproportionate share of that burden than the people of Okinawa. 
For their many contributions to the United States-Japan relationship and the peace and stability of all the Asia Pacific region, the Okinawan people justly deserve our recognition and our sincerest thanks. That is precisely what this resolution does. But it also goes further: the resolution makes it clear that the continued support of the Okinawan people is crucial if we are to maintain a bilateral relationship that serves both our countries' interests, as well as those of the Asia Pacific and the entire world. 
In light of the need for the support and understanding of the Okinawan people, and of the prefecture's continuing economic problems, I hope the Government of Japan gives serious consideration to some of the ideas that have been circulating on making the prefecture into a bastion of free trade and investment. The surest cure for Okinawa's economic ills is a dose of fundamental market reform. 
Mr. President, I submitted a similar resolution at the end of the 104th Congress. While that resolution was cleared for passage, Congress adjourned before we could take the measure up for final consideration. Because of the importance of the United States-Japan relationship, I urge all my colleagues to join me in making passage of this resolution possible this year.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Col. John K. Wilson III as he retires after 26 years of distinguished service in the U.S. Air Force. 
Colonel Wilson is retiring from his position as the executive director of operations, Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Legislative Liaison at the Pentagon. In addition to this position, he also served as Chief, Congressional Inquiries Division. In a previous legislative liaison tour, Colonel Wilson served as a Congressional Inquiries Officer as well as a Senate Liaison Officer. In these critical positions, Colonel Wilson not only served the Air Force well, but he also assisted the U.S. Congress. 
During his tenure, he worked with hundreds of Members of Congress, responding to their constituent inquiries, lending his expertise in Air Force matters and handling a myriad of unique situations. Colonel Wilson's professionalism, diplomacy, and insight were essential to the flawless planning and execution of well over 100 Congressional worldwide fact-finding travels. His comprehensive knowledge of the legislative process and thorough understanding of Air Force issues made him the perfect liaison between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. 
Mr. President, I join with my colleagues who have directly benefited from the superb support Colonel Wilson has provided the Congress and executive branch, in congratulating him for a job extremely well done and wishing he and his lovely wife Andrea, the very best in the future. He will be a success in any pursuit he may endeavor to undertake. Colonel Wilson is a professional among professionals and has brought great credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which would establish a bipartisan Government 2000 Commission, charged with developing a comprehensive legislative proposal to reorganize, consolidate, and streamline Federal departments, agencies, and activities. 
 Mr. President, this Commission is very similar to the one that was included in S. 929 in the 104th Congress which was reported out of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee under my chairmanship. 
To make clear our objectives, this legislation includes specific goals for reducing costs and improving the performance. 
These goals include: a 35-percent reduction in the costs of administration, a tenfold increase in the timeliness of service delivery, a compound annual improvement in productivity of 6 percent, and customer service levels comparable to the private sector. 
The Commission's reorganization plan must include no more than 10 Cabinet Departments--a reduction from 14--and a substantial reduction in the number of agencies and subdepartmental bureaus, offices, divisions, and other program operating units to eliminate duplication and fragmentation. It is also required to achieve a reduction in the layers of organizational hierarchy and a substantial reduction in the total number of midlevel supervisory, administrative, and political positions. 
The Commission is charged with considering the consolidation of program service delivery functions into operating units that are independent of individual executive departments, to maximize service coordination, and whether the heads of such program operating units should be nonpolitical, noncareer appointments hired for a fixed-term under an employment contract with specific, measurable program performance goals, to maximize accountability. 
There will be nine Commission members: Two each appointed by the President, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate majority leader, and one each by the House and Senate minority leaders. The Chairman shall be appointed by agreement of the President, the Speaker, and the Senate majority leader. The Commission is authorized an appropriation of $5 million for fiscal year 1998. 
The Commission shall report its recommendations in a single legislative package by June 1, 1998. The act provides for fast-track consideration of this legislation. In the Senate, there is no time limit on debate, and only germane amendments will be order. In the House, there will be 10 hours of general debate followed by 20 hours of debate on all amendments.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one of the greatest foreign policy opportunities and challenges before the 105th Congress is the consolidation of a wider, peaceful, and democratic Europe. 
The inclusion of the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe in the core institutions of the transatlantic community has been a cornerstone of American foreign policy for the last 50 years. 
Its attainment remains both a strategic and moral imperative for the United States. 
A key step toward this end is the inclusion of democracies from Central and Eastern Europe as full members in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. 
This is a step that has been endorsed by the U.S. Congress. It is a step that has been endorsed by the American people. 
It's a step that must be taken. 
I was glad to hear the President emphasize last night in his State of the Union Address that the first task of our foreign policy is to build an undivided, democratic Europe. 
He is right to emphasize that a wider NATO and stable partnership between the alliance and Russia are cornerstones to this vision. 
As we look to the 21st century, and the uncertainties that still threaten our vital interests and those of our allies--as we see the need to maintain an organization that is dedicated to safeguarding freedoms, promoting democracy, and supporting the rule of law--we realize that NATO is critical to our future. 
It is not enough to win the cold war; we must now ensure the peace. This is NATO's commission * * * a commission the alliance must continue to carry out. 
Now more than ever, NATO has the opportunity to fulfill the role for which it was originally intended. 
Those who know the history of the alliance understand the historic significance of this moment. With the cold war behind us, NATO is now in the position to consolidate a wider democratic Europe--the very reason for which the alliance was born. 
We must welcome this. 
Enlarging and strengthening the alliance is a catalyst for increased security, productive communication, enhanced cooperation, and common objectives. 
An alliance that is outward-looking and inclusive provides a framework for peace that possesses infinite capabilities. 
For these reasons, the North Atlantic Council recently issued an historic communique that offers a long-awaited blueprint for building the alliance's relationship with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. 
The communique calls for the alliance to advance its original objectives by moving toward the integration of these nations. It articulates the North Atlantic Council's intention at its July summit meeting in Madrid, to extend invitations to accession negotiations to one or more countries which have participated in NATO's intensified dialog process. 
The communique establishes for the alliance the goal of welcoming new members by the time of NATO's 50th anniversary in 1999. 
It also announces the North Atlantic Council's objective to reach agreement with the Russian Federation on arrangements that will widen and deepen their current relationship in order to enhance security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. 
Mr. President, NATO enlargement is not a new issue before the Congress, but it is among the most important foreign policy issues the 105th Congress will face. 
The timeline established by the North Atlantic Council is both worthy and challenging. 
NATO's 50th anniversary will be in April of 1999. To ensure the accession of new members into the alliance by that date, 16 parliaments or legislatures will have to ratify accession treaties. 
Considering the important role the United States will have to play in ensuring success in this process, it is incumbent upon the 105th Congress to lead the ratification process. 
Toward this end, I call upon my colleagues to endorse the goals and timetable established by the North Atlantic Council through a resolution sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Lugar, Mikulski, Hagel, McCain, Cochran, and myself. 
I encourage my colleagues to approach this resolution with an eye toward the July summit in Madrid. 
The principal theme of this summit will be enlargement, and this resolution expresses the `sense of Congress that the extension of membership in NATO to the democracies of Central and Eastern Europe is essential to the consolidation of enduring peace and stability in Europe.' 
The resolution we introduce today also reviews congressional support for NATO enlargement--as well as the support of the North Atlantic Assembly which represents over 200 legislators from more than 40 political parties around the world. 
Most importantly, this resolution declares that Congress regards the political independence and territorial integrity of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security and, thus, to the interests of the United States. 
Our resolution calls upon the alliance, during the Madrid summit, to extend invitations to accession negotiations to Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia. 
It endorses the pledge of the North Atlantic Council that the alliance will remain open to the accession of further members in accordance with article 10 of the Washington Treaty. 
It also endorses the alliance's decision to seek a charter with Russia that reflects the common interest that Russia and the alliance have in reinforcing enduring peace and stability in Europe. 
Finally, this resolution reserves the Senate's right of advise and consent over international treaties. It pledges that the Senate will seriously and responsibly review the outcomes of accession negotiations between the North Atlantic Council and prospective NATO members. 
Passage of this resolution prior to the Madrid summit meeting in July would reiterate and reaffirm both at home and abroad the strong bipartisan support behind NATO enlargement in the United States. 
This would strengthen the President's position within the alliance on the issue of enlargement as he prepares for the July summit in Madrid. 
And, it would further reinforce the groundwork that has been laid for NATO enlargement, demonstrating that the 105th Congress is ready and willing to aggressively address this important issue. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, to send a strong and unmistakable message to our friends and allies, and to ensure that the NATO's half century of success carries well into the future.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, my friend Pat Moynihan and I are submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index. Last week the Finance Committee kicked off our first hearings of the 105th Congress with a very distinguished panel of experts in the field of economics and Dr. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
Mr. President, probably the most significant issue that faces Congress this year is the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index, and I believe that Congress and the President need to seriously address the economic ramifications of an accurate CPI. 
One of the roles in government is to protect American families from inflation. In doing so, it is important that we are able to precisely measure inflation. 
I cannot emphasize too greatly--that is what these discussions are all about--the accurate measurement of inflation. If the index is too high, it overcompensates retirees and others and undertaxes many taxpayers. If it is too low, it undercompensates retirees and overtaxes the taxpayer. What we want in fairness to all is as accurate an index as possible. 
Obviously, this is a very sensitive issue, affecting retirees and taxpayers directly as well as wage earners and others. 
In the spring of 1995, the Senate Finance Committee appointed a blue ribbon commission, headed by Dr. Michael Boskin, to study the methodology used to compute our current measure of inflation, the CPI. The panel also included leading experts in the field of price indexes, they include: 
Dr. Dale Jorgenson, Harvard University; Dr. Ellen Dulberger, IBM Personal Computer Company; Dr. Zvi Griliches, Harvard University; and Dr. Robert Gordon, Northwestern University. 
In their interim report, released in September 1995, the Boskin Commission concluded that the upward bias using changes in the Consumer Price Index to estimate changes in the true cost of living is about 1 percentage point per year. 
Dr. Boskin and the other four commission members have now completed their final report and have concluded that this critical government statistic is not as accurate as possible. Since this report suggests that the Consumer Price Index has an annual upward bias of about 1.1 percent, clearly this is a significant finding and should be taken seriously. 
Dr. Boskin and his colleagues have also suggested to the Finance Committee that a new measure of the true cost of living may be needed. 
Inaccurate government statistics--particularly one as important as the CPI--are unacceptable. Steps should be taken to change the procedures so that the measure of the CPI is as accurate as possible. 
I want to stress that any action we take on this report must be broadly and deeply bipartisan. 
We must also have the full cooperation of and leadership by the Clinton administration. I hope the President will not miss an opportunity to address this issue in his fiscal year 1998 budget he submits to the Congress this week. Clearly this reform will not be successful without the President's leadership.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today we reintroduce the super IRA, a savings plan that is well-known as the Roth-Breaux super IRA. 
I'm honored again to be joined by Senator John Breaux, in introducing this bill. I believe now, as I did last Congress, that this is extremely well conceived legislation that succeeds in strengthening two fundamental components of our society: the family and the future of our economy. Much has been written and said about both of these lately, particularly as we look to a new century. Likewise, we're hearing more and more about the need to promote personal responsibility and self-sufficiency. 
The Roth-Breaux super IRA will have a positive influence in all of these areas. Congress understands this. That's why Congress has passed similar legislation in the past. We all know that Washington must promote policies that strengthen family and create an environment where our economy can grow, this is why our IRA legislation in the past has been marked by a strong, cooperative, bipartisan spirit. In 1991, legislation similar to this had 78 cosponsors. In 1994, we had 58 cosponsors and in 1995, 52 cosponsors. I believe this legislation will find similar support. 
Why? Because this super IRA will go a long way toward strengthening our families and restoring equity to work-at-home spouses and other workers without pensions. It will also boost our Nation's saving rate and lead to capital formation, increased investment and economic growth. The lack of saving in this country, as we all know, is a real concern. Chairman Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve says that the single most important long-term economic issue for this country is savings--savings that are essential for jobs, opportunity, and growth. 
This super IRA has been designed to address our Nation's need for savings and to provide families with as much flexibility as possible to use their savings not only for their security, but for the important goals and challenges in life. For example, this super IRA allows withdrawals to be made penalty-free to purchase first homes, to pay for college, and to cover expenses during extended periods of unemployment. 
This super IRA removes many of the Tax Code's barriers to retirement saving. First, this bill increases and phases out the IRA's income limits over 4 years, and increases the contribution limit to keep up with inflation. Furthermore, one of the key features of our bill is that we separate the IRA and the 401(k) or 403(b), so Americans can save the maximum in both, and so that spouses who work at home will not have their savings limited by their husband's or wife's 401(k). 
To strengthen the way this super IRA serves our families, this legislation not only allows parents to use penalty free withdrawals to help their children meet these goals and challenges, but children can use their IRA's to help their parents. Grandparents can make penalty free withdrawals to help grandchildren. And grandchildren can use their IRA's to help their grandparents. Our objective is to make this IRA as family oriented, as flexible and as useful as possible. It will go a long way toward promoting opportunity and reliance on self and family. 
Let me stress, this super IRA bill builds on what we did in the Small Business job Protection Act of 1996 and eliminates the unequal treatment of work-at-home spouses that now exists under current law. This bill allows spouses--husbands or wives--who work at home to make equal IRA contributions, up to $2,000, in their own accounts regardless of whether their spouse has an employer pension. 
With the super IRA, we also create a new type of individual retirement account--an IRA in which an individual's contribution is not tax deductible, but where the earnings can be withdrawn tax free if the account is open for at least 5 years, and the account owner is at least 59 1/2 when the funds are withdrawn. 
Mr. President, it's clear to see why this is a bill whose time has come. We have passed it before--in both Houses of Congress--now we must pass it again. It serves the individual. It serves the family. It serves the Nation. It is equitable, restoring spousal contributions to where they should be. It is flexible, offering penalty free withdrawals for life's necessities. It promises the vital capital formation America needs to invest in its future. And it builds upon the very important concept of self-reliance.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I would like to say something about a hero. The distinguished historian Stephen E. Ambrose says that we need to teach our children about heroes. It is by understanding the contributions of great men and women that our youth set standards of achievement for themselves. Common heroes provide a sense of unity and inspire us to aim a little higher than we did the day before. 
This week in Delaware, an outstanding man is being recognized for his more than 50 years of service to community, State, and Nation. His name is Louis J. Amabili. He's a loving husband, a devoted father, an attentive grandfather, and fearless firefighter. He's a man who, for half a century, has risked his life to protect the lives and property of others. 
Louis is my friend, and I am honored to count him among my friends. He is a member of the Hockessin Fire Company and the founding Director of the Delaware State Fire School. For 32 years, he served as director of that school, leading it to its current pre-eminent position as one of the leading fire training facilities in the United States. 
During his tenure, the Delaware State Fire School not only built its facility in Dover, but established training centers in Sussex and New Castle Counties, providing fire training centers within 30 minutes of every fire company in Delaware. 
In additions to these many successes, Louis Amabili also served as president of the New Castle Volunteers Firemen's Association, the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association, and the International Association of Fire Service Instructors. Richard Nixon appointed him to the Fire Prevention and Control Commission, and Delaware Governor Pete DuPont recognized him with the `Order of the First State.' 
Mr. President, Louis Amabili is one of the most well-recognized fire service leaders in America. He served on the Board of Directors of the National Fire Protection Association, and chaired the Fire Officers Professional Qualifications Standards Committee for more than a decade. 
Louis was a member of the International Fire Service Training Association and received their highest honor for his role in fire service training. He chaired the Joint Council of National Fire Service Organizations and helped establish the National Fire Service Professional Qualifications System. 
He serves as a member of the board of directors of the Congressional Fire Services Institute--which I have the honor of co-chairing--and he has received that institute's highest honor, the CFSI Fire Service Person of the Year Award. 
On this occasion, as Louis Amabili retires from a distinguished career, it is my privilege to recognize his years of selfless service, the lives he has touched, the lives he has taught, and the lives he has saved. I want to express my gratitude to his wonderful wife, Carmen, to his son Louis Jr., and to his daughter, Janice, and I want the record to show without question that we do, indeed, still live in a time of heroes. Quite often these valiant men and women live right next door.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Moynihan, introduce a joint resolution that will waive certain provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 relating to the administration's nomination of Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky to the position of U.S. Trade Representative [USTR]. 
Specifically, the resolution will provide a waiver for Ambassador Barshefsky from the application of section 141(b)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by section 21 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. This provision prohibits the appointment of any person to serve as USTR or Deputy USTR, who has directly represented, aided, or advised or foreign government or foreign political party in a trade dispute or trade negotiation with the United States. 
The administration has sought the waiver because of questions surrounding Barshefsky's work for the Government of Canada while practicing law in the private sector. Ambassador Barshefsky was already serving as Deputy USTR when the law went into effect. 
When the Finance Committee acts on her nomination. I will ask it to mark up the joint resolution waiving, in her case, the application of the prohibition to eliminate any questions about her eligibility to serve. Ambassador Barshefsky now enjoys an exemption from this prohibition as Deputy USTR, and I believe that the extension of this exemption by waiver is appropriate. Because this waiver will have the force of law, it must be passed by both the Senate and the House and then presented to the President for signature. 
In past statements, I have expressed my strong support for Charlene Barshefsky's nomination as USTR. She is a very capable public servant, and I fully expect she will distinguish herself as USTR much as she did in her service as Deputy USTR.

Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the comedian Henny Youngman told a joke that highlights America's family friendly tax system. 
`The people who make our taxes are very nice,' he said. `They're letting me keep my mother.' 
Certainly, our tax laws were never quite this bad, but the humor hinted at the fact that the laws were not altogether family friendly. The family, in fact, has taken it right in the pocketbook. More and more, we are hearing that oft-quoted fact that today the average American family spends more on taxes than it spends on food, clothing and shelter combined. Today, many families need a second earner to make ends meet, because too much of their income is taken by Government. 
At the end of World War II, the median income for a family of four was $3,468. At the time, the first $2,667 of income for such families were tax exempt, meaning that three-quarters of median family income was exempt from taxation. 
Over the years, inflation ate away at the value of the standard deduction and personal exemptions. The result was that average families paid more and more of their income in taxes. 
In 1983, the median family income for a family of four was $29,184, but only the first $8,783 of income was exempt from tax--less than one-third. As my good friend and distinguished colleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, has pointed out with these statistics, Government tax policies have adversely affected family life. 
In 1948, a family of four at the median income level paid 2 percent--2 percent--of its income in Federal taxes. Today, a family of four pays 24 percent. 
The time has come to address this disturbing trend. Our tax policies must be changed in light of current realities and critical needs. The American family has been shackled with the excess burden of taxes, I believe, in part because family was such a constant and stable foundation for our society, an enduring unit that could be depended on to carry the burden. But the consequences of that burden and other economic and social factors have succeeded in ravaging the family. Indeed, in society today, the family is under assault, and too many of the policies that are coming out of Washington are increasing the problem rather than providing the solution. 
As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend to work with my colleagues to address these policies and trends, and I laud the spirit of the tax bill introduced today and believe that we can build bipartisan support to advance its overall objectives. The American Family Tax Relief Act is a strong first step towards restoring a sense of economic equilibrium to our families and offers a $500-per-child tax credit, a capital gains tax cut, estate and gift tax relief, and expanded individual retirement accounts. 
At one time or another, each of these proposals has found bipartisan support, and I believe Senators on both sides of the aisle will see this bill as a strong first step toward achieving a mutually shared objective. This legislation sets the spirit for debate. It has the welfare and future of the family at heart. 
As introduced, this bill calls for a permanent $500-per-child tax credit for children under 18 years of age. The capital gains tax cut allows individuals to deduct 50 percent of their capital gains and allows families that sell their homes at a loss to treat it as a capital loss for purposes of a tax deduction. This bill allows an individual to pass up to $1 million tax free as a gift during life or at the time of death. It excludes from estate taxes the first $1.5 million in value of certain qualified family-owned businesses or farm interests and 50 percent of the value in excess of $1.5 million. 
The American Family Tax Relief Act expands the power and availability of IRAs by permitting homemakers to have IRAs, regardless of their spouse's participation in a pension program, and by raising income limits to include more families. It also creates a backloaded IRA that permits after-tax contribution and tax-free withdrawals of earnings after the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2 . This is a provision I have sought for some time, along with allowing for penalty-free withdrawal for education expenses, which is also included in the package. 
Again, Mr. President, this is a strong place to start. I appreciate the leadership--particularly our majority leader Trent Lott--for working with us to establish this foundation. Now we must go about the legislative process, building the consensus we need to see it implemented and achieving the real tax relief American families not only desire but need.
