 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on October 8th I made a statement on the Senate floor regarding the independent counsel law and Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. I want to take the opportunity today to clarify one aspect of that statement to ensure that my words and their import are accurate. 
I stated on October 8th that the so-called Starr Report failed to mention Ms. Lewinsky's testimony `that when she asked President Clinton whether she should get rid of his gifts to her in light of the Jones subpoena, his response was `I don't know' and her testimony that the President said he didn't want to see Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit when she offered to show it to him. The reference in my statement should have been to Mr. Starr's analysis of the evidence which is the key part of his report instead of the overall report. Mr. Starr did make reference to such testimony in the part of the report where he summarized the evidence. My criticism of Mr. Starr's report is that he left such exculpatory evidence out of or dismissed it in the key part of his report which analyzes the evidence and explains why he believes the evidence `may constitute grounds for impeachment.' 
Otherwise it was the imbalanced analysis of the evidence where Mr. Starr failed to address the significance or relevance of exculpatory facts such as these which is so disturbing.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the last few years, I have been working on an issue of great importance to my constituents in Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint is home to an outstanding medical facility, Hurley Medical Center. A subsidiary of Hurley Medical Center owns a nursing home, Heartland Manor, also located in Flint. Heartland Manor has applied to HCFA for Medicare certification which it has been attempting to do since 1994. However, Heartland Manor has been thwarted in this process at every turn by HCFA. I would like to lay out the facts of this situation for the record. 
On July 27, 1989, Chateau Gardens, a nursing home facility, was terminated from the Medicare program. On January 1, 1994, West Flint Village Long Term Care Inc., a subsidiary of Hurley Foundation, purchased Chateau Gardens. The new owner, Hurley Medical Center, is a non profit public hospital with an excellent reputation. State officials requested that Hurley Medical Center take over Heartland Manor. In taking over the facility, the entire staff and management of the nursing home was changed. In 1994 Heartland Manor applied for certification into the Medicare program as a new, prospective, provider. Heartland Manor had never before entered into a Medicare participation agreement and had never been issued a provider number. However, HCFA chose to consider Heartland as a re-entry provider and Heartland was subsequently denied participation into the Medicare program based in large part on violations which HCFA carried over from the previous owner. If Heartland Manor had been treated as a new provider, it would have been approved and would presently be in the Medicare program. 
The complaints that have been cited against Heartland Manor itself are typical of complaints which are lodged against many established and reputable nursing homes. In fact, the citations which Heartland Manor has received have consistently been either deleted or reduced in their determination of scope and severity. I recently reviewed eight complaints that were levied against Heartland Manor in August. None of the complaints represented a determination of a deficient facility practice. 
Hurley Medical Center is planning to build a new complex that will bring state of the art care to an underserved area. The only barrier to this undertaking is Heartland's lack of Medicare certification. Once Heartland Manor receives Medicare certification, Hurley plans to put $10 million into renovating Heartland Manor. 
I believe that Heartland Manor deserves to be treated as a new provider as was determined by Administrative Law Judge Stephen Ahlgren's February 26, 1998 ruling. It is illogical and unconscionable that HCFA is refusing to treat Heartland Manor as a new provider. 
Mr. President, I had hoped that we could have resolved this issue in the appropriations process. It was my intent to offer an amendment to the Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill that would have required that HCFA consider Heartland Manor to be a new provider for Medicare certification purposes. That bill never showed up on the floor but instead was wrapped into an omnibus nonamendable conference report. 
I believe that it is fair and just for the community of Flint that Heartland Manor be treated as a new provider. Providing Heartland Manor with the ability to apply as a new provider will allow the nursing home to receive a fair shot at Medicare certification which is all I am asking for.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, a powerful voice for fairness and compassion fell silent with the untimely death of State Representative Morris Hood, Jr. 
Representative Hood served in the Michigan House of Representatives for 28 years, representing a part of the City of Detroit, my home town. He was the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He distinguished himself in that role by fighting to make education accessible to all people. He strove to give everyone the opportunity to go to school, to obtain a job and earn a living. He was the primary founder of the King-Chavez-Parks initiative, which has provided thousands of dollars in scholarship money to deserving minority students. He was a believer in a positive role for government in our society. He once said, `There are some things government is meant to do. One of the them is to take care of those who can't take care of themselves.' 
Morris Hood, Jr. recognized the painful effects of discrimination and sponsored legislation to give small and minority owned businesses the ability to compete for state contracts. Foremost of all, Morris Hood was a promoter of the City of Detroit. He saw in Detroit a community full of possibilities, inhabited by people full of potential. He saw as his responsibility to use government as one means to unlock that potential. That is why he was such a strong supporter of Focus: HOPE, an organization that is near and dear to my heart. His voice will be dearly missed. Our hearts go out to his children, Denise and Morris III. 
Mr. President I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a passionate legislator, State Representative Morris Hood, Jr.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the untimely death of former Michigan State Representative Perry Bullard. 
Perry Bullard had a sharp mind, and a tongue to match. He has been called outspoken and abrasive. But what he really was was a passionate legislator. He had a fundamental belief in democracy, and the protection of individual liberties. He served in the Michigan House of Representatives for 20 years, rising to the position of Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. His commitment to the rights of individuals in a democracy and the rights of individuals to access their government are evidenced by the bills he sponsored which have become law. He wrote the Michigan Open Meeting Act, the state Freedom of Information Act, the Whistleblower Protections Act and the Polygraph Protections Act. He was behind the passage of the state's Statutory Will Act, which created a fill-in-the-blank will form that allows people to write their own wills. Equally important to the bills he passed were the bills he stopped. He prevented passage of legislation to loosen requirements for police wiretaps, and to allow for police entering homes without a warrant. Perry Bullard was a liberal, and unabashedly so. He believed that being liberal meant protecting liberty. For him protecting liberty meant putting the interests of the public ahead of those of the state. He will be missed and our hearts go out to his wife, Kelly. 
Mr. President I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a passionate legislator, Perry Bullard.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this legislation that authorizes and requests the President to award the Medal of Honor posthumously to Theodore Roosevelt for his actions in the attack on San Juan Heights, Cuba during the Spanish American War. I support this legislation because the letter to the President that Senator Thurmond has put in the Record makes clear the congressional intent in passing this legislation. 
I want to briefly summarize the key points of this letter. It is our intent and understanding that: prior to reaching a decision on awarding the Medal of Honor posthumously to Theodore Roosevelt pursuant to this legislation, the President will seek the advice of the Secretary of the Army; Theodore Roosevelt will be considered for eligibility for the Medal of Honor based on the same standard of merit that was applied to other members of the armed forces who received this medal during the Spanish American War; and the Secretary of the Army will prepare a full and formal record of Theodore Roosevelt's valor, inviting public submissions, with emphasis on the eyewitness and contemporaneous accounts of Roosevelt's battlefield courage. 
Mr. President, military awards and decorations--particularly decorations for valor--are a hallowed part of the military services' core values and traditions, and are critical to the morale and esprit of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. In my view, the decision to award a medal of valor is the prerogative of the military service, not the Congress. That is why Congress recently enacted section 1130 of Title 10 United States Code. This section allows Members of Congress to request a Service Secretary to review proposals for military decorations that were not previously submitted in a timely fashion, but leaves the final determination as to the merits of approving the decoration to the Service Secretary. 
There are many people who believe that Theodore Roosevelt's actions in the attack on San Juan Heights are deserving of this high honor, and that this honor was withheld from him at the time despite the recommendation of his military chain of command. I believe that a complete record should be assembled and the entire issue should be carefully reviewed by the Army. Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera recently pledged to Congress that the Army is conducting this review, and he has agreed to review personally all of the material in this case. 
Mr. President, if an injustice was done to Theodore Roosevelt in withholding the Medal of Honor, it should be corrected. But the legislation we are passing today is advisory and not directive. Before the President reaches a final decision on whether to award the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt, our letter to the President makes clear the congressional intent that he should consult with the Secretary of the Army.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the legislation I introduced along with Senator McCain, the Federal Reports Elimination Act of 1998, S. 1364, was passed by the House earlier this week and is being considered by the Senate under unanimous consent today. The law eliminates 132 outdated reporting requirements imposed on federal agencies by Congress through statute. 
The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight circulated a list of reports that was initially provided by the President in his 1997 budget to all committees having cognizance over the reports recommended for elimination. The committees reviewed the list of reports and identified those reports they deemed essential. The initial list contained over 400 reports; the bill that passed the Senate contained over 200 reports, and the bill as passed by the House contains 132 reports for elimination. The reports that were in the initial proposal that are not included in the bill as passed by the House have been reviewed by both houses of Congress and considered necessary and useful to the Congress in its oversight responsibilities. 
Reports elimination is not a new area of interest in Congress. This is the third piece of legislation we have passed in the last 15 years to eliminate or modify wasteful reporting requirements. Just three years ago, in 1995, Senator McCain and I introduced and got enacted Public Law 104-66, the `Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995,' which eliminated or modified 207 reports. Section 3003 of Public Law 104-66, contains a provision for the termination of all annual, semiannual, or other regular periodic reporting requirements, subject to some exceptions, 4 years after the date of enactment. The bill was enacted into law on December 21, 1995, which means that effective December 21, 1999, reports listed in the House No. 103-7, that are not exempt from termination, will be automatically eliminated on December 21st of next year. Committees and Members should be on notice that if there are reporting requirements now in law that they want to continue that are annual, semiannual or periodic, those reporting requirements will have to be reenacted before the 1999 deadline. It will require an affirmative act of legislation to continue those reporting requirements. While it is important to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary reports, it is equally important to continue those reporting requirements that we think are essential to the work of the Congress. I urge my colleagues to be alert to this upcoming deadline. 
Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his excellent work in helping to get today's legislation passed. I also want to thank Myla Edwards of my office who handled this bill for us as a legislative fellow. Ensuring that this bill covers the intended reporting requirements is tedious work, and Myla demonstrated the care, patience, and commitment necessary to get a bill like this passed.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have serious objections to a provision in the Coast Guard authorization bill that was inserted in the House bill in a managers amendment with no hearings or vote in the Senate. This provision grants a waiver of existing law for a single vessel operating on the Great Lakes and elsewhere against the wishes of both Michigan Senators and other Senators and in circumvention of a Customs Service ruling regarding the type of dredge work this vessel is allowed to perform. 
This waiver is a discriminatory provision which gives special treatment and a competitive advantage to one vessel at the expense of its competitors. 
Mr. President, the granting of this waiver will be detrimental to other dredgers on the Great Lakes and elsewhere who are abiding by U.S. law and U.S. Customs Service interpretations of the Jones Act. The hopper dredge vessel Columbus, the vessel seeking the waiver, was challenged by a competitor for violating the Jones Act because it was performing dredging work that was not allowed under that Act. That challenge was upheld by the U.S. Customs Service. However, instead of abiding by or appealing the Customs Service ruling, a legislative waiver was sought to circumvent that ruling. The waiver was granted by the House, but not the Senate because the Senate passed Coast Guard authorization bill did not contain this discriminatory provision. 
I want to make clear that the only reason this waiver will be included in the final Coast Guard authorization bill is due to the circumstances under which this bill is being considered. Under normal circumstances, I believe the Senate would have removed this provision from the final bill. 
Next year I will introduce legislation to repeal the Jones Act waiver that is contained in the Coast Guard authorization bill, H.R. 2204, for the vessel Columbus. Mr. Chairman, it's my understanding that you and Senator Snowe will work with me to repeal this waiver as early as possible next year.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Yogi Berra, explaining the difficulty of playing in the afternoon sun and shadows of Yankee Stadium's notorious left field is reported to have commented, `It gets late early.' We have before the Senate a huge Omnibus Appropriations and Emergency Supplemental bill which spends more than $486 billion and legislates across a broad range of issues of great importance. We are faced now with this massive, sweeping legislation because the 105th Congress did not do its work. In the 105th Congress, it got late early. 
From the very outset of this Congress, the majority leadership set a slow pace and avoided fully addressing the major issues before the Nation. The 105th Congress failed to reform our campaign finance laws, failed even to debate a patient's bill of rights, failed to act on legislation to reduce tobacco use by our young people, failed to even to take up serious regulatory reform, and failed to address the problems looming in the future of Social Security. In fact, this Congress, failed, this year to even meet its responsibility, under law, to pass a budget, the first time this has occurred. And, it failed to complete work on 8 of the 13 appropriations bills required to run the government. Two appropriations bills were never even debated by the Senate and a third was never passed. On top of that dozens of legislative proposals were added to this bill which were never debated and considered in the Senate. 
The failure to pass the appropriations bills, as required, prior to end of the fiscal year on October 1, led directly to the process that confronts us with this monster Omnibus Appropriations bill today, a four thousand plus page bill which we were unable to even begin reading until yesterday. 
The Founders of our Nation envisioned a careful contemplative legislative process which divided power and sought to assure that the people would be well represented. The process which we have recently witnessed was hardly that. It was a closed process, which greatly excluded Democrats in the House and Senate, enhancing the powers of the Republican leaders of the House and Senate and in an extra-Constitutional fashion bringing the President into a legislative role. Where the Congress was more fully represented, its representation was limited to the members and leaders of the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate. This, despite the fact that legislation was included affecting the jurisdictions of many, if not all, of the authorizing committees. And then, the entire package was lumped together and dumped here on the Senate floor on a take it or leave it basis. Senators have no opportunity to attempt to amend this product, merely to vote yes or no. Never before in my memory have we been confronted with appropriations bills and legislative provisions on so massive a scale which have never even been considered in either the House or Senate. 
The President, and Democrats in the Congress have won some important victories in this bill. However, even as we acknowledge and applaud those victories, we must be mindful of the precedents which we set when we accept this terrible process. Congress should not abdicate its responsibilities. That is why I joined with Senators Byrd and Moynihan in fighting the line-item veto in the courts, a battle which was successful and that is why I am distressed by the process which creates the bill on the floor today, an ad-hoc process at best and a process which effectively disenfranchises many Americans by short-changing their representation, at worst. And that is why, although this legislation contains many provisions of which I approve, and although I applaud the work of the Administration and Democrats in Congress in winning important provisions in this bill, I do not support this wretched process and cannot in good conscience vote for this bill. 
Among the most important positive aspects of this legislation is that the bill provides additional funding for education. The President and Democrats in the Congress put forward an education package early this year. This bill finally acts on key elements of that package, providing a $1.2 billion downpayment on reducing class size by hiring new teachers across the country. In addition, the bill includes $698 million for education technology, the $260 million that the President requested for child literacy, $871 million for summer jobs, a $301 million increase for title I, $491 million for Goals 2000, and a $313 million increase for Head Start. 
Unfortunately, the bill excludes the President's school modernization initiative which would have leveraged nearly $22 billion in bonds to build and renovate schools. Hopefully, we can revisit this issue in the next Congress. 
The bill includes $15.6 billion for National Institutes of Health, $2 billion more than FY'98 and $859 million more than the Administration request, $700 million for Maternal and Child Health Block grant, $9.4 million more than FY98, $105 million for Healthy Start to reduce infant mortality rates, $9.5 million more than FY98, $160 million for breast and cervical cancer screening, $16.2 million over FY98, and $2.5 billion for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, $341 million above FY98. 
Also, I am pleased that the bill contains language which is a first step toward restructuring the home health care payment system. I have been concerned about this problem for some time now. I was an original co-sponsor of Senator Collins' Medicare Health Equity Act of 1998 I believe the provision in the Omnibus bill will create a payment system which is somewhat more equitable than the current system. Under our current system, health care providers in Michigan have too often been penalized for prudent efficient use of Medicare resources, and that is wrong. 
In addition to the nearly six billion dollars in the bill for emergency assistance to farmers who have been hurt by low prices, drought and natural disasters, it contains important money for Michigan agriculture for research on subjects from fireblight to wood utilization. There is a provision to make apple growers in West Michigan, who suffered fireblight-related tree loss in disastrous storms, eligible for the Tree Assistance Program. The bill provides the President's request for an enhanced food safety incentive, plus an increase in the National Research Initiative of $7.4 million for nutrition, food quality and health. Some of these additional funds could and should be used by the Secretary to help develop safer substitutes for pesticides that might be discontinued in implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act. Also, the agreement includes $300,000 for a study of the WIC food package nutritional guidelines finally looking at the benefits of including dried fruit in WIC cereals. 
I am pleased that the bill continues a moratorium on the use of funds to increase the CAFE standard for passenger cars and light-duty trucks. Given the low-price of gasoline and the continued high consumer demand for larger, safer vehicles, which are made most efficiently by U.S. manufacturers, increasing CAFE would only harm the U.S. economy and deprive consumers. 
I am disappointed funding for the National Contaminated Sediments Task Force which I requested was not included in the bill. I am concerned that this will mean that the existing uncoordinated Federal approach will continue to fail in adequately cleaning up contaminated sediments and preventing further contamination. 
There will be an additional $400,000 above the President's request split between operations and acquisition at Keweenaw National Historical Park. The bill includes $800,000 for land acquisition at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, and $2.25 million for the final phase for acquisition of lands from the Great Lakes Fishery Trust as part of the Consumers Energy Ludington settlement. 
This agreement provides the budget request for the International Joint Commission so that negotiations with the Canadians can begin in earnest to prevent the export of Great Lakes water. The bill includes $6.825 million for the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor. Funds ($50,000) for a study of the erosion problems in Grand Marais Harbor are also included. Unfortunately, the bill does not include the Senate's increase of $1 million above the budget request for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to combat the sea lamprey in St. Mary's River. 
Overall, the bill provides the highest level of funding for the Federal Highway Administration in history, at $25.5 billion. That is relatively good news, though, unfortunately, the negotiators have included over $300 million in new highway money to be handed to four different states in an apparent effort to bypass the allocation formulas in TEA-21 that were the subject of much debate earlier this year. 
The bill does contain $10 million for new buses and bus facilities across facilities, and $600,000 for the Capital Area Transit Authority in Lansing. And, $200,000 for a study of the viability of commuter rail in Southeastern Michigan. 
As a cosponsor of legislation to delay implementation of Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Reform bill, which was scheduled to go into effect on September 30, 1998, requiring individuals entering the U.S. at the Canadian border to complete a visa card at the point of entry and register at the time of exit, I am pleased to note that this bill contains language delaying the provision for 30 months. However, it should be repealed, not just delayed. 
I am pleased that the bill does not include the House version of the 
Auto Salvage Title bill since the House dropped the Levin amendment which I successfully attached to the Senate bill. The House version would have preempted state laws that provide tougher consumer protection. 
I am also pleased that while the bill provides funding to replenish the IMF, it will push recipient countries to liberalize trade restrictions. 
Mr. President, let me take a moment to comment on the national security provisions of the omnibus bill. First, I am pleased that this legislation includes the funding the President requested for United States participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 
If Congress had not provided this emergency funding, there would have been disastrous consequences for the readiness and the morale of our forces serving in, and in support of, Bosnia. We all regret that the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Accords has not gone as fast as we hoped it would, but Congress has done the right thing by providing the necessary funding to ensure the readiness of our forces. 
This legislation provides a needed $1 billion in additional readiness funding that the President requested earlier this month for equipment maintenance, spare parts, and recruiting assistance. 
This omnibus bill also contains the funds requested by the President for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, also known as KEDO. This funding is crucial to continuing the Agreed Framework between the United States and North Korea. That agreement is our best hope for denuclearizing North Korea and has provided tangible security benefits to our nation. 
Previous legislation would have effectively prevented the funding of KEDO, and thus given North Korea an excuse for walking away from the Agreed Framework. That could have led North Korea to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, which would cast the Korean Peninsula into an unnecessary and dangerous crisis. This outcome is the right one. 
There are many positive aspects of this legislation for our national security, but I am disappointed that so much of the `emergency' funding in this bill for national security programs is not for readiness and not for emergencies, but for things the Defense Department and the administration never asked for, in particular the addition of $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. Of course, that $1 billion for ballistic missile defense cannot be spent unless the President submits an emergency request for these funds. I fully expect the Administration will exercise good judgement in deciding whether or not to request these funds as an emergency. 
Not only is the money added to this bill for missile defense and intelligence programs going to fund programs that the administration did not request funding for on an emergency basis, again, these are programs for which the administration did not request funding at all. 
Furthermore, with regard to missile defense, adding this funding is in direct contradiction to the testimony of the Secretary of Defense and other senior officials of the Department of Defense who told the Armed Services Committee that while there was one instance in which additional funds could accelerate a program, the Navy Upper Tier program, in general the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization is proceeding as fast as it can with all our missile defense programs and their development is constrained by technology, not funding availability. 
In recent testimony to the Armed Services Committee, senior defense and military leaders told us that the National Missile Defense (NMD) program is going as fast as it can, and that adding more money will not make it go faster. Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre told the Committee: `As a practical matter, we are moving as fast as we can to develop the elements of an NMD system. Even with more money, we couldn't go any faster.' He later emphasized that `this is as close as we can get in the Department of Defense to a Manhattan Project. We are pushing this very fast.' 
During that same hearing, General Joseph Ralston, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Committee that the NMD program enjoys a unique and privileged status within the Defense Department. He said: `I know of no other program in the Department of Defense that has had as many constraints removed in terms of oversight and reviews just so we can deploy it and develop it as quickly as possible.' 
On October 6th, Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified to the Armed Services Committee that the NMD program is being developed as fast as possible and additional money will not speed it up: `I have talked to the head of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and he has assured me that no amount of money will accelerate that timetable . . .' He went on to say that `I cannot accelerate it no matter what we do.' 
So, it is clear that the Defense Department is proceeding as fast as possible to develop a National Missile Defense system, and that more money will not make this go any faster. Furthermore, the Defense Department has told us that only one program could be accelerated with more money. I would note that Congress added $120 million to the Navy Upper Tier program this year to accelerate it, cut funds from other theater missile defense programs and made no attempt in the regular legislative process to add any money for National Missile Defense. So this unrequested missile defense money cannot speed up most of the programs that are now being developed. It is not clear what it would be for, but it is clear that the Defense Department never asked for it. 
A few weeks ago, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were criticized by some of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee during our hearings with them for not speaking up soon enough or forcefully enough about concerns they had with aspects of our defense program. 
Mr. President, it seems a little inconsistent to me for the Congress to criticize the Pentagon for not speaking up and then after they express themselves very clearly on the status of the missile defense program, we ignore their testimony and do the opposite of what they say. 
I am also disappointed that this legislation perpetuates the practice of not fully funding our obligations to the United Nations. It is in the national 
security interest of the United States to have an effective United Nations and strong U.S. leadership within the United Nations. It is especially regrettable that this legislation moves us in the opposite direction in order to score political points on the abortion issue. 
Mr. President, the bill that we are voting on today includes S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, with several amendments. This legislation clarifies and updates the current Vacancies Act, an 1868 law meant to encourage the Administration to make timely nominations to fill positions in the Executive Branch requiring the Senate's advice and consent. 
First, the Vacancies Act provisions in this bill make it explicit that the Vacancies Act is the sole exclusive statutory authority for filling advice and consent positions on a temporary basis. It can no longer be argued that other general statutory authorities creating or organizing agencies supersede the Vacancies Act and authorize temporary officials, who have not been confirmed by the Senate, to serve indefinitely. 
Second, the legislation updates the Vacancies Act in several significant respects to more accurately reflect the realities of today's nominations process. The clearance process for nominees requiring Senate confirmation has become much more complex than it was just a decade ago. Moreover, increasingly adversarial confirmation proceedings have required that background investigations and other steps in the vetting process be more thorough and lengthy. In recognition of this development, the legislation increases the time period that an individual can serve in an acting position from 120 days under current law to 210 days from the date of the vacancy. If a nomination is sent to the Senate during that 210 day period, an individual may serve in an acting capacity until the Senate has completed action on the nomination. Moreover, the legislation gives a new Administration an additional time period of 90 days to submit its nominations in the first year. The legislation allows first assistants, other Senate-confirmed officials, and other qualified high-level agency employees to serve as acting officials. 
Finally, the legislation creates an action-enforcing mechanism to encourage our presidents to promptly submit nominations. Specifically, the legislation provides that if no nomination to fill a vacant position is submitted within the 210 day period, the position remains vacant and any duties assigned exclusively to the position by statute can be performed only by the agency head. As soon as a nomination is submitted, however, the legislation provides that an acting official can assume the job until the Senate acts on the nomination. 
The legislation also includes an amendment I authored to address the problem of lengthy recesses or adjournments. The bill allows a person to serve in an acting capacity in a vacant position once a nomination is submitted, regardless of whether the nomination is submitted within or after the 210 day time period. This is a clarification the legislation makes to current law. However, there was no provision to allow a person to serve in an acting capacity after the 210 day time period if the nomination is made during a recess or adjournment of the Senate. My amendment, incorporated into the enacted legislation as section 3349d, provides that during such long recesses, the President's submission of a written notification that he or she intends to nominate a designated person promptly when the Senate reconvenes triggers the provision of the bill that allows a person to act in the position temporarily until the Senate acts on the nomination. This allows the President to fill a vacant position with an acting person during a long recess of the Senate provided the President has identified the person whose nomination will be submitted when the Senate returns. 
Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues Senator Byrd and Senator Thurmond for their leadership and sponsorship of legislation to amend the Vacancies Act. They identified a serious problem in the failure of Administrations past and present to comply with their responsibilities under the existing law to promptly nominate persons to fill advice and consent positions. They worked diligently to resolve the various conflicts over this legislation, and I am pleased we were able to bring this legislation to a responsible and timely conclusion. 
As we adopt these reforms to the Vacancies Act, we should not forget that as Senators we have a corresponding duty to act promptly and responsibly on nominations once they are submitted by the Administration. We as the Senate rightfully want to protect our Constitutional prerogative to provide advice and consent on nominations. However, we must by the same token discharge these duties in a conscientious and timely manner. 
Mr. President, I also want to mention one piece of legislation which the Congress failed to address this year and which was not folded into this Omnibus Appropriations bill in the final hours of this Congress. I am very disappointed that we were not able to enact legislation to improve the regulatory process this year. Senator Thompson and I sponsored S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement Act. We had two hearings on the bill and marked it up in the Governmental Affairs Committee back in March of this year. It was reported to the full Senate for consideration in May. The Administration signaled its support for the bill with certain agreed-to changes in July. And, we've been urging that the Majority Leader bring the bill to the floor since that time. The bill now has 17 Republican and 8 Democratic cosponsors.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 105th Congress is nearing its conclusion. As we look over the past two years of this Congress, one issue that consumed hours of effort and debate, exposed problems that strike at the heart of our government, and whose ramifications are nothing less than a cancer eating at the body politic, remains unresolved. I'm talking about campaign finance reform. 
In January 1997, this Congress launched multiple investigations into events associated with the 1996 federal elections. Dozens of hearings were held, and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee issued a 9,575 page report. Bipartisan legislation addressing the major issues was introduced and debated on the floor of the Senate and the House. Majorities on both sides of the Capitol voted in support of reform, to strengthen federal election laws. In the Senate, a majority supported the McCain-Feingold bill. In the House, a majority voted for the Shays-Meehan bill. Both bills sought to ban soft money, treat phony issue ads as campaign ads they are, strengthen disclosure, and streamline enforcement. Despite majority support in both Houses, we are ending this Congress without major campaign finance reform. 
It is a tragedy. Given the controversy and criticisms following the 1996 elections, the failure to enact meaningful campaign finance reform is unjustifiable, it is inexplicable, and it is wrong. 
As many of us have said repeatedly, the problem with the 1996 elections is that the vast majority of the conduct most loudly condemned was not illegal--it was legal. Most involved soft money--the solicitation and spending of undisclosed and unlimited election-related contributions, despite laws now on the books requiring federal campaign contributions to comply with strict limits and be disclosed. Virtually all the foreign contributions so loudly condemned involved soft money. Virtually every offer of access to the White House or the Capitol Building or to the President or the leadership of the Senate or the House involved contributions of soft money. 
Opponents of campaign finance reform contend that soft money is not a problem and that the laws on the books do not need reform, but the truth is that legal limits which once had meaning have been virtually swallowed up by the loopholes. The limits on individual, corporate and individual contributions have become a sham. Campaign contribution limits, for all intents and purposes, do not exist. 
The law now states, for example, that no one may contribute more than $1,000 per election to a candidate; no one may contribute more than $20,000 per year to a political party; and corporations and unions may not make federal campaign contributions at all except through a PAC. But the soft money loophole makes these limits meaningless. For example, under the current system, a corporation, union or individual can give $1 million to a candidate's party and have that party televise so-called issue ads in that candidate's district during the election, using an ad that is indistinguishable from candidate ads which have to be paid for with regulated funds. That's exactly what is happening. In the 1998 elections, for example, the Republican National Congressional Committee is conducting a $37 million advertising effort dubbed `Operation Breakout' in which the party runs television ads in areas where there are close Congressional races, claiming that the ads discuss issues and are not efforts to elect or defeat the candidates they mention by name. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is spending $7 million on similar issue ads. These multi-million dollar advertising efforts by both parties demonstrate how the loopholes have effectively erased the campaign limits. 
Other, more fundamental problems with current law are illustrated by a recent court decision, issued October 9th in the Charlie Trie prosecution, holding that the law as currently worded does not prohibit soft money contributions by foreign nationals. 
The plain truth is that the federal election laws now on the books are too often unenforceable. While the Republican leadership rails at the Attorney General for not doing more and threatens her with impeachment for not appointing an independent counsel to investigate the 1996 federal elections, they simultaneously block efforts to clarify and strengthen the very laws that they say they want her to enforce. 
The soft money loophole exists, because we in Congress allow it to exist. Foreign involvement in American election campaigns exists, because we in Congress allow it to exist. Phony issue ads exist, because we in Congress allow them to exist. Weak enforcement of campaign laws continues, because we in Congress allow the current loophole-ridden statutes to continue on the books unchanged. 
It is long past time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility for our share of the blame for this system. We alone write the laws. Congress alone can close the loopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election laws. 
We could have made significant progress during this Congress. The House passed meaningful campaign finance reform. The majority of the Senate voted to do the same, but the Republican leadership brought sufficient pressure to bear so that the chief sponsor of the legislation in the Senate, Senator McCain, withdrew his reform amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. We had 52 votes in favor of his amendment to include the McCain-Feingold legislation in that bill. But rather than allow the majority to prevail, the Republican leadership sank the campaign finance reform effort. And when Senator Feingold announced his intention to offer the same amendment again to force another vote, the leadership chose to pull the Interior bill from the Senate floor. And since the Interior appropriations bill was pulled from the Senate floor in September, there has been no must-pass bill on the Senate floor that supporters could seek to amend to forward the campaign finance reform effort. 
Instead the Interior bill, along with a number of other appropriations bills, have been folded into a so-called omnibus appropriations bill. That means that anyone who wants to enact campaign finance reform by amending the omnibus spending bill would be forced to hold up almost all government appropriations--essentially to shut down the government--in order to debate the issue. 
The question is whether these strong-arm tactics will prevail. Whether, given the obstacles thrown in the path of campaign finance reform, we give up this fight or whether we continue to press on. Senators McCain and Feingold have said publicly that they will be back in the next Congress to fight for reform. I plan to stand with them. I believe the stakes are nothing less than the integrity of our electoral system. 
The time is over for empty rhetoric about the 1996 campaign and the need for stronger enforcement of the campaign laws already on the books. The laws now on the books are too often unenforceable, and everyone knows it. It is time to wipe away the crocodile tears and see clearly what the American people see. Campaign finance reform is long overdue.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senators McCain, Lieberman, Hutchison and twenty-three other Senators, I am sending a letter to the President to express our concern over Iraq's actions and urging the President `after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.' 
At the outset, I believe it would be useful to review the events that led up to the requirement for the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. At the time that Iraq unlawfully invaded and occupied its neighbor Kuwait, the UN Security Council imposed economic and weapons sanctions on Iraq. 
After Iraqi forces had been ousted from Kuwait by the U.S.-led coalition and active hostilities had ended, but while coalition forces were still occupying Iraqi territory, the UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, conducted a review of Iraq's history with weapons of mass destruction and made a number of decisions in April 1991 to achieve its goals, including a formal cease fire. 
With respect to Iraq's history, the Security Council noted Iraq's threat during the Gulf War to use chemical weapons in violation of its treaty obligations, Iraq's prior use of chemical weapons, Iraq's use of ballistic missiles in unprovoked attacks, and reports that Iraq attempted to acquire materials for a nuclear weapons program contrary to its treaty obligations. 
After reviewing Iraq's history, the Security Council decided that `Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless, under international supervision' of its weapons of mass destruction programs and all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers and conditioned the lifting of the economic and weapons sanctions on Iraq's meeting its obligations, including those relating to its weapons of mass destruction programs. 
To implement those decisions, the Security Council authorized the formation of a Special Commission, which has come to be known as UNSCOM, to `carry out immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's biological, chemical and missile capabilities, based on Iraq's declarations and the designation of any additional locations by the Special Commission itself' and requested the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out similar responsibilities for Iraq's nuclear program. Additionally, the UN Security Council decided that Iraq shall unconditionally undertake not to use, develop, construct or acquire weapons of mass destruction and called for UNSCOM to conduct ongoing monitoring and verification of Iraq's compliance. The detailed modalities for these actions were agreed upon by an exchange of letters in May 1991 that were signed by the UN Secretary General, the Executive Chairman of UNSCOM and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq. 
Thus, Iraq unconditionally accepted the UN Security Council's demands and thereby achieved a formal cease-fire and the withdrawal of coalition forces from its territory. 
Mr. President, UNSCOM has sought to carry out its responsibilities in as expeditious and effective way as possible. UNSCOM Executive Chairman Richard Butler and his teams, however, have been confronted with Iraqi obstacles, lack of cooperation and lies. As UNSCOM has noted in its own document entitled `UNSCOM Main Achievements': `UNSCOM has uncovered significant undeclared proscribed weapons programmes, destroyed elements of those programmes so far identified, including equipment, facilities and materials, and has been attempting to map out and verify the full extent of these programmes in the face of serious efforts to deceive and conceal. UNSCOM also continues to try to verify Iraq's illegal unilateral destruction activities. The investigation of such undeclared activities is crucial to the verification of Iraq's declarations on its proscribed weapons programmes.' 
Mr. President, I will not dwell on the numerous instances of Iraq's failure to comply with its obligations. I would note, however, that in accepting the February 23, 1998 Memorandum of Understanding that was signed by the UN Secretary General and Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister, that ended Iraq's prior refusal to allow UNSCOM and the IAEA to perform their missions, the UN Security Council warned Iraq that it will face the `severest consequences' if it fails to adhere to the commitments it reaffirmed in the MOU. Suffice it to say that on August 5, 1998, Iraq declared that it was suspending all cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA, except some limited monitoring activities. 
In response, on September 9, 1998, a unanimous UN Security Council condemned Iraq's action and suspended its sanctions' reviews until UNSCOM and the IAEA report that they are satisfied that they have been able to exercise their full range of activities. Within the last week, Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister refused to rescind Iraq's decision. Throughout this process and despite the unanimity in the UN Security Council, Iraq has depicted the United States and Britain as preventing UNSCOM and the IAEA from certifying Iraqi compliance with its obligations. 
To review, Iraq unlawfully invaded and occupied Kuwait, it's armed forces were ejected from Kuwait by the U.S.-led coalition forces, active hostilities ceased, and the UN Security Council demanded and Iraq accepted, as a condition of a cease-fire, that its weapons of mass destruction programs be destroyed and that such destruction be accomplished under international supervision and permanent monitoring, and that economic and weapons sanctions remain in effect until those conditions are satisfied. 
Mr. President, by invading Kuwait, Iraq threatened international peace and security in the Persian Gulf region. By its failure to comply with the conditions it accepted as the international community's requirements for a cease-fire, Iraq continues to threaten international peace and security. By its refusal to abandon its quest for weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, Iraq is directly defying and challenging the international community and directly violating the terms of the cease fire between itself and the United States-led coalition. 
Mr. President, it is vitally important for the international community to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to allow UNSCOM and the IAEA to carry out their missions. To date, the response has been to suspend sanctions' reviews and to seek to reverse Iraq's decision through diplomacy. 
Mr. President, as UN Secretary General Kofi Annan noted when he successfully negotiated the memorandum of agreement with Saddam Hussein in February, `You can do a lot with diplomacy, but of course you can do a lot more with diplomacy backed up by fairness and force.' It is my sincere hope that Saddam Hussein, when faced with the credible threat of the use of force, will comply with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. But, I believe that we must carefully consider other actions, including, if necessary, the use of force to destroy suspect sites if compliance is not achieved. 
Mr. President, the Iraqi people are suffering because of Saddam Hussein's noncompliance. The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. It is most unfortunate that they have been subjected to economic sanctions for more than seven years. If Saddam Hussein had cooperated with UNSCOM and the IAEA from the start and had met the other requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions, including the accounting for more than 600 Kuwaitis and third-country nationals who disappeared at the hands of Iraqi authorities during the occupation of Kuwait, those sanctions could have been lifted a number of years ago. I support the UN's oil-for-food program and regret that Saddam Hussein took more than five years to accept it. In the final analysis, as the Foreign Ministers of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, comprising the Gulf Cooperation Council stated at the time of the February crisis: `responsibility for the result of this crisis falls on the Iraqi regime itself.'

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when this Congress adjourns the Senate will lose its distinguished Minority Whip, the senior Senator from Kentucky, Wendell H. Ford. Wendell Ford has earned a reputation as the Senate's leader on aviation matters, and has long been one of the most influential members of the Senate on energy and election reform issues. He has battled for campaign finance reform legislation and led the fight for the `motor voter' bill which has expanded voter registration across the country. 
There is no member of the Senate more well-liked by his colleagues than Wendell Ford. However, I have often thought that one of the true measures of a Senator is how she or he relates to staff members, workers and other visitors to our nation's capital. Wendell Ford is among the most beloved. 
I think back to one particular incident. A member of my staff had brought his 5-year old son to work for the day. The staff member, needing to attend an important meeting, left his son to play with paper, crayons and stapler, under the supervision of several co-workers. He returned to find his son no longer at the desk where he had been left. A quick search followed. The young boy was found just outside the office in the Senate hallway where he had stopped Senator Wendell Ford and attempted to sell him a book (artful pages of crayon scribbles, stapled together) for a nickel. Senator Ford was in the act of earnestly requesting two and trying to convince the young man to accept a dime as superior to the requested nickel. 
Last March, Wendell Ford became the longest serving senator from Kentucky in the history of the U.S. Senate when he surpassed another beloved Kentuckian, Alben Barkley. 
Wendell Ford is unsurpassed in many things: He is unsurpassed in his love of family, love of country and love of the U.S. Senate. He is unsurpassed in his efforts to be helpful to new members. How many times he has set aside personal needs or took the time to help newcomers to this body to weather the self doubts or maneuver through the complex procedures. 
Wendell Ford is unsurpassed in his commitment to the hard working families whom are the backbone of this nation and in his passion for the `little guy'. 
Mr. President, to me, the story I told of the little boy in the Senate hall characterizes Wendell Ford. Wendell is a genuine, kind, straight-forward and thoughtful man as well as an effective national leader. All of us in the United States Senate and our families will miss the inimitable Wendell Ford and his wife, Jean.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the Congress ends, Senator Dan Coats of Indiana will retire from the Senate. Dan Coats and I have served together on the Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. 
On the Armed Services Committee, Dan Coats has served ably as the Chairman of the Airland Forces Subcommittee. He is a forceful proponent of a strong national defense and has consistently supported efforts to assure that our men and women in the military remain the best trained and equipped in the world. 
Although Dan Coats was one of the leading proponents in the Senate of the version of the line-item veto which was passed and signed into law, and I joined with Senators Byrd and Moynihan in arguing in an amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court that that legislation was unconstitutional, I greatly respected the diligence and integrity with which he fought that battle. 
My friend from Indiana and I have worked together for several years to prevent our states and communities from becoming dumping grounds for solid waste from other areas of the country and outside the country. He has been a persistent advocate of giving states and local governments the power to stem the flow of garbage flooding into their jurisdictions. I would like to thank him for all he has done on this matter, hopefully paving the way to a resolution which will give more power to the people whose quality of life is being harmed by a free interstate flow of trash. 
Mr. President, Dan Coats' outstanding service as a United States Senator came as no surprise to me or my constituents. He was born and raised in Jackson, Michigan and naturally this has prepared him, like most Michiganders, to excel in life. However, even though he has wandered off to Indiana, and wandered even further into the GOP, I have enjoyed the opportunities which I have had to work with Dan Coats and will miss his friendship next year.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when the 105th Congress adjourns sine die in the next few days, the Senate will lose one of our nation's true heroes, and one of my personal heroes, Senator John H. Glenn, Jr. of Ohio. I rise today to pay tribute to this great American, a man I feel genuinely honored to call my friend. 
All of us old enough to remember John Glenn's flight into orbit around the earth on February 20, 1967 aboard Friendship 7 stand in awe of his courage and strength of character. But this enormous accomplishment followed on a distinguished record of heroism in battle as a Marine officer and pilot. He served his country in the Marine Corps for 23 years, including his heroic service in both World War II and the Korean conflict. And, in turn, his remarkable accomplishment in the history of space flight has been followed by an extraordinary Senate career over the past 24 years, as the only Ohio Senator in history to serve four consecutive terms. 
For the 20 years that I have been in the Senate, I have served side by side with John Glenn in both the Governmental Affairs Committee which he chaired for many years and now serves as Ranking Minority Member and the Armed Services Committee where he serves as the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on Airland Forces. More recently, I have served with John Glenn on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. This has given me a front row seat to watch one of the giants of the modern day U.S. Senate do the hard, grinding work of legislative accomplishment. 
Over the years, John Glenn has led the fight for efficiency in government, for giving the American people more bang for that tax `buck'. He was the author of the Paperwork Reduction Act. He has worked to streamline federal purchasing procedures, and led the fight to create independent inspectors general in federal agencies. He was the point man in the Senate for the Clinton Administration's battle to reduce the size of the federal workforce to the lowest levels since the Kennedy Administration. He and I have fought side by side to block extreme efforts to gut regulatory safeguards in the name of reform and for the passage of a sensible approach to regulatory reform to restore confidence in government regulations. Throughout his career, John Glenn has made himself an enemy of wasteful spending and bureaucracy, yet a friend of the dedicated federal worker. 
John Glenn has steadfastly served as a powerful advocate for veterans. He led the effort to bring the Veterans Administration up to cabinet-level and to provide benefits to veterans of the Persian Gulf conflict. 
On the Armed Services Committee, John Glenn has brought his enormous credibility to bear time and again both in that Committee and on the Intelligence Committee on the side of needed programs and weapons and against wasteful and unnecessary ones like the B-2 bomber. 
Perhaps John Glenn's most important role, however, has been as the author of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act and as the Senate's leader in fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. In this area, the Senate will sorely miss his clear vision, eloquent voice and consistent leadership. 
Mr. President, John Glenn, of course, has remained the strongest and most effective voice in the Senate for the nation's space program. Many of us will be on hand to watch the launch of his second NASA mission later this month, 31 years after the first. At age 77, John Glenn has volunteered to go back into space to test the effects of weightlessness on the aging process, and once again inspires our nation and sets an example for us all--an example of courage, character, sense of purpose, and, yes, adventure. 
No person I've known or know of has worn his heroism with greater humility. John Glenn is, to use a Yiddish word, a true mensch, a good and decent man. 
John Glenn and his beloved wife, Annie, are simply wonderful people. They, their children and grandchildren are the All-American family. My wife Barbara and I will keenly miss John and Annie Glenn as they leave the Senate family.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the United States Senate is about to lose one of the great orators of its long history. I never had the opportunity, of course, to hear Webster or Clay or Calhoun. But, I have heard Dale Bumpers of Arkansas on the Senate floor and it's hard to imagine anyone could have been a more forceful, eloquent, or effective speaker. 
I was reminded recently by a former staff member of one debate in particular. The issue was the proposed real estate development in Northern Virginia at the site of the Second Battle of Manassas. The debate had stretched into a Friday evening and a larger than usual number of Senators were on the floor. The manager had made an effective presentation when Dale Bumpers, the author of a more restrictive version of the bill rose to speak. 
Knowing that many of his colleagues love history, Dale Bumpers using detailed maps laid out the story of the Second Battle of Manassas more than a hundred years ago. Every Senator on the floor that night listened with rapt attention. As he reached the climax of his performance, Dale Bumpers said: 
`Well, I could go on and on, but I want to just simply say . . . I believe strongly in our heritage, and I think our children ought to know where these battlefields are and what was involved in them. And, I don't want to go out there ten years from now with my grandson and tell him about the Second Battle of Manassas . . . and he says, `Grandpa, wasn't General Lee in control of this war here--didn't he command the confederate troops.?' 
`Yes, he did.' 
`Well, where was he?' 
`He was up there where that shopping mall is.' 
Senator Bumpers then said, `I can see a big granite monument inside that mall's hallway right now: `General Lee Stood On This Spot'. Now if you really cherish our heritage, as I do, and you believe that history is very important for our children, you'll vote for my amendment.' 
Rarely in the modern Senate do we see issues actually decided in debate on the floor. But, I suspect that that night I watched Dale Bumpers, with that speech, win the `Third Battle of Manassas'. 
Dale Bumpers has served in the Senate for four terms. He has been one of the most consistent voices for elimination of wasteful government spending. We will all miss his leadership in efforts to reform federal mining law and grazing fees. His battles against the Clinch River Breeder Reactor which he won in 1984, the superconducting super collider which he finally won in 1993 and the space station which he did not win, have become legendary. 
Dale Bumpers and I both take pride in the fact that we were among the few Senators to vote against the Reagan tax cut and unfunded defense buildup of 1981 which together led to the huge deficits of the 1980's. 
Dale would have made a great President because he is a person whose clarity of expression is matched by the courage of his vision and his committment to America's working families. 
Mr. President, when the 106th Congress convenes next year, the Senate will seem an emptier body in the absence of one of its most memorable leaders and all of us in the Senate family with miss Dale and Betty Bumpers.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a colleague and friend who will be leaving the Senate when the 105th Congress adjourns, Dirk Kempthorne, the junior senator from Idaho. 
I have served with Dirk Kempthorne on both the Armed Services and Small Business Committees where I have come to respect his thoughtfulness, dedication and hard work. 
Dirk Kempthorne has been a valuable member of the Armed Services Committee where he has served as the Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee. As Chairman, he has demonstrated a commitment to the welfare of our men and women in uniform and their families. 
Senator Kempthorne joined with Senator Byrd in initiating the Congressional Commission on Military Training to examine issues related to basic training of men and women which will give its best advice to the Congress next year on whether current practices should be changed. 
While I didn't agree with Dirk Kempthorne on many of the specifics of his Unfunded Mandate legislation in 1995, I, like many of my colleagues in the Senate, was greatly impressed with the manner in which he managed the bill and his command of the complex details. 
Mr. Chairman, in the United States Senate we are called upon to work with colleagues of many differing points of view. While Dirk Kempthorne and I sit on separate sides of the aisle and sometimes disagree on issues before the Senate, it has always been a pleasure to deal with him. He is always an able advocate for his position, and always a gracious gentleman.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the distinguished managers of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1998 have agreed to incorporate into the managers' package several provisions which I have proposed. These cover Michigan projects, Great Lakes Basin matters, and contaminated sediments. I am hopeful that the House will expedite passage of this important matter before concluding legislative business this session. 
There are several specific items in the managers' package that will benefit Michigan. They include an Army Corps of Engineers' feasibility study of improvements to the Detroit River waterfront between the Belle Isle Bridge and the Ambassador Bridge, as part of the ongoing revitalization of that area. The Corps will also prepare studies for flood control projects in St. Clair Shores and along the Saginaw River in Bay City to see what types of structures will be necessary to protect shorelines and property. Similarly, the Corps will consider reconstruction of the Hamilton Dam flood control project. And, lastly, the Corps will review its denial of the city of Charlevoix's request for reimbursement of construction costs that it incurred in building a new revetment connection to the Federal navigation project at Charlevoix Harbor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as one who three times in the last 15 years helped to reauthorize the independent counsel law, I have been giving a great deal of thought to the way in which the independent counsel statute has functioned in Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. 
The important purpose behind the statute was to have an objective person investigate credible allegations of violations of criminal law against top Administration officials in order to give confidence to the public that the Attorney General, an appointee of the President, was not put in the position of investigating those allegations. 
But what if the person selected to investigate those allegations by the special court, the three-judge court that appoints independent counsels, violates the restrictions in the very act creating him? What could be done to rein in such an independent counsel? 
Some will dismiss these questions and more specific ones related to Mr. Starr's investigation of the President as defending the President's actions, actions which were irresponsible and immoral, and which by the President's own acknowledgment, hurt those closest to him and which damaged the body politic of the nation. But dismissing such questions would be wrong, because the actions of the independent counsel in this case, and the implications his actions have on the future of the independent counsel law and, indeed, upon the rule of law, demand our attention as well. 
The authors of the law in 1978 attempted to put limits on the independent counsel in the law itself and provided, for instance, that the independent counsel must follow the policies of the Justice Department and that the Attorney General could fire an independent counsel for cause. 
The Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson upheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel law in large part because of those provisions, stating that: 
. . .the Act does give the Attorney General several means of supervising or controlling the prosecutorial powers that may be wielded by an independent counsel. Most importantly, the Attorney General retains the power to remove the counsel for `good cause,' a power that we have already concluded provides the Executive with substantial ability to ensure that the laws are `faithfully executed' by an independent counsel. . . . In addition . . . the Act requires that the counsel abide by Justice Department policy unless it is not `possible' to do so. 
During each of the reauthorizations of the law, in 1983, 1987, and 1994, Congress was concerned about the potential for an open-ended, unlimited investigation by an independent counsel, and we adopted various restrictions in an effort to prevent that. We added, for example, a number of budgetary restrictions, reporting requirements, and a biannual GAO audit. And, we gave the Special Court the authority to terminate an independent counsel if it found the independent counsel's work to be `substantially completed.' 
Those of us involved in those reauthorizations worked in a bipartisan manner to put additional checks and limits on these investigations. We did so in the hope that we could preserve the core principle of the law--that someone outside of the Department of Justice could investigate credible allegations of criminal violations by high level Executive Branch officials. 
Our goal has always been to have independent counsels be like ordinary prosecutors, treating high-level government officials no better and no worse than a U.S. Attorney would treat a private citizen. The specific questions that need to be addressed are whether Mr. Starr has met that standard or whether he has violated important requirements of the independent counsel law, whether he has ignored his responsibility not to abuse the grand jury process and whether he has carried out the duty of all prosecutors as established by the Supreme Court not just to prosecute but to prosecute fairly.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to a remarkable example of community commitment taking place in my home state of Michigan this fall, the United Way Torch Drive. This year will mark the 50th United Way Torch Drive in metropolitan Detroit. 
The Torch Drive was officially kicked off in 1949 by General Mark Clark with a goal of raising $8,550,000. Many people doubted that this goal could be reached. During that period of time, similar fundraising campaigns in other cities were falling short of their goals. However, the people of the Detroit area proved the skeptics wrong, contributing almost $9.3 million to the Torch Drive in three weeks. The metropolitan Detroit Torch Drive was the first such drive in the country, and its success has been a model for cities throughout the country. 
The Detroit Torch Drive has been helped by local and nationally recognized Americans from every walk of life. Business leaders like Max Fisher and Lee Iacocca have lent their time and talents to the Drive. Entertainers like Jackie Gleason, Audrey Hepburn and the Supremes have donated time as well. National and local media stars, from Walter Cronkite to J.P. McCarthy have made themselves available to help. And sports stars, from Hockey Hall of Fame player Gordie Howe to current Detroit Pistons star Grant Hill, pitch in as needed. But as impressive as this list of famous people is, United Way representatives will tell you that it is the dedication and heart of the people of metropolitan Detroit which make the Torch Drive a success year after year. Thanks to them, the United Way is able to support more than 130 agencies in metropolitan Detroit, providing assistance to people in need and solutions to long term problems like homelessness, substance abuse, hunger and mental illness. 
Mr. President, I have many reasons to be proud to be a Detroiter. One of the strongest reasons for my pride is the generosity and warm-heartedness of my neighbors. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking the tens of thousands of people who have made the annual United Way Torch Drive such an overwhelming success over the past 50 years, and in looking forward to the next 50 years of giving help and hope to people in need in metropolitan Detroit.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a true urban innovator, a woman who has devoted her `retirement' years to solving the many challenges that confront urban communities across the nation, Ms. Evelyn Dukes. 
The urban community of northeastern Detroit has greatly benefitted from the work of Ms. Evelyn Dukes. Her involvement with urban and neighborhood renewal began with the `Adopt-A-Park' program. In her neighborhood, Ms. Dukes daily observed gangs, drug users, and loiterers frequenting a parcel of land that was formerly a small community park, but had become a symbol of fear and apathy. Fortunately, Ms. Dukes did not view Brookins Park in the same manner. As an organizer for numerous Block Clubs and Neighborhood Watch Groups, Ms. Dukes saw the area as an opportunity to bring the community together and reclaim a vital recreational park. By calling on organizations from the city's Park and Recreation Department to the Detroit Piston Basketball Organization, Ms. Dukes' vision for Brookins Park became a reality. Today the land is used by community residents for picnics, reunions, and birthday parties, and Ms. Dukes is on to her next project, Skinner Park. 
Ms. Dukes is also involved in her neighborhood organization and is an active member in the Citizen Band Radio Patrol organization. While on patrol, she documents dangerous situations and possible criminal actions. Evelyn is President of the Ninth Precinct Community Relations Board and is very involved in the City Wide Roundtable, an organization of Detroit leaders who meet on a regular basis to discuss issues and solutions involving public service, safety, and awareness. 
At 73, Evelyn Dukes' personal commitment to her neighborhood and city are an inspiration to everyone. She is truly a model for community involvement, and her efforts and achievements clearly set Ms. Dukes apart as an exemplary citizen. She has been honored by being selected as only one of seven people in the country to receive the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. 
I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Evelyn Dukes on receiving this award and thanking her for the stalwart dedication she has shown to improving her community.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend of mine and a great leader in my home state of Michigan, Bruno Nowicki. On October 11, 1998, Bruno's friends and family will help him celebrate his 90th birthday at a celebration at the Polish Century Club. 
Bruno Nowicki is well known in Michigan and in his native Poland for his efforts to commemorate and celebrate the contributions of Polish people to the United States and to the world. He has designed monuments to Polish-American heroes of World War II and Vietnam and to Revolutionary War Generals Pulaski and Kosciuszko. Bruno Nowicki has also been a strong supporter of public libraries, and served on the Board of Governors of the Detroit Public Library from 1971 until 1994. He melded his interests in promoting Polish culture and supporting public libraries by arranging for statues, mosaics and busts of prominent figures in Poland's history to be displayed in the Detroit Main Library and the Hamtramck Public Library. Bruno worked with artist Zygmunt Dousa of the University of Krakow to design the Polish Room of the Ethnic Conference and Study Center at the Wayne State University in Detroit. He is a co-founder of the Polish Riverfront Festival, which provides assistance to children's hospitals in Poland. 
I was proud to work with Bruno Nowicki in 1993-1994 on an issue especially close to his heart, promoting chess to students in schools. An avid chess player who participates in (and has won) tournaments in the U.S., Bermuda and Cuba, he believes that the skills children develop by learning to play chess can be applied to everyday life. A four-year study of school chess players confirmed Bruno Nowicki's belief. The study found that chess helps children build self-confidence and self-worth, dramatically improves children's ability to think rationally, and results in higher grades, especially in English and Math. Bruno provided me with important information which I used in drafting an amendment to the 1994 Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which allows State educational agencies to use certain Title III funds to promote instruction in chess as a tool for teachers to use to motivate students to develop critical thinking skills, self-discipline and creative resolution methods. 
Mr. President, Bruno Nowicki has demonstrated time and again his commitment to his community. He is truly a person who has touched the lives of thousands of people. I know my colleagues join me in wishing Bruno a happy 90th birthday and in commending him for his remarkable dedication to community service.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased Senators Lott and Gorton have accepted my amendment to the substitute to S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act of 1998. Senators Feinstein and Bryan have joined me in offering this amendment which will remedy concerns that the substitute bill would have preempted state laws that provide greater consumer protection with regard to the titling of salvage vehicles. 
My colleagues may have heard from the state attorneys general about their opposition to the state preemption impact of the substitute bill. Mr. President, I have worked with the state attorneys general to address their concern. Simply put, my amendment will allow states with higher standards to keep them.

Mr. LEVIN. First, Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to join with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in bringing to the floor the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999. It is truly a fitting honor for our chairman that this conference report which is named in his honor has been signed by not only all the Senate conferees on both sides of the aisle, but also by all conferees from the House National Security Committee on both sides of the aisle. 
I am sure that I speak for all of our colleagues in saying just how much we appreciate the leadership that Senator Thurmond has provided on this bill, the fair and even-handed manner in which he has managed the committee not just on this bill, but as long as he has been a chairman of this committee, as well as how much we appreciate the lifelong dedication that he has brought to the national defense. We look forward to many, many more years of working with him. He has expressed his appreciation for having the bill named after him. I just want to tell him that it is my very strong personal feeling that it has been a pleasure for me to work with him to bring forward measures such as this that are so critical to the national defense. 
We will miss him as chairman, but we will not miss him as a member of the committee, because he will continue to be an active member of the committee. 
Mr. President, this is also the last defense authorization act for several of our colleagues on the committee, as Senator Thurmond has noted. Senator Glenn, Senator Coats and Senator Kempthorne will all be leaving us at the end of this year. All three have made great contributions to the work of the committee and to the national security of our country. They will be greatly missed, and I know many of us will have more to say about that during the next few days. 
The conference report that we bring to the Senate today is the product of more than 6 months of work, including a full 2 months in conference with the House. Overall, we have reached a bipartisan conference report that advances the security of our country in the best interests of the men and women in uniform. I am particularly pleased that on a series of issues that were important to the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy and to the administration, we have been able to eliminate or modify positions that would have led to a veto. 
First, we eliminated a series of House provisions that would have barred any exports of satellite or related technology for launch in China, and also the provision which we eliminated also would have prohibited participation in launch failure investigations. So we have eliminated a number of provisions. However, the conference report does provide that the licensing of applications to launch satellites in China will be returned to the State Department. However, that return will be delayed until March 15, 1999. In the interim, there is a requirement for the Secretary of State to plan for a more timely and orderly licensing process. 
The only effective difference since January of 1996 between the licensing being done by State or Commerce has been the long delays that exist in the State Department's processing of license applications. The delay in the effective date of the transfer from Commerce to State will give the administration time to take steps to speed up the State Department's licensing process and provide the new Congress with an opportunity to review the transfer in a less politically heated atmosphere after the elections. 
It is critical for American security that American satellites continue to be launched in large numbers, both because, as Senator Bob Kerrey has pointed out, most of our intelligence information comes from open sources, such as satellites, and because the satellite transmission of programming is critically important to forcing open closed societies whose dictatorships threaten American interests. The compromise embodied in the bill before us should protect our national security interests by helping to ensure that American satellites will continue to be launched in appropriate numbers and in a timely and secure manner. 
Second, we have eliminated a House provision that would have prohibited the Secretary of Energy from even considering the less costly of the two options for renewed tritium production. It would have achieved this result by prohibiting the production of tritium in a commercial facility, even though tritium is widely used in commercial products and is not a special nuclear material like uranium or plutonium. 
The provision in the bill will provide a level playing field for the selection of an option for future tritium production by delaying the implementation of the decision made by the Secretary of Energy to select either option until October 1, 1999, the beginning of the next fiscal year. This approach will provide Congress an opportunity to review the Secretary's decision--whatever it may be--before it is implemented. It will have no adverse impact on our national security because we will not need a new source of tritium for several years. The Secretary's decision could not be implemented in any case until funding is approved by Congress, and Secretary Richardson has indicated that delaying implementation of his decision until October 1 of next year will have `minimal impact' on future tritium production. 
Third, we eliminated a House provision that would have prohibited gender-integrated training at the basic training level in all three military services. This prohibition was opposed by the uniformed military, opposed by a majority of the Senate, and it would have led to a veto by the President. The bill does contain provisions that, (a), direct the Secretaries of the military departments to provide for separate and secure housing for male and female recruits with sleeping areas separated by permanent walls and served by separate entrances; and, (b), prohibit afterhours access to sleeping areas by unescorted members of the opposite gender. These provisions are consistent with, and would in fact codify, the current policies of the Department of Defense. 
Fourth, a Senate provision was dropped that would have made it harder for the Secretary of Defense to downsize and close unneeded military facilities. I recognize that many Members on both sides of the aisle supported this provision. However, the provision was strongly opposed by the civilian and uniformed 
leadership of the Department of Defense and would have led to a veto. I am personally hopeful that in the next session of Congress we will at least authorize one additional round of base closings. 
Mr. President, I am also pleased with the outcome on several issues that have been important to the Department of Defense, including the adoption of a Senate provision authorizing Bosnia funding on an emergency basis; the decision to fund cooperative threat reduction programs at a level close to the one proposed by the administration; and, most importantly, the decision to fund a 3.6-percent pay raise for our men and women in uniform. Nothing is more important to our national security than their well-being and high morale. 
Mr. President, this conference report is the product of hard-fought compromise, and I cannot say, of course, that I support every provision in it. 
I would have preferred that we not fund seven C-130s and one F-16 that the Department of Defense says it doesn't want and doesn't need. 
I would have preferred that we not cut into the readiness of our Armed Forces by reducing the Department's operations and maintenance accounts below the administration's budget request. 
I would have preferred that we not include a House provision that unfairly singles out a single facility by prohibiting the China Ocean Shipping Company from leasing a facility at the Long Beach Shipyard that was closed in the last base closure round. 
I would have preferred that we not reach outside of our jurisdiction to resolve a complicated tax dispute between two States. 
On balance, I think we have succeeded in reaching a fair resolution on the issues in the conference. I am convinced that we have a very solid compromise of the major issues, and I hope the President will sign the bill. 
Again, I will conclude by thanking our chairman, Senator Thurmond, for the open and the bipartisan manner in which he conducted the conference on this bill. Senator Thurmond and his staff have made every effort to include the minority at every stage of the deliberations. I also thank the chairman and ranking minority member of the House National Security Committee, Congressman Spence and Congressman Skelton, for their cooperation in bringing the conference to a successful conclusion. 
Of course, none of this could have been accomplished without our staffs. I want to express the appreciation we all feel on the committee to the staffs of the Armed Services Committee--both the majority and minority staffs--for the extraordinary effort they put into this bill and this conference. It was a long, long conference. It just simply would not have been possible to achieve the result we did without the outstanding work of David Lyles, Les Brownlee, and their dedicated supporting cast. I also extend my thanks to the staff of the House National Security Committee and the House and Senate legislative counsels for their help in preparing this large bill. 
Mr. President, it is a good conference report. It strengthens our national security. I know our colleagues will be pleased to join me in supporting the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.  
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, after whom this defense authorization bill is named. 
Section 1512 of this bill requires the President to certify to Congress 15 days prior to any export to the People's Republic of China of missile equipment or technology, as defined in the Annex to the Missile Technology Control Regime, that such export is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry, and that such export will not measurably improve China's missile or space launch capabilities. 
The intent of this section is not to prevent the export of commercial communications satellites to the PRC, consistent with U.S. law and national security and foreign policy interests, nor to harm our domestic satellite industry. The purpose of this section is to ensure that exports of such satellites and related technology to China will not harm U.S. security. As long as sufficient export controls are in force and are being enforced, such exports are consistent with our national security. 
Furthermore, this certification requirement for exports to China is not intended to prevent the export of commercial technology for emergency repair of civilian equipment, such as navigation systems required for safe flight of passenger aircraft. If a U.S.-made aircraft requires emergency repair or replacement of its navigation system while in China, we would not want to delay such required repair unreasonably. 
I wish to ask the Chairman if he shares this view of Section 1512.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate the outstanding and continuing service of a fine Air Force officer, General William F. Moore, USAF. 
For almost three years, General Moore has served as Director of Special Programs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, he was responsible for coordinating planning, budgeting, and management of very sensitive Department of Defense special access classified programs. 
In fulfilling these duties, General Moore has had frequent contact with the leadership and members of the defense oversight committees in Congress. I believe that General Moore has executed these duties in an exemplary manner. General Moore always operated in a very forthcoming manner, was sensitive to the needs of Congressional oversight committee members, and made great strides in improving the Congressional understanding and coordination of special access programs. I would point out that our former colleague, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, also recognized this track record by awarding General Moore the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. 
General Moore also had a distinguished career in the Air Force before coming to that position. Among his many assignments, he has served as the Program Executive Officer for Bombers, Missiles, and Trainers within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition; as the System Program Director for the Small ICBM; and in various positions with the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-air Missile (AMRRAM), Peacekeeper Missile, and Drone and Remotely Piloted Vehicles programs. 
General Moore is a graduate of the Air Force Academy, the Air War College, and the Defense Systems Management College. He also took an M.B.A. degree from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania. 
General Moore has been recently named as Deputy Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a very important position. There is no doubt in my mind that General Moore will be as diligent a steward in his new position as he has been as Director of Special Programs. We are all fortunate to have a man of his professionalism and ability in these positions, and I want to thank him both for his many years of service and wish him every continued future success.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-1933. During the period 1932-1993, the repressive policies of the government of the former Soviet Union, directed by Joseph Stalin, led to the deaths of at least seven million Ukrainians. Stalin's war on the Ukraine sought to eradicate its unique religious, cultural and political characteristics for the purpose of achieving complete Soviet domination. 
For the most part, the famine and its victims can be traced to the forced collectivization of agricultural production. Collectivization was central to Stalin's efforts to break the will of the Ukrainian land-owning peasants and a conscious part of his plan to bring about an end to Ukrainian nationalism, ultimately leading to total Communist control. Stalin's forced collectivization of agriculture changed the face of Ukraine. Stalin repeatedly raised the quota productions for agriculture, so much so that the vast majority of Ukrainian agricultural production was being transferred from the region. These increased production quotas for exports depleted the amount of food for the people of Ukraine. The quota increases began a vicious cycle of less food which led to the exhaustion of farm workers, which in turn led to even smaller harvests and ultimately famine. Harvest yields were further diminished when the peasants were forced to abandon their accustomed ways of farming and use collectivized farming techniques. 
During this period, food became so scarce that people were left to scavenge for what little they could find. There are horrible accounts of people being sentenced to death for stealing sheaves of corn. The fields once owned and worked by the peasants were now supervised by armed guards, while an environment of suspicion and fear consumed the Ukrainian people. Individuals who did not quickly show the signs of starvation were often accused of hoarding food. At the same time that the Ukrainian people were risking their lives for the smallest amount of food to sustain themselves and their families, the Soviet Union was denying that there was a crisis and refusing to allow assistance from international relief organizations to be delivered in the region. Throughout this turbulent period, Stalin further exacerbated the situation by working to turn Ukrainians against one another. The famine followed an assault on the Kulaks, or petty bourgeoisie, and a purge of the Ukrainian intelligentsia. 
While this tragic period of Ukrainian history is often difficult to revisit, we must do so in order to ensure that the world will not to endure a tragedy such as this again. When children in the United States study the dark periods of human history, it is important that the Ukrainian famine of 1932-1933 be included. It is also important to note that despite the tragedy the people of Ukraine endured at the hands of Stalin's government and many years of Soviet domination, Ukraine has re-emerged with its vibrant cultural and religious traditions intact and strong. 
Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor this resolution commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine and I urge all Senators to show their support.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, H.R. 3412, as amended by the Senate Small Business Committee, has broad bipartisan support. I am particularly pleased that H.R. 3412 makes permanent the Small Business Innovation Research Program SBIR, which was originally established in 1982 and reauthorized and expanded in 1992. This competitive program has a well deserved reputation for success and it is fitting that it be made permanent. 
H.R. 3412 also addresses a problem pointed out by GAO in its April, 1998 SBIR report regarding the lack of uniformity in defining the term `extramural budget'. GAO found that participating agencies had different interpretations of what should be included in their extramural research budgets. This is a problem because a participating agency's extramural budget is the base from which that agency's SBIR funding is calculated. To resolve any discrepancies, H.R. 3412, as amended by the Senate Small Business Committee, directs OMB to define the term `extramural budget' and ensure that it is applied uniformly throughout the government. 
Finally, this bill includes a provision I authored which authorizes existing procurement outreach programs of the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to conduct program outreach efforts for the SBIR program out of funds that are already available to them.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Travelers Aid Society of Detroit, which is celebrating its 75th Anniversary on October 15, 1998. Travelers Aid has been an important part of Metropolitan Detroit's network of community service organizations since its inception in 1923. 
Travelers Aid was first created as an arm of the YWCA to assist young women who had recently settled in Detroit. In 1923, as the City of Detroit was growing by leaps and bounds, the Travelers Aid Society of Detroit was chartered as an independent institution to serve people who became stranded or lost. Since its chartering as an independent institution, Travelers Aid has broadened its activities from its original mandate to include assisting men and women, the homeless, runaway youths, victims of domestic violence, children traveling alone, the physically challenged and travelers at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Travelers Aid has developed innovative programs, like Homeward Bound and the Supportive Housing Opportunities Program, which have helped thousands of people recover from homelessness. Each year, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Travelers Aid helps 250 runaway children find their way back home and introduces 150 adopted babies from foreign lands to their new American families. Along with the City of Detroit and the Lovelight Foundation, Travelers Aid sponsors the annual `A Special Gift' Christmas party for 2,500 homeless children at Detroit's Cobo Hall. 
On October 15, 1998, many people from my hometown will join together at the historic Wayne County Building to celebrate Travelers Aid's 75 years of service to the community. This celebration is being chaired by N. Brewster Broder, with the assistance of Honorary Chair Nettie Seabrooks and Honorary Co-Chairs Charlie Williams and Larry Givens. Community Service awards will be given to four outstanding individuals whose commitment to improving their community is truly inspiring. The award recipients are Aaliyah, an Oscar nominated recording artist; Delphine Fairbanks, a tireless volunteer at Detroit Metropolitan Airport; Geneva Williams, COO of United Way Community Services; and William McKenzie of Michigan Rehabilitation Service. 
Mr. President, the men and women of the Travelers Aid Society of Detroit exemplify so many of the qualities that make our country great. Their dedication to their community, compassion for those in need and innovative problem-solving skills affect the lives of tens of thousands of people each year. I invite my colleagues to join me in expressing gratitude to the Travelers Aid Society of Detroit for the important services they have provided for the past 75 years, and in offering congratulations to the four Community Service Award recipients on this special occasion.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I, too, think we need to amend the Federal Vacancies Act, because the current act has too many loopholes and insufficiently protects the constitutional prerogative of the Senate to have Senate-confirmed officials serving in top positions in the executive branch. It is because I believe we should amend the Federal Vacancies Act that I voted to report the bill out of committee and, along with, I think, all or most of our colleagues, voted to proceed to Senate consideration of the bill. 
But I will oppose cloture on the bill at this time, because if we adopt cloture now, it would mean that relevant amendments could not be considered. After cloture, only what are called germane amendments, as we all know, can be considered. That is a very narrow and a very strict rule. And for us to preclude the possibility of relevant amendments, relevant to this subject, being offered, without the opportunity even to offer those amendments, it seems to me, does not do justice to this subject. 
I commend Senator Byrd and Senator Thompson for bringing this issue to our attention. Senator Byrd was the witness who appeared before our committee--and the Chair is also a distinguished member of this committee--and brought to our attention, very forcefully, the current loopholes that exist, at least the alleged loopholes that exist, in the Federal Vacancies Act. 
These loopholes have been used by Presidents--I think inappropriately used. And surely Senator Byrd has laid out a very powerful case in this bill. And Senator Thompson and others laid out a very powerful case that we should close those loopholes. But we should close those loopholes considering relevant amendments in the process. And obtaining cloture immediately upon proceeding to the consideration of the bill will preclude the consideration of relevant amendments. 
The bill before the Senate would make several important changes to the current Vacancies Act to close a number of those loopholes. First, it would make clear that the act is the sole legal statutory authority for the temporary filling of positions pending confirmation. Both Senator Byrd and Senator Thompson have stated forcefully why it is so important for us to close that loophole. In our judgment, that loophole does not exist. I think in the opinion of probably most Senators that loophole does not exist. But, nonetheless, whether it is a real one or an imaginary one, it has been used by administrations in order to have people temporarily fill positions pending confirmation for just simply too long a period of time, which undermines the Senate's advice and consent authority. 
So the first thing this bill would do would be to make clear that the act, the Federal Vacancies Act, is the sole legal statutory authority for temporarily filling positions pending confirmation. Agencies would no longer be able to claim that their organic statutes trump the act and empower them to have acting officials indefinitely. 
Second, the act's time period authorizing an individual to be acting in the vacant position would be increased to 150 days from the date of the vacancy. The current act provides for 120 days, and it is unclear on whether the period runs from the date of the vacancy or the date a person assumes the acting position. 
Finally, the bill would provide for an enforcement mechanism for violations of the time period. And that is really an important point, because without some kind of an enforcement mechanism, these violations can take place without being corrected. 
So the enforcement mechanism provides that if no nomination is submitted within the 150-day period, the position would have to remain vacant and any duties assigned just to that position by statute could be performed only by the agency head. As soon as a nomination is submitted, the bill provides that an acting official could then assume the job temporarily until the Senate acts on the nomination. 
While the staff was making efforts to try to negotiate a unanimous consent agreement and perhaps a managers' amendment for Senate consideration of this bill, a cloture motion was filed. In my judgment, it was filed prematurely. And now if, indeed, this cloture motion passes, amendments which are relevant to this subject, important amendments, relevant to this subject, would not be subject to consideration and debate by the U.S. Senate. 
Again, I am one who would like very much to see a reform of the Vacancies Act and to see that reform enacted in this Congress. Senator Byrd and Senator Thompson and others deserve the thanks of all of us for bringing the Senate's attention to this issue. Senator Byrd, again, took the lead in prompting the Governmental Affairs Committee to hold a hearing on this topic last March and pointed out the Justice Department's regrettable practice of having persons serve as acting officials in top-level positions for significant periods of time without Senate confirmation. 
By having acted, officials serve in this way; and ignoring the purpose of the existing Vacancies Act, the Department delays or avoids Senate confirmation. 
The Vacancies Act was originally enacted in 1868. Its whole purpose is to encourage the President to submit nominations in a timely fashion. In 1988, the Governmental Affairs Committee amended the act to preclude an agency--in particular, the Justice Department--from avoiding Senate confirmation and the requirements of the Vacancies Act by arguing that the act did not apply to their Departments. Unfortunately, the technical language that the committee used back then to accomplish this didn't do the job, at least in the eyes of the Department of Justice, and some agencies--and the Department of Justice, for one--have continued to operate outside of the intent of that law. 
The bill before the Senate, then, attempts to rein in agencies like the Justice Department. It also attempts to set clearer guidelines on what agencies can and can't do with respect to vacancies, and it creates an action-enforcing mechanism that will encourage Presidents to act promptly on submitting nominations. 
Now, in the eyes of many Members of this body, the Senate also has an important responsibility to act promptly on the nominations once they are received. That is why it would be relevant to debate the question as to whether or not a bill which amends the Vacancies Act to force the President to make timely nominations--in order to evade the clear constitutional role of the Senate in advising and consenting to such nominations--that such a bill could also appropriately address the Senate's duty to act on such nominations once they are submitted. That doesn't mean approve the nominations, that simply means to act on those nominations. 
When we take up this subject of nominations, we need a bill which will ensure that nominations are made in a timely way, but we also have to avoid crafting an unrealistic bill that could leave many key positions vacant. I don't think any of us want to do that. That is why this bill extends the time that a new administration would have in order to fill these positions without triggering the action-enforcing mechanism. 
We need to recognize, however, that this vetting process for nominees--the exploratory process, the FBI checks--has become much more complicated and complex than it was even a decade ago when the act was last amended. Increasingly adversarial confirmation proceedings have required that background investigations and other steps in the vetting process are more thorough and lengthy. 
We asked the Congressional Research Service to look at the length of time it took for the first Clinton administration to make nominations and the time for Senate confirmation of those nominations, and to compare those numbers to the time it took the first Reagan administration in 1981 to make those nominations and for the Senate to act on those nominations. The results reflect that both the nomination and the Senate confirmation process are simply taking longer. In 1981, President Reagan took an average of 112 days to submit a nomination; President Clinton, in 1993, took an average of 133 days to make a nomination. 
In addition to Presidents taking longer because the process simply takes longer, the Senate is also taking much longer to confirm nominees. In 1981, the Senate took an average of 30 days to confirm nominees; in 1993, the Senate took an average of 41 days to confirm Clinton administration nominees. So the reality that it takes a greater period of time for these nominations to be made should be reflected in the bill. It is reflected by a 30-day extension for the time period, which we have all referred to. Whether or not that is enough is subject to debate, and there will be amendments on that subject as well. 
As I have indicated, in addition to crafting a bill that reflects today's more adversarial nominations climate, there are many who feel strongly that we in the Senate should acknowledge our own responsibility to act on nominations that we receive from the administration. We, in the Senate, rightfully want to protect our constitutional prerogative to advise and consent on nominations and not to have positions filled by people whose nominations have not been confirmed by the Senate. By the same token, we should discharge our duties in a prompt matter once those nominations are submitted to us. 
Currently, there are many, many examples of the Senate failing, both in committee and on the floor, to act on nominations. We are appropriately critical of the administration for not sending up nominations in a timely way, but it is also appropriate for us as an institution to act one way or the other on those nominations once they are received. It is the desire of some of our colleagues to offer amendments that would require the Senate to act in a timely fashion on nominations, both by considering them in committee and by requiring a vote on them on the Senate floor. Again, not a positive vote guaranteed, just a vote. 
Madam President, I think this bill moves us in the right direction. It is a bill that would close loopholes which many of us did not think even existed but which are being utilized by administrations to make appointments of these temporary people for long periods of time without submitting the nominee's name to the Senate for advice and consent. There are many provisions about which concerns have been raised, and it is perfectly appropriate, I believe, for those issues to be debated and to be resolved here on the Senate floor. 
I also would plan on offering an amendment to provide for a cure of a violation; that is, to allow an official to temporarily act in a vacant position once a nomination has been submitted, even if that nomination is submitted during a long recess. The bill is not clear, in my judgment, as to what happens when the 150-day period runs prior to, for instance, a sine die recess but when the intention to nominate a particular person is submitted to the Senate to the extent that is permitted during a sine die recess. 
It would seem to me that, just as the bill appropriately holds the 150-day period when a nomination is submitted and permits somebody to serve in that capacity where there is an intent to nominate, so if the 150-day period happens to run out before a recess but the intention to nominate a particular person is submitted to the Senate during that recess, then also a temporary appointment ought to be permitted. 
Madam President, I will offer an amendment at an appropriate time to have a person as an acting official permitted after the 150-day period has expired, when a recess occurs and the nominee or a nominee's name is submitted to the Senate during that recess. 
There are a number of concerns which a number of our colleagues have raised with the bill as drafted, and some of these concerns, again, would be reflected in relevant amendments but which are not technically germane and would be precluded and foreclosed if cloture were invoked. 
For example, the bill restricts who can be an acting official, in case of a vacancy, to a first assistant or another advice and consent nominee. That is too restrictive a pool of acting officials and does not give this administration, or any administration, the ability to make, for instance, a long-time senior civil servant within the agency an acting official. Such senior civil servants may be the best qualified to serve as acting officials. First assistants may not exist for all vacant positions. Further, designating another advice and consent nominee to serve as an acting official takes that person away from the duties of their regular job. The category of persons who can act needs to be made larger, in my judgment, and in the judgment of others who will be offering amendments along this line--who, at least, want to offer amendments along this line, assuming that they are afforded the opportunity to do so. 
This provision that I have referred to, the restriction that I have referred to, may be operating particularly harshly at the start of a new administration when many vacancies exist. At such times, not many first assistants may be holding over from previous administrations. Therefore, the first assistant slots may be empty, also. Similarly, few other Senate-confirmed officers will exist that the President could choose from to serve in a vacant position. One of our colleagues intends to offer an amendment to allow qualified civil servants to be acting officials, also. And again, this amendment, like some of the other amendments that are sought to be offered here, may not be technically germane and can be foreclosed after cloture. 
I don't think it is appropriate that relevant amendments should be foreclosed. That is why I am somebody who believes we need to amend the Federal Vacancies Act in order to close the existing loophole, and in order to protect the constitutional prerogative of the President, and I also want to protect the prerogative of Senators to offer relevant amendments. That is the issue we are going to be voting on--whether or not Senators ought to have an opportunity to offer relevant amendments, or whether they should be precluded from doing that by cloture being invoked so prematurely, when a bill has just been brought to the floor, and then being denied the opportunity to offer amendments on issues that are clearly relevant to this issue. 
So the bill is an important one. The issue is an important one. I think we are all in the debt of the sponsors for bringing this bill to the floor. It is appropriate that the Senate debate this bill and that Senators who have relevant amendments, although not technically germane, be offered the opportunity to offer those amendments, have them voted on, and to have these issues, some of which I have discussed, resolved. 
I hope we will vote against cloture and that we will proceed to continue on the bill and have people offer amendments--hopefully relevant amendments--and to try to work out a unanimous consent agreement to see if we can't come up with a list of relevant amendments that people could offer on this subject so that they would not be foreclosed, being in a postcloture situation, from offering amendments that are relevant to this important issue, but not technically germane. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am submitting for the Record and my colleagues' consideration an amendment to S. 2131, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1998, which I hope will be included in that legislation. It is a relatively simple measure. Contaminated sediments are a serious problem in our nation's waterways and ports and a potential threat to human and environmental health. S. 2131 presents a long overdue and perfectly appropriate opportunity to begin addressing this problem. 
The EPA submitted a report to Congress this year on the quality of sediments across the nation, pursuant to WRDA of 1992. The report shows that we have cause to worry. Ninety-six areas of probable concern are identified where public and environmental health may be threatened by contaminated sediments. Yet, we have at least six different Federal statutes with implementation responsibilities spread over seven Federal agencies, including a great many specific provisions regarding the Army Corps of Engineers' duties in recent WRDAs, two major programs--Superfund and Clean Water--within EPA, and numerous state and local governments coming at the problem of contaminated sediments in a variety of ways. The inefficiency of this setup and the lack of information exchange and data availability reduces the chances of an expeditious solution. My amendment is intended to improve communication and cooperation among agencies, affected parties and all levels of government, and motivate them to address the problem sooner rather than later. 
My amendment requires the National Contaminated Sediment Task Force, as authorized in section 502 of WRDA of 1992 but never funded, to actually meet and make recommendations on how to improve contaminated sediment management practices. Also, this Task Force would have to report on the status of remedial actions on contaminated sediment sites across the nation, including Superfund sites, within one year. This report would also have to identify remediation status, programs and funding for cleanup, the nature and sources, etc. of contaminated sediments. 
EPA and the Army Corps would jointly publish a recurring report on ways to assess the threat of contaminated sediment, on the status of any guidelines issued designed to protect human and environmental health or to reduce deposition of toxics into sediment, and on guidelines issued intended to encourage the beneficial use of dredged material. 
Finally, the amendment makes modifications to cost-share provisions for environmental dredging, remediation technology assistance, and establishes a pilot program to give grants to communities that try to reduce contamination of downstream sediments. 
Mr. President, there have been years of inaction on contaminated sediments. My amendment is primarily intended to gather information and stimulate the agencies with jurisdiction to take this matter seriously and begin working together. If the information I am seeking is prepared in a timely way, the reauthorizations of Superfund and the Clean Water Act will be greatly enhanced from an environmental perspective, insofar as my colleagues would like to truly address the multi-media threat posed by contaminated sediments.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am opposed to S. 1645, the so-called Child Custody Protection Act. This legislation would prohibit and set penalties for transporting an individual under the age of 18 across a state line to obtain an abortion even though the abortion is legal in the state that individual is taken to. It would subject close relatives such as grandmothers, aunts, and siblings to criminal prosecution for an action totally legal where taken. In fact, an amendment that would have excluded grandmothers and other close adult relatives from federal prosecution was defeated in Committee by proponents of this bill. Invoking cloture at this time would preclude this amendment on the Senate floor. 
When faced with difficult choices regarding abortion and reproductive health, young women should be encouraged to seek counsel from their parents or other trusted adults. In many cases, even in states without mandatory parental consent laws, young women involve one or both parents. However, if a young woman feels that she cannot involve her parents for whatever reason, such as her fear it would put her in danger of abuse or if the pregnancy is the result of incest, she should not be discouraged from seeking the counsel of a trusted adult. I support adult involvement in this very difficult decision, but we must recognize that in some cases it is not always possible for the adult to be a parent. This bill would make it a federal misdemeanor for a grandmother to take her granddaughter to another state for an abortion even if the mother is dead and the father is in jail for incest. 
Without question, we should encourage parents, educators and counselors to help prevent teenage pregnancy within their state and communities. Teenagers need to be informed of the responsibility that comes with sexuality and parenthood. But making it more difficult for young women to turn to a trusted adult, be it an older sister, aunt, or grandmother, is clearly not the way to do this. 
This legislation also raises some unusual federalism questions that concern me. Under this bill, state laws would follow the people who live in those states when they travel to other states. The legislation would require the federal government to prosecute people for an activity that is lawful in the states in which the activity takes place (if that activity is not lawful in the state in which they reside). The Federal government does not impose this same restriction on crossing state lines in any other case that I can think of such as to gamble or buy liquor, cigarettes or guns. For the first time since slavery this legislation would make it criminal to go to a state to act in a way that is legal in that state. This is a terrible precedent. 
This legislation would impose federal penalties in states that have opted not to implement parental involvement requirements. I believe such decisions should be made by the citizens of each state, not by the residents of a neighboring state. 
People who act legally in Michigan should not be prosecuted because acts are illegal in another state and Michigan citizens should not be prosecuted for acts which are legal in the state in which they are performed.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's veto. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has continually expressed deep concern about legislation prohibiting the intact D&X procedure, which is the technical name for the late term birth abortion procedure. They have urged congress not to pass legislation criminalizing this procedure and not to supersede the medical judgment of trained physicians. They have stated, `The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.' 
The Supreme Court has ruled that a ban on all abortions after viability is permitted under the Constitution providing the ban contains an exception to protect the life and health of the woman. 
The bill vetoed by the President does not meet that test because the exception it provides for does not include language relative to a woman's health. 
Principally for both those reasons, I voted against this legislation and I continue to oppose it. Instead, I support an alternative which would ban all post-viability abortions, regardless of the procedure used, except in cases where it is necessary to protect a woman's life or health.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin. I commend him and Senator McCain and the bipartisan group that has worked so hard to pass campaign finance reform. 
A couple of nights ago, Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run. In doing so, he defied the odds. He warmed the hearts of Americans everywhere with his grit, his determination, and his dedication. It was a shining moment for American baseball and for America. Today, we should hold him up as our example. We need to show equal grit and equal determination. We need to hit a home run for the American people by passing campaign finance reform. 
To do that, we are going to have to defy the odds. The House did it; they defied the odds. They passed campaign finance reform, and now the question that we are going to face in the days ahead is whether we can. Can the Senate rise to the occasion? Or will we go with the status quo, continuing the demoralizing and debilitating money chase that now funds our election campaigns and undermines public confidence in our democracy? 
Seventy-five percent of the American people want campaign finance reform. They want limits restored on contributions, real limits. They want the end of the loophole called the soft money loophole. 
The House passed a strong bipartisan bill. The President is ready to sign it. A majority of the Senate supports similar legislation which is before us now. We are ready to vote to enact this legislation into law. 
But instead of going to a vote on the bill, the majority leader has instead filed a cloture motion. And what is surreal about this cloture motion is that while a cloture motion is usually intended to be a device to close debate on an issue, and to move to a vote, the Senators who signed the cloture motion in this instance do not want to end debate or go to a vote. They oppose their own petition. They hope that the pending legislation and this issue will go away. They hope the supporters of campaign finance reform will withdraw the bill because it is being filibustered. 
This is an inside-out filibuster. The opponents of reform want to filibuster the reform bill without actually filibustering it. They are hoping that if supporters do not have the 60 votes to close debate, that the supporters will agree to withdraw their own amendment. I believe it would be wrong to withdraw this bill because opponents are filibustering the bill. Opponents have the right to filibuster under our rules. They have the right to filibuster. But the supporters have no obligation to help them succeed by agreeing to change the subject or by agreeing to withdraw the amendment. 
This is an issue of transcendent importance. Huge contributions that come through that soft money loophole have sapped public confidence in the electoral process. The House has acted. They did what conventional wisdom said could not be done. They passed a bill with meaningful campaign finance reform to close the soft money loophole. Our colleague from Kentucky said that when the House passed reform and sent it over here, that the bill and reform was dead on arrival, DOA. Well, it was not. The struggle for life for campaign finance reform will be determined by a test of wills between a bipartisan majority who support campaign finance reform and the minority that is filibustering in opposition to campaign finance reform. 
But campaign finance reform is not dead on arrival. It is struggling for life here on the Senate floor in a kind of a titanic struggle which has existed with prior legislation of this importance, legislation which has such meaning to the country that both its supporters and its opponents are willing to test their strength. Opponents filibustering, as is their right, but supporters not yielding to that filibuster, as is our right. 
So just as the House defied the odds by passing a bill, just like Mark McGwire defied the odds by hitting home run No. 62, now it is our turn at bat. The American public is waiting for us to step up to the plate and to fight for campaign finance reform. And that is what our intention is. Again, I commend the bipartisan group that has led this effort. It is a vital effort for the well-being of democracy in this country. It is worth fighting for. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

I want to put in the Record some documents, for the sake of completeness, showing how bipartisan this problem is. Senator McCain, very appropriately, put in a document relative to what the benefits of major contributors to the Democrats are going to be offered. I don't know if that was actually implemented under that document or not, but plenty was implemented.

Mr. LEVIN. One of these documents is an invitation to the Republican National Committee Annual Gala 1997, in which for $250,000, the contributors to the Republican National Committee get to attend a luncheon with Senate and House leadership and the Republican Senate and House committee chairmen of your choice. That is $250,000. You get a luncheon with the committee chairmen. 
Next is a 1992 Republican President's Dinner. Major contributors got a private reception, among other things, hosted by President and Mrs. Bush at the White House. And the Republican Eagles promised major contributors who became members of the Republican Eagles' contributor group `foreign economic and trade missions,' in which the Eagles have been welcomed enthusiastically by heads of state, such as Premier Li Peng of the People's Republic of China. 
Again, Mr. President, I think the point Senator McCain very properly made is that we have a major, massive, bipartisan problem that is undermining public confidence in elections in this country. It is a bipartisan problem. It requires a bipartisan solution, and hopefully this coalition will stand together in the face of a filibuster and say, yes, you have a right to filibuster; that is your right, but we need not withdraw in the face of a filibuster. 
This problem is so huge that it requires action, and we cannot simply defer it year after year. There has never been a better time for action than when the House has acted on reform, against the odds, just as we have to act against the odds if we are going to succeed. I thank Senators McCain and Feingold, the leaders on both sides of the aisle, who can succeed if we hang tough here and not withdraw in the face of a filibuster.

The supporters of campaign finance reform need not withdraw, should not withdraw, and I believe and hope will not withdraw the bill if the filibuster survives this cloture vote. It will then be up to the filibusterers to continue the filibuster. Hopefully, over time they will see that the American people are determined to change a system which is not only corrupt but has a corruption which permeates and undermines public confidence in our democratic electoral process.

Mr. LEVIN. Well, just for one brief comment, if I might, to the majority leader. I thank him for his comments. When the proponents of civil rights legislation were faced with a filibuster, they didn't succeed the first time to get the necessary votes, which I think then was two-thirds. They didn't withdraw the civil rights bill. Because they felt it was so important to the Nation that we pass that legislation, they decided that the filibuster, which is their right under the rules--it is not required that people who offer a bill or an amendment withdraw their amendment or their bill just because they are being filibustered. 
The situation here is that there is a bipartisan group, a majority, who feel very, very strongly that this is a transcendent issue, that this is an issue which cuts across so many other issues, that the soft money loophole has undermined public confidence in a significant way in our elections. 
I think it is important that everybody be straight with each other, and I think you have been straight with us and we have been straight with you. Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have worked on a bipartisan basis in a way which is really important for the Nation. 
It is important that everybody understand that this amendment will be reoffered on the next appropriations bill because of the seriousness with which it is held on a bipartisan basis, and then folks who want to filibuster have that right, but folks who don't want to help that filibuster succeed also have rights to reoffer it. Those are the rights which will clash. That is why we are here to do this in a civil way. The majority leader has always been civil in his dealings on this issue, as on all other issues. 
I want to add both the statement that I have made and also to be very clear and be very straight with the leadership as to what the intent is, which is to reoffer this amendment on the next appropriations bill.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that, if enacted, will go a long way toward eliminating deceptive practices in mailings that use games of chance like sweepstakes to induce consumers to purchase a product or waste their money by paying to play a game they will not win. The use of gimmicks in these contests, such as a large notice declaring the recipient a winner--oftentimes a `guaranteed' winner or one of two final competitors for a large cash prize--has proliferated to the point that American consumers are being duped into purchasing products they don't want or need because they think they have won or will win a big prize if they do so. Complaints about these mailings are one of the top ten consumer complaints in the nation. I have received numerous complaints from my constituents in Michigan asking that something be done to provide relief from these mailings. 
Earlier this month we held a hearing in our Governmental Affairs Committee federal services subcommittee on the problem of deceptive sweepstakes and other mailings involving games of chance. We learned from three of our witnesses, the Florida Attorney General, the Michigan Assistant Attorney General and the Postal Inspection Service, that senior citizens are particular targets of these deceptive solicitations, because they are the most vulnerable. State Attorneys General have taken action against many of the companies that use deceptive mailings. The states have entered into agreements to stop the most egregious practices, but the agreements apply only to the states that enter into the agreements. This allows companies to continue their deceptive practices in other states. That's why federal legislation in this area is needed. The bill I'm introducing today will eliminate deceptive practices by prohibiting misleading statements, requiring more disclosure, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty for each deceptive mailing and providing the Postal Service with additional tools to pursue deceptive and fraudulent offenders. 
Sweepstakes solicitations are put together by teams of clever marketers who package their sweepstakes offers in such a way so as to get people to purchase a product by implying that the chances of winning are enhanced if the product being offered is purchased. Rules and important disclaimers are written in fine print and hidden away in obscure sections of the solicitation or on the back of the envelope that is frequently tossed away. Even when one reads the rules, it frequently takes a law degree to understand them. 
The bill I am introducing will protect consumers from deceptive practices by directing the Postal Service to develop and issue regulations that restrict the use of language and symbols on direct mail game of chance solicitations, including sweepstakes, that mislead the receiver into believing they have won, or will win a prize. The bill also requires additional disclosure about chances of winning and the statement that no purchase is necessary. Any mail that is designated by the Postal Service as being deceptive will not be delivered. This will significantly reduce if not eliminate the deceptive practices being used in the direct mail industry to dupe unsuspecting consumers into thinking they are grand prize winners. The direct mail industry should benefit as a result. The adverse publicity recently aimed at the industry because of `You Have Won a Prize' campaigns has malign the industry as a whole. Cleaning up deceptive advertising will certainly improve the industry's image. 
For those entities that continue to use deceptive mailings, my bill imposes a civil penalty of $10,000 for each offense that violates Postal Service regulations. Currently the Postal Service can impose a $10,000 daily fine for evading or not complying with a Postal Service order. My bill imposes a fine concurrent with issuing an order. This has the effect of applying the penalty to the deceptive offense, not for noncompliance of the order. 
My bill allows the Postal Service to quickly respond to changes in deceptive marketing practices by tasking them to draft regulations and language that will be effective against the `scheme du jour.' A deceptive practice used today, may not be used tomorrow. As soon as authorities learn about one scheme, it's changes. If legislation is passed that requires a specific notice, it won't be too long before another deceptive practice will pop up to by-pass the legislation. The Postal Service, who is in the business of knowing what is going on with the mails, will be able to evaluate what regulatory changes will be required to keep pace with deceptive practices. This will ensure that deceptive practices are weeded out in a timely manner by keeping regulations current. 
The bill also gives the Postal Service administrative subpoena power to respond more quickly to deceptive and fraudulent mail schemes. Currently the Postal Service must go through a lengthy administrative procedure before it can get evidence to shut down illegal operations. By the time they get through all the administrative hoops, the crook has folded up operations and disappeared, or has destroyed all the evidence. By granting the Postal Service limited subpoena authority to obtain relevant or material records for an investigation, the Postal Service will be able to act more efficiently against illegal activities. Subpoena authority will make the Postal Service more effective and efficient in its pursuit of justice. 
The Deceptive Sweepstakes Mailings Elimination Act of 1998 takes a tough approach to dealing with sweepstakes solicitations and other games of chance offerings that are sent through the mail. If you use sweepstakes or a game of chance to promote the sale of a product and provide adequate disclosure and abide with Postal Service regulations, then the Postal Service will deliver that solicitation. If deceptive practices are used in a sweepstakes or a game of chance solicitation, then the Postal Service will be able to stop the solicitation, and impose a significant penalty.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American body politic has a disease. It is a serious disease that some would argue is a critical disease. It is called `the money chase.' No party and few candidates are immune from it. The good news is that it is curable. The bad news is that there may be enough Members in this body--the Senate--who want to block the cure so that the cure cannot succeed. 
To inoculate our democratic system against this disease, we passed a series of laws in the 1970s to limit the role of money in Federal elections. It was our intent at that time to protect our democratic form of government which relies so heavily on the interchange of ideas and actions between the government and the private sector and to protect our form of government from the corrosive influence of unlimited and undisclosed political contributions. We wanted to ensure that our elected officials were neither in reality nor in perception beholden to special interests who are able to contribute large sums of money to candidates and their campaigns. These laws were designed to protect the public's confidence in our democratically elected officials. 
For many years those laws setting limits on campaign contributions worked fairly well. 
The limits that they set were respected, and these limits, indeed, are still on the books today. Those same laws that purportedly set limits on how much people can contribute to campaigns are on the books. And here is what they say. 
Individuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate per election, or $5,000 to a political action committee, or more than $20,000 a year to a national party committee, or $25,000 total in any one year. Corporations and unions are supposed to be prohibited from contributing to any campaign. Contributions from foreign countries, foreign citizens, and foreign corporations are prohibited. And Presidential campaigns are supposed to be financed with public funds. 
That is the law. That is what it says on the law books today. Yet in the last few years we have heard story after story after story about contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, corporations, and unions, and even about contributions from foreign sources. And we have heard stories about Presidents and Presidential candidates spending long hours on fundraising tasks. 
Now, how is that possible? Well, what has happened is that a pretty good law setting limits on the size and source of contributions had some soft spots which, over the years, both parties took advantage of. Both parties pushed up against those soft spots and created holes in the law, big loopholes that allowed the big money to pour in. 
So now there are effectively no limits at all. That is why we hear about a $1.3 million contribution to the RNC from just one company in 1996, and a half-million dollar contribution from just one couple to the DNC the same year. 
Some in this Chamber like it that way. They don't want any limits. The majority leader has said it is `the American way.' 
I disagree. We have got to plug those loopholes. We have to make the law whole again and, in making it whole, to make it effective. If we don't do that, we risk losing the faith the American people have that we represent their best interests. 
Soft money has blown the lid off the contribution and spending limits of our campaign finance system. Soft money is the 800-pound gorilla sitting right in the middle of this debate. Some want to pretend that it is not there, but it is. Soft money is at the heart of this problem. All soft money means is money which is unregulated and unlimited that, for one reason or another, crawls through that loophole that has been pierced by both parties in our campaign finance limits. 
Look at the most recent data. In the 1996 election, Republicans raised $140 million in soft money contributions, while Democrats raised $120 million--almost as much. In the first 18 months of the 1998 election cycle, Republicans have raised about $70 million, and Democrats have raised about $45 million. That was double the amount that both parties raised in the first 18 months of the 1996 elections. That money currently is legal, and it is legal because of the loopholes in the law that we must close with the McCain-Feingold bill. 
The way both parties have gotten around the law of the 1970s has been to establish a whole separate world of campaign finance. It is the world of soft money--contributions that are not technically covered by the limits under current law. Once that soft money loophole was opened, once the loophole was viewed as legitimate, the money chase was on by both parties. Couple that with the high cost of television advertising, and you have the money chase involving just about all candidates. 
The chase for money has led most of us in public office or seeking public office to push the envelope, to take the law to the limits, to get the necessary contributions. 
The money chase led the head of the Republican National Committee, Haley Barbour, to use a subsidiary of the RNC, the National Policy Forum, to obtain some $750,000 in what, practically speaking, became a foreign contribution from a Hong Kong businessman to run ads in key congressional races. 
The money chase drove the actions of Roger Tamraz, a large contributor to both parties who, during last year's investigation, became the bipartisan symbol for what is wrong with the current system. Roger Tamraz served as a Republican Eagle in the 1980s during Republican administrations and a Democratic trustee in the 1990s during Democratic administrations. He was unabashed in admitting his political contributions were made for the purpose of getting access to people in power. Tamraz showed us in stark terms the all too common product of the current campaign finance system--using unlimited soft money contributions to buy access. And despite the condemnation by Members of Congress and the press of Tamraz's activities, when asked at a hearing to reflect on his $300,000 contribution to the Democrats in 1996, Tamraz said, `I think next time I'll give $600,000.' 
What happened to the limits? What happened to the $1,000 limit and the $5,000 limit on PAC contributions, and the overall $25,000 limit per year? What happened to the intent of this Senate and the House of Representatives back in the 1970s to establish limits on contributions to candidates? How is it that a Roger Tamraz can unabashedly appear in front of a Senate committee and say, `Yes, I gave $300,000 to the Democrats. I did it to gain access.' And when asked, `Would you do it again?' indicated that, next time, he'll give $600,000, if necessary. 
Now, what do we believe the public feels and senses when they hear and see that? What do we think goes through the average person's mind when they see a Roger Tamraz unabashedly, boldly, without any shame, saying, `Hey, I can give you guys $300,000, I can give you $600,000, using that loophole, and I will do it again'? 
Is that what we want our election system to be--when we have passed a law which says $1,000 to a candidate, $25,000 overall in a year, that somebody can just appear in front of a Senate committee and say, `Yes, I gave $300,000, nothing illegal about that. I used the soft money loophole, folks. If you don't like it, close it. If you want to put limits on how much money I can give, close the loophole. But until you do it, I am going to keep on giving it'? 
That is the Tamraz challenge to us. That is the gauntlet that he has laid down in front of us, both parties. Answering his challenge cannot be done on a partisan basis. There is no way we are going to reform these laws unless enough Democrats and enough Republicans come together, as they did in the House of Representatives, and say enough is enough. We intended limits, we intended limits to apply, and we are going to close the loopholes which have obviated those limits, destroyed them, undermined them and, in the process, undermined the confidence of the American people. 
The money chase also pressures political supporters to cross lines they should not in order to help their candidates get needed funds. 
The money chase led a national finance chair of Senator Dole's presidential campaign, Simon Fireman, to engage in a 5-year money laundering scheme which funneled $120,000 through a secret Hong Kong trust to his employees who contributed to the candidates he supported. Similarly, the money chase led members of the Lum family, a father, mother and daughter, to funnel $50,000 through company employees and stockholders to Democratic candidates they supported, resulting in the first guilty pleas in the Justice Department's ongoing campaign finance fraud case. 
The money chase led a foreign corporation, Korean Airlines, and four U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations from the same country to funnel illegal contributions through their employees to a Republican Member of Congress Jay Kim, resulting in $1.6 million in corporate criminal fines. 
The money chase in political campaigns is a serious disease that has become chronic and too many of us have been affected by it. Too many of us have spent too much time fund-raising and in the process, pushing the fund-raising rules to their limits. Most of us know in our hearts that the money chase is a bipartisan problem and the bipartisan solution is the McCain-Feingold bill. 
But we have been here before. During my career in the Senate I have lost count of the number of times that this body has debated the need for campaign finance reform, been presented with reasonable bipartisan proposals, yet, in the end, failed to get the job done. 
Will this time be different? 
The Senate has before it a bipartisan campaign reform bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, that would do much to repair our campaign finance system. It is not a new bill. It has been before this body for years now and has received sustained scrutiny from Members on both sides of the aisle. 
It is a bill that recognizes that the bulk of troubling campaign activity is not what is illegal, but what is legal--what is currently legal because of the soft money loophole. The McCain-Feingold bill takes direct aim at closing the loopholes that have swallowed the election laws. In particular, it takes aim at closing the soft money and issue advocacy loopholes, while strengthening other aspects of the federal election laws that are too weak to do the job as they now stand. 
I have heard experts and my colleagues condemn the excesses of the 1996 elections. I've also heard people bemoaning the lack of tough civil and criminal enforcement action against the wrongdoers. But there is an obvious reason for the lack of strong enforcement--the existing Federal election laws are riddled with loopholes and in many respects unenforceable. And as much as some want to point the finger of blame at those who took advantage of the campaign finance laws during the last election, there is no one to blame but ourselves for the sorry state of the law. 
The soft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it. The so-called issue advocacy loophole exists because we in Congress allow it to exist. Tax-exempt organizations spend millions televising candidate attack ads days before an election without disclosing who they are or where they got their funds because we in Congress allow it. 
It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility for our share of the blame. Congress alone writes the laws. Congress alone can shut down the loopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election laws. 
The Federal Election Campaign Act was first enacted 20 years ago, in response to campaign abuses uncovered in connection with the Watergate scandal. Congress enacted a comprehensive and tough system of laws, including contribution limits and full public disclosure of all campaign contributions and expenditures. 
At the time they were enacted, many people fought against those laws, claiming they were an unconstitutional restriction of First Amendment rights to free speech and free association. The laws' opponents took their case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued the Buckley decision, which held both contribution limits and disclosure requirements were constitutional. 
I want to repeat that, because Buckley is thrown around quite a bit on this floor, so I want to just repeat that last statement. Buckley upheld the constitutionality of contribution limits. 
There are those who say we should not, or cannot, limit the amount of contributions. We do limit the amount of contributions, and Buckley said that we can. The question now is whether we close the loopholes which have destroyed those limits. But in terms of the constitutionality under the first amendment, Buckley upheld the constitutionality of limits on campaign contributions. 
The Buckley court wrote specifically--relative to disclosure requirements, by the way--that:  
While disclosure requirements serve the many salutary purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the problem. 
And the court held in Buckley that: 
We find that under the rigorous standard of review established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests served by restricting the size of financial contributions to political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited effect upon first amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 contribution ceiling. Congress was justified [the Buckley court wrote] in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated. 
That is Buckley explicitly holding that Congress can set and enforce contribution limits, and that the first amendment does not preclude us from doing so. The Buckley court also wrote: 
It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions--in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. . . . To the extent that large contributions are given to secure political quid pro quo's from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . . Of almost equal concern is . . . the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. . . . 
Roger Tamraz spent $300,000 buying access and said, `I'll double it next time.' Buckley, the Supreme Court, said: 
Of almost equal concern . . . is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. . . . 
Congress [the Buckley court held] could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence . . . is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent. 
That is Buckley. That is Buckley ruling on contribution limits. That is Buckley saying that Congress could legitimately conclude, to use its words, that `the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence . . . is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.' 
That is Roger Tamraz' challenge to us. 
And when he and others say, `I can give $300,000 because of that soft money loophole, and I'll double it next time,' the Supreme Court says that Congress can legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence `is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.' 
The Buckley Court also upheld the disclosure limits that we had in the law. In upholding both the contribution limits and the disclosure requirements, the Supreme Court used a balancing test that weighed the first amendment rights against the integrity of Federal elections, and the Court ruled that the integrity of our elections is so compelling a Government interest that contribution limits and disclosure requirements are constitutionally acceptable. 
Some have argued that McCain-Feingold is an unconstitutional restriction of free speech, but that analysis leaves out several key legal considerations. 
First, although Buckley is often cited in support of that argument, Buckley, as a matter of fact, is the decision that upheld contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Buckley did strike down spending limits, but not contribution limits which Buckley affirmed. Spending limits were stricken by Buckley, but no one is talking about mandatory spending limits in this bill. What we are talking about is contribution limits and disclosure requirements, exactly what Buckley said is a constitutional means to protect the integrity of our elections, to deter corruption and the appearance of corruption, and to inform voters. 
Some have correctly cited other court decisions holding that only ads which contain a short list of so-called magic words can be subjected to the Federal election law requirements and limits relative to contributions, but that analysis leaves out a decision in the ninth circuit in the Furgatch case which holds that the list of magic words, which those other courts cited, `does not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.' 
The analysis by some relative to issue ads also leaves out, in addition to ignoring the ninth circuit Furgatch case, the fact that the Federal Election Commission has reaffirmed, on a bipartisan basis, its commitment to a broader test that goes beyond the magic words to unmask ads that claim to be discussions of issues but which are clearly intended to advocate the election or defeat of a Federal candidate. 
The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the Federal Election Commission regulation or whether the magic words must be present before Federal election laws can be applied to ads that clearly attack or support candidates. 
Despite attempts to depict the constitutional picture as providing crystal clear support for unfettered speech, no matter how corrupting of our electoral system, that is not the state of the law. To the contrary. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the integrity of our elections is a weighty concern which Congress can consider. The question is how to balance that concern for the integrity of elections against the free speech concerns in the first amendment. 
How do you balance the two? In Buckley, the Court balanced them by saying contribution limits are constitutional; disclosure requirements are constitutional; spending limits, expenditure limits are not. That is what the Buckley Court ruled. This bill, our bill, is consistent with Buckley, consistent with Furgatch, and consistent with the Federal Election Commission s reaffirmation of the broader test for candidate advocacy. 
The problem with our campaign laws is that candidates and parties have pushed against the limits of the law and found loopholes to such an extent that the law's limits are no longer effective. We intended to establish limits after Watergate. Those limits have been destroyed by the soft money loophole. 
The Supreme Court said we can, in fact, limit contributions. The issue before us is whether we will restore those limits on contributions. Individuals can now give parties hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars at a time, claiming that they are providing soft money rather than the hard money that has to meet the legal limits. Corporations, which are not supposed to make direct contributions at all, now routinely contribute huge sums to both parties, millions to both parties. While those contributors claim to be providing money that is simply for party-building purposes and not for candidates, the issue advocacy loophole allows parties and others to televise ads that clearly attack or support candidates while claiming to be discussions of issues beyond the reach of the election laws, but which are indistinguishable from candidate ads which are subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements. 
To show the absurd state of the law, at least in some circuits, we can just look at one of the 1996 televised ads that was paid for by the League of Conservation Voters and which referred to House Member Greg Ganske, a Republican Congressman from Iowa, who was then up for reelection. This is the way the ad read:  
It's our land; our water. America's environment must be protected. But in just 18 months, Congressman Ganske has voted 12 out of 12 times to weaken environmental protections. Congressman Ganske even voted to let corporations continue releasing cancer-causing pollutants into our air. Congressman Ganske voted for the big corporations who lobbied these bills and gave him thousands of dollars in contributions. Call Congressman Ganske. Tell him to protect America's environment. For our families. For our future. 
The ad sponsor claimed that was an issue ad, an ad that discussed issues rather than a candidate, and so could be paid for by unlimited and undisclosed funds. If one word were changed, if instead of `Call Congressman Ganske,' the ad said, `Defeat Congressman Ganske,' it would clearly qualify as a candidate ad subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements. 
In the real world, that one word difference doesn't change the character or substance of that ad at all. Both versions unmistakably advocate the defeat of Congressman Ganske. But the ad sponsor claims that only one of those ads must comply with election law contribution limits and disclosure requirements. That doesn't make sense, and McCain-Feingold would help close down that interpretation of the law. 
This is not the first time that loopholes have eroded the effectiveness of a set of laws. It happens all the time. The election laws are just the latest example. Congress is here partly to oversee the way that laws operate, to close loopholes that have been discovered. 
The question is, What are we going to do about it? 
The time for crying crocodile tears about campaign fundraising is over. Folks should wipe away those crocodile tears from their eyes, because if they do, they will see a public disgusted with both parties for allowing unlimited fundraising and contributions in our Federal elections. Seventy-three percent of American people in a poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times believe both parties committed campaign finance abuses in the 1996 elections; 81 percent--81 percent--of the American people believe the campaign fundraising system needs to be reformed; 78 percent of the American people believe we should limit the role of soft money. 
Campaign finance reform is an issue that can convert a dedicated optimist into a doomsayer, but we have before us a bipartisan bill that provides the key reforms, that has passed the House and that the President will sign. 
We have before us a bipartisan bill which a majority in the Senate support, and we have a bipartisan coalition that is willing to fight hard for this bill. 
So let us stop complaining about weak enforcement of the election laws when the wording of those laws make them virtually unenforceable. Let us stop feigning shock at the laws' loopholes while allowing them to continue. It is time to enact campaign finance reform. That is our legislative responsibility. Otherwise, we are going to be haunted by the words of Roger Tamraz that in the next election it will be $600,000 instead of $300,000. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
Mr. President, this bill will not contribute to our national security. As a matter of fact, it will weaken and jeopardize our national security. 
That is not just me saying it and those of us who oppose this bill. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has written us a very, very strong letter supporting the current national missile defense policy, which is to develop defenses against these long-range missiles but not to commit to deploy such defenses, since such a commitment will violate an agreement that we have with Russia which has made it possible for us to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this world. 
Committing to break out of a treaty which has allowed us to reduce the number of nuclear weapons will result in Russia--they have told us this--not ratifying START II, and then, indeed, deciding to reverse the START I reductions. START I reductions, START II reductions, and hopefully START III reductions are based on an agreement that we have with Russia that neither party will deploy defenses against long-range missiles. 
If we violate that agreement--this bill commits us to a position which would violate that agreement--if we violate that agreement, we are going to see Russia reverse the direction in which it is going--reduction of nuclear weapons. Indeed, there will be a much greater threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, because thousands of additional weapons will then be on Russian soil. 
This bill is a pro-proliferation of a nuclear weapons bill. That is not the intent, obviously. But that is the effect of this bill, because instead of Russia just having a few thousand nuclear weapons on its soil--which are then subject to being stolen, or pilfered, or sold--it will have many more thousands of nuclear weapons. 
It is not in the security interests of this Nation to trash the START II agreement by threatening another treaty called the Antiballistic Missile Treaty upon which START II is based, upon which START I is based, and upon hopefully START III will be based. 
Can we negotiate a modification in that ABM Treaty? I hope so. Might it be desirable for both sides to move to defenses against long-range missiles? I think so. Should we develop defenses against long-range missiles but not commit to violate the ABM Treaty by committing to deploy those missiles? Yes. We should develop those defenses. And we are at a breakneck speed--by the way, a very high-risk speed. 
This bill, which would change our policy, will not speed up the development of national missile defenses by 1 day. We are already developing those defenses as fast as we possibly can. 
Mr. President, I want to just read briefly--if my 4 minutes are up, I ask for an additional 2 minutes.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, part of the Joint Chiefs' letter is the following: 
* * * we reaffirm our support for the current [National Missile Defense] policy and deployment readiness program. 
Those are the key words. 
Based on these considerations, we reaffirm our support for the current [National Missile Defense] policy and deployment readiness program. 
Then General Shelton wrote the following: 
Our program represents an unprecedented level of effort to address the likely emergence of a rogue ICBM threat. It compresses what is normally a 6-12 year development program into 3 years with some additional development concurrent with a 3-year deployment. This emphasis is indicative of our commitment to this vital national security objective. The tremendous effort devoted to this program is a prudent commitment to provide absolutely the best technology when a threat warrants deployment. 
Given the present threat projections and the potential requirement to deploy an effective limited defense, we continue to support the `three-plus-three' program. It is our view that the development program should proceed through the integrated system testing scheduled to begin in late 1999, before the subsequent deployment decision consideration in the year 2000. 
Then he points out that:  
Additional funding would not buy back any time in our already fast-paced schedule. 
Finally, General Shelton said the following: 
The [ABM] Treaty contributes to our strategic stability with Russia and, for the immediate future, does not hinder our development program. 
Mr. President, our program now calls for the development of defenses against long-range missiles. Let no one misunderstand that, or misstate that. That is our current program. 
We are moving as quickly as possible. Indeed, it is a high-risk move that we are making because we have collapsed this development schedule so much. We are not going to speed up this schedule 1 day by threatening to destroy the ABM Treaty. All we will do, if this bill passes, is to contribute to the threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons on the soil of Russia. That is not in our security interest. I hope we do not proceed to the consideration of this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have negotiated this modification in the McConnell amendment so that it is no longer targeted at the sitting general counsel of the Federal Elections Commission. That was my objection to it, my very strong objection to it. This amendment has been modified now so it has no effect on the current general counsel until the year 2008. He is eligible to retire at that date in any event. 
And even then, the amendment has now been changed so that three of the six members of the Federal Elections Commission can renew the appointment of the general counsel or staff director. It would not take four of the six to renew the appointment of a general counsel or staff director. 
So in effect we have grandfathered the current general counsel. And with respect to future general counsels and staff directors, we have provided that once they are appointed, which of course will take a majority vote of the Commission, they shall serve for 6 year terms and their terms can be renewed by a vote of three of the six members of the Federal Elections Commission. 
This is a very significant change that makes this perfectly acceptable to me. 
I want to thank Senator McConnell for working with us on this. With that, I support the amendment. 
After this is concluded, I understand that we will then be offering and there will be general support for an amendment of Senator Glenn, if I understand what we worked out here correctly.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader for yielding. I do have a number of questions. 
First, let me say I think we have never been closer to enacting comprehensive campaign finance reform than we are at this moment. The majority of the Senate favors it. The House, through a very courageous act on the part of many of its Members, has overcome the opposition of the House leadership to pass Shays-Meehan. 
It was said earlier this year that there would be no way of passing Shays-Meehan against the will of the leadership of the House of Representatives. But a very stalwart, gutsy coalition of Democrats and Republicans in the House found a way to have the majority rule in the House of Representatives. It was not easy. It took incredible energy and willpower. They exercised it and they prevailed, and the majority prevailed over the wishes of the leaders of the House of Representatives. So, now we are in a situation where the majority of the Senate favors comprehensive reform and the House has passed comprehensive reform. 
The leader has spoken earlier as to what it is that is stopping us from trying to get comprehensive reform adopted in the Senate this year. The majority of the public clearly favors it. All public opinion polls show it. They are skeptical that we will do anything about it--the polls show that as well--but they favor it. Now we are going to come down, it seems to me, to a test of wills, a great and a historic test of wills in the U.S. Senate. The opponents of campaign finance reform have the right to filibuster. They have used that right, and they have the right to filibuster. But the proponents, the supporters of campaign finance reform, do not need to withdraw simply because there is a filibuster on the floor. If that were done, we would not have civil rights legislation. The people who supported civil rights legislation did not always have 67 votes going in. You can start with a majority and offer an amendment, or offer a bill, and just because the opponents filibuster the bill does not require us, those of us who support campaign finance reform, to give up our right to offer the amendment and to have the amendment disposed of by the Senate. And if the filibusterers want to tie up the Senate and prevent the Senate from voting, that is their right. But the supporters of campaign finance reform are not obligated to withdraw an amendment simply because the opponents use their right to filibuster. 
That is why what we are now facing, given the opposition to the unanimous consent request this morning, is a historic test of wills between the majority that favors campaign finance reform, a bipartisan majority that now has seven Republicans and all the Democrats, and those who oppose campaign finance reform. We must not withdraw in the face of a filibuster. The stakes are too huge. They have been illuminated here this morning eloquently by the Democratic leader. The stakes are whether we are going to restore public confidence to a campaign finance system which is in tatters. We are supposed to have limits on contributions. It is supposed to be $1,000 per person per campaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute to campaigns, and neither are unions. Yet, we have corporations and unions contributing huge amounts of money which, for all intents and purposes under any reasonable interpretation, support or oppose campaigns. That is what is now happening because of the soft money loophole. 
We have a chance this year, better than we have ever had, to close that soft money loophole and to restore public confidence in the campaign finance system. We have a chance to do it. If we will show the same courage on a bipartisan basis as was shown in the House of Representatives, down that hall just a few weeks ago, we can pass campaign finance reform in the Senate. But what it will take is a determination on the part of the supporters not to withdraw our majority view in the face of a filibuster. The filibusterers have their rights to tie up the Senate. We have our rights to offer an amendment and seek a vote on that amendment. And, in the face of a filibuster, we need not withdraw and give in to a filibuster. 
My question of the Democratic leader is this: Was it his hope this morning, and intent this morning in offering this unanimous consent proposal, that we have a course of action which would allow the Senate to work its will, to permit amendments to Shays-Meehan providing they are relevant? As I read the unanimous consent request and heard the unanimous consent proposal, relevant amendments would be in order. Was it the Democratic leader's proposal this morning that we have an opportunity to resolve this issue in a way which would allow us to do all of our other business and to avoid the kind of filibuster which we now very clearly see is going to be forthcoming from the objection to this unanimous consent agreement?

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted to table the McCain amendment because I believe it undermines the agreement we have in place with North Korea that is designed to denuclearize North Korea. This could effectively give North Korea an excuse to produce plutonium that it could use for nuclear weapons, which would be absolutely contrary to our most basic national security interests. 
The McCain amendment would add a requirement for a certification relative to North Korea that would undermine the Agreed Framework that has frozen North Korea's nuclear weapons plutonium production program, because it would change the terms of that agreement. Before any of the fiscal year 1999 funds for implementation of that Agreed Framework could be spent, the McCain amendment would require the President to certify that North Korea is essentially denuclearized, which is not yet the case but which is the very goal of the Agreed Framework. 
The Agreed Framework stipulates that North Korea must freeze its plutonium production facilities, namely three graphite-moderated nuclear reactors (either operating or under construction) and a plutonium reprocessing facility, in exchange for an international consortium (the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, or KEDO) providing two proliferation-resistant light water nuclear power reactors. 
Before the U.S. delivers key nuclear components to the North Korean light-water reactor program, North Korea must come into full compliance with its nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It was understood from the outset that it would take a number of years, and probably not before the year 2003, before North Korea would come into full compliance with its obligations under the NPT. 
The whole idea of the Agreed Framework was in fact to bring North Korea into full compliance with the NPT and to go beyond the NPT's requirements by requiring North Korea to freeze and then dismantle its plutonium production facilities, and to place all its spent nuclear fuel in canisters safeguarded and monitored by the IAEA and eventually remove that spent fuel from North Korea. These represent significant security gains for the United States and we should honor our commitments under the agreement to realize these gains. 
We should not give North Korea an excuse to walk away from its obligations under the Agreed Framework and to resume the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons. I believe that is what the McCain amendment would do, and that is why I voted to table the McCain amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is directly aimed at the independence of the Federal Elections Commission. It is aimed at no other commission. Its purpose is obvious--to eliminate a general counsel who has taken an independent position, following the Federal Election Commission's decision relative to soft money and other issues. We should not muzzle them. We should not throttle them. We should not destroy their independence.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would set arbitrary dates for reductions of troops. It runs smack against the advice of our top military officials, both uniformed and civilian. 
In a letter which has been quoted by a number of Senators, including the Senator occupying the Chair, General Shelton and Secretary Cohen, on May 21, told us the following: 
Under a legislated approach, military commanders would be forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission accomplishment, operational considerations, and the fluid tactical situation they face. 
Mr. President, that is why military commanders, including our top commander, oppose this amendment. That is why General Shelton opposes this amendment. It is why Secretary Cohen opposes this amendment. It would be mandating an arbitrary date for a troop reduction. That jeopardizes the well-being of our forces in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, I want to talk about a number of provisions in the amendment with which I disagree. 
First of all, I want to correct an impression that I believe is created by the findings in this amendment. The findings imply that Congress has not played any role nor exercised its oversight authority since U.S. forces were first deployed to Bosnia. I would remind my colleagues of the provisions that were included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 and the National Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Those Acts required the President to certify that the continued presence of U.S. armed forces in Bosnia, after June 30, 1998, is required in order to meet the national security interests of the United States and that it is the policy of the United States that U.S. armed forces will not serve as, or be used as, civil police in Bosnia. It also required the President to submit to Congress a report on why the U.S. armed forces' presence in Bosnia was in the U.S. national security interests, the expected duration of such deployment, the mission and objectives of the U.S. armed forces, the exit strategy of such forces, and a number of other matters.

Mr. LEVIN. Those 10 benchmarks, however, were established unilaterally by the Administration and were not shared with or agreed upon by our NATO allies. Accordingly, I offered an amendment when the Senate was considering the emergency supplemental bill at the end of March. That amendment, which was accepted and eventually became part of the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act, urged the President to seek concurrence among the NATO members on the ten benchmarks, on estimated target dates for achieving the benchmarks, and on a process for NATO to review progress towards achieving the benchmarks. It also required the President to submit to Congress a report on these matters by June 30, 1998 and semiannually thereafter so long as U.S. ground combat forces remain in the Stabilization Force in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, two days ago the President submitted that report as required by the amendment to the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act. That report advises that benchmarks parallel to ours have been incorporated in NATO's Operation Plan or OPLAN for the post-June 1998 mission in Bosnia. The OPLAN requires SFOR to develop detailed criteria for each of those benchmarks, to be approved by the North Atlantic Council. 
The President's report also advises that the NATO allies agreed on June 10 to the United States' proposal that the NATO military authorities provide an estimate of the time likely to be required for the implementation of the military and civilian aspects of the Dayton Agreement based on the benchmark criteria. During his testimony before the Armed Services Committee on June 4, General Wes Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, stated that the development and approval of the criteria and estimated target dates should take two or three months. 
The President's report further advises that the benchmark criteria will be used during NATO's regular six-month review of the Bosnia mission in December. The President added that, although not required by the amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council has included language that corresponds to 
the benchmarks in its Luxembourg declaration of June 9. The Peace Implementation Council also called on the High Representative to submit a report on the progress being made in meeting those goals by mid-September. This means that both General Shinseki, the NATO on-scene commander, and High Representative Westendorp, the international community's senior civilian in Bosnia, will be using the same framework and that the North Atlantic Council will have the benefit of the judgment of both of these officials.

Mr. LEVIN. Finally on this point, I would note that the Senate adopted an amendment during its consideration of the Defense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 1999 that expressed the sense of Congress that, among other things, stated that the President should work with our NATO allies to withdraw U.S. ground combat forces from Bosnia within a reasonable period of time, consistent with the safety of those forces and the accomplishment of SFOR's military tasks. That amendment passed by a vote of 90-5 on June 24--a little more than a month ago. 
Mr. President, I thought that it was important to get that information on the record to correct any impression that Congress has not paid attention to the participation of U.S. military forces in the NATO-led force in Bosnia. But it is far more important, in my view, to focus on the other sections of the amendment, particularly the mandatory reduction of U.S. ground elements from Bosnia to a level of 6,500 by February 2, 1999, and 5,000 by October 1, 1999. 
First, I think it would be useful to put the size of the U.S. contingent in Bosnia in perspective. It should be noted that the United States provided about 20,000 of NATO's Implementation Force in 1996--or about 33 percent of the total force. Up until approximately June of this year, the United States provided about 8,500 troops to NATO's Stabilization Force--or about 25 percent of the total force. By September of this year, the United States will provide about 6,900 troops--or about 22 percent of the total force. So the percentage of the U.S. contribution to the NATO-led force has been declining over time--from 33 to 25 to 22 percent. 
The amendment before us, however, would use the power of the purse to reduce the number of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia by another 400 by February 2 of next year and then by an additional 1,500 by October 1 of next year. That is the main purpose and impact of this amendment. That is also what makes this amendment unacceptable to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and should make it unacceptable to us. When the Armed Services Committee was considering a series of amendments during its markup of the Defense Authorization bill earlier this year, we sought the views of the Department of Defense. Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, in their letter of May 21, 1998, gave us their views and I would like to quote from a few parts of their letter: 
We write to express our concerns with any amendment that would legislate a date or schedule for withdrawal or reduction of US forces from the NATO-led mission in Bosnia. Such amendments would make it more difficult to accomplish the mission, which has been remarkably successful to date. * * * * * 
We will conduct regular reviews of our force posture and progress toward the benchmarks we have established, and we expect further reductions will be possible. But that determination is best based on the actual situation on the ground, the military advice of our commanders in the field, and the approval of the NATO military and political authorities, not an arbitrary withdrawal or reduction dates determined long in advance. * * * * * 
Under a legislated approach, military commanders would be forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission accomplishment, operational considerations, and the fluid tactical situation they face.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton said it well. I agree with them--Congress should not mandate troop reduction by arbitrary dates. 
Mr. President, I also disagree with other sections of this amendment dealing with exceptions to the mandated drawdown and limitations on support for law enforcement activities in Bosnia. 
Finally, I would note that the Statement on Administration Policy states that the President's senior advisors would recommend veto of this bill if it contains a provision that would prescribe a arbitrarily scheduled force drawdown in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, for all these reasons I will vote against this amendment and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment as well.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Arkansas for the second-degree amendment, the modification in effect, which he has sent to the desk. 
I reluctantly voted to table his original amendment because I was troubled by his narrow focus on one country, when the problem exists not only in China, but a number of other countries. The problems he identifies in his amendment are real problems and they are problems we must be concerned with. He has shown that concern, and I think it is wise that we reflect the concern relating to people engaging in those practices that come from any country--China or anyplace else. 
And while I reluctantly voted to table his original amendment, the first-degree amendment, for the reason I just gave, I enthusiastically cosponsored the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, and I hope it passes with a resounding vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have a number of problems with the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas that contains a series of findings, expresses the sense of Congress, and requires the President to submit a report relating to the readiness of the United States Armed Forces to execute the National Security Strategy. 
I realize that the managers of the Defense Appropriations bill are up against a tight deadline to finish their bill and I want to cooperate with them. But, I do want to note for the record a few points. 
I believe a number of statements in the amendment are overdrawn and I believe that the sense of Congress section of the amendment, particularly subparagraph (B), improperly singles out the Bosnia operation and badly overstates its impact on the units participating in and supporting that operation. 
Nevertheless, I believe that it would be useful to the Congress to receive a report from the President on the military readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States. Accordingly and despite the problems I have noted, I will not object to this amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to support the nomination of Patrick T. Henry to be the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. 
P.T. Henry has served on the staff of the Armed Services Committee for the last five years. Before that, he had a distinguished career on active duty in the Marine Corps and in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, as well as serving as the Chief of Staff of the American Red Cross here in Washington. 
Mr. President, I can't think of a better person to serve in this important position. P.T. Henry has played a key role in virtually every Defense manpower and personnel issue in the last two decades. Whether the issue is quality of life issues, military pay and benefits questions, recruiting and retention, or military health care, the United States Senate and the men and women of our armed forces have benefitted tremendously from the advice and counsel of P.T. Henry. 
I know that every member of the Armed Services Committee agrees with me that P.T.'s expertise in the area of Defense manpower and personnel issues is exceeded only by his commitment to the welfare of the men and women of the armed forces and their families. I am disappointed that P.T. will be leaving the Armed Services Committee staff, but I am delighted and proud that he will be moving to such an important position in the Defense Department. The Senate's and the Armed Services Committee's loss is certainly the Army's gain. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank P.T. Henry for his service to the Senate and the nation. I know that he will do an outstanding job as the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, and that he will continue to be an effective advocate for the men and women of the Army.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to join the people across our Nation paying tribute to the heroic actions of Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson. These two men, who were killed during a senseless act of violence last Friday, gave their lives in order to protect the American people and their Capitol. They died fulfilling their sworn duty to protect the men and women who work in the Capitol compound and the multitudes of visitors who tour each day. The loss of J. J. Chestnut and John Gibson is like a death in the family. However, despite the great loss that will feel, our thoughts and prayers are first with their families, who will bear the greatest burden of this tragic event. We hope that they may find some solace in knowing that the Nation joins them in their grief. 
These fallen protectors were true heroes. They faced gunfire and death in the line of duty. It is fitting that we are able to pay our final respects to them today in the very place where they worked and gave their lives. The Capitol Police serve with pride, efficiency and good humor. They handle the enormous task of allowing the multitude of people who visit our Capitol, the symbol of freedom and democracy the world over, access to it without a feeling of having to cross a barricade. This openness and accessibility have a heavy price, as we mourn the loss of these brave men. 
Today, J. J. Chestnut and John Gibson are being given an extraordinary honor by the Congress when their caskets are placed in the Capitol rotunda. It is an honor that has been bestowed upon very few of our Nation's exemplary public servants and one which is entirely fitting for J. J. Chestnut and John Gibson. They were public servants in the most fundamental sense. Their sense of duty and service were unmatched, and as we mourn the deaths of these two outstanding men we can also feel a sense of pride in the great sacrifice they made in the defense of democracy, our Capitol, and its visitors. 
Mr. President, I know my Senate colleagues and Americans everywhere join in honoring these two fallen heroes: Jacob J. Chestnut and John M. Gibson.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman of the subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding the very important issue of Federal courthouse security. As I am sure the Chairman is aware, each day Federal courthouses across the country must temporarily detain thousands of prisoners awaiting trials, hearings and interviews. The facilities must be secure because the courthouses are occupied by members of the public and the judiciary. For example, the U.S. Marshal's Service, which oversees Federal courthouse security, recommends that larger courthouses be equipped with a secure garage area referred to as a `sally port' where prisoners can be transferred to the courthouse by van or bus, a detention facility where prisoners can be temporarily held, secure interview rooms where prisoners can be questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorneys, and if possible some separate secure hall or corridor through which a violent or dangerous prisoner can be transferred to a courtroom apart from the public and the judiciary.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, it has come to my attention that many of the older Federal courthouses do not have proper facilities to adequately secure prisoners and assure the safety of the public and the judiciary. For example, in my own state of Michigan the U.S. Courthouse in Detroit, which is a large older courthouse, is in desperate need of security improvements. The building contains no sally ports, and prisoners are transferred from vans and buses in the same modern ventilation systems that control the spread of air bourne diseases such as tuberculosis. Also, there are no interview rooms in which defendants or prisoners acting as witnesses for the Government can be questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorneys or their own counsel. This has led to difficulties for the local U.S. Attorney, and the U.S. Marshal, who has been forced to use extra members of his staff that are needed elsewhere to instead guard meeting rooms while the interviews take place. Moreover, the Detroit courthouse has no secure corridor to transfer prisoners from the detention cells to the courtrooms so that dangerous prisoners must be transferred in the same halls that are used by the public. Finally Mr. Chairman, the Marshal's Service has informed me that there is also a problem with many newly constructed courthouses, which cannot be opened because insufficient money is available to equip the building with a minimum level of security systems such as security cameras and monitors. I want to commend the Chairman and ranking member for appropriating money specifically for courthouses in Detroit and Grand Rapids. However, I would ask that more money be made available for courthouse security projects.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today Senator Thompson and I, as sponsors of S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1998, are putting into the Congressional Record a proposed amendment we will offer when S. 981 is brought to the Senate floor for consideration. The amendment reflects changes to the bill we have agreed to make in response to a number of concerns about the bill identified by the Administration and Members of the Governmental Affairs Committee. We are putting it in the Record at this time, to make the language available to the public and persons interested in this bill. We are also putting into the Record today the letter of July 15th from Acting OMB Director Jack Lew, stating that the Administration will sign the bill if the changes included in the Managers' Amendment are made and the bill passes both Houses in the same form. We welcome the support of the Administration in this effort and hope we can get the bill to the floor as soon as possible. 
OMB stated in their analysis of costs and benefits of federal regulations in 1997 that regulation has enormous potential for good and harm. `The only way,' OMB said, `we know to distinguish between the regulations that do good and those that cause harm is through careful assessment and evaluation of their benefits and costs.' S. 981 would build that careful evaluation into the regulatory process of all the regulatory agencies. OMB estimated that of the significant or major regulations currently in effect, we have received approximately $300 billion in benefits at a cost of some $280 billion. We know that through the appropriate use of cost benefit analysis and risk assessment we can improve those figures. In a well-respected analysis of 12 major EPA rules and the impact of cost-benefit analysis on those rules, the author, Richard Morgenstern, former Associate Assistant Administrator of EPA and a visiting scholar at Resources for the Future, concluded that in each of the 12 rule makings, economic analysis helped reduce the costs of all the rules and at the same time helped increase the benefits of 5 of the rules. Report after report acknowledges the importance of good cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for all agencies. It's long past time to get these basic requirements into statute. S. 981 offers us the best opportunity to do that. 
The Managers' Amendment Senator Thompson and I will be offering to S. 981 reconfirms our intention that the bill not diminish or affect an agency's responsibility to carry out the purposes of the substantive statute under which the agency is regulating. At the same time, the amendment does nothing to weaken the important requirements of the bill that agencies do a thorough and competent analysis of the costs and benefits of the major regulations they issue. 
Mr. President, I believe S. 981 will significantly improve the regulatory process. If enacted, it will build confidence in the regulatory programs that are so important to this society's well-being, and will result in a better, and I believe a less contentious, regulatory process. Those of us who believe in the benefits of regulation to protect health and safety have a particular responsibility to make sure that regulations are sensible and cost-effective. When they aren't, the regulatory programs--which are so vital to our health and well being--come under attack. By providing an open regulatory process guided by reasonableness and common sense, we are protecting important programs from harmful attacks.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. It embodies a historical principle that has been embedded in most of our psyches and consciousness, which is that an individual has a right to counsel--particularly an individual involved in the criminal justice 
system has a right to counsel. 
Our good friend from Utah says, well, someone appearing before a grand jury can leave the room and get counsel. Indeed, he knows of cases, as do I, where somebody who is in front of a grand jury leaves the room after every question to go outside the door and talk to an attorney. 
What is the common sense of requiring somebody who is entitled to counsel not to be able to get that counsel inside the grand jury room? What is the common sense of forcing somebody in front of the jury to leave at the end of each question--leave the grand jury room to go talk to his or her attorney? How does that meet the ends of either common sense or justice--to force that rigmarole, that process, when we come to something as fundamental and basic as the right to counsel? 
I don't think anyone here questions that there is a right to counsel under our Constitution. The question is, Why not then permit that right to be exercised inside the grand jury room? Why not permit the advice to be given to somebody inside the grand jury room, rather than to force that person at the end of each question to say, `Excuse me, I want to go outside the grand jury room to consult with my counsel'? 
The only argument that I have heard against permitting that is that, somehow or other, that would tie a grand jury in knots, as our good friend from Alabama just said. But under this amendment, that is not possible, because under this amendment, as modified, it carries out the original language of this amendment, which says that, `A counsel for a witness shall be allowed to be present in the grand jury room only during the questioning of the witness and only to advise the witness, and shall not be permitted to address the attorney for the government, or any grand juror, or otherwise participate in the proceedings before the grand jury.' 
That is it. This amendment would only permit the attorney, which every person under this Constitution has a right to at least hire, to give advice to a citizen inside the grand jury room instead of forcing that person to leave each time. I think it is a modest amendment. It is a modest amendment because it makes sure that we will not tie up a grand jury in knots. It is a modest amendment because it only says that what we know is right, that someone ought to have a right to counsel when they become involved in the criminal justice system--something that we know is right and something that we know is guaranteed, which is the right to counsel, to be exercised in a sensible way, in a way that doesn't undercut and diminish that very right. 
To be forced to leave the grand jury room after each question, in front of that grand jury, it seems to me, undermines the very right to counsel which is guaranteed in the Constitution. But, at a minimum, we, it seems to me, as people who want to defend this Constitution, should say, if there is a right--and there is one--that it ought to be exercisable in a commonsense way. 
In 90 percent of the grand jury proceedings, the witnesses are law enforcement officers or other governmental officials who are not likely even to have an attorney or want an attorney. But in those other 10 percent of the cases, it seems to me only fair, only common sense, to avoid the absurdity of making a witness leave the grand jury room after every question in order to exercise a constitutional right to the advice of counsel. 
I want to close by emphasizing the words of this amendment, because I think they are very important: `The counsel that a witness is allowed to have in the grand jury room under this amendment is present only during the questioning of the witness and'--these are the key words--`only to advise the witness and not to address the attorney for the government or address any grand juror, or to otherwise participate in the proceedings before the grand jury.' 
Many of our States allow the attorney to be inside of the grand jury room. Some States do, some States don't. But we have to make up our own minds as to what makes the most sense in this Federal system. It seems to me the most fundamental form of common sense. Forcing a person to get up, walk through the door, and leave the room to talk to someone, I believe, diminishes and undermines the very fundamental right that people have to the advice of counsel. 
So there is no tying up in knots in this amendment. 
This amendment precludes any possibility that an attorney inside the grand jury room will address the court, will address the grand jurors, will address the prosecutor. All that is permitted under this amendment, and all that is required under this amendment, is that the counsel for the witness be allowed to be present in the grand jury room, and only to advise his or her client. 
I want to commend the Senator from Arkansas for his extraordinary courage and, as always, his eloquence in presenting a case. 
I think that if we will all think about this basic right overnight, hopefully the majority of this body will do what at least a number of States have done, and that is to permit the attorney to be inside the grand jury room solely for the purpose of advising the witness. 
I thank the good Senator for his leadership.

It is my intention just to briefly amplify what the Democratic leader said here this afternoon. And I am greatly appreciative for the tremendous support that he has given to an effort to achieve a bipartisan approach to an issue which should be approached in a bipartisan manner. There is no justification for partisanizing this issue. It will weaken our security if we do so. And the Democratic leader's effort to insist that we approach this issue in a bipartisan way, I hope, will produce some results. 
Mr. President, the statement that was released last Tuesday by the majority leader was a highly partisan approach to the multiple hearings which we have had in the Senate relative to the export of satellites to China. 
I happen to sit on three of the four Senate committees that have held these hearings, so I speak from personal experience when I say that the majority leader's statement omitted some of the most important testimony that those committees received. 
His statement also conveyed the false impression that the statement was a bipartisan product, when to the best of my knowledge not a single Democrat was consulted or even knew that the statement was being prepared. 
The majority leader's statements claim that he was being careful not to rush to judgment, but then he offered such unequivocal conclusions as: 
The Clinton Administration's export controls for satellites are wholly inadequate, [and that] they have not protected sensitive U.S. technology, [and that] national security concerns are regularly downplayed and even ignored, [and that] sensitive technology related to satellite exports has been transferred to China, [and that] China has received military benefit from U.S. satellite exports. 
To my knowledge, Mr. President, not one of the Senate committees investigating these issues has reached those conclusions. The evidence that the majority leader offered to support his conclusions ignored some of the most important testimony that we received, obviously, because it contradicted their conclusions offered. 
For example, the majority leader's statement ignored testimony by senior Department of Defense and State officials on June 18 and 25 and on July 8 that the 1996 Clinton Executive order `strengthened' the Department of Defense's role in Commerce export licenses, rather than weakening it, and also ignored the fact that those Department of Defense and State Department officials believed `it would be a bad thing' to return to State licensing of commercial satellites. 
In a June 18 hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security on which I sit, when responding to a question on whether commercial satellite export licensing should be returned to the State Department, Department of Defense, Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Policy Jan Lodal testified that `I think it would be a bad thing to do.' And Assistant Under Secretary of State for International Security John Holum, testified, `I agree. . . . I would recommend against that.' 
Mr. President, the statement of the majority leader last Tuesday also ignored the Department of Defense and State Department letters which were included in the June 18 Governmental Affairs Committee subcommittee hearing record and which stated that each agency has an adequate opportunity to revise and support the issuance of all satellite export licenses actually issued by Commerce since 1990. 
The majority leader's statement ignored testimony on June 18 by senior State and DOD officials, stating that they are unaware of any transfer of sensitive U.S. satellite technology to China that has harmed U.S. national security. 
Mr. Holum testified, `[W]e do not believe that any launch of a commercial satellite under this policy since 1988 has resulted in a transfer of significant technology or assistance to Chinese either space-launch vehicle capabilities or missile capabilities.' 
Mr. Lodal testified, `I agree. We're not aware of any situation in which such transfer harmed U.S. security.' Yet the majority leader's statement ignores that kind of testimony. 
Now, the majority leader's statement cited testimony critical of U.S. export control from a June 25 hearing before the Governmental Affairs Committee by an individual that the majority leader described as a `senior official of the Defense Trade and Security Administration,' without mentioning testimony the following week before the Senate Armed Services Committee revealing that this individual, Dr. Peter Leitner, had been demoted by the Bush administration from a senior policy position to a lower-level licensing officer within that office. The statement of the majority leader also omitted testimony on June 25 and on July 9 by some of Dr. Leitner's current and former superiors at the Department of Defense contradicting Mr. Leitner's facts and assertions. 
The majority leader's statement cites testimony by the GAO before the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 10, but omitted testimony from the same hearing indicating that the General Accounting Office has not reached a conclusion on whether current export controls are adequate to protect national security, and he omitted to say that the Intelligence Committee had requested the General Accounting Office to conclude that analysis. Now, the relevant testimony came from Katherine Schinasi, the Associate Director of the International Affairs Division at the General Accounting Office. Responding to a question about Department of Defense's ability to effectively advocate national security interests in the current export control process, she testified on behalf of the General Accounting Office that, `We have not looked at how that process has operated.' 
The majority leader's statement indicates that moving satellites from the State Department to the Commerce Department eliminated the requirement that Congress receive notice of individual export licenses. The statement failed to mention the legal requirement that the President must notify Congress of all national security waivers authorizing commercial satellite exports to China, whether the export license is issued by State or by Commerce. The majority leader's statement also failed to note that Congress has, in fact, received timely notice of every waiver granted to export a satellite to China; and that Congress has received timely notice of the decisions in 1992 and 1996 to transfer satellites from the State Department to the Commerce Department. It fails to acknowledge that despite receiving all those notices, Congress took no action to express disagreement with the decisions made. 
The majority leader's statement also omitted mention of the National Security Council letter included in the July 9 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing record, stating that the National Security Council conducts the same waiver review process for commercial satellite exports to China, whether the export license is issued by the State Department or by the Commerce Department. 
The majority leader's report omitted testimony on June 18 and July 8 before the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on international security, by senior Defense and State Department officials that, after the 3 unmonitored satellite launches took place in China, a policy decision was made in 1996 and remains in effect today, requiring the Defense Department to monitor all satellite launches, whether or not a satellite contains sensitive technology. 
Mr. Lodal, speaking for the Defense Department, testified on June 18 that  
Communication [satellite] licenses include strong safeguards, including DOD monitoring . . . DOD currently reviews all communication satellite licenses to ensure that the proposed export would be consistent with U.S. national security interests . . . [A]fter the implementation of the 1992 Bush administration decision to transfer to Commerce purely commercial satellites, and before the 1996 revision, there were three launches that were not monitored . . . We're not aware of any transfer of technology from these unmonitered launches that contributed to China's missile and military satellite capabilities. 
He continued, speaking for the Defense Department: 
Nevertheless, DOD did conclude that full monitoring would be a strong safeguard at relatively low cost to the companies, and that it should be applied to all license cases, even those that did not require Department of State licenses. And this was agreed by all agencies and incorporated as a requirement in 1996, when jurisdiction was transferred to Commerce for all commercial communications satellites. . . .' 
The majority leader's statement identified the major `military benefit' of China launches of U.S.-made commercial satellites to be the access gained by the Chinese military to an improved commercial telephone system, without acknowledging that that same so-called military benefit would have accrued if China had instead launched European-made commercial satellites. 
The majority leader's statement ignored testimony from Clinton administration critics on July 9 before the Senate Armed Services Committee that the United States export control system is still the `best' and most restrictive in the world. 
Now, the majority leader has the right to say whatever he wishes on the subject of satellite exports to China. But he is wrong to suggest, as his statement did, that his conclusions were bipartisan, or that they were reached by the Senate committees examining this issue. His statement struck a major blow to whatever hopes there were that the Senate committees would proceed in this matter in a bipartisan way, with emphasis on the facts rather than on partisan politics. 
Mr. President, I hope that a bipartisan approach can still be salvaged. But I think it is fair to say that that goal, that effort which is so important to the national security of this Nation, was given a set-back by the highly partisan comments of the majority leader on this floor last Tuesday. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Reserving the right to object, I just state for the Record with regard to the proposal just offered, there have been ongoing efforts to clear a unanimous consent agreement on each of the items just mentioned. From the Democratic side, we can enter a unanimous consent agreement with regard to S. 442 and S. 1619. 
However, at this time, we are still attempting to get clearance on a unanimous consent agreement on S. 1482, but are not in a position, today, to enter into such an agreement. If the majority leader wants to call the bill up with no agreement, then, perhaps, we can do that, but for the Record, Mr. President, the Democratic side can now enter an agreement on S. 442 and on S. 1619. If the other side is ready to do that, we can go forth. 
Otherwise, I have to object to the consent request just propounded.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished majority manager of the bill in a brief colloquy regarding the Great Waters program. 
As the Senator from Missouri is aware, the Great Waters program is important to my state, the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Champlain area and all states with coastal waters. The program is intended to monitor atmospheric deposition of toxic air pollutants, provide information on these pollutants sources and loadings in our surface waters, and recommend to Congress any necessary changes in the Clean Air Act to prevent serious adverse effects to public health and serious or widespread environmental effects. These are important multi-media tasks that should receive Congress's full support. This program will help us identify and reduce toxic air pollution in an efficient way. 
The FY99 budget request for the Great Waters program, also known as section 112(m) of the Clean Air Act, is $1.484 million. In FY 98, the program received $2.612 million in appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee has included language in its report urging that the EPA `--provide at least $3 million to carry out--the Great Waters program.' I would hope that, at a minimum, the Senate would support this amount for this important program. 
Could the Senator indicate what the Senate's position would be in the conference on this matter?

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the IRS Restructuring Act of 1998. 
Ten years ago, I worked with former Senator Pryor on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. That legislation grew out of hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee which highlighted abuses by IRS employees against the taxpayers they are hired to serve. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights was landmark legislation that outlined the rights taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS including the right of the taxpayer to legal representation and the right to recover civil damages and attorneys fees from the IRS where they have engaged in abusive practices. 
While that legislation and the subsequent Taxpayer Bill of Rights II addressed some of the most egregious abuses, some abuses continue. The Finance Committee hearings have again shed light on abuses of taxpayer by some overzealous employees. While all of us want the IRS to be diligent in their collection of taxes owed to the federal government, we don't want the IRS to abuse its authority. This legislation is another step in the right direction. 
The bill contains an IRS Oversight Board which is intended to bring some private sector management and customer service expertise to the IRS. This Board is made up of nine members, six of whom are from the private sector and have an expertise in management of large organizations, tax laws, information technology and the concerns of taxpayers. The Board will review and approve strategic plans, operational functions and plans for major reorganization. In addition they will review operations at the IRS to monitor the Agency's treatment of taxpayers in general. 
The Taxpayers Bill of Rights II contained an office of Taxpayer Advocate. The Taxpayer Advocate has the responsibility of aiding taxpayer in their disputes with the IRS and reporting to Congress annually with suggestions outlining the most serious problems faced in working with IRS. Taxpayers can request that the taxpayer advocate issue a taxpayer assistance order if the taxpayer is suffering or about to suffer a significant hardship as a result of the manner in which the tax laws are being administered. A taxpayer assistance order may require the IRS to release property, cease any action or refrain from taking action. The bill before us expands the circumstances when a taxpayer assistance order may be issued. 
Currently, the direct point of contact for taxpayers seeking taxpayer assistance orders is a problem resolution officer appointed by a District Director. This bill replaces the present law problem resolution system with a system of local Taxpayer Advocates who report directly to the National Taxpayer Advocate. Under the bill, the local Taxpayer Advocate will have a phone number published and available to taxpayers, they must tell taxpayers that they are operated independently of any IRS office, and they are required to tell taxpayers that they do not disclose any information from the taxpayer to the IRS. In addition, the IRS is required to publish the right to contact the local Taxpayer Advocate on the statutory notice of deficiency. 
The Taxpayer Advocate will be required to publish an annual report to identify areas of the tax law that impose significant compliance burdens on taxpayers and the IRS, including recommendations and identify the ten most litigated issues for each category of taxpayer including recommendations on how to mitigate those problems. 
The bill contains other provisions that will improve the management of the agency. It also includes innocent spouse relief for those spouses who find themselves liable for taxes, interest or penalties due to the actions of their spouse. There's increased protections for taxpayers in the area of interest and penalty charges as well as in audit and collections. I am also especially encouraged by the stronger requirements imposed on the IRS to provide taxpayers with better information in regards to taxpayers rights, the appeals and collection process and potential liabilities when filing joint returns. 
While all of these reforms are steps in the right direction, there is nothing in this bill to simplify the tax code. Since the 1986 Tax Reform Act, Congress has amended the tax code 63 times. Just this past year, Congress passed and the President signed a tax bill which contained over 800 changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Now that this legislation is prepared to move to the President's desk for signature, it is time that we set our sights on tax simplification.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I'm glad to see Section 3507 regarding tax matters partners in the conference report. It strikes me as unfair that the IRS has not been notifying partners of a TEFRA partnership when the IRS appoints a successor tax matters partner. Under the effective date provision, Section 3507 applies to selections of tax matters partners made by the IRS after the date of enactment. Does the enactment of Section 3507 create any inference that the IRS is not required to give such notice to partners of TEFRA partnerships under the due process clause of the United States Constitution?

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Wellstone amendment which increases from 12 to 24 months the limit on the amount of post-secondary education training that a state can count towards meeting its work requirement under the new Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Under the old Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, recipients could attend post-secondary education training for up to 24 months. I support the new law's emphasis on moving recipients more quickly into jobs, but I am troubled by the law's restriction on post secondary education training, limiting it to 12 months. The limitation on such advanced training raises a number of concerns, not the least of which is whether persons may be forced into low-paying, short term employment that will lead them back onto public assistance because they are unable to support their families. 
Mr. President, a majority of my colleagues in the Senate has previously cast their vote in support of making 24 months of post secondary education a permissible work activity under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. A year ago, on June 25, 1997, a Levin-Jeffords amendment to the Senate Reconciliation bill, permitting up to 24 months of post-secondary education, received 55 votes--falling five votes short of the required procedural vote of 60. I would also like to make note of the fact that the amendment had the support of the National Governors Association. 
Study after study indicates that short-term training programs raise the income of workers only marginally, while completion of at least a two-year associate degree has greater potential of breaking the cycle of poverty for recipients of public assistance. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median earnings of adults with an associate degree is 30 percent higher than adults with only a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. 
Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues some examples of jobs that an individual could prepare for in a two-year vocational or community college program and the salary range generally applicable to the positions. One very productive specialty area is information technology. Graduates in this area are generally hired immediately following or in some cases prior to completing their program.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator Jeffords, in a colloquy on an important measure which will be a subject of discussion during the House-Senate conference on the Higher Education reauthorization Act. 
It has been observed that America does not send its athletes to the Olympic Games, Americans do. Indeed, the U.S. Olympic Committee, whose responsibilities include the support for training and selecting athletes to represent the United States in the Olympic and Pan America Games, is the only major national Olympic Committee from among the 197 participating nations that receives no funding whatsoever from its federal or state governments. All funds for training U.S. athletes must come from private sources, including an individual's personal resources. 
In September 2000 more than 800 young American men and women will gather in Sydney, Australia to represent their countrymen in the XXVII Olympiad. They will join more than 10,000 other athletes from nearly 200 nations to engage in friendly competition. Many will have spent more than a decade preparing for what Jesse Owens once referred to as `fifteen seconds of glory.' 
As they have since the modern Olympic Games were instituted in 1896, Americans back home will follow with great pride the accomplishments of the U.S. athletes, and will vicariously share in each triumph. But when the Olympic flame is extinguished and our American heroes return home most will leave forever the athletic careers to which they have devoted so much of their lives. 
The greatest homecoming we can prepare for our U.S. athletes is assistance in obtaining the educational foundation that will enable them to pursue productive lives outside of their athletic arenas. We can achieve this by reauthorizing the Olympic Education Scholarship program. Originally authorized in 1992, this important program recently expired; however, reauthorization language has been included in the House version of the Higher Education Act and it is my hope that our Senate conferees will support the House reauthorization of this important Olympic Education Scholarship program. The $5 million authorization level for this program would be an important step toward allowing these young men and women to simultaneously advance themselves on the training field and in the classroom.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the use of indiscriminate force by units of the Serbian special police and the Yugoslav armed forces in Kosovo must stop. If unchecked, the violence there could well spillover into Albania and Macedonia and could at some point involve other nations in the region, including our NATO allies. 
Acting at the direction of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian police and military units have brutally targeted civilians and used scorched earth tactics with a plan to drive ethnic Albanians out of their towns and villages. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, around 65,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in Kosovo since March and prior to the latest Serbian special police and troop attack on the town of Belacevac. 
Of that number, around 12,000 have fled to neighboring Albania across treacherous mountains--some children had to walk barefoot for days. About 8,000 have fled to Montenegro and small numbers have sought refuge in Macedonia, where the United States maintains about 350 Army personnel as part of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force. 
Before I comment further on what I believe should be done to address the crisis in Kosovo, I would like to briefly describe how this crisis came about. 
Kosovo, with a population of 2 million of which more than 90 percent are ethnic Albanians, enjoyed autonomous province status under the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. However, changes to the Serbian constitution in 1989 through 1991 revoked that autonomous province status and abolished the Parliament and Government of Kosovo. Since that time, Serbian authorities have carried out a policy of repression: firing ethnic Albanians from all public jobs and using arrests, brutal and often fatal beatings and other forms of intimidation in violation of commonly accepted human rights standards. In the face of this repressive policy, ethnic Albanians pursued a policy of non-violent resistance. They boycotted Serbian institutions and built their own parallel set of political, economic and social institutions. In 1992, they elected Ibrahim Rugova as president and a 130-member parliament. 
When the policy of non-violent resistance failed to make any progress, some ethnic Albanians turned to violence and over the past two years, the Kosovo Liberation Army has conducted attacks on Serbian police and other officials. On the night of February 28 of this year, Serbian special police reportedly killed more than 20 ethnic Albanians in a sweep through the Drenica region of Kosovo. Since late February, it is estimated that more than 200 ethnic Albanians have been killed in Kosovo at the hands of Serbian special police and military forces. As Serbian police forces have increased their violence against civilians, more and more ethnic Albanians have joined the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
Mr. President, the actions of Slobodan Milosevic and his henchmen have been condemned by the entire international community. Russia, at the conclusion of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council meeting on June 12, 1998, joined the NATO defense ministers in condemning `Belgrade's massive and disproportionate use of force as well as violent attacks by Kosovar Albanian extremists.' 
The United Nations Security Council, by resolution 1160 adopted on March 31, 1998, condemned the excessive use of force by Serbian police forces against civilians and peaceful demonstrators in Kosovo and acting under Chapter VII of the Charter imposed a comprehensive arms embargo on Yugoslavia and urged the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia to begin gathering information related to the violence in Kosovo. 
The Security Council's action is important because, by taking under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council has determined that the violence in Kosovo is a threat to international peace and security. This is important because, there is a possibility that Russia may use its veto to prevent the Security Council from authorizing the use of all necessary means to stop the violence in Kosovo. In this regard, I note with approval that both Secretary of State Albright and Secretary of Defense Cohen took the position that the Security Council's authorization was desirable but not required for NATO action to intervene in Kosovo. 
Mr. President, I applaud NATO's decision to conduct an air exercise in Albania and Macedonia to demonstrate its capability to project power rapidly in the region. I regret that Russian President Yeltsin was unable to gain Milosevic's commitment to withdraw Serbian special units from Kosovo, when they met in Moscow on June 16. Milosevic has already defaulted on his commitment to President Yeltsin to carry out no repressive actions against civilians. 
Mr. President, we all hope that this tragic situation will be resolved peacefully, but that does not appear to be likely. Bosnia has taught us that quick and decisive action can prevent a crisis from getting out of hand. We must not allow Milosevic to draw this crisis out, while the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo suffer. The international community must let Milosevic know that he must halt the systematic campaign of repression and expulsions in Kosovo. He must withdraw his special police from Kosovo and return his military forces to their barracks. And he must engage in bona fide negotiations to restore a significant degree of autonomy to Kosovo. Anything else will be insufficient and justify strong action by the international community.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Employees Health Benefit Children's Equity Act of 1998. 
This legislation concerns Federal employees who are under a court order to provide health insurance to their dependent children. If a Federal employee is under such a court order and his dependent children have no health insurance coverage, the Federal government would be authorized to enroll the employee in a `family coverage' health plan. If the employee is not enrolled in any health care plan, the Federal government would be authorized to enroll the employee in the `family coverage' plan of the standard option of the service benefit plan, typically Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The bill would also prevent the employee from canceling health coverage for his children for the term of the court order.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me say that, as usual, our friend from Minnesota is fighting for a cause that is an important one. I think he is one of the leaders in this body of trying to make sure we have enough money for child care, child development, and it is important that leadership exist in this area. I commend him on that. 
The defense budget this year shows a greater than 10-percent increase in this area. So I think the Defense Department is right when they give us the facts and tell us that they have a program for significant improvement in child care, in part, by the way, because of the efforts of people in this body many years ago. They have a projected significant increase over these years, in part, may I say, because of our former colleague, Bill Cohen. Secretary Cohen was a leader in the effort to provide child care in this Senate. He is totally dedicated to it in the military. 
The DOD effort, the planned effort to significantly increase the amount of child care, is requiring them to go off base frequently in order to do that, to get facilities off the site of the facility itself, and to go into the neighboring communities to get child care. But they are on that course of action. They are doing that, and they should. But they have put in this budget this year approximately a 10-percent increase in funding for child care. It is part of a significant increase that has been projected over a number of years for child care, and it is in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, who, when he was in the Senate, showed a tremendous commitment in this area and has continued that commitment as Secretary of Defense. 
So the increases that are significant have been planned. They are proceeding in a planned way. The Defense Department feels that it is proceeding as quickly and as administratively feasible and efficiently, and I would, therefore, oppose the Senator's amendment. 
I do so with some reluctance because of the subject matter. But despite that reluctance, I feel that the Defense Department is proceeding on pace, in a planned way, and most importantly, proceeding in a way that involves a significant increase in expansion in child care, despite the fact that the number of people in the armed services is being reduced, and it is all under the leadership of a Secretary of Defense who has shown a commitment to child care over the years. 
So for those reasons I will oppose the Senator's amendment. But, again, I express my feeling that, as he so often does, he is addressing an issue that is an important issue for the Nation.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we spoke with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Carolyn Becraft. She is in charge of their family program. They oppose this amendment. 
When the Senator says he can't believe that the Defense Department would not support this, or the people in charge of families and child care would not support this amendment, we asked them what their position was. Their position is that the child care program is funded in a way to expand the availability of child care in a planned way. 
I want to emphasize that. We have a significant expansion in child care in the Defense Department underway. It is because of the initiative of many people within the Defense Department and outside, including Members of this body. It is under the supervision of a Secretary of Defense who is totally committed to child care. He showed that when he was in this body, and he has continued to show that as Secretary of Defense. The Defense Department has this significant expansion, which is ongoing in a planned way, and that is why they do not support this additional increase. 
That comes from the Assistant Secretary of Defense who is responsible for dealing with the needs of families in the Defense Department.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just 1 additional minute. 
The source of these additional funds is across-the-board reduction in every budget activity in the Defense Department. It is not aimed at some category called `waste.' I think if there were such a category, everybody in this body would identify it. And I have spent a good part of my life seeking to identify it, have identified a lot of it, and we have been able to get rid of a lot of it. 
This amendment would take money from every budget activity, in a very small amount, which the Senator has identified. But those budget activities for weapons systems are just as important as they are. Research and development is part of that. Those budget activities include DOD schools, family support centers, commissaries. Families need those things too. 
So when the Senator makes an unallocated cut across each budget activity, many of those budget activities are as critical to those very same families as we are trying to help with our child care program. 
Mr. President, again, I oppose this amendment. I hope it is defeated. But I want to end on a positive note and again say how much we appreciate the strength with which the Senator from Minnesota supports the kind of causes which are so important to the people of this Nation and to the people in the military.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the victory which we celebrate today is truly a victory for the American people and our Constitution. It has been a matter of real pride for me to be associated with Senators Byrd and Moynihan in the effort that we have made, first when we went to court to challenge the line-item veto and were parties where it was ruled we had no standing, and the substantive issue was then delayed to the decision of the Court today. But then when, as Amicus, we banded together--no longer was Senator Hatfield there, who is no longer a Senator, who was with us I know in spirit, and who had been with us in our first effort--to file an amicus brief to point out and to argue the fundamental premise of this Constitution's Article I. 
The article that relates to enactment of laws is that the only way a law can be made, modified, or repealed is if the Congress is involved. And Congress may want to give the President the power to repeal a law or modify a law or even enact a law on its own. We may want, for whatever momentary reason we have, to give a President the power to make, modify, or repeal a law, but, thank God, we have a Constitution which says we cannot do that. And, thank God, we have a Supreme Court today which upheld that very fundamental provision of the Constitution. 
What we tried to do--the Congress tried to do--in this law was to give the President the power to repeal a law which he just signed. What this law tried to do, and thankfully was not allowed to do, was to give the President the power to create a law today with his signature, a bill which had passed both Houses and which became law when he affixed his signature. But then this Line-Item Veto Act said that if he, within a certain number of days, wanted to modify that law, unless Congress acted to do something to the contrary, that he could unilaterally, on his own, without congressional involvement, change the law of the land. 
Now, when we were all kids we learned about this Constitution and what those magic words `law of the land' meant, 
and what they mean today, and what, the Good Lord willing, they will always mean in this country--`law of the land'--all of us bound by it equally, no matter what our station or income or power, all bound by those words, `law of the land.' 
When the President affixes his signature to a bill, that bill then takes on that power, in a free society, of being the law of the land. What the line-item veto bill, in the form we passed it, tried to do was to then say, `Well, yes, it's the law of the land today, but the President can undo that law by himself, without congressional approval, if he does it in a certain number of days, in a certain type of way.' 
The Supreme Court said today that that cannot stand. The fundamental reasons have been cited by Senator Byrd, the mentor of all of us relative to the Constitution, and in so many other ways, and also cited by Senator Moynihan. The fundamental reason is, as the Federalist put it, as James Madison put it, that there could be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person. 
It is so fundamental, we often forget it. We should never forget it. The Supreme Court emblazoned it again on the constitutional consciousness of this country today. There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person. What this bill tried to do was to unite that power in the President by saying that he could make a law today as part of the legislative process, of which he must be a part, but then alone, as the executive, undo that law tomorrow--he could repeal a law on his own. 
That is what this Congress tried to give a President of the United States. What a power. And what a road that would have taken us down. To think that we would even consider giving a President the power to repeal or modify the law of the land on his own without congressional involvement, changing a law which had been properly enacted and presented--to think that we would do that is almost unimaginable. We tried, Congress did, and, thank God, we failed. 
I want to close by again thanking Senator Byrd for his leadership. I will always treasure a copy of the Constitution which he has inscribed to me, the same Constitution which he carries with him every day of his life, in his pocket, which he has so often on this floor brought out to make a point. I want to thank him. 
I want to thank Senator Moynihan and Senator Hatfield. I want to thank the counsel who represented us on this amicus brief that we just filed successfully: Mike Davidson, Linda Gustitus, Mark Patterson. 
I also want to thank, on behalf of all of us, the attorneys who represented us in our earlier effort, where we did not succeed because of a technical reason but where we nonetheless established that beachhead which today led to victory. And those lawyers were Mike Davidson, at that time as well; Lloyd Cutler; Lou Cohen; Alan Morrison; and Chuck Cooper. 
I also wish to thank Peter Kiefhaber. Although he is not a lawyer, he has one of the keenest legal minds--if you will excuse me--that I have ever seen. With their help, and the help of many others in this body, but mainly with the leadership of Senator Byrd, the position today was sustained that our liberty has been preserved in the most fundamental way. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate Senator Dodd for his amendment. It is inconceivable to me, as it was to him, that a retired reservist would have to wait for up to 9 months to receive the first pension check. The Army must fix this problem, and quickly. We will do everything we can to ensure 
that this issue is addressed and is resolved very quickly, and it will be Senator Dodd's tenacity that is going to drive the appropriate quick response and outcome on this issue. 
So the amendment has strong support in the Armed Services Committee, and it has been cleared by both sides, I understand. I believe the amendment could be adopted at this point.

Mr. President, I congratulate and thank the Senator from Washington for her persistence, her constancy, and the way in which she has gone about trying to make sure that the families of veterans, in their grief, have a bit of a reminder of the dedication and the commitment of those veterans. The honors that we should be providing these veterans and their families are important. They are particularly important at a time of grief. 
The Senator from Washington is determined, with the support of many of us, including the Senators from Maryland, to have the Defense Department make this happen and make this work. And I just want to thank her. There are a lot of families who will never know her name, but because there will be honors at funerals where they are requested, they will in fact have been served by her efforts here on the floor. I want to thank her for them as well as for many of us.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, the Senator from Arkansas has again identified a significant problem in terms of our defense procurement. We were very much concerned with this problem in the Armed Services Committee in the manner which the Senator from Indiana described. 
The difficulty that we face is that there is going to be some risks either way. If there is a delay here, as the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas would require, there would be a 14-month gap, approximately, before the advanced procurement funds could be obligated. And that gap in this production line will be costly to the extent perhaps of $2.75 billion. 
Now, on the other hand, in the testing which we need to displace some significant problems with the F-22, we are going to also have some significant costs. So either way, we have to face some risks--either way--whether we do it the committee way or whether we do it the way of the Senator from Arkansas. 
We felt on the committee it was better to do it our way, to let the Secretary of Defense, if he must waive some of those testing hours before the obligation of the advanced procurement money require that he certify that the financial risks that are there either way would be greater from his not certifying than from his certifying. 
So we are trying to reduce the risks through this process, the financial risks that are going to exist either way. But in supporting the committee position, and in opposing the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, I again commend him for taking the time to get inside one of these issues. He is one of the few Senators who is willing to get inside one of these complicated defense procurement issues and point out the complexities, and in this case what he considers to be the error of a particular procurement process in which we are engaged. And so while I disagree with him, again, I commend him and thank him for the time he has taken on this issue.

Mr. LEVIN. It is only because the hour is late and we are trying to wrap up this bill that I only will spend a moment saying how important it is that we adopt this amendment in paying respects to our chairman, who has done such an extraordinary job in moving our committee along in these last few years as chairman, and as a member for so many years before that. 
As ranking member, I had the privilege of working with Senator Strom Thurmond, for Senator Thurmond is a chairman who approached these issues on a bipartisan basis, as the defense budget should be approached. He has always set forth a determination that we protect our Nation's security first and foremost, and that the men and women in our Armed Forces be the focus of our resolve, and the protection and security of this Nation through them be what is first and foremost in our minds. 
So this is a small gesture that the Senator from Virginia is leading tonight. I want to commend him for thinking of this and for taking the leadership on this. I want to tell him it is my pleasure to join with him and do what we do so often, act on a bipartisan basis in the Armed Services Committee. 
I congratulate Senator Thurmond. This will be the last defense authorization bill that he will manage, but there will be many, many, many, many more years of energetic efforts that will be forthcoming from the Senator from South Carolina.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the tritium production issue that is the subject of the Sessions amendment is a very important issue. 
The Department of Energy must have a level playing field to make a sound decision on a tritium production source. We should not restrict the options available to the Department of Energy in making that choice. 
The Sessions amendment would ensure a level playing field for the Department to make its choice. That is why I strongly support the Sessions amendment. 
Mr. President, I will work hard to ensure that the conference on the defense authorization bill will result in a level playing field to assure the Energy Department can make the best possible choice. That is in our national interest. 
Mr. President, Secretary of Defense William Cohen agrees that there should be no restriction on the options being considered by the Department of Energy on a future tritium production source. 
He has sent a letter to the Armed Services Committee today that urges the Senate not to adopt any amendment that would restrict DOE's options. His letter concludes with the following sentence: `Passage of any such amendment would place the Defense Authorization bill at risk.'

While there may be priorities which I would give a higher priority to, including readiness, this amendment fits the needs of our military personnel and meets the tests that the Armed Services Committee has set for military construction projects. 
I thank him for meeting those criteria. We try to apply those criteria across the board, and here is what they are--if I can just take 30 seconds. Each one of Senator Burns' projects is contained in the Defense Department's Future Year's Defense Program, FYDP; they are all considered mission essential by the Defense Department; they are consistent with past Base Closure Commission decisions; and they are all projects that can be executed in fiscal year 1999. 
I thank him for the care with which he has selected these quality-of-life projects. They all meet these criteria.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment before us goes beyond the amendment which we considered yesterday. 
Yesterday, there was a debate on an amendment of Senator Brownback which related to the question of barracks. The amendment before us today revisits that issue, and I will come to that in a moment. It goes beyond that to require segregated training for our recruits. This is not a pure revisit of yesterday's amendment that was offered by the Senator from Kansas. We are now talking about both the barracks issue and the requirement in the Byrd amendment for segregated training. 
Now, our top uniformed officials have written us strongly opposing this amendment. In a moment I am going to read from the letter of the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Reimer, who wrote to Strom Thurmond, our great chairman, on May 19, about this issue. But before I quote from his letter, I want to emphasize that what we are being told here is not a matter of political correctness; this is a question of a commander's responsibilities that General Reimer is talking to us about. And this is what General Reimer wrote: 
The company commanders of the training companies are responsible for everything their units do or fail to do. Segregating their units-- 
Segregating their units-- into gender-unique platoons for training and billeting the soldiers by gender in separate buildings will degrade the commander's ability to command and control his or her unit. We do not want to make the commander's responsibilities more difficult or the drill sergeant's duties more challenging than they already are. 
This is part of a letter from General Reimer. 
Now, the top enlisted members of each of the services, each of the services--and these are the senior advisers relative to the welfare of enlisted members--have written us on June 17 saying the following:  
Each time our Nation has asked the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marines to do a job, it has been done. Men and women soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines accomplish the tasks asked of them every day in places like Bosnia, Haiti, southwest Asia, and the Far East. Their many successes in our gender-integrated, all-volunteer force is a direct result of the training the services currently provide. 
A direct result of the training that these recruits get--and that training is gender-integrated training. 
This amendment would end that--not only end it against the recommendation of our top uniformed officials and officers; it would end it prematurely and precipitously. 
Last year, we appointed a commission, the Congress appointed a commission. We picked 10 people on this commission to review the recommendations of the Kassebaum commission. That was our choice, and those citizens are now serving. They are serving at our request, reviewing the very recommendations that this amendment would put into law before that review can take place. 
I want to read from that part of last year's defense authorization bill. It says that the commission--again I emphasize, the commission that we created, we put into place, we appointed--this commission shall:

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me join Senator Thurmond, our chairman, in thanking a number of people, the members of our committee. Let me not single out anybody, but I do want to pay a special tribute to Senator Warner, Senator Thurmond's loyal lieutenant, who really worked along with Senator Thurmond and made it possible. 
We have great members of this Armed Services Committee who worked with us on a bipartisan basis--David Lyles on our side and staff on our side, Les Brownlee and staff on the Republican side, working together, all the time, to try to fashion a bill on which all of us at the end can come together. 
We want to thank our leaders, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle who worked so hard to make this kind of effort happen in just a few days. It seemed like a long period of time this was on the floor, but as complicated a bill as this is, and involving as many issues and as much money as this bill does, we really, I think, disposed of this bill with great dispatch as well as bipartisanship. 
This bill is a tribute to Senator Thurmond. Many have paid tribute to him tonight, and I won't repeat that except to say I will always remember this evening, naming a bill that strengthens our national security after Senator Strom Thurmond, who has meant so much to the national security of this country. 
It has been a real pleasure and an honor to work with Senator Thurmond. I know that my staff, our staff here, as well as all the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle felt very, very good that this bill was named after Senator Strom Thurmond.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the chairman, Senator Coats, and others who have worked on this 
amendment. It is a sense-of-the-Congress amendment regarding the continuation of United States forces and operations in Bosnia. We worked very hard on this amendment. The committee did not reach a consensus or, indeed, ever take a final vote on the various alternatives which were offered to us. I don't think anything should be said which would suggest that this is a committee amendment. Indeed, I believe that the chairman and Senator Coats made it clear that it was not. But it is an amendment which has a significant amount of bipartisan support. We offer it to the Senate on that basis. 
I am wondering if at this point, Mr. President, I could ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, so people know there will be a vote forthcoming.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the Congress on a number of aspects of our presence in Bosnia. 
First, it says that our forces should not remain in Bosnia indefinitely. We do not simply want to authorize a significant amount of funds without any statement as to the length of time that our forces should remain in Bosnia. 
As the Senator from Indiana very ably put it, we don't want to set a deadline. We don't want to mandate a certain force structure as of a certain time. We think that would diminish the safety of our forces. We think that would pull the rug out from under our forces. 
On the other hand, we don't want to write a blank check. We don't want to simply say, here are billions of dollars for our presence in Bosnia, and not continue to make a statement about the necessity within a reasonable period of time to remove our combat forces from Bosnia. So this sense-of-the-Congress amendment is an effort to avoid both the blank check downside but also to avoid setting a mandated date for the removal of those forces. 
First, I would note, Mr. President, for our colleagues, that the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, in their letter of May 21 wrote to Senator Thurmond and to me to express their concerns about some of the proposals that were being offered relating to Bosnia. 
In that letter, they said the following: 
We write to express our concerns with any amendment that would legislate a date or schedule for withdrawal or reduction of U.S. forces from the NATO-led mission in Bosnia. Such amendments would make it more difficult to accomplish the mission, which has been remarkably successful to date. 
Later on in that letter, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton said the following: 
We will conduct regular reviews of our force posture and progress towards the benchmarks we have established, and we expect further reductions will be possible, but that determination is best based on the actual situation on the ground, the military advice of our commanders in the field, and the approval of the NATO military and political authorities, not an arbitrary withdrawal or reduction date determined long in advance.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank our good friend from West Virginia. 
General Clark appeared on June 4th before the Armed Services Committee, and, of course, General Clark commands our U.S. and NATO forces in Europe, including Bosnia, and we asked him what effect the adoption of a legislatively mandated reduction of U.S. forces in Bosnia would have. And this was part of his response:  
I would not favor as a military professional a mandated limit because it would, I think, hinder our accomplishment of the mission on the ground. 
Then he went on: 
In so doing, I think it could jeopardize force protection. I mean, one of the things that has kept our troops safe, and all of our NATO troops, it has been made very clear to those who might seek to do us harm that it will not be tolerated, that we will take action. We made that very clear personally and in many different statements. So if such a commitment were to be taken by those over there that this was some change in policy, that we were somehow less committed, that it somehow meant that we were not as firm in our resolve, then I would say that could pose a force protection threat.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. We on the committee pressed General Clark to give us some kind of timeline for the accomplishment of those benchmarks, and it is that timeline, for how long will it take to establish each of these benchmarks--to achieve, excuse me, each of these benchmarks that General Clark is referring to and he is going to be sending to the Congress within the next few months. 
This amendment builds on an amendment to the 1998 supplemental appropriations bill that urged the President to seek concurrence among the NATO members on the benchmarks detailed in that March 3, 1998, report to Congress on estimated target dates for achieving the benchmarks and a process for NATO to review progress toward achieving the benchmarks. It required a report to be submitted, which was submitted semiannually thereafter on such progress. 
NATO has now adopted those benchmarks and will use those benchmarks as it conducts its own 6-month reviews of the mission and the size of the NATO led stabilization force in Bosnia. Our amendment is designed to keep the pressure on our NATO allies, to continue the process where the United States is able to withdraw our ground combat forces from Bosnia, while our NATO allies and other nations maintain or increase their share of the stabilization forces, total force strength in Bosnia. 
Again, the amendment does not mandate specific force levels. It does not mandate a specific withdrawal or reduction timetable because we do not believe it would be prudent to do so. Indeed, based on General Clark's testimony and on the letter from General Shelton and Secretary Cohen, we believe it could endanger our forces if we mandated a specific date for withdrawal or reduction. 
The people who do not want those forces there would then know what our forces would be doing and when, when they would be leaving and in what numbers. And it is not to their safety, it is not to our advantage, it would jeopardize their well-being for us to state legislatively in advance that a certain number of troops are going to be leaving in a certain number of months or years, or to set forth a timetable for the reduction or removal or withdrawal of those ground combat forces. 
Well, then, how do we keep the pressure on our European allies? How do we let them know we are not there for an indefinite period of time? How do we avoid writing that open-ended commitment or blank check? The answer is set forth in this resolution which attempts to let our allies know that we are not there indefinitely. At the same time, we do not in any way undermine the morale or the safety of our forces. 
Finally, Mr. President, the NATO-led mission in Bosnia has been very successful. It has been able to carry out its military tasks without a single combat death. 
The civilian implementation of the Dayton accords has not proceeded as well as the military implementation, but some progress has been made in the last 6 months. The upcoming September election, which will involve virtually every elective office in Bosnia, will be a major event. If things go well, it could lead to a major reduction in the U.S. ground combat presence there. 
I have been to Bosnia on a number of occasions, as have many of our colleagues. On each of my visits I have been struck by the high morale and the positive attitude of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces there. They feel, and I surely concur, that they are making a contribution to the maintenance of an enduring peace in Bosnia. Those who work with the Russian forces on joint patrols in the United States sector also feel that they are contributing to a better understanding of, and a closer relationship with, Russia. 
But we have worldwide commitments, and our forces are stretched thin. We cannot remain in Bosnia indefinitely. This amendment--it is a bipartisan amendment with strong support--serves to pressure our European allies to redouble their efforts to bear more of the burden in Bosnia so that United States ground combat forces can be withdrawn within a reasonable period of time. 
Finally, I will read from the mission statement that guides our forces, and then I will put the entire statement in the Record.

Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps I will just read them:

2. Police in both entities are restructured, re-integrated, re-trained and equipped in accordance with democratic standards. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-levin-mi-13-19980624</DOCNO>

Mr. LEVIN. That means--what it means is, the civilian control over the police, and that the police will operate within the standards which are followed in democratic countries, which means a semblance, presumably, of process for its citizens, avoidance of physical violence against its citizens, and the kind of implementation of the law which democratic countries seek to achieve. 
I may say to my good friend from West Virginia that it was because these benchmarks, in the judgment of many of us, including me, are not achievable within a reasonable period of time--that this involves too long a period, that this would require some significant restructuring--that we pressed General Clark, when he was here, for what would be the estimated timeline to achieve those kinds of goals. 
This is not the military mission, by the way. This is the civil restructuring that mission seeks to support. That was what I just previously read from. The military mission is what I just read from a moment ago. These are the benchmarks which the Dayton implementation, hopefully, will follow and achieve. 
But I must say, I agree with the Senator from West Virginia--at least as to what I believe he is driving at--that these benchmarks will take a significant period of time. That was the point that I made to General Clark. That is why I pressed him very hard to give us the timeline within which he believes these individual benchmarks could be achieved, because I expressed then, and I will express again: I do not believe these benchmarks can be achieved--that these goals, these civilian goals, can be achieved within years. I think this will take decades, in some instances, to achieve these. 
So if I could just conclude, and I will be happy to yield further.

Mr. LEVIN. What I simply was saying was, for instance, benchmark No. 3, `An effective judicial reform program is in place.' I said to the general, `My heavens, we are not going to be doing that in a matter of years. If it is highly successful, that could take a decade to achieve. But we cannot be there that long. We have to let the Europeans know in some way that we can only be there for a reasonable period of time, and then our ground forces must be removed, because we are 
stretched thin. We are all over the place, all over the world in many different ways, and our readiness is going to be jeopardized if we continue to have our forces in Bosnia for an unlimited period of time.' 
So what General Clark committed to do is to give us, within a matter of months, estimated time lines for achieving these benchmarks. That is what we are awaiting. I think it will be very helpful. I think all of us look forward to his estimates, as to how long would it take for an effective judicial program to be in place. 
He said he is not going to give us a specific year. Then I said, `Can you give us a range as to how long it might take?' He said he will go through this, benchmark by benchmark, in order to give us that range. 
So I think we are kind of after the same goal here, both making sure our mission is clear--and I just put that in the Record, making sure that our particular military tasks are clear, and I just put those in the Record. But as far as these benchmarks being accomplished, the best we are going to do, I think, is to get the time lines, the estimates on it, and then make the best judgment as to how long the forces can be there while these processes, hopefully, continue. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. I will do that, and then I will be happy to yield the floor. There are 10 benchmarks. The third benchmark I just referred to: An effective judicial reform program being in place. 
The fourth benchmark--again, this is for civil implementation, now, of Dayton. This is not our military mission. I want to be real clear, I read our military mission before. I read our military tasks before. This is the civil implementation side of Dayton. 
4. Illegal pre-Dayton institutions . . . are dissolved . . . 
And they specify which ones they are talking about. And I would be happy to give you a list. There are four of them: 
 and revenue and disbursement mechanisms under control of legitimately elected officials. 
5. Media are regulated in accordance with democratic standards; independent/alternative media are available throughout [Bosnia]. 
6. Elections are conducted in accordance with democratic standards, and results are implemented. 
7. Free-market reforms (e.g. functioning privatization and banking laws) and an IMF program are in place, with formal barriers to inter-entity commerce eliminated. 
8. A phased and orderly minority return process is functioning, with Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka having accepted significant returns. 
9. In Brcko, the multi-ethnic administration functioning and a secure environment for returns is established. 
10. The Parties are cooperating with [the International Criminal Tribunal] in the arrest and prosecution of war criminals. 
Those are the 10.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I can reclaim the floor for a final moment. Our resolution, it seems to me, clearly speaks for itself. People can try to interpret the President's statement in different ways, and I will read one line from it in a moment, but our resolution is very clear: Our forces cannot be there indefinitely. We want our forces out within a reasonable period of time. 
It is our belief that it will take a long time for these kinds of civilian reforms to occur. If you want to read the President's report as saying that the forces cannot leave, in his judgment, until these are achieved, I think that is really stretching what the President has said, but I will read it, and then one can interpret it the way one wants: 
The goal of the military presence is to establish the conditions under which Dayton implementation can continue without the support of a major NATO-led military force. 
That is what the President reports. He wants to establish the conditions under which progress can continue--`Dayton implementation can continue without the support of a major NATO-led military force.' 
The way I read that is that these do not need to be reality before the President intends to remove combat forces from Bosnia. If one wants to read that differently, one is free to do so. But however one reads the President's report, what our resolution makes clear is we are not going to be there. We don't believe we should be there for as long as it takes to achieve this. That is the point of our resolution.

In fairness--and I do not consider this to be an abundantly clear document.

But the document says, `conditions under which Dayton implementation can continue without the support of a major NATO-led military force.'

Mr. LEVIN. But I think the Senator would need to then read what it is in entirety, which is to establish conditions under which implementation can continue without the support of major NATO-led military forces. But that could be argued to read as that implementation of this can continue--not that it has to be achieved before the force can leave--but that it could continue after a major--major; a qualification--NATO-led force can continue. 
But I will simply repeat and then yield the floor. It is because we have our responsibility to state what we believe our policy should be in Bosnia that this bipartisan resolution has been introduced. We are trying to state we are not there indefinitely, in our judgment. And we want to let the Europeans know we will not be there indefinitely. We are not writing a blank check. We are not making an open-ended commitment. We are putting you on notice, we are there for a reasonable period of time. 
Now, why don't we set a specific date? Why don't we then say how many troops, by what date? The answer is, because our top military leaders say that would undermine the safety of our troops. That will jeopardize the well-being of our troops. That will play into the hands of those that want us out of there by one means or another and that will use force if necessary to get us out of there. That is because we want to support our troops as long as they are there and not harm them. 
Setting a specific date or setting a specific reduction timetable would, in the judgment of General Clark and General Shelton and Secretary Cohen, jeopardize the well-being of our troops. 
So what our resolution does is say we want to express ourselves, put everybody on notice that we are not there for an indefinite period of time. And by the way, we surely are not there until these goals are achieved. There is no way--no way --we are going to be there until these goals are achieved. But that is the expression of our opinion. 
I would be happy to yield for a question or yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. That is the strategy, that implementation can continue without the support of a major military force. And what the next step is is for General Clark to submit to us, as he said he would, within 2 months of our hearing, which was early June, June 4--so that, hopefully, by the end of July we will then have his timelines for the achievement of the benchmarks. At that point we will take whatever action we think is appropriate. 
This resolution is aimed at stating what our position is, again, relative to not having an unlimited commitment from ground combat forces in Bosnia. That is what this resolution says. We are not going to do that. We are going to say they are there for a reasonable time period. That is what this resolution does, which is what we think is the responsible thing to do at this time, without having more information as to what those estimated timelines are. But I would not want to tell you what action, if any, Congress would appropriately take after it receives estimates of timelines, perhaps ranges, from General Clark before we actually see his response. I don't think it would be responsible for us to project in advance what action, if any, we would think would be appropriate beyond adopting this resolution which states quite clearly that we intend that our ground forces only be there for a reasonable period of time.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Indiana is the prime sponsor of this resolution and is exactly correct. 
Further, in response to his question, I again state that this is our expression of what Congress intends, that we intend for Europeans to understand, and what we intend, of course, for the President to understand. 
Part of this, paragraph 5, is that the President should inform the European NATO allies of this expression of the sense of the Congress, should strongly urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a Western/European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-led stabilization force, if needed, to maintain peace. In other words, there may be a need--in my judgment there will be, by the way--for a long period of time for there to be an outside force in Bosnia. 
But what this resolution is saying, it cannot have American combat forces as part of that force beyond a reasonable period of time and we are putting you on notice. Whether we understand your exit strategy, whether we agree with your exit strategy, Mr. President, whatever differences there are as to the interpretation of it, that is not the point. The point is this is what Congress is telling you and telling the Europeans. This is not an unlimited commitment. We are sending you a very clear statement that we are only going to support the presence of American combat forces there for a reasonable period of time. Plus, as long as they are there, we will support them. We are not going to harm them by setting a specific exit date or a specific reduction schedule. We are not going to jeopardize the well-being of our forces with a specific date for an exit, because our top military leaders have told us that is what the effect would be. We are not going to do that in this resolution, at least. 
I yield the floor.

This amendment, I believe, is seriously flawed. What it will do is keep our troops nervous and our commanders nervous, because if there is not a vote that occurs on March 31 next year, then no funds can be spent to support our troops. 
So it really is the worst of all worlds. It attempts to guarantee there will be a vote. Of course, you never can tell what efforts will be made to thwart that. What this amendment says, if there is no vote by a certain date, the funding is cut, the troops must be withdrawn, the troops will not be supported--if there is no vote. 
That is a `keep the troops and commanders nervous' approach. I think it is a terrible mistake. I hope our last vote, which was overwhelming in this body, will be considered the view of this Senate.

Mr. LEVIN. First of all, Mr. President, we have all read about some terrible incidents that occurred at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds that gave rise to much of the concern about recruit training. Those incidents did not occur in recruit training. They did not occur in recruit sleeping areas. They did not involve sexual misconduct among recruits. They took place in advanced individual training, which is a phase of training which takes place after an individual graduates from recruit training. The incidents that give rise to so much of this understandable concern did not occur in the recruit training area or phase which this first-degree amendment would address. 
I want to emphasize something on which the chairman of the Armed Services Committee has just spoken. We appointed a committee or a commission, 10 citizens. These are distinguished citizens that were selected by the chairman, by me, by the chairman of our counterpart committee in the House, and by the ranking member in the House. This commission is underway. We picked 10 distinguished citizens. 
We asked them to look at a particular agenda, a list of items. We set forth their duties and they are now fulfilling those duties. 
This is what our law said, and this is something which had broad support in this body. The law said:

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment sends the wrong message to every single person in the Defense Department. That message is: Do as I say, not as I do. We are telling the Department of Defense to be more efficient, to adopt better business practices, to do more with less, to go faster in reshaping the military for the threats of the 21st century. 
We are pushing the DOD to have their inventory maintained more efficiently, to cut acquisition personnel, cut headquarters personnel, cut the number of ships and aircraft and combat troops. But, apparently, the military forces of the future that some colleagues have in mind will cut equipment, people, and supplies, but leave all the empty buildings standing to impress people. 
This amendment tells our soldiers that despite what we say, our real priority would be to protect our turf back home, instead of protecting the well-being of our future soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. Every single top uniformed military and civilian military have told us that the reality is that the money we spend maintaining more bases than we need is money that we can't spend buying our troops the things that they do need. 
You know, it is one thing not to authorize some more BRAC rounds, and it is something altogether different to make even an alignment that is currently possible without BRAC, to make that more difficult. This amendment takes us in exactly the wrong direction. It will make reductions more difficult than they are now. 
I happen to support BRAC rounds, but that is not the issue here. The issue here isn't whether we add a round or two rounds of BRAC, as much as that may be necessary in the judgment of some of us; the issue here is whether or not we make it more difficult to realign facilities that are currently realignable without BRAC. This amendment will make it more difficult. 
If this amendment is adopted, it is either going to kill this bill, or if the President does sign a bill that includes this provision--which is a very uncertain prospect--it is going to put a very large wrench into the Defense Department's gears and bring the Defense Department's efforts to make its base structure more rational and efficient to a grinding halt. 
The Secretary and Deputy Secretary are trying to move the Defense Department into the 21st century. This amendment is trying to set the Defense Department in concrete. 
This is what Secretary Cohen wrote to Chairman Thurmond and me on June 22: 
Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the Department of Defense's strong opposition to an amendment to the fiscal year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill that has been proposed by Senators Inhofe and Dorgan. If enacted, this amendment would further restrict the Department's already limited ability to adjust the size and composition of its base structure. The Department will have views on other provisions in the Authorization Bill as well, but I want to draw your attention to this particular amendment before the Senate completes consideration of your bill. 
The Department can undertake closures and realignments only after first complying with the requirements of 10 USC 2687. As a practical matter, section 2687 greatly restricts the Department for taking any action to reduce base capacity at installations with more than 300 civilians authorized. The amendment being proposed would extend the application of section 2687 to an even greater number of installations. 
This proposal would seriously undermine my capacity to manage the Department of Defense. Even after eight years of serious attention to the problem, we still have more infrastructure than we need to support our forces. Operating and maintaining a base structure that is larger than necessary has broad, adverse consequences for our military forces. It diverts resources that are critical to maintaining readiness and funding a robust modernization program. It spreads a limited amount of operation and maintenance funding too thinly across DoD's facilities, degrading the quality of life and operational support on which readiness depends. It prevents us from adapting our infrastructure to keep pace with the operational and technical innovations that are at the cornerstone of our strategy for the 21st century. In short, this amendment would be a step backward that would harm our long-term security by protecting unnecessary infrastructure. 
I urge you to oppose the Inhofe/Dorgan amendment during floor consideration of the Authorization Bill. Its passage would put the entire bill at risk. Congress has given me the responsibility to organize and manage the Department's operations efficiently. I need to preserve my existing authority to fulfill that responsibility. 
Mr. President, I think all of us who are on the Armed Services Committee--including my friend who is proposing this amendment--are very sensitive to that question. We want an authorization bill, we want to get an authorization bill to the President, and we want him to sign an authorization bill. The Secretary of Defense is telling us in this letter, in his words, that passage of this amendment would `put the entire bill at risk.' 
There are many ways in which this amendment would make it more difficult for the Defense Department to realign bases that are currently realignable. It does that by changing, reducing the number of civilians at a base that would require notification to Congress, or would require realignment action by a base closing commission. This amendment lowers the threshold for any base with 300 people to a base with 225 civilians. Even though the current definition of 300 captures all of our major installations, this amendment would go deeper. This amendment would make it more difficult for the Secretary of Defense to make the kind of efficiencies that we are demanding everywhere else in the defense budget. 
So I hope this amendment will be rejected. It is a step in the wrong direction. If we don't have what, in my judgment, is the courage to adopt an additional round or two rounds of BRAC--of Base Closing Commission--with the power to make a recommendation to us and the President, and a certainty that that would be voted on--if we don't have the courage to do that because it will put at risk facilities in each of our States, for heaven's sake, we should not go backwards, dig ourselves into a deeper hole, require lesser efficiencies instead of greater efficiencies. We should not set the Department of Defense in deeper concrete, thicker concrete than it already is in. So I hope that this amendment will be rejected. 
I thank our colleague, Senator Inhofe, for a number of things. 
One is his willingness to raise this amendment tonight, even though it means there will be less time tomorrow for us to debate this amendment. His willingness to offer this amendment tonight is very courteous to all of us who are trying to move this bill. I thank him for that courtesy, and many other courtesies which he has extended.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would reauthorize a special advisory committee on U.S. trade. 
The Auto Parts Advisory Committee (APAC) is an important private sector industry advisory group made up of American auto parts companies that advise the Commerce Department on auto parts trade negotiations with Japan and Asia. 
APAC was established by the Fair Trade in Auto Parts Act included in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. It was reauthorized in 1995. APAC's authorization will expire at the end of this year. 
At a time of soaring U.S. trade deficits with Japan and the rest of Asia, continued market opening negotiations are critical to removing barriers and achieving deregulation in these automotive markets. The overall U.S. trade deficit with Japan can only be reduced if the automotive portion of that deficit--on average 60 percent of the total--is reduced. We must have the tools at our disposal to do this, including the cooperation and resolve of the private sector to present our trading partners with a united front to advance the U.S. negotiating position. Because of the unfair trade barriers U.S. automotive exports face in a number of Asian markets, this reauthorization language will expand APAC's parameters to allow it to advise the Administration on trade consultations in Japan and other Asian markets. 
APAC has done much to focus the attention and will of the U.S. government on finding a results-oriented solution to the auto parts problem with Japan. It has also played an important role in organizing an industry that is made up of thousands of diverse companies, many of them small businesses, to speak more with one voice with regard to the trade debate. This industry directly employs over 700,000. If we can open up foreign markets to U.S. auto parts exports we can create more high paying American manufacturing jobs in the auto parts industry. This is good for American workers, its good for U.S.-based auto parts companies and its good for our economy. 
APAC is able to provide our trade negotiators with insight on the U.S. auto parts industry and the specific barriers they confront in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. Often individual U.S. auto parts companies that are trying to enter these markets do not want to speak out individually about protectionist foreign trade barriers that they have encountered for fear that doing so could jeopardize potential business opportunities in the countries in question. That is an understandable concern and that is why the U.S. Government, with input from APAC advising the government as an industry, can and should speak up on behalf of American companies trying to break into foreign markets. 
In addition to its advisory role to the Commerce Department, APAC has also issued a number of useful studies and reports on the competitiveness of the United States auto parts industry and on the barriers to trade faced in selling to Japan. It has also issued reports and recommendations to the Commerce Department and the U.S. Congress on what steps must be taken to open Japan's markets to U.S. auto parts.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Village of Dimondale, located in Eaton County, Michigan, which will hold its Sesquicentennial celebration from June 26-28, 1998. 
Dimondale was established in 1848 by Isaac Dimond, a wealthy former New York resident who had purchased 4,000 acres of land in Michigan in 1837. Mr. Dimond and his wife, Sarah, left New York for his `wild land' in Michigan in 1840, after poor investments caused them to lose most of their possessions. In 1848, Mr. Dimond built his house on Jefferson Street, and the Dimondale School District was formed, signifying the establishment of the community. Isaac Dimond founded several businesses in Dimondale, including a saw mill, a general store and a grist mill. In 1860, Isaac Dimond returned to New York, where he died in 1862. 
Today's residents of Dimondale are proud to celebrate the history and heritage of Isaac Dimond and the village he created 150 years ago. During the Sesquicentennial festivities, Dimondale residents are encouraged to dress in period clothing while participating in a family picnic and watching a baseball game featuring the Kent Base Ball Club of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which has been in existence for 130 years and which plays by the rules the game followed in the 1800s. 
Mr. President, I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating the residents of Dimondale, Michigan, on this special occasion.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate raises very, very serious issues that I think all of us have some strong feelings about, hopefully on the same side of the issue. I can't imagine there is a Member of this body who would support religious repression, forced sterilization, forced abortion, or the other activities which too often occur in this world, including in China. 
It is because this amendment raises such serious issues that it seems to me there are going to be many people who, understandably, are going to want to pursue what those issues are and to see whether we should not, indeed, address those activities, not just for China but for wherever they occur. 
One of the questions which this amendment raises is religious repression--intolerable, anywhere. Intolerable, whether it occurs in China or in Saudi Arabia or any other country. 
This amendment is aimed exclusively at China. The issues that it raises are incredibly serious; the activities that are described are incredibly reprehensible and deplorable, wherever they occur. The question is whether or not this country should adopt a policy of denying visas and, if so, whether or not it is a policy which is manageable; can we determine which of the hundred of thousands of visa applicants--for instance, which were issued to Chinese nationals--probably 
millions in other countries--can be investigated. If so, by whom and under what circumstances? Is it a practical policy? 
On the Armed Services Committee, we have not held hearings on this. This is not something that comes within our jurisdiction. This is a Foreign Relations Committee issue, which they, hopefully, have either looked at or will look at. This has to do with the State Department and Justice Department, not the Defense Department. 
So we are sitting here with a defense bill, being presented with a very serious issue that should be dealt with, I believe, generically, wherever the activity occurs, and it should be aimed at any country--not just at one, but all countries where these activities occur--and it should be a policy that can be implemented. 
Does this amendment meet that test? I think there are people who feel that, no, it doesn't. But it raises such serious issues that we ought to find a way to deal with these issues. I am one of those people. I am second to none in terms of my opposition to religious repression. My family has felt enough of that through our generation. I am second to none in terms of what I believe is the reprehensible character of a forced abortion or a sterilization policy. We don't have to take second seats to each other in terms of our abhorrence of those kinds of activities. But I would hope that, as a body that tries to deliberate on a policy and apply it wherever it should be applied, we would take enough time to ask ourselves if forced abortion is reprehensible, and do we want anybody who perpetrates it to have a visa. If so, apply it uniformly; if not, apply it uniformly. 
We have an amendment which says the top leaders of the country--the policymakers--are exempt from the denial of a visa. The Cabinet officers in China, presumably, who make policy, can get visas; but any 200,000 nationals of China are supposed to be investigated to see whether or not they implemented a reprehensible policy. You let the Cabinet officers off the hook, but the 200,000 nationals beneath the Cabinet officers are the ones whose visa applications presumably are supposed to be investigated. Why are we letting the policymakers off the hook? Why do they get visas to come in here, but people who may or may not have been implementing the policy are the ones whose visa applications will be investigated? 
We have a 1,500-page book, `State Department Analysis of Human Rights Violations Around the World.' It is a very useful book. Just open to a page just about anyplace--on page 1,561 it relates to Saudi Arabia: `The Government does not permit public non-Moslem religious activities. Non-Moslem worshipers risk arrest, lashing and deportation for engaging in religious activities that attract official attention.' 
Now, the policy of denying visas may or may not be workable, but we surely ought to apply it uniformly where the activity is as reprehensible in one country as it is in another. But the amendment before us doesn't do that. It singles out a single country; it singles out 10 pages of those 1,500 pages and says that this is where we are going to apply the visa denial policy. Is that what we want to do as a Senate? Should we take the time to decide whether or not we want to do it that way? I think we ought to. Is a policy of religious persecution or forced abortion as reprehensible if it occurs there, as well as 
if it occurs elsewhere? I think it is. 
So what we have before us is a very, very sincere effort to address a real human rights problem--more than one--pages and pages of human rights problems in China. I said 10, but I wasn't sure; it could be 50 for all I know. These are huge human rights violations in China--huge. The Senator from Arkansas is correct in pointing them out, in my book. I give him credit for pointing them out. But there are issues that are raised, which must be addressed by a Senate that is serious about addressing these issues uniformly, generically, wherever they exist. In my book, that is what we should try to find a way to do. 
Can we do this on a defense authorization bill? I do not believe that we are going to be able to resolve these issues here. Should we acknowledge that the issues are indeed real ones? I think we should find a way to do that. 
So there is going to be some real reluctance, in my judgment--honest reluctance, may I say to my friend from Arkansas--to table an amendment from those who nonetheless have questions as to whether or not this amendment should apply to people who engage in activities wherever they engage in them, not just in China, and should apply to top level officials, not just to the 200,000 nationals beneath them who applied for visas. So however people vote on the motion--and I hope everybody is troubled by the activity equally and with the same commitment and passion as our friend from Arkansas--I believe that will reflect, in their judgment, a decision as to whether or not the issue is an important issue, as I believe and I think all of us believe it is, but also how do we deal with it on a defense authorization bill. That is an honest dilemma that people feel. 
So the suggestion that people who will vote against tabling may disagree with the Senator from Arkansas, I don't believe is a fair accusation about many of us who will vote against tabling. Many of us who will vote against tabling have a lot of issues that we feel should be resolved relative to the issue that has been raised by the Senator from Arkansas--honest, legitimate improvements that could be made or considerations that could be made on the points he has raised, including the few that I have just enumerated here. Do we want to apply this to top officials? If so, why are they given exemption? Do we want to apply it wherever the activities occur, not just in China? If so, why is this limited to China? Is this a workable process when you have millions of visa applications--200,000 from China alone? We don't know on the Armed Services Committee. We have surely not had an opportunity to have a hearing into this subject, which I think would have been highly useful prior to this amendment coming to the floor. 
Mr. President, there will be an effort, I know, to table this, or a motion that Senator Warner hopes to make around 10:15. I know there is at least one other speaker who wants to be heard.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Otherwise, I think we would have to object on this side, and perhaps on your side, without that unanimous-consent agreement. We are trying, however, very hard to work out a unanimous-consent agreement to permit the Senator to proceed. 
So I ask the Senator to withhold just for a few more minutes to see if we can do that. In the absence of that, I would have to object.

The concern that is reflected in this resolution--this amendment now--is very significant in terms of what our fears and concerns are. These tests have not brought security to India and Pakistan; they have brought insecurity to the region. They have made the world a lot less secure place. And now we must both state that and seek to try to put this genie back in the bottle to the extent that those tests have helped to release it. 
The modifications are important modifications to make sure this is an evenhanded resolution, which it is, following the tests by the two countries. And our staffs have worked very closely with your two staffs. We wish to thank you again for your efforts in pursuing this, and we hope that this resolution is promptly and totally adopted by this Senate.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about the amendment my friend, Senator Warner, has offered concerning an open season for enrollment in the military Survivor Benefit Program. 
I understand my colleague's views that it is time to offer the possibility of enrollment in this plan to retirees who have, under different circumstances, chosen not to enroll. 
I have been told that the Department of Defense has determined that the amendment, as written, is actuarially sound. As I understand it, that means that this amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to set premiums for those who enroll during the proposed open season so that these individuals pay back amounts equal to the amounts they would have paid had they enrolled upon retirement. 
According to DOD, this amendment is not unfair in a monetary sense to those who enrolled upon retirement and have been paying premiums into this program since that time. 
Nonetheless, I still have several concerns. This amendment would allow all retirees, regardless of the state of their health, to buy into the program and, in effect, purchase annuities for their spouses that could cover any number of years. Even though the Department believes the amendment to be actuarially sound, this could, in my view, work to the detriment of the military retirement fund from which survivors' annuities are paid. 
What if all the new enrollees were terminally ill? A 90-year old retiree could conceivably enroll under the Warner amendment, pay premiums for two years and then leave an annuity for his survivors that would be paid from the retirement funds for a long time. 
I also remain concerned about the effect this open season would have on the tendency of younger military personnel to enroll in the program upon retirement. I am concerned that an open season like this would serve as a disincentive to enrollment by encouraging service men and women not to enroll at the time they retire and, instead, gamble that Congress will authorize another open season at some point before they die. If this is the case, it would not be in the best interests of the program or the service members. 
Because of these concerns and the Department's objections, I look forward to working with Senator Warner between now and the end of conference to address these concerns.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me again commend Senator Thurmond for his leadership on the committee. His chairmanship has been a distinguished one. He has worked hard to keep us together as a bipartisan committee. We have adopted this bill on a bipartisan basis. He and his staff have worked with me and our staff to work out the problems that we have had, and where there have been disagreements we have resolved them and moved on to other areas of importance. We are ready to get back to work on our bill. As the chairman mentioned, the Appropriations Committee has already reported the DOD appropriations bill, and we worked cooperatively with them, so it is important that we complete action on this authorization bill so we can get to conference. 
We have been working with Senators for the past several weeks on a number of amendments which we have been able to clear, and I hope that we can act on those cleared amendments here this morning. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will address our friend from Arkansas first. Let me add my comments to the Senator from Virginia. We were just informed last night that this bill was going to be brought back to the floor. We expected there would be the resolution of two appropriations bills before this bill came to the floor. We didn't know when the bill would come back until late last night. 
As the Senator from Virginia has indicated, there was a `Dear Colleague' letter circulated indicating objections to any consideration of amendments relative to China, specifically those that might involve visas and other things in that letter, of which I am sure the Senator has a copy. 
In addition, there is a specific objection which the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, as indicated in his letter to the majority leader, to any setting aside, or to quote him: `I object to any unanimous consent request designed to come to a time agreement on or to bring up such an amendment.' 
And the amendment that he is referring to is any amendment in this dealing with the People's Republic of China. 
So as one of the managers of the bill here, the minority manager, I have the responsibility, as does the manager on the majority side, to protect Members when there are unanimous consent requests, knowing of objections to those requests. 
I, too, join our good friend from Virginia in expressing regret to the Senator from Arkansas for his inconvenience, but we were just informed last night. We were never asked whether or not there would be agreement to setting aside amendments and so forth so that the amendment or amendments of the Senator from Arkansas can be brought up. 
Having said all that, there is at least one of these amendments which I am hoping, perhaps, we might be able to get agreement on before this day is over; that is the fourth amendment, which has been dealt with by the Foreign Relations Committee. Unlike the first three amendments, which have not been, the fourth amendment, I understand, has been dealt with by the Foreign Relations Committee. Perhaps we could get that amendment cleared before the debate is over today. We would have to go back to the signers of these letters with these objections in order to accomplish that. But I surely would like to accommodate our friend from Arkansas, if we can, at least to that extent. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

What the Senator said about his family, his stepfather, his uncle, and other men who had such an impact on his life, brave men, modest men, men of modest means who had such an impact on his life, all live through him in us and those memories are shared with us. They become part of all of us. And so I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for sharing those memories with us. 
I talk a lot back home about lifelong learning. When I talk to students when they graduate, whether high school or college, I say it is the learning that lies ahead of them also which is so important and they should never stop learning. We have greater opportunities for that now as adults because of some of the efforts, as a matter of fact, which the Senator from West Virginia has made to make possible lifelong learning for our citizens. 
We all still learn from Senator Byrd. It has been a learning experience for me, being with him in this Chamber, since the first day I was here, and that learning experience has never ceased. I do not know of any Member of this body who has not gained a great deal of wisdom and knowledge from serving here with the senior Senator from West Virginia. So I thank the Senator for taking the time he did this morning to share those thoughts with us.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. Res. 251, which has been introduced by myself and Senator Abraham, which I am confident will be passed later on today. This resolution congratulates the Detroit Red Wings for their second successive Stanley Cup victory. Tuesday night, the Red Wings defeated the Washington Capitals 4 to 1. This is the second time in 2 years that the Red Wings have swept the Stanley Cup finals--four straight. 
In perhaps the most moving and memorable moment of the evening, after the victory, the Stanley Cup was placed in the lap of Vladimir Konstantinov, who was injured after last year's Stanley Cup victory in an automobile accident. I have come to know Vlady and his wife Irina during this past year, when they have recovered, at least partly, from that terrible tragedy of a year ago. What is extraordinarily moving is the way the Red Wings--indeed, all the Red Wings' fans--have become a closer family as a result of that accident, the way they have surrounded Vlady with love and support. The whole town--indeed, our whole State and to some extent the entire country--has come to the support of Vladimir Konstantinov. When he was pushed in his wheelchair around the ice at the MCI Center on Tuesday night, with the Stanley Cup in his lap, surely we reached a new height in terms of what family means and what family is all about. 
The Red Wings have surely the greatest hockey fans on Earth. Detroit lives and breathes hockey, and there are a legion of fans all over our State and throughout the country who came to the MCI Center on Tuesday night. There was a sea of red 
shirts in the stands. I was one of those who had the pleasure of being there to see this very, very special victory. I also, though, want to not just pay my respects and appreciation to the players who brought home the cup again, and the Konstantinovs and those who supported that team, but also to the Caps fans who treated the Red Wings fans in the audience with such decency and civility. 
I have been to a lot of Red Wings games away from home where that was not true, where the opponents' fans, indeed, were quite hostile to their opponents. But on Tuesday night, as was true on Saturday night, the Caps fans treated us very, very civilly indeed. And when it came that moment, that very magic moment in the third period when the fans were serenading Vlady, who was sitting up with Irina in the stands, the Caps fans joined with the Red Wings fans in the arena singing, `Vlady, Vlady, Vlady.' That was also a moment I will always remember and cherish. Our captain, Steve Yzerman, won the Conn Smythe Trophy, deservedly so. He has been an extraordinary role model for so many young players, as Detroit Red Wings before him were role models for him. 
Speaking just for one more moment on that subject, when I was young and my brother Sander was young, we used to go down to Olympia frequently with my mother, going up to the cheapest seats available, three flights up in the balcony, where we rooted for an earlier generation of great Red Wings, the so-called Production Line of Sid Abel, Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay, and our great goalie Terry Sawchuck in those years, in the fifties, who brought home the Stanley Cup on many occasions to Detroit. 
That has happened again this week. The Red Wings fans, perhaps a million of them, have just finished celebrating in a parade down Woodward Avenue from the Fox Theater to the Hart Plaza. The Hart Plaza, by the way, is named after a former U.S. Senator, one who touched the hearts and the souls of this body, Phil Hart. The place where that parade started was the Fox Theater, and it was very appropriate that that be the place because that theater has been restored by the Ilitchs, Mike and Marian Ilitch, who are the owners of the Detroit Red Wings. I only wish I could be there to greet my friends the Ilitchs in person today, to thank them again for what they have done for our city. But how sweet that victory was, how moving that victory was, how important these events are in terms of gluing our communities together, bringing us together as family. 
With the shouts of, `Go, Wings, go!' still ringing in my ears, they now can savor the victory of a Stanley Cup. Just as their names are engraved on that cup, so their names will be engraved in this resolution when it passes, after Senator Abraham has an opportunity to get to the floor. 
With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the managers have accepted my amendment adding funds for two shoreline erosion projects along the Detroit River. The funds provided will allow reconnaissance surveys to go forward to help develop longer term plans for the important ongoing and comprehensive effort to revitalize the Detroit waterfront. I call to the attention of my colleagues that the Detroit River has been named by the Administration as an American Heritage River. Such recognition, combined with attention from the Army Corps and other Federal agencies, will assist in these redevelopment efforts. 
The managers have also accepted my and Senator Glenn's proposal to clarify that aquatic ecosystem restoration funds (section 206) can be used for sea lamprey barrier construction. The language in the amendment does not place a limit on the Corps' use of section 206 funds for this purpose. As my colleagues may know, the sea lamprey is a devastating invasive species that has plagued the Great Lakes since it first appeared and these barriers play an important role in preventing this species spread and population growth. The Corps can and should work with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to place these barriers in the most efficient spots. 
In addition, the managers have agreed to accept two important changes affecting contaminated sediments. The first is my and Senator Glenn's recommendation to increase the funds available for development of technology to remediate contaminated sediments. This is a pressing problem in the Great Lakes and across the country as EPA's recently published inventory of sediment quality establishes. The amount provided should help us make some progress in identifying cost-effective means of addressing this difficult pollution issue. The second is making it clear that the Corps can and Congress desires the Corps to spend funds to support the National Contaminated Sediment Task Force. This body was first authorized in WRDA 1992, but no Administration has requested funds to make this Task Force operational. The lack of funding for this body to date and the resulting lack of attention to this important matter must be changed. 
I would also note that the Committee has significantly increased the planning assistance to states, as I and my Great Lakes colleagues proposed, and that the Corps should use some of this increase to provide technical assistance, as authorized in section 401 of WRDA, to communities working on developing Remedial Action Plans in Areas of Concern. 
Mr. President, the diversion of Great Lakes waters out of the Great Lakes Basin is a matter of great concern to those of us from the Great Lakes region. Earlier this year, a Canadian firm announced plans and received permission from the Ontario Provincial government, permission which has since been withdrawn, to export water from Lake Superior to Asia. Also, the Army Corps has been considering a permit from a company in Wisconsin that wants to use ground water that would otherwise discharge into Lake Michigan for an industrial process then send the wastewater out of the Basin into the Mississippi River watershed. These and other activities, including litigation on the latter action, highlight the need for Congress to reemphasize that existing law prohibits such interbasin transfers, unless the process under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is followed. 
Last year, the managers accepted an amendment I offered to prohibit the Corps from using appropriated funds to permit a diversion, though it was subsequently dropped in conference. Senators Glenn and Feingold and I had discussed offering a similar amendment to the FY99 bill clarifying that such permitting activities on the part of the Corps, and indeed, all Federal agencies, are prohibited under WRDA 1986 unless the Great Lakes States unanimously approve of any diversion. However, the Senator from Nevada, who also sits on the Environment and Public Works Committee, has offered his assistance on this matter, which needs attention and clarification when and if the Senate prepares and considers a new Water Resources Development Act for 1998. I thank him for that consideration and we will await our next opportunity. 
The Committee bill includes some other important items for Michigan and the Great Lakes. They include: 
$1.5 million for Corps' public facility research and development to control zebra mussels and other invasive species. 
$1 million for solar thermal energy dish/engine field verification, which would support work that has been done by Stirling Thermal Motors in Ann Arbor. 
$3 million for accelerated demonstration of federally sponsored research for renewable energy production and environmental remediation project at the Michigan Biotechnology Institute in Okemos. 
$.5 million for Great Lakes sediment transport and modeling. The Corps can use these funds to develop models to target Areas of Concern, such as the Saginaw River, for preventive measures to control future sediment loadings, 
$39.95 million for operation and maintenance (mainly dredging at 24 harbors, rivers and channels in Michigan), including $1.9 million for Pentwater Harbor, which was not in the budget request. 
$.5 million to begin preparation of the general design memo for replacement lock at Sault Ste. Marie. 
$6 million for aquatic ecosystem restoration. These funds can now be used to construct sea lamprey barriers, per the accepted amendment mentioned previously. 
$70 million more than proposed by the Committee, per the Jeffords/Roth amendment, for solar and renewable energy research and development. This is the amount in the President's budget request. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill, despite the budget constraints that the managers faced in putting it together. I look forward to working with the managers and other Committee members on these important matters as they proceed to Conference.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the Gorton amendment. This amendment would create a complicated, bureaucratic and arbitrary set of criteria for establishing payments to the plaintiffs' lawyers while leaving the fees of the tobacco companies' lawyers without restriction. The amendment would set forth unusually high hourly amounts for attorneys' fees which could lead to higher payments. The underlying legislation establishes a preferable process by setting up a three-person arbitration board to resolve disputes regarding the attorneys' fees. The board would have a representative of the plaintiff, a representative of the attorney, and a third party chosen jointly by those two arbitrators. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the City of Roseville, Michigan, which is celebrating its 40th birthday on June 20, 1998. Residents of Roseville are justifiably proud of their community's growth throughout the last 40 years. 
People have lived in the area known today as Roseville since before Michigan became a state in 1837. In its early years, Roseville was an agricultural area and its people were predominately farmers. In 1836, William Rose was appointed postmaster in the area and he established a permanent office in 1840, which he named the Roseville Post Office in honor of his father, who was a hero of the War of 1812. Thus the area received its name, though Roseville was not officially incorporated as a village until 1926. 
From its humble beginnings, Roseville has grown into an increasingly attractive place to live for people moving to the Detroit area. While it had previously been considered a small suburb of Detroit, in the 1950s Roseville's population increased dramatically. In 1950, the population of the village of Roseville was 15,816. By 1960, more than 50,000 people called Roseville home. In 1958, Roseville was incorporated as a city and Arthur Waterman was elected as its first mayor. 
In conjunction with a fireworks display, entertainment, and other birthday festivities on June 20, Roseville officials will dedicate a new addition to the city's library, demonstrating that even as they commemorate the past, the people of the City of Roseville are committing themselves to the needs of the future. 
Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in offering congratulations and best wishes to the residents of Roseville, Michigan, on this important occasion.

Mr. Levin. Oh, God, it meant it was almost a slam dunk . . . 
Oh, this is tough litigation. The chief plaintiff lawyer who wrote the bill to make the suit possible in Florida said it wasn't tough litigation; it was a slam-dunk because he changed the law in a way that nobody knew what he was doing to create a lawsuit that had not been possible before. 
Here, Mr. Stossel goes on. 
Am I missing something here? The controversy's become should the dream team-- 
That is talking about the lawyers-- get billions from the 25-percent deal? 
They had a contract, you see. We will sue these people for the State of Florida. We will take 25 percent of whatever we recover. And then they go in and change the law and it becomes a slam-dunk lawsuit and they want 25 percent of it. Then they come to Congress and say, well, we have some problems with just suing. We need the Congress to pass global legislation to control this whole area of the law but don't control our fees. You can control everything else. Tell the tobacco companies they are violating their contract, but you can't violate our contract, not ours, because ours is sacrosanct because we are lawyers. We are lawyers. That is our business and you can't violate our contract. 
Stossel. This is his quote. 
Why do private lawyers gets so much of the State's money in the first place? When this construction company got the contract to replace this Florida bridge, they had to compete against other construction companies. There was competitive bidding. To win the job, they had to show they were qualified and submit the lowest bid. All States have such rules to prevent politicians from funneling projects to friends. But that's not what happened with the lawyers. Here, Fred Levin called some friends. You picked the dream team. 
Then they interviewed Professor Lester Brickman, a law professor at Cardozo School of Law, an outstanding professional who studied legal fees and how they are awarded for a number of years, and asked Mr. Brickman about it. 
Mr. Brickman: It's an outrage. It's more than greed. It's a scam. 
Those are strong words: `It's more than greed. It's a scam.' 
John Stossel. Law Professor Lester Brickman, who's an expert on legal fees, says it's not right for a Governor to hand over such a potentially lucrative case to a friend. 
Brickman. There are politicians involved who are stroking the backs of lawyers because lawyers have stroked their backs before and may yet stroke their backs again. So I think the public perception here, which is probably pretty accurate, is that this smells. 
Stossel. However it smells, the deal is now mostly done. Its main accomplishment is a huge transfer of wealth from not tobacco companies--they'll just raise the price--but from today's smokers, who will give it to State treasuries with a huge cut going to lawyers like Bob Montgomery. It's like an old boys' scam. You and your buddy, the Governor who sleeps in your house, do your little deal together. You get rich. 
John Stossel says: 
The taxpayers get burned. The smokers get burned. 
Finally, Mr. Stossel points out--I am quoting him now-- 
Finally, another clever twist you might have missed in the tobacco deal is that usually when Americans want to tax something-- 
This is very important, and I will share with you my personal experience less than 2 years ago when I was attorney general of Alabama-- we vote on that. The legislature decides on behalf of the people, but not here. Here, a Governor-- 
Sometimes in other States the attorney general-- 
 and some lawyers decided, in secret, that smokers should pay the State and lawyers a lot of money. 
And then Mr. Levin explains why it is such a cool political deal and why many of the people in this body like it, those fellows and ladies who favor tax increases and tax and spend and tax and spend. And people are getting mad about it. They are getting alert to it. They are objecting to it. They are seeing how taxes get slipped in through this backdoor and that backdoor. It is not popular, and many of them are losing their places in Congress and in the State legislatures because they are voting for too many taxes. That is not good. 
So Mr. Levin tells why this is such a good deal. 
The tobacco companies don't care. They can either pass it on as a tax, or they can pass it on as an increase in price, and tobacco companies settle with the Government. Beautiful. 
John Stossel. What's the difference? You're still paying 60 cents more for your cigarette? 
Levin. But it's the tobacco company they can get mad at. You don't hold that against the Governor. 
You see, make the public get mad at the tobacco company for raising the price, and the politician says, We didn't raise taxes. It was the tobacco company that raised the price of the cigarette. You get the deal? Good politics. Mr. Levin just flat said it. 
John Stossel concludes: 
So everybody wins. Well, not the smokers, but the politicians win, the tobacco companies win, the State and certainly the lawyers. 
Hugh Downs concludes the report: 
That's really outrageous, isn't it? And Bob Montgomery may well get his way because last week an appellate court judge reopened the door for what could be a big payday for these guys. 
And Barbara Walters concluded. 
As Mr. Montgomery said, `Oh, yeah.' But you know Senator Crist is trying to have a bill that caps the amount they get paid at $250,000. But even that's not bad money. 
Two-hundred-fifty thousand dollars is not bad money either. I say that to you. 
I went through that report because, Mr. President, it shows how this thing has developed and that there is a sense and a tinge of corruption in the way this was done. 
Another thing that was very unhealthy is how did the settlements occur and how were they justified? Well, the lawyers said for the taxpayers and public citizens not to worry about it, how we got this case settled and where it leads, because these fees are not paid by the State; they are paid by the tobacco companies. They agreed to pay our fee, see. I agreed with my tobacco company and they pay my fee. And it is not coming from the taxpayers. 
Now, I have been a lawyer for a good while. I have litigated a lot, and most business people understand money and they know that the tobacco companies, when they settle a case, don't care whether the money they pay is called tobacco fees, lawyer fees or anything else. There is so much money, they are willing to pay. And so they are perfectly happy if they can pay off the lawyer and give him a lot of money for their fee to get them to agree to the whole settlement. It doesn't bother them in that circumstance. 
So there is an unhealthy relationship there, and it is something good lawyers have to guard against at all times. You have to guard against that because it can even corrupt your judgment because your money may be paid from the person you are supposed to be suing and your fidelity, your loyalty, your integrity is due to the people you are representing. 
That is an unhealthy relationship. I just say to you this money absolutely available to be paid to the Government to be used for tax reduction and the child smoking reduction effort and health care and health research, it will not be used for that; it will be sent to the attorneys. 
Let's talk about something else. In Mississippi, the case there was an interesting case. In Mississippi, the case was brought before a single judge in Mississippi, and the case was filed in equity. It was not a jury trial, it was in equity. Many States still have a distinction between law courts, legal courts, and equity. Historically, in England, equity courts were run by the church and the law courts were run by the king. In matters of divorce and family, relief of that kind was done in equity. They came out with an equitable doctrine of unjust enrichment and pursued this case for a number of years, and under a theory that the tobacco companies were unjustly enriched, they made their recovery. So, hundreds of millions of dollars will be paid out of that Mississippi case, based on that. 
In Texas, the fee came down to be $2.3 billion for the attorneys involved in that case. I believe the firm that was involved in that had four partners, five attorneys in that firm, who will split $2.3 billion--quite a lot of money. 
Professor Brickman of the Cardozo Law School has testified, I believe--as Governor George Bush of Texas is furiously and aggressively doing everything he can to undermine and defeat these claims for this huge amount of money--Professor Brickman has testified that he figures the trial lawyers were asking for at least $92,000 per hour. I didn't make that up. This is a Cardozo Law School professor saying these lawyers were asking $92,000 per hour. 
Stewart Taylor, writing for the Legal Times--he also is a senior writer for the National Journal--estimates that the total attorneys' fees will amount to $5 billion per year and quotes Professor Brickman as saying it will create 20 to 25 billionaire attorneys. I am talking about a billionaire. I had my staff pull up--I think it is Fortune magazine that lists the richest people in America. We counted 60 billionaires in America. We are talking about creating numerous new billionaires out of this one lawsuit--some of them have not filed a case this past year--will be making $1 billion. That is just not acceptable. That just cannot be. 
So I appeal to all the Members of this body, whether you are Democrat or Republican, to look out for justice, to look out for fairness, to look out for decency. This is beyond making a good fee. I am quite willing to have these attorneys make a good fee. We will let them make $1,000 an hour and double their expenses that they have invested in it. I am willing to let them. But I am telling you, that is more than I really feel is necessary. But I want to gain support for this legislation. I think it is absolutely critical that we contain these fees. 
Where is the money coming from? Is it from the waitress? the construction person? the businessman? the gas station owner? the secretary who smokes--that is who is paying it--to give it to a lawyer who already has a garage with his Bentley in it, bigger than somebody's house, and who practices golf by driving golf balls out into the Atlantic Ocean? That is what we are talking about--a wealth transfer from decent Americans who trust their Government. They trust us to treat them fairly, to pass legislation that gives them a fair chance. We are taxing them to pay for this kind of thing? Wrong. It is unjustifiable, unconscionable, as a judge in Florida has said. 
How did it happen? How did this all happen? I want to tell you how it happened. I will tell you exactly how it happened because I was, in a way, there. I was attorney general of Alabama less than 2 years ago, and I was approached by a group of attorneys. They said, `Well, Jeff, we would like to talk to you about hiring us to sue these tobacco companies. We are working with a group of lawyers around the country, and we have this theory, and you can pay us 25 percent and we will just file this lawsuit for you. I know your attorney general's office doesn't have a lot of money, and we'll just fund that for you. You just give us 25 percent of whatever we recover.' 
And I said, `What's your legal theory? I don't think I can file a lawsuit, according to the ethical rules of law, if I don't 
believe it's a good lawsuit.' So we spent a good bit of time talking about that first. When they got through, I said, `What you are telling me is, this is not an established principle of law but you want to expand the law and go further.' 
And they said, `Yes, that's correct. It hasn't been a proven theory. But we have this new theory. We think we maybe can prevail on this. It is very popular today. Nobody likes tobacco. We believe we might just win.' 
So I told them, `No, I don't think so. I think I'd rather have you go ahead with your suits, and I'm not going to spend 25 percent of the recovery. If you prevail in Mississippi or Florida or other States and you establish a cause of action, I may consider joining it. But I won't need you then, because I have lawyers on my own staff and they can handle the litigation, thank you.' 
They didn't want to do that. They persisted and told me certain names of attorneys that they wanted to participate. One of the best known attorneys in Alabama, Jere Beasly, was a name they suggested to me--that he would be part of it. And the person making the proposal to me, it wasn't Hugh Rodham, but he was the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama who was a part-time Lieutenant Governor and a lawyer. He was coming in as a private attorney, and he was going to make part of the fee out of the case. 
I objected to all of this--by the way, the Lieutenant Governor has great power on legislation. We have had a lot of efforts to reform tort laws and lawsuits in Alabama, and they have died in the State Senate, where he presides over the State Senate in committees that he set up and established. He was popular with the trial lawyers, and he asked me to file the suit, and I said no, I didn't think that we ought to do that. 
And he said to me, `Well, you can hire some of your law firms. You can hire some of your buddies, your Republican law firms--cut them in on the deal. Why don't you do that, Jeff? That will be fair, won't it?" 
I am telling you, this is not good business that we are involved in here. There is an element of greed that goes beyond what is normal. 
So, anyway, that is the way that went. They go around the States, then, approaching attorneys general with this kind of pitch. As it turns out, one attorney is apparently involved in litigation in 30 States and another attorney group is involved in litigation in 28 States. What does that mean? What they do is, they have this theory. They have come up with a theory of litigation that can make billions of dollars in recoveries. They go into a State and get a group of local people, and they also bring in the President's brother-in-law, Hugh Rodham, make him a $50-million man because he sits in the room and reads a novel while they are settling the case. Let him have a little bit, too. Make him happy. Maybe it will make the President happy. Maybe he will be supportive of us when we come in with the legislation. We cut in the Attorney General of Alabama; maybe he will continue to be friendly to us in the State legislature. What would his fee have been? I don't know. 
They go around and they get investors. People, basically, as I would understand it, buy shares. They go out to a number of the big name plaintiff firms in this town, community or State, and they get them to agree to put up so much of the money. They put the money in. Each one of them has a share. These major law firms that are doing most of the work, they do all the brainwork, and the local guys file the pleadings and handle the PR and the political stuff and take care of the attorney general, and make him look good. That is how it happens. 
And then, boom, after Mississippi--they had that unique single judge in Mississippi--you had the change of law in Florida, the tobacco companies lost those big settlements, and they just collapsed and they agreed to pay everybody. Listen to me. In some States, the attorneys had done little more than file the lawsuit and they are now claiming 25 percent, 15 percent, of billions of dollars in recovery. 
Why? Because they had a contract. They signed a contract with the attorney general of Alabama, Georgia, whatever State. That is not good. That is not a good process. I will tell you with absolute certainty and conviction that money paid to those lawyers is money not available to children, to antismoking programs in America. It was simply allowed to go to the attorneys. 
Why would not my brethren on the other side of the aisle, who profess to be so concerned about children, be involved in this? They have accused those who have opposed this tobacco legislation consistently of being tools of big tobacco--`Oh, they're just bought and paid for by big tobacco.' 
I will say this, I took not a dime from tobacco. I rejected tobacco money. I have not taken it and will not take it. I don't think at this stage of the game we ought to be taking money from tobacco. I realized we were going to have a contested issue concerning tobacco, and I wanted to keep my record clear, so I have not taken any. A lot of other Senators on both sides of the aisle don't take tobacco money.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of Michigan's finest lawyers, Donald E. Barris, who is celebrating his 80th birthday on June 21st. Born and raised in Detroit, Don Barris attended Detroit public schools and Wayne State University, from whose law he graduated in 1940. Don has spent his entire professional life, now approaching 60 years, in private practice in downtown Detroit. In 1968, he co-founded the firm of Barris, Sott, Denn & Driker and is its senior partner. 
Known throughout southeastern Michigan as a premier trial lawyer, Don has also served as a trusted legal advisor to hundreds of families and businesses. Their problems have become his problems, as he passionately advocated their causes. Using his vast knowledge of zoning and land use law, Don has provided significant services to churches, synagogues and other non-profit institutions throughout the Metropolitan Detroit area. He has been recognized by these appreciative clients for the zeal with which he has furthered their interests, often taking no compensation for his work. 
Don Barris has been a generous benefactor of the Wayne State University Law School. He provided the funds for a student lounge named after his late wife, Miriam, and has contributed substantial resources to expand the Law School's computer laboratory. The Donald E. Barris Trial Practice Fund was established at the Law School by his law firm to honor his legal talents and many contributions to Wayne State. 
It is a pleasure to recognize and honor Donald E. Barris, a great lawyer and a great humanitarian, on the occasion of his 80th birthday.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I must note to my colleagues that the procedure that has been used here on the floor today for consideration of this conference report is outrageous. 
Despite the process followed here, I intend to vote for this bill, based on the representations about Michigan's share of highway funds made in the incomplete charts provided by the Conference Committee. I ask unanimous consent that those charts be placed in the Record following my statement. The best judgement I can exercise at this point is to support the apparent increases provided to my state. According to these charts, Michigan will receive an annual average of $825 million per year from the Highway Trust Fund, an increase of $310 million over the ISTEA I average. Our percentage return on the dollars distributed will rise from approximately 84% to 90.5% and is guaranteed to go no lower. And, our share of the total funds going to the states will increase from approximately 2.87% to 3.16%, close to the Senate bill's mark. 
If the factual matter in those charts proves to be inaccurate, I, and I am sure my donor state colleagues, will seek corrective action. 
Michigan and the nation are making some significant progress with the passage of this bill. We are now going to spend all or nearly all our gas tax dollars on transportation, rather than leaving them in the Highway Trust Fund. That means we are going to start addressing the serious backlog of infrastructure projects that are vital to our economy and quality of life. 
I understand the report contains a minimum guarantee provision similar to that in the Senate bill, though the `guarantee' has been reduced to a 90.5% return on dollars distributed rather than the 91% the donor states were promised. Still, this is some incremental progress for my state, but Michigan will continue to be a substantial donor state and continue sending money to the donee states. We will continue pressing at the next opportunity for more equity, particularly on transit when that title is reauthorized in two years. But, for the moment, we can declare a minor victory. 
While I appreciate the conferees', particularly Senator Warner's, attention to the donor states' needs, I am concerned by one particular provision. Apparently, the report includes an item that could drastically reduce the minimum guarantee funds to states if revenues increase by more than 25% over a 1998 baseline. This provision has no place in this bill, particularly since the total amount authorized and distributed by this bill is projected to rise by approximately 25% over the next six years, assuming current CBO projections. Its inclusion undermines the `guarantee' and the promise that the Senate conferees made to the donor states, since we could be disproportionately hurt. I intend to examine this provision closely and will work with the other donor states to change this provision if it proves harmful to us. 
I am pleased that the conferees have included a number of important provisions in the report, including a provision similar to one I authored in the Senate's bill enhancing local transportation officials participation in the preparation of the states' transportation improvement program. Also, the international trade corridor number 18, which includes I-69 and I-94, is designated as high priority. Ambassador Bridge access projects are made eligible for Federal funding. The State of Michigan will receive $10 million in FY99 and $13.5 million in FY2000 for buses and bus facilities in a block grant for distribution around the State. Numerous other important projects are identified all over the State, from an Intelligent Transportation System technology project in Lansing, to Monroe Rail Consolidation, to the South Beltline in Grand Rapids, to renovation and rehabilitation of the Detroit Waterfront, to upgrading 3 Mile Road in Grand Traverse County, to upgrading H-58 in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore., etc. 
This is not a perfect bill. But, it is another step on the long, long road toward equity. When I started in the Senate, we were getting somewhere around $.75 cents on our gas tax dollar. The 1991 ISTEA bill brought us up to approximately $.80 per dollar, and the conference report before us should get us to about $.83. Some day, Michigan taxpayers will get back 100% of the gas taxes they pay into the Highway Trust Fund in the form of better roads and bridges and well-maintained infrastructure. But, only if we keep fighting.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, about one year from now, in June 1999, the independent counsel law is due to expire unless Congress acts to renew it. In the Senate, the Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, is responsible for examining whether the independent counsel law ought to be reauthorized. I rise today because, as I've begun to look at the reauthorization issues, one stands out as central to the law, central to the question of reauthorization, and central to the issue of whether the independent counsel law is a tool of fairness or a weapon of politics. 
In a recent Law Day speech, independent counsel Kenneth Starr proclaimed that, `No one is above the law.' He is correct. No one is above the law--certainly not the President, who was the focus of Starr's remarks, but equally so, not an independent counsel. 
The question I want to discuss today is whether independent counsels are themselves complying with the law, in particular a provision at 28 U.S.C. 594(f)(1), which states that independent counsels `shall' comply with the `written or other established policies of the Department of Justice.' 
This is a straightforward provision. The law says `shall,' not `may,' not `should.' It makes compliance with established Justice Department policies mandatory, not discretionary, for every independent counsel. The only exception to this rule is where compliance with Departmental policies would be `inconsistent with the purposes of the statute' such as, for example, compliance with a policy requiring the permission of the Attorney General to take a specific act. Barring this exception, the law's clear general rule is that independent counsels must comply with established Justice Department policies. 
This provision in the law is an important one. It is a key constraint to ensure that persons who are subject to independent counsel investigations receive the same treatment as ordinary citizens--no better and no worse. It is a key safeguard against an overly zealous prosecutor. 
The Senate felt so strongly about this requirement that, during the law's 1994 reauthorization, the Senate approved an amendment by Senator Bob Dole emphasizing that failure to follow Justice Department policies constitutes `cause' for removing an independent counsel from office. The final conference report on the law, while omitting the Senate provision as accurate but too limiting, said, `refusal to follow important Department guidelines . . : like many other circumstances--do provide potential grounds for removing an independent counsel from office.' 
Independent counsel compliance with Justice Department policies was important to the Supreme Court. In the key decision upholding the independent counsel law, Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court referred to the requirement as one of the keys to the law's constitutionality. The Court did so when determining whether the independent counsel law, `taken as a whole, violates the principle of separation of powers by unduly interfering with the role of the Executive Branch,' in particular the Constitutional requirement that the President, as head of the executive branch, ensure that the laws be faithfully executed. The Supreme Court stated: 
It is undeniable that the Act reduces the amount of control or supervision that the Attorney General and, through him, the President exercises over the investigation and prosecution of a certain class of alleged criminal activity. . . . Nonetheless, the Act does give the Attorney General several means of supervising or controlling the prosecutorial powers that may be wielded by an independent counsel. Most importantly, the Attorney General retains the power to remove the counsel for `good cause,' a power that we have already concluded provides the Executive with substantial ability to ensure that the laws are `faithfully executed' by an independent counsel. No independent counsel may be appointed without a specific request by the Attorney General, and the Attorney General's decision not to request appointment if he finds `no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted' is committed to his unreviewable discretion. . . . In addition, the jurisdiction of the independent counsel is defined with reference to the facts submitted by the Attorney General, and once a counsel is appointed, the Act requires that the counsel abide by Justice Department policy unless it is not `possible' to do so. 
The Court then went on to say, in language directly relevant to this issue: `Notwithstanding the fact that the counsel is to some degree `independent' and free from executive supervision to a greater extent than other federal prosecutors, in our view these features of the Act give the Executive Branch sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure the President is able to perform his 
constitutionally assigned duties.' 
The Supreme Court thus highlighted four `features' of the independent counsel law which enable the Attorney General to meet the constitutional requirement that the President, as head of the executive branch, ensure the faithful execution of the law. The four features identified by the Court are the Attorney General's sole authority to request appointment of an independent counsel, her authority to remove an independent counsel from office for good cause, her authority to define the scope of an independent counsel's investigation, and the requirement that independent counsels must abide by Justice Department policy. 
Mandatory compliance with Justice Department policies is important not only for the law to be constitutional, but also because that compliance is one of the few practical constraints on the conduct of an independent counsel. The Supreme Court has held that the special court which appoints independent counsels `has no power to supervise or control the activities of the counsel' it has appointed. Congress, legally empowered to oversee independent counsels, has shown little interest under the current Republican leadership in monitoring independent counsels investigating the Clinton Administration. 
The law does empower the Attorney General to remove an independent counsel from office for good cause, but that draconian penalty is not a practical one and has never been used. For example, if Attorney General Reno were to fire independent counsel Starr for enforcing subpoenas served on Secret Service personnel, the Republican Congress as well as the news media would have her head. The power to terminate an independent counsel, while an essential element in the law's architecture for purposes of constitutionality, is simply not, except for unusual circumstances, a practical means for limiting an independent counsel's individual prosecutorial decisions. 
That means a key remaining constraint on independent counsels is the legal requirement that they comply with established Justice Department policies. 
Yet questions have increasingly arisen about whether sitting independent counsels are acting in ways that an ordinary federal prosecutor would, or whether they are taking actions outside the established practices of the Department of Justice. 
A prime example is an independent counsel subpoena so troubling that the Supreme Court has agreed to review it on an expedited basis next month. This subpoena was served by independent counsel Starr on a private attorney who, in 1993, met with Vincent Foster nine days before his suicide to discuss representing him during inquiries into the White House travel office. The Starr subpoena demands the notes taken by the attorney during that meeting, on the ground that the attorney-client relationship dissolved upon Mr. Foster's death.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment that I will be sending to the desk will change the trigger date for sanctionable activity from August 8, 1995, which is currently in the bill, to January 22, 1998. I will explain why I am seeking to do that in the next few minutes. 
The bill the Senate is debating requires the President to submit periodic reports on foreign persons who, on or after August 8, 1995, have provided or attempted to provide material, technology, technical assistance, or facilities that contributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop or produce ballistic missiles. Those who are identified as assisting Iran's ballistic missile effort will be subject to sanctions for at least two years, preventing them from buying military equipment and technology, and controlled dual-use goods and technology, and from receiving U.S. economic aid. 
The bill includes two waiver provisions, one in case the President learns of new information that shows that a foreign person did not provide assistance initially included in one of the required reports, and one in case the President determines that imposing sanctions would not be in our national security interest. 
I am a cosponsor of this legislation, and I strongly support the legislation's goal, Mr. President--to stop assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program by foreign entities. 
I am concerned, however, about the bill's use of August 8, 1995 as the trigger date for determining behavior to be sanctioned. 
My amendment would change the trigger date in the bill for determining behavior to be sanctioned from August 8, 1995 to January 22, 1998. This is the date on which the then-Prime Minister of Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, signed a government decree to strengthen Russian export controls on dual-use items that could be used either for weapons of mass destruction or for missiles to deliver such weapons. 
Madam President, we need to strengthen the President's ability to apply sanctions to foreign entities--whether individuals, companies or educational institutions--that provide assistance of any kind to the current efforts of Iran to develop ballistic missiles that could threaten their neighbors. 
But I believe that the more appropriate trigger date for the behavior subject to sanctions is January 22, 1998 rather than August 8, 1995 for the following reasons: 
The United States Government has been working with the Russian Government intensely for the last few years to encourage them to stop all assistance by any entity in Russia to Iran's efforts to develop a ballistic missile. Our government has engaged the Russian Government at the highest levels--President Clinton directly to President Yeltsin--and at numerous levels below the Presidents. Vice President Gore made this a crucial and central issue in the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, and put this on then-Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's agenda for immediate attention. In addition, the Administration appointed Ambassador Frank Wisner to work with his specially appointed Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev, the head of the Russian Space Agency, to seek progress in stopping assistance from Russian entities to Iran's ballistic missile program. 
Ambassador Wisner was recently succeeded by Ambassador Robert Gallucci, the diplomat who negotiated the North Korean Agreed Framework and led UNSCOM inspection teams in ferreting out Iraqi weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf War. So our government has been highly energized and motivated and they deserve credit for their efforts, which are continuing still. 
These efforts have met with mixed success. In some cases, the activities have stopped. In other cases, the activities have continued. And in other cases, the information is inconclusive as to whether or not the activities that the Russian Government has said they are trying to stop and which we surely want stopped, and which the world needs stopped, in fact have stopped. 
However, in January of this year, the Russian Government took an important step that we had been encouraging them to take for some time. On January 22, then-Prime Minister of Russia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, issued a broad decree, known as the `catch-all' decree, to strengthen export controls over all dual-use goods and services that could be used to proliferate either weapons of mass destruction or the missiles to deliver them. 
This decree states that Russian entities engaged in foreign trade `shall refrain from export transactions involving any dual-use goods or services not subject to Russian Federation export control regulations should such entities be aware that such goods and services will be used to develop or employ nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missile means of delivery . . .'. The decree goes on to state that `Should Russian entities engaged in foreign trade have reason to believe that such goods and services may be used for the aforesaid purposes, they shall submit the pertinent application to the Russian Federation Governmental Commission on Export control.' 
Madam President, this Russian decree is a broad and sweeping prohibition on the export of any goods and services, if there is reason to believe that those goods or services could be used to develop or employ a weapon of mass destruction or the missiles to deliver them. 
Our Government strongly encouraged the Russian Government to issue that decree. 
And of great significance, the January 22 decree is broader and stronger than the Missile Technology Control Regime. The Missile Technology Control Regime deals only with the proliferation of missile technology for certain classes of missiles. The January 22 decree is an effort by the Russian Government to strengthen controls over the export of technology, goods, and services that can lead to the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction as well as the missiles to deliver them. 
So this decree covers the weapons of mass destruction and their components and the materials that go into them. It is much broader than the Missile Control Technology Regime, which just relates to missiles. The Missile Technology Control Regime, to state it more correctly, covers just missiles, whereas the Chernomyrdin decree of January 22 covers the weapons of mass destruction that we are trying to preserve and protect the world from, as well as the missiles that could deliver them. 
This is an important step by the Russian Government. That decree, which we pleaded with them to adopt and to publish, deserves to be supported and deserves to be encouraged. 
My amendment uses their decree as the basis for our action--their decree--and that reinforces its effectiveness instead of ignoring its issuance. 
Madam President, it is not clear to me that all the activities of the Russian entities that have or could contribute to Iran's ballistic missile program would even be proscribed by the Missile Technology Control Regime that the Russians signed in August of 1995. But the January 22 decree, being much broader, would prohibit those activities because they fit under the decree's broad category of `export transactions involving any dual use goods or services' that `may' be used to develop or employ nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or the missiles to deliver them. 
So, summarizing the amendment, the amendment strengthens the original intent of the bill. It recognizes the efforts of the Russian Government to address the problem of assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program through the January 22, 1998, decree. By using that decree as the trigger date for behavior that is sanctioned, the bill reinforces that decree, both recognizing the action that the Russians took at our request and using the restrictions in that decree which are more comprehensive than those entailed by the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
Our Nation shares a common goal with Russia of trying to stop all assistance from Russian entities to Iran's missile program. Russia has taken some steps, but more steps and more cooperation are needed. I believe that if we acknowledge the efforts they have taken and encourage them to continue, we can avoid a counterproductive result. That result could make it harder for Russia to succeed in its efforts to stop such assistance. And our goal should be just that--to do what works, to do what leads to a better result. 
In all likelihood, if this legislation becomes law with my amendment, it will still require sanctions to be applied, because there is evidence that some Russian entities have provided assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program since January 22, 1998. 
Finally, I note that the bill before the Senate contains two Presidential waivers. They are there for important reasons. The more significant of the two waivers is a national security waiver which the President can use to waive the imposition of sanctions if doing so `is essential to the national security of the United States.' 
This legislation is not intended to force the President to impose a sanction if doing so would harm U.S. national security. If the President determines that it is necessary for him to waive the imposition of sanctions in the interest of national security, then under this bill he may do so. That is in the bill itself. That is not touched by my amendment. But that is why the waiver is included in the bill before us. 
Madam President, I believe that the sponsors of the bill have indicated support for my amendment. Senator Kyl is on the floor. I will let him speak for himself in that regard. 
I yield the floor. I appreciate their support.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Douglas C. Holbrook, who will be retiring from his position as Secretary-Treasurer of the American Postal Workers Union in November, 1998. Mr. Holbrook is being recognized for his service to the men and women of the American Postal Workers Union at their 14th Biennial National Convention, which will take place in my home town of Detroit, Michigan, from July 20-24, 1998. 
Douglas Holbrook was born and attended high school in Virginia, and moved to Michigan to study labor relations and administration at Wayne State University in Detroit. While in Detroit, Mr. Holbrook began his career with the U.S. Postal Service as a part-time clerk. His abilities were quickly recognized by his fellow employees, and he began his distinguished career in labor relations with the Detroit District Area Local. After serving as Trustee, Editor of the Detroit Postal Worker and Vice President, he was elected President of the District Local in 1966. Mr. Holbrook served in this position until being chosen to fill the unexpired term of his predecessor as Secretary-Treasurer of the American Postal Workers Union. 
The American Postal Workers Union is the largest union of postal workers in the world. Under the steady and determined leadership of Mr. Holbrook, APWU has truly been a powerful force for workers rights, fair pay and a safe workplace. I know that he will be missed by his colleagues and by postal workers from every corner of the country. 
Mr. President, I know my colleagues join me in expressing appreciation to Douglas Holbrook for his distinguished service to our nation's postal workers, and in wishing him well in his upcoming retirement.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the University of Michigan hockey team on their 1998 NCAA Championship--The Wolverines' second hockey title in three years. 
On Saturday, April 4th, the Michigan hockey team defeated Boston College (3-2) in overtime for the championship. This is a remarkable achievement for a team which lost nine senior players from last year's team, including the Hobey Baker trophy winner and 5 players who each scored 20 or more goals in the season. The 1997-98 Michigan team featured 10 freshmen, one of whom scored two goals in the final game, and another who scored the winning goal in overtime in the championship game. 
When the 1997-98 season started, it was expected to be a rebuilding year for the Wolverines. The young team faced a difficult season against some of the toughest teams in the nation. Instead, the Michigan team earned a 34-11-1 record, seizing every chance to display their athleticism, sportsmanship, teamwork, and perseverance. 
The University of Michigan ice hockey players have always been among the `leaders and best.' As the Wolverines celebrate this year's victory, they also commemorate the anniversary of their first NCAA title fifty years ago, when the tournament began. In the last 50 years, the Wolverines have brought nine championship titles back to Ann Arbor, making them the winningest team in NCAA men's ice hockey history. 
The `Victors' are indebted to the strong leadership they have from Head Coach Red Berenson and players, Captain Matt Herr and Assistant Captains Bill Muckalt and Marty Turco. These three seniors, along with Chris Fox and Gregg Malicke, advanced to the Final Four four seasons in a row. In addition, senior Bill Muckalt was named a Hobey Baker award candidate and All-American player, and senior goaltender Marty Turco finished his college career with one of the most impressive records in college hockey. The goalie's four years at Michigan gave him a record of 127 career victories and nine victories in NCAA elimination games, making him the winningest goaltender in NCAA tournament history. Turco was also selected most valuable player in the Final Four after stopping 28 shots in the championship game. 
I extend my best wishes to the University of Michigan Men's Ice Hockey Team on a tremendous season and the 1998 NCAA Championship--Go Blue!

As we all know, as Senator Thurmond has so eloquently reminded us, this is the last year that he will be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, through his choice. Therefore, it is the last year that he will be bringing an authorization bill to the floor. I just want to thank him and commend him for the commitment that he has made to our Nation's defense. It has been longstanding, it has been a matter of keen devotion. It is really a significant moment for me to be here with him as this defense authorization bill comes to the floor. I know I am thanking him on behalf of all of the members of our committee and the Senate for the energy he has placed into this issue of defense, security, and this bill itself.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is also the final defense authorization bill for three other members of our committee--Senators Glenn, Coats and Kempthorne. They will be leaving us this year, also through their choice. We will miss them keenly. They have all made tremendous contributions to the work of the Armed Services Committee and to the national security of our country. Sometimes their ways were similar and sometimes they were different, but we are grateful for their contributions. I wanted to note that as we get to work on the defense authorization bill. 
The bill that we bring to the floor this morning is the product of several months of hard work by the Armed Services Committee. It is a large and complicated bill that could not have been produced without the dedicated effort of our chairman, the other members of our committee and our staffs. I join Senator Thurmond in thanking our staffs for their work. 
While I don't agree with everything in this bill--none of us do or ever can in a bill this big and complicated--I think it will improve the quality of life for the men and women in uniform and for their families. It will continue the process of modernization of our Armed Forces to meet the threats of the future. 
Senator Thurmond has already summarized the provisions of the bill. I will just highlight a few provisions that will make a significant contribution to the national defense and to our men and women in uniform. 
The bill contains a 3.1 percent pay raise for military personnel and authorizes a number of bonuses to enhance our ability to recruit and retain quality men and women for our armed services. 
The bill would authorize three health care demonstration projects that would address concerns about gaps in the military health care system by requiring the Department of Defense to provide health care to retired military personnel and their families who are over 65 and Medicare-eligible. 
The bill contains a bipartisan Defense Commercial Pricing Management Improvement Act, which would require the Department to address management problems in sole-source buying practices. 
The bill would provide funding for the U.S.-Canada environmental clean-up agreement, and for a new $24 million initiative for the development of pollution prevention technology. 
Finally, the bill includes a series of other provisions that are designed to assist the Secretary of Defense in his effort to streamline our defense infrastructure and improve the Department's so-called `tooth-to-tail' ratio. These provisions would require reductions in DOD headquarters staff; extend current personnel authorities available to the Department to assist in downsizing; encourage public-private competition in the provision of support services; require improvements in the Department's inventory management and financial management systems; enable the Department to undertake needed reforms in travel management and the movement of household goods; and require the Department to streamline its test and evaluation infrastructure. 
Mr. President, the committee was presented with a dilemma on the Air Force's F-22 fighter program. Although there is broad support for achieving the revolutionary capability the F-22 program promises, a number of us remain concerned about the degree of overlap between development, testing, and production in the program. Four years ago, we expected that 27 percent of the flight testing hours would have been completed before the Air Force signed a contract for the first production aircraft. Last year, that number had fallen to 14 percent. This year, the committee was faced with the Air Force's plan of signing a production contract with only four percent of the flight testing completed. 
The bill would address this problem by making the long-lead funding for the six F-22 aircraft in FY 2000 contingent upon certifications by the Secretary of the Air Force that: (1) adequate flight testing has been conducted to address technical risk in the program; and (2) the financial benefits of going forward with the program exceed the financial risks. 
I am also pleased that the bill contains a provision to encourage and facilitate organ donation by service men and women. Organ donation represents, in my view, one of the most remarkable success stories in the history of medicine. Over the past several years, the Department of Defense has made some strides in increasing the awareness among service members of the importance of organ donation. With our encouragement, DOD has included organ donation decisions in their automated medical databases, and established policies that give service members regular opportunities to state a desire to become organ donors upon their deaths. 
In an effort to enhance the value of these initiatives, the bill provides the framework in which DOD will provide each new recruit and officer candidate information about organ donation during their initial weeks of training, and will include organ donation procedures in the training of medical personnel and in the development of medical equipment and logistical systems. This initiative is likely to have a vital impact on the survival of countless individuals who will, one day, benefit from organs donated by service men and women. 
From the beginning of the year, Secretary Cohen and the Joints Chiefs of Staff have stressed three things that they would like to achieve in this bill: 
First, they have requested authority to close excess military bases in order to fund their modernization priorities in the next decade; 
Second, they have urged us not to undermine military training and readiness by reducing operations and maintenance budgets; and 
Third, they have urged us to provide the necessary funding to support U.S. military operations in Bosnia during FY 1999 in a manner that does not cut into current levels of DOD funding. 
I would say that the committee has achieved roughly one and a half of these three goals. 
First, the bill before us would authorize $1.9 billion for continued U.S. military operations in Bosnia, in the manner requested by the Department. I am sure that many Members will want to be heard on this subject as we debate this bill. At the appropriate time I intend to offer my own amendment, which would ensure that the President reports to the Congress on progress toward achieving benchmarks toward implementation of the Dayton Accord with an exit strategy and that the Congress has an opportunity to vote on the continued presence of U.S. ground combat forces in Bosnia beyond June 30, 1999. 
Second, the Armed Services Committee did a reasonable job of funding training and readiness, given the budgetary constraints under which we were operating. Overall, the bill would reduce operations and maintenance funding by roughly $300 million, but these cuts would be achieved through reductions for fuel savings, foreign currency fluctuations, and civilian underexecution--which, if DOD's and CBO's predictions prove right, should not have a significant negative impact on military training and readiness. 
On the other hand, the Secretary has asked us not to cut operations and maintenance accounts at all, because any cuts to these accounts pose some risk of a negative impact on training and readiness. We have been hearing complaints for several years now that the Administration has not provided adequate funding for military training and readiness. If we are not able to increase the level of O&M funding in conference, the cuts in this bill mean that Congress must share responsibility with the Department of Defense for any training and readiness problems resulting from O&M funding shortfalls that DOD may experience in the next year. 
On the third point, I am deeply disappointed that the Armed Services Committee has again filed to authorize a new base closure round, as requested by the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Secretary's Report on Base Closures from Secretary Cohen contains almost 1,800 pages of backup material. It is responsive to those who said last year that we need a thorough analysis before we can reach a decision on the need for more base closures. 
The Report reaffirms that DOD still has more bases than it needs. From 1989 to 1997, DOD reduced total active duty military endstrength by 32 percent, a figure that will grow to 36 percent by 2003. Even after 4 base closure rounds, the reduction in DOD's base structure in the United States has been reduced only 21 percent. 
DOD's analysis concluded that DOD has about 23 percent excess capacity in its current base structure. For example, by 2003: 
The Army will have reduced the personnel at its classroom training commands by 43 percent, while classroom space will have been reduced by only 7 percent. 
The Air Force will have reduced the number of fighters and other small aircraft by 53 percent since 1989, while the base structure for those aircraft will be only 35 percent smaller. 
The Navy will have 33 percent more hangars for its aircraft than it requires. 
Secretary Cohen's report also documents the substantial savings that have been achieved from past base closure rounds. Between 1990 and 2001, DOD estimates that BRAC actions will produce a total of $13.5 billion in net savings. After 2001, when all of the BRAC actions must be completed, steady state savings will be $5.6 billion per year. 
Based on the savings from the first four BRAC rounds, every year we delay another base closure round, we deny the Defense Department, and the taxpayers, about $1.5 billion in annual savings that we can never recoup by studying to death the question of savings from previous rounds. In his report on base closures last month, Secretary Cohen stated: `More than any other initiative we can take today, BRAC will shape the quality and strength of the forces protecting America in the 21st century.' General Shelton told our committee: `I strongly support additional base closures. Without them we will not leave our successors the warfighting dominance of today's force.' 
Admiral Jay Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, stated:  
This is more than about budgeting. It's about protecting American interests, American citizens, American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. We owe them the best force we can achieve. Reducing excess infrastructure will help take us there and is clearly a military necessity. 
Mr. President, closing bases is a painful process. I know that as well as anyone. All three Air Force bases in my state have been closed, and we are still working to overcome the economic blow to those communities. We have heard a lot of complaints in the last year about inadequate funds for modernization or for readiness. I am sure that we will hear more such complaints in the next year. But we don't have much standing to be critical of DOD for underfunding important defense needs if we don't allow them to do what Secretary Cohen and the Chiefs have repeatedly said they need to do--close unneeded bases. 
There are several other issues in the bill that concern me. I am disappointed by the committee's cuts in the Department of Energy's stockpile stewardship program, which Secretary PenAE6a says will have a real and dramatic impact on our ability to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile and undermine confidence in our nuclear deterrent. I am disappointed by the cuts we have made in the chemical demilitarization program, which may make it impossible for the United States to comply with our obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. And I am disappointed that we have funded several weapons systems for which the Department of Defense says that it has no current need. I look forward to amendments that will improve the bill in these and other areas in the course of our debate. 
Mr. President, I know that there will be some vigorous debate on this bill, and I hope Senators will come to the floor and offer their amendments so that we can complete Senate action on the bill in a timely manner then go to conference with the House. 
I must leave here for perhaps a half hour to an hour. I note that Senator Cleland will be floor managing the bill for this side of the aisle. This is an important day for us. I know it is meaningful for him, but it is an important day for us and for this institution, and for this country to note that Senator Cleland, who is truly a hero for all of us, is now managing this bill. I can't think of anyone I would rather have do that, anyone in whom I have greater confidence to protect this Nation's interest, as he always has, than Senator Cleland. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the DoD authorization bill, as reported, includes a cut of some $550 million in classified intelligence programs. I serve on both the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committees. I am very aware of the tough choices that members of both committees have to make in discharging our respective responsibilities. However, I must say that the magnitude of this cut to intelligence programs disturbed me, as it did other members of the Committee. 
Based on these concerns, the Committee agreed during the markup of the Defense Authorization Bill to try to come to some compromise with the Intelligence Committee that would reduce the magnitude of this reduction. This amendment restores $275 million of the original reduction made by the Committee. I am glad that we have worked together to achieve this outcome. 
The bulk of the funds to increase the level of intelligence programs in this amendment comes from one particular program, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD program. The THAAD program is designed to meet a theater missile defense requirement. I have supported theater missile defense programs like THAAD because we have a clear requirement for theater missile defense systems. 
The THAAD program has had a number of testing failures, and two days ago, there was another unfortunate test failure in the program. Mr. President, this failure led the Committee to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to adjust the fiscal year 1999 funding for the THAAD system. While we do not know the full implications of this test failure, it is clear that it would now be premature for the THAAD program to move from the demonstration/validation phase of the program to engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) next year as proposed in the fiscal year 1999 budget. The Committee amendment to the bill implementing the agreement with the Intelligence Committee eliminates EMD funding for THAAD in fiscal year 1999, since it is unrealistic to expect THAAD to enter EMD during that period. 
I must point out that the Committee is proposing that the Senate make this adjustment without prejudice to the THAAD program. I believe that the Committee will need to follow this program as we proceed to conference with the House on this bill. If it turns out that we need to adjust this position to one that is better for the underlying THAAD program, I will work with Chairman Thurmond to do just that.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
The bill before us could lessen the security of this Nation, and that is the reason so many of us oppose it. Will the bill add to our security by committing us to deploy a system before it is even developed, threatening the abrogation of a treaty between ourselves and the Russians which have allowed significant reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in this world? 
In my judgment--more important, in the judgment of the uniform and civilian military leaders of this country--this bill does not contribute to our security. This bill risks a reduction in the security of this Nation. This bill could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this case, nuclear weapons which is the greatest threat that this Nation faces. It is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this case, nuclear weapons, which is the greatest threat that this Nation faces. And yet this bill, which purportedly is aimed at a defense against ballistic missiles, could, because it threatens a very significant treaty between us and the Russians which has allowed for significant 
reduction of nuclear weapons, increase the threat to this Nation from nuclear weapons proliferation. 
That is not me saying it, although I believe it; that is Secretary Cohen saying it, that is General Shelton saying it, that is the military leadership of this Nation saying it. 
I think we all believe in the security of this Nation with equal passion. I don't doubt that for 1 minute. I think everybody in this Chamber, everybody who serves in this Senate has an equal commitment to the security of this Nation. The issue here is how do we contribute to the security of this Nation? 
The answer comes, it seems to me, from General Shelton in a letter which he wrote to me on April 21. He is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as we all know. What he says is the following: 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the American Missile Protection Act of 1998 (S. 1873). I agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems poses a major threat to our forces, allies, and other friendly nations. U.S. missile systems play a critical role in our strategy to deter these threats, and the current National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program (3+3) is structured to provide a defense against them when required. 
The bill and the NMD program-- 
And he is referring to our current program-- are consistent on many points; however, the following differences make it difficult to support enactment. 
Then he goes through those differences, why it is that he does not support enactment of the bill before us; why it is that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not support enactment of this bill. 
One of the things that we hear from the proponents of this bill is that there is no policy on missile defense in this country. There is no policy to deploy a missile defense. We hear that over and over. Here is what General Shelton says, as his second reason for not being able to support this bill: 
Second, the bill asserts that the United States has no policy to deploy [a national missile defense] system. In fact, the [national missile defense] effort is currently a robust research and development program that provides the flexibility to deploy an initial capability within 3 years of a deployment decision. This prudent hedge ensures that the United States will be capable of meeting the need for missile defenses with the latest technology when a threat emerges. 
So his second reason for not supporting this bill is this bill says we don't have a policy to deploy a system. In fact, General Shelton writes, we have a current robust research and development program that gives us the flexibility to deploy a system at the right time. That is what is called a prudent hedge strategy. That is the 3+3 Program. That is the 3+3 policy which we adopted in the Senate 2 years ago. 
Section 233 of that bill says: 
It is the policy of the United States to--

Mr. LEVIN. The consequences of committing ourselves to deploy a system which almost certainly will violate that agreement are real-world consequences. They threaten our security. They will contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Is that me saying it? Yes. More importantly, is it Secretary Cohen saying it and General Shelton saying it? Yes. 
This is what General Shelton said in his final reason for not supporting this bill. The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs says: 
Finally, the bill does not consider affordability or the impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions. Both points are addressed [he says] in the [current national missile defense program] and should be included in any bill on [national missile defense]. 
Our highest military officer is telling us that the impact that a deployment will have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions should be included in any bill on national missile defense. 
Well, Mr. President, they are not included in this bill. And they should be. The security of this Nation requires that we at least consider the impact of deployment of a system on arms reduction, because if we commit to deploy a system, and that commitment destroys a treaty between us and the Russians, and leads to nonratification of START II and the reversal of START I and the nonnegotiation of START III--and that is the fear here that General Shalikashvili has expressed in a letter that he wrote when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--we have done severe damage to the security of this Nation. 
For what reason would we take that risk? In order to develop a system? No. We are developing that system right now. And we should. We are developing a national missile defense system. And we should. It is the commitment to deploy which risks the security of this Nation without consideration of the impact on arms reduction. 
That is the mistake that this bill makes. That is what General Shalikashvili pointed out in his letter to Senator Nunn in May of 1996 when he said: 
. . . efforts which suggest changes to or withdraw from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet Statement to the United States of 13 June 1991, could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned [General Shalikashvili said] that failure of either START initiative will result in Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons thereby increasing both the costs and risks we may face. 
We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased costs and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the ABM treaty. 
That is General Shalikashvili. Is this resolution consistent with the ABM Treaty? Probably not. It is very unlikely we could deploy a system consistent with the ABM Treaty which defends the entire continental United States. But there is an easy way to do it, if that is the intent of the resolution: Just put down `treaty compliant' system in the resolution. Just add those two words, `treaty compliant' system. Put the words `treaty compliant' before the word `deployment,' and that would solve that problem. 
Those words are missing, and they are not missing inadvertently. It is obvious that many supporters of this resolution do not care whether or not there would be a violation of the ABM Treaty because they believe that we should unanimously withdraw from that treaty. But such an action will lead to exactly the result which we should dread as much as anything, which is the increase in the number of nuclear weapons on the face of this Earth. 
Finally, Mr. President, on the ABM Treaty--how many minutes do I have left?

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 additional minutes. 
Mr. President, the ABM Treaty is not some abstract relic. It is a living commitment which has been reasserted at the highest levels at a summit in Helsinki in 1997. 
President Clinton and President Yeltsin issued the following joint statement. Now, this isn't some person writing an op-ed piece in some newspaper. These are the Presidents of two nations with the largest nuclear inventories in the world, President Clinton and President Yeltsin, expressing their commitment to strengthen the strategic stability and international security, emphasizing the importance of further reductions in strategic offensive arms, and recognizing the fundamental significance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty for these objectives, 
as well as the necessity for effective theater missile defense systems, considered their common task to preserve the ABM Treaty, prevent circumvention of it, and enhance its viability. 
Then later in that same statement, both Presidents state that the United States and Russia have recently devoted special attention to developing measures aimed at assuring confidence of the parties that their ballistic missile defense activities will not lead to circumvention of the ABM Treaty, to which the parties have repeatedly reaffirmed their adherence. 
This bill before the Senate, where there is a motion to proceed pending, surely will undermine the confidence of Russia that we are adhering to a treaty. Since the commitment which this bill makes to deploy missile defenses will almost certainly--almost certainly--violate that treaty--and again I emphasize, if that is not the intent and if that is to be precluded, then the words `treaty compliant' should be added. But I think, as we all know because we debated this issue so many times, that is not the intent of this resolution. 
Mr. President, I hope the words of our top military officers will be heeded and that the danger of this bill will be considered. Its intent, obviously, is to contribute to the security, but its effect is to lessen the security of this Nation. We simply cannot afford that risk.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is more of an `NMC' bill than an NMD. This is a `Never Mind the Consequence' bill. 
General Shelton, our top military leader in the uniform of this country, has said he cannot support this bill for a number of reasons. 
The question has been asked, `How can anybody oppose this bill?' A lot of people oppose this bill for a lot of reasons. But the people who support this bill ought to ask themselves, `How is it that our top military leadership oppose it?' And General Shelton, for many reasons, says he cannot support it. And one of the reasons is the one that Senator Conrad just read. And I want to repeat it. Any bill should `consider affordability [and] the impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions.' 
When you commit to deploy a system which will breach in almost dead certainty a treaty between us and the Russians, and cause them to quit cutting the number of nuclear weapons and to start increasing again, we are jeopardizing the security of this Nation and contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
That is one of the big problems of this bill. That is why our top military leadership do not support this bill.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator McCain and Senator Hollings proposed a managers' amendment, Amendment No. 2389 to S. 1618, a bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934. The amendment significantly improves the protections for consumers against `slammers,' persons who deliberately deceive consumers and change their long distance carrier without proper authorization. The manager's amendment included two of my amendments which were cosponsored by Senator Durbin and Senator Glenn. 
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing recently on slamming. At this hearing, we became aware of the fact that slammers intentionally used names like Phone Company and Long Distance Services to deliberately deceive customers on their phone bills. Usually local telephone companies or billing agents precede an itemized list of long distance calls by printing the name of the long distance service provider. When deceptive company names are used, customers are not aware that their long distance service provider has been changed. My intention was to remedy this situation by requiring the billing companies to specify the long distance provider using a statement like, `Your provider for the following long distance service is------------' . If that type of statement were made conspicuously and clearly stated on a consumer's phone bill before the itemized long distance charges, consumers would know if their long distance carrier had been changed. 
Section 231 of the manager's amendment, entitled Obligations of Telephone Billing Agents, has language that differs from my proposed amendment. The language in the Manager's amendment is language that was suggested by the staff at the Federal Communications Commission. 
I chose not to use the FCC language because my staff contacted several telephone companies and learned that if we used the FCC language several problems could be created which may result in potential increased costs to consumers. GAO has advised my staff that some of the requirments in the provision as passed simply can't be done. 
Because of time constraints we were unable to resolve the language in the provision. It is not our intention to increase consumers costs for telephone services in order to alert them about `slammers.' If the current bill increases costs, and we believe it could, we need to modify this section so consumers are protected without having to pay for that protection. I sincerely hope we can continue to work to improve this section in the conference committee, if there is one, or before the bill is enacted into law, to make sure that we are not creating a burden on telecommunications carriers which will be passed on to consumers.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the conference report to accompany S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. This legislation contains very important provisions that will help improve the delivery of safe, healthy, and value-added agricultural products to the American and world marketplace, and keep rural America strong. 
The conference report contains a provision very similar to one in S. 1597, a measure I introduced as a companion to a bill introduced in the House by Congresswoman Stabenow. This provision directs the Department of Agriculture to assemble FEMA-like Crisis Management Teams to respond to emergencies, like threats to human health from food-borne pathogens. And, USDA must work with other agencies to ensure coordinated information and actions in the event of such a crisis. This is a very important and non-regulatory way for the Federal government to identify, correct, and prevent future food supply contamination.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the mangers' amendment included two amendments to S. 1618 which I authored and which I appreciate the managers of the bill accepting. I am joined in offering these amendments by cosponsors Senator Glenn and Senator Durbin. 
These amendments are the product of hearings held on slamming in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), chaired by Senator Collins. Slamming, the practice of changing a consumer's long distance carrier without the consumer's knowledge and express consent, is the number one complaint received by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). And those FCC slamming complaints are on the rise--increasing almost 50% from 1995 through 1997. Slamming is also the number one complaint received by the Michigan Public Service Commission. And, Michigan has the unfortunate distinction of being in the top ten states, nationwide, for the number of consumers who have been slammed. A Louis Harris survey taken in September 1997 ranked Detroit and Grand Rapids among the hardest hit cities in the country. About 25% of telephone customers in Detroit and Grand Rapids have either had their telephone carrier switched without their permission or know someone who was illegally switched. 
Slamming leaves consumers feeling vulnerable and angry. Consumers have the right to use any long distance carrier they choose and to change carriers whenever they wish. But they want to be in control. Slamming takes choices away from consumers without their knowledge, and rewards companies that engage in deceptive and misleading marketing practices. 
Slammers use deceptive marketing practices such as getting subscribers to sign a misleading authorization form, falsifying tape recordings to make it appear that the consumer has verbally agreed to the change, or posing as the subscriber's currently authorized carrier. Unscrupulous carriers have been known to forge letters of authorization or even pull subscribers' numbers from a telephone book and submit them to the local exchange carrier for a long distance carrier change. Unscrupulous resellers generally bill higher rates once the subscriber is switched. 
In one case in Michigan, the slammer used the device of a contest--the opportunity to win a trip or a car--to get consumers to sign a card that would then be used to change the long distance service. The Michigan consumer who filed a complaint with the Michigan Attorney General reported that her 14 year old daughter was approached several times in a shopping mall to sign the card under the auspices of participating in the contest. The daughter kept trying to resist--telling the slammer that she was underage for the contest. The slammer finally prevailed, and the 14 year old daughter entered what she thought to be a contest or drawing. However, a week or so later, this constituent was notified that her long distance carrier had been changed--unbeknownst to her. She wrote in her letter to the Attorney General: `I am very upset that this is happening not only to me but to others as well. It's a scam and it needs to stop now!' 
Although the large telecommunications companies, called facilities based carriers because they own extensive telephone lines and equipment, have engaged in slamming, according to a recent GAO report, most intentional slamming is perpetrated by switchless resellers. Switchless resellers have no equipment; they purchase network facilities from large long distance companies at a bulk rate and resell the service either to consumers or to other resellers. Currently a switchless reseller can enter into the telecommunications business without any proof of financial capability. All a person has to do is strike a deal with a long distance carrier to use that carrier's lines and facilities, get a billing company to provide billing services and develop a customer base. The switchless reseller is then in business and can use unscrupulous practices to switch the long distance providers of innocent consumers from the carrier the consumer has been using to the switchless reseller. The reseller then charges higher long distance rates. 
Many switchless resellers operate legitimately; but there are a surprising number who don't. Currently there is nothing in the law that screens out the scam artists from the legitimate resellers. S. 1618 increases civil penalties, creates new criminal penalties and includes disincentives to eliminate the profit for slammers. I am supportive of those provisions and ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor. 
But, Mr. President, we also need to try to keep the scam artists out of the system--to keep consumers from being slammed in the first place. My amendment would require switchless resellers--those resellers who have no switching facilities under their ownership or control--to post a bond with the FCC before they can engage in the business of selling long distance service. The bond would be in an amount set by the FCC, and the amendment would prohibit a billing agent of a switchless reseller from billing subscribers of long distances services on behalf of the switchless reseller unless the billing agent has confirmed that the reseller has furnished the bond. In this way, a switchless reseller cannot get someone to bill on its behalf unless it has posted a bond with the FCC. The proceeds of that bond can be used to pay for any damages to a consumer awarded by the Commission to reimburse the consumer for excess charges incurred as a result of slamming. The requirement for a bond should keep the unscrupulous resellers out of the business. Take for example, David Fletcher, possibly the most notorious slammer. He started his slamming business, apparently, with no resources and managed to bill up to $20 million in long distance services. He couldn't start his business and no billing agent or phone company could have contracted with him to do his billing unless he had posted a bond with the FCC, under my amendment. 
The other amendment which the Managers have incorporated in their substitute requires full disclosure of the long distance services and providers on the local phone bill. We learned, Mr. President, in the hearing on slamming that some switchless resellers go to great lengths to disguise the fact that they have taken over a consumer's long distance service. One reseller, for example, incorporated under the name `Phone Calls.' Another used the name, `Long Distance Services.' Those names, then, appeared on the consumers' phone bills, and no one would have paid attention to those names. Anyone looking at such a phone bill would have assumed those were not the names of the unexpectedly new long distance carriers, but the identification of the item being listed below --the phone calls. The consumer would continue to assume that his or her long distance carrier had not been switched. 
To make it perfectly clear to consumers who their long distance provider is, the provision requires that the local telephone bill explicitly state the name, address and toll-free number of the long distance telephone provider and the specific services provided. This hopefully will address the problem of hidden or disguised switching--where a consumer gets a bill and can't tell that his or her long distance carrier has been switched. This provision gives the FCC the authority to make telephone bills absolutely clear so slammers can't hide behind vague or confusing phone bills. 
Mr. President, I want to commend Senator McCain and Senator Hollings for their good work in getting this important piece of consumer legislation to the floor so quickly. I also want to commend Senator Collins and Senator Durbin from the PSI subcommittee for their energy and commitment to publicizing and helping to solve this problem.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the legislation being discussed this afternoon would undermine a carefully designed program called the National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program, which is currently in place. That is why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense do not support this bill and why they favor their current program that is in place. 
This bill would commit us to deploy a national defense system before development is completed, without considering the critical factors that should inform a deployment decision. 
There are a number of critical factors. What is the impact on arms reduction of such a commitment to deploy a system that could violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty? There is nothing in the language of this bill that says it will be treaty compliant. Nothing in this bill says that the national missile defense system that it commits us to deploy will be compliant with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
That is a treaty, a solemn agreement between us and Russia. If we threaten to break out of that treaty unilaterally, we threaten the security of this Nation because that treaty permits Russia to ratify the START II agreement and to negotiate a START III agreement, reducing the number of warheads that they have on their missiles and warheads that could also potentially proliferate around the world and threaten any number of places, including us. This is not just a cost debate; it is a debate about committing ourselves to deploying a system not yet developed, and without knowing the cost of that system. 
It is not just a debate over whether we ought to commit ourselves to a system of unknown cost, without consideration of other threats to this country from weapons of mass destruction and of the likelihood of those threats actually happening. All those factors should be taken into consideration. 
This bill would commit us to deploy a system which could undermine, weaken, lessen, the security of this Nation. And that is why this bill does not have the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is why this bill does not have the support of the Department of Defense. Yes; it commits us to deploy a system before we know the cost of the system, without even knowing what the cost is and without comparing the cost of this system to the cost of deploying other systems which could defend against or address different threats of delivery of weapons of mass destruction, like ships or trucks. 
This bill would simply commit us now to deploy. As far as I know, we have never in the history of this Congress ever committed ourselves to deploy a weapon system before it was developed. But this bill does that. It would be a mistake to do so without consideration of those factors--cost, threats, and relative threats. But the biggest mistake that this bill makes is to commit us to deploy a system which could weaken and reduce the security of this Nation. 
All of us want to defend this country. The good Senator from Mississippi wants to defend this country. He is a good friend of mine, and I know he does. I know that is 100 percent his motivation. And I hope and believe that he knows that is my motivation as well. 
The question, though, is whether or not we are helping the security of this Nation or reducing the security of this Nation. If we commit ourselves to deploy a system which, in all likelihood, would violate a treaty between ourselves and Russia it would not help our security; it would reduce our security. By the way, if that is not an intent, it is very easy to amend this bill to say it would be a treaty-compliant deployment. But that language is not in this bill. To threaten to break a treaty which is key to the security of this Nation is a terrible mistake. 
I just want to repeat what that threat is. Russia has signed the START I agreement and has significantly reduced the number of warheads. It is very clear that if we break out of this ABM Treaty unilaterally, and if they face ABM defenses here, they will not continue with the START I reductions, ratification of START II, and negotiation of START III. 
The ABM Treaty has been discussed between our President and the Russian President. It has been discussed at the highest levels of government at a summit meeting. They have issued statements following those summits. Most recently at the Helsinki Summit, March 21, 1997, President Clinton and President Yeltsin issued the following joint statement:  
President Clinton and President Yeltsin, expressing their commitment to strengthen strategic stability and international security, emphasizing the importance of further reductions in strategic offensive arms, and recognizing the fundamental significance of the antiballistic missile treaty, for these objectives, as well as the necessity for effective theater missile defense, consider it their common task to preserve the ABM Treaty, prevent circumvention of it, and enhance its viability. 
That is the highest level that we can reach here, at least in our Government. You can't go higher than having the President of the United States and the President of Russia issuing a joint statement, which they just did in March of 1997, that recognizes the fundamental significance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty for the objective of further reductions in strategic offensive arms. That is about as serious a statement as you can get. 
I think we all want those reductions. I don't know of anybody in this body who does not want to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons that exist in this world. But for us to threaten 
to deploy a system which would, in all likelihood, violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and would then jeopardize the reduction in nuclear weapons, which we all hope for so fervently, could undermine and weaken the security of this Nation. That is why this bill does not have the support of our uniformed military. 
So this isn't a question of whether you are for the security of the United States or not. We are all for the security of United States. This is a question of how best to achieve the security of the United States. By committing ourselves to deploy a system which will lead to more weapons remaining on this Earth's surface and thus contributing to the proliferation of those weapons, by the mere fact that we would be jeopardizing reductions in the number of weapons, is not a way to contribute to the security of this Nation. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has written us a letter. I hope every Member of this body will take some time to read this letter--it is dated April 21, 1998--in which he compares the bill that we are discussing now, S. 1873, to the current program, the so-called National Defense Deployment Readiness Program. Under the current program, we are going to develop the capability to have a missile defense against intercontinental ballistic missiles. We are going to do it as fast as we can. 
But what I think is particularly notable about the defense authorization bill--which will hopefully be on the floor later this week--is that I don't think there is a member of our committee, whichever side of this issue that they are on, who voted additional money for national missile defense. The budget for national missile defense has a significant amount of money in it, some $950 million dollars. And if we are not doing anything, as my good friend from Mississippi said, if we are just sitting around on our hands, or twiddling our thumbs while our security is jeopardized, and if we are not developing a national missile defense system as quickly as we should because we have not made the commitment to deploy, then you would think somebody on the Armed Services Committee, 10 of whom voted for the bill before us, would have voted to add money to develop that system, or proposed it at least. 
But while the Armed Services Committee is deeply divided on the question of this bill--10 people voting yes and 7 people voting no, if my recollection is correct--nobody proposed that we add money to the national missile defense to develop a system which is referred to in this bill, presumably, because I think everybody on the committee thought we had adequate funding in our authorization. I do not want to be presuming here. We have to find out whether that is true. Perhaps when the bill comes to the floor, somebody will move to add additional funds. 
But I caution people, you can only move at a certain speed without jeopardizing the program. You don't want to do certain things before you have adequately tested what you have already done. General Larry Welch, the retired Air Force Chief of Staff who studied this issue for the Department of Defense, has cautioned us that we should not put more money, should not force more money, into a program and push for a faster deployment without adequately testing what we are doing and providing sufficient time for such testing. 
But, nonetheless, we will find out on the floor whether there are people who think we can usefully add more money to the development of a national missile defense, and, if so, I presume there would be an amendment. But that is not this bill. This bill doesn't add any money to a national missile defense system. This bill commits us to deploy the system before it is developed, without consideration of the impact on nuclear arms reductions and without consideration of the cost of the system, since we have not developed it. It also commits us without comparing the relative cost of deploying this system against the long-range missile threats there are at the time of the decision against the cost of deploying defenses against whatever other threats are coming from different directions in the area of weapons of mass destruction. 
So we have these two approaches. One is the current approach to a national missile defense system, supported by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which puts a significant amount of money into development and which then declares that when the system is developed, that we will make a decision whether or not to deploy. That decision will be made after we have adequately developed and tested a system. 
That decision will be based on a number of facts, including the threats, the cost, the cost-effectiveness, the operational effectiveness and, very critically, what arms reductions could be jeopardized by a unilateral deployment of whatever system is developed. 
Now, the letter from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to me compares the two bills, as I started to say, and it says that `the bill and the program that we currently have are consistent on many points. However, the following differences make it difficult to support enactment.' 
Now, these are the reasons why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shelton, in his letter to me, says it is difficult to support enactment. 
First, he says:  
The bill would establish a policy to deploy as soon as technology allows. The NMD program, on the other hand, requires an emerging ballistic missile threat as well as achievement of a technological capability for an effective defense before deployment of missile defenses. 
Secondly, as to why General Shelton says it is difficult to support enactment of this bill, he points out that: 
The bill asserts that the United States has no policy to deploy an NMD system. In fact, the NMD effort is currently a robust research and development program that provides the flexibility to deploy an initial capability within 3 years of a deployment decision. This prudent hedge ensures that the United States will be capable of meeting the need for missile defenses with the latest technology when a threat emerges. 
Third, General Shelton says: 
I disagree with the bill's contention that the United States ability to anticipate future ballistic missile threats is questionable. It is possible, of course, that there could be surprises, particularly were a rogue state to receive outside assistance. However, given the substantial intelligence resources being devoted to this issue, I am confident that we will have the 3 years' warning on which our strategy is based. 
The fourth point in his letter he has subsequently modified, I understand, so I won't quote that point. I believe he sent a subsequent letter to Senator Cochran advising that it no longer is relevant or that the point is now moot, I believe, agreeing with Senator Cochran on that point. 
But the fifth point he makes as to why he says that `it is difficult to support enactment,' as he phrases it, is that `the bill does not consider affordability or the impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions. Both points are addressed in the NMD Deployment Readiness Program and should be included in any bill on NMD.' 
Now, those are his reasons. We have a letter from the Secretary of Defense, as well, saying that he does not support this bill, and describing the current system, which is basically the hedge strategy that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs described in his letter. 
General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote us in May of 1996 the following: 
In this regard, efforts which suggest changes to or withdrawal from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet statement of 13 June 1991, could prompt Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure of either START initiative will result in Russian retention of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons, thereby increasing both the costs and the risks that we face. 
Now, that is the issue which we must decide here. Do we want to commit ourselves to the deployment of a system not yet developed, the costs of which are not known, the risks of which are many including--and these are the words of General Shalikashvili--that we could face additional thousands of nuclear weapons `thereby increasing both the costs and the risks that we face.' 
Might we want to deploy a system? The answer is yes. 
Weighing all of the factors which General Shalikashvili and General Shelton tell us should be considered, might we want to deploy a system after it is developed? The answer is yes. That is why we are developing it--to put ourselves in a position where we could deploy--could deploy--a national missile defense system. 
Do we want to commit to deploying it before development is completed, without consideration of the impact on arms reductions, without consideration of what the threat is at the time that the deployment decision should be made, without the consideration of those factors? We should not. 
Much more important than my saying that is what General Shelton said and what General Shalikashvili said and what the Secretary of Defense said. Do we all want to increase the security of this Nation? We do. Will a commitment to deploy a system which could lead us to face additional thousands of nuclear weapons contribute to the security of this Nation? I doubt it. Could there be a circumstance under which we might want to deploy, despite the ABM Treaty? There could be. Does that circumstance exist now? It does not. 
Should we seek to negotiate with the Russians a shift from focusing on offensive weapons to including defenses? We should. Should this be a mutual discussion? Should this be a mutual activity? Surely, it should be. Can we unilaterally now commit ourselves to deploy a system which in all likelihood would violate a keystone treaty between ourselves and the Russians? Should we commit ourselves to do that now? No. Because by doing so we will weaken us, not strengthen us. 
Are we doing nothing? No. We are spending billions to develop a system to permit us to decide to deploy it, should we need to. So this is not a matter of should we do something or should we do nothing. We are pursuing a hedge strategy with our current NMD program, as General Shelton described. The hedge is that we are developing a system as fast as it makes sense to develop. And again, if we should develop it faster and if we can, then I am assuming that we would face an amendment on the defense authorization bill that would seek to add more funds for that purpose. But we are developing a system as fast as is prudent. General Welch suggests that we may even be developing it faster than is prudent, thereby jeopardizing the effectiveness of the system we develop. 
But nonetheless, should we develop it as quickly as prudent? Yes. Are we? Yes. Should we prejudge the deployment decision and make a determination which, as far as I know, has never been made in the history of Congress to deploy a system before it is developed? We should not. And General Shelton and General Shalikashvili, our senior uniformed military, and our civilian defense leaders, are urging that we stay with the current system, which is that hedge strategy of developing so that we could deploy should all those factors point in that direction after the development is completed.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the paragraph to Senator Nunn reads as follows. 
We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased costs and risks. 
And here he is talking about the risk he cited earlier in this letter of thousands of more nuclear weapons being retained by Russia should we unilaterally develop or deploy defenses in violation of the ABM Treaty. General Shalikashvili says: 
We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased costs and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the ABM Treaty. The current National Missile Deployment Readiness Program, which is consistent with the ABM Treaty, will help provide stability in our strategic relationship with Russia as well as reducing future risks from rogue countries. 
Those are the risks we are all concerned about, risks from rogue countries being particularly of concerns--missile risks, yes, but other risks of delivery of weapons of mass destruction also. 
I think that is the greatest threat, those weapons of mass destruction and the delivery by various means, everything from suitcases to ships to truck bombs, perhaps to missiles. Those are the greatest risks that this Nation faces as we enter the next century. But we are not reducing those risks; we are probably increasing those risks, if Russia, seeing us commit to deploy a system unilaterally which could violate the ABM Treaty, then decides, as General Shalikashvili suggests they would, that they can no longer comply with START I, cannot ratify START II, or negotiate further reductions in START III. 
So, I hope that this bill will not be adopted. It was a vote of 10 to 7 in the Armed Services Committee which approved reporting this bill to the Senate. I assume it would be a very heavily debated bill, should it come before the Senate. But in the meantime, I oppose this bill.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will just read one paragraph from this, and then I want to ask my good friend from Mississippi a question. The paragraph reads: 
The national Missile Defense Program is structured to develop and test system elements the United States could deploy if intelligence indicated that a new strategic threat was emerging. The United States is not making a decision to deploy a national missile defense at this time. Deploying before the threat emerges would preclude deploying the most advanced technology if and when the threat does emerge. If a threat does not emerge, the NMD program will continue to improve the performance of the system by advancing the technology of each element and adding new elements as necessary, while maintaining the capability to deploy a system in a short period of time. 
There is also a discussion in the previous paragraph, which is now incorporated in the Record, as to why, relative to the North Korean Taepo Dong 2, and the `likelihood of its being operational by 2005 being very low.' 
Now, my question of my friend is this. He made reference to the fact that the motion is being withdrawn. I want to be sure I understand; I assume he means that the motion is being set aside at this time--is that correct?--and that the scheduled vote on Wednesday is what is contemplated.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I think the effect of this amendment will be to make it impossible for an employee representative to sit on the board. The Commission should have that representation, according to the recommendation of the Commission that is recommending this Commission. If we want an employee representative to sit on this board, as a practical matter there is no way to do it without exempting that person from these laws. There is an inherent conflict which that person will have. And we might as well be very open about it, and face it, and say, `Yes, providing it is disclosed.' And it is known that the benefits of having that perspective on the board outweighs any precedent that would be set by this kind of a waiver. 
The IRS Oversight Board itself is unprecedented. I don't know of a board quite like this that we have in the Government. 
So to suggest that as we are creating a new board like this that we cannot, with our eyes open, make an exemption from our conflict of interest laws in order to permit a very critical person to serve on the board it seems to me is unduly restricting our options and, more importantly, is making this board less useful. This oversight board will be more useful with an employee representative on it. There is a certain perspective, an important experience, which that person can bring to this board. 
So we have to weigh the value, the benefit, of that against the precedent we would be setting. It is like a cost-benefit analysis which we recommend that others do. We have to look at the precedent and the value, and we are the policymakers. 
I have great respect for the Office of Government Ethics. They enforce and implement the law. But we make policy. When we decide, with an unprecedented new board, that we will permit a representative of the employees to sit there because we want that experience, we want that perspective, we then are making a policy judgment that we want an effective IRS oversight board and that the effectiveness of that board is to rein in the IRS to overcome the abuses which have disgusted us which we have all heard about for so many years which outweighs any precedent we might be setting. 
I oppose the amendment and hope we will defeat it.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend of mine and of the working men and women of Michigan, Bob Lent. Bob is retiring at the end of June, 1998, from his position as Director of UAW Region 1. 
Bob Lent has been a UAW member for nearly 50 years, when he began working in 1949 at the Dodge Main plant in Hamtramck, Michigan. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953, Bob went to work as a millwright apprentice and skilled tradesman at the Chrysler 9 Mile Road Press Plant. It was here, as a member of UAW Local 869, that he began his rise into the leadership of the UAW. He served in a number of leadership positions in Local 869, including alternative chief steward, trustee chairman, vice president and president. From here he was appointed to the Region 1B staff, where he rose to the position of assistant director in 1982. In 1983, Bob was elected Regional Director at the UAW's 27th Constitutional Convention in Dallas, Texas. 
Bob is something of a legend in labor circles for his commitment to the working men and women of Region 1. But he is almost equally well-known for his remarkable ability to remember the most minute details of events that happened years before. Of course, in his line of work, a memory like that can be an incredible asset to bring to the bargaining table. But it can also be the source of amusement, and occasionally embarrassment, when Bob relates who said what to whom at a dinner which took place ten or fifteen years ago. 
Knowing Bob as I do, I have no doubt that retirement will not slow him down, and that he will continue to serve his community in a number of ways. I am sure that his wife, Earline, will keep him at least as busy as his commitments to the United Way of Pontiac-Oakland County, the Detroit-area United Foundation, the NAACP and the Wayne State University Labor Advisory Committee. And I also know that the men and women of the UAW can count on Bob to continue to stand with them in their ongoing efforts on behalf of the working people of our nation. 
Mr. President, I know my colleagues join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to Bob Lent, Director of UAW Region 1, on the occasion of his retirement.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride and pleasure that I rise today to call my colleagues attention to Jewish Heritage Week, which is being recognized this year from April 26 through May 2. 
Each spring since 1976, during the season in which Jewish people commemorate Passover, Yom Hashoah (Holocaust Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel independence Day), a week is set aside to celebrate the significant contributions Jewish people have made to American history and culture. This year is of special significance to Jews in the United States and throughout the world as the State of Israel celebrates its 50th anniversary on April 30. 
On the day following the establishment of the State of Israel, Prime Minister Ben-Gurion reminded the people of Israel what had been accomplished. He said, `whatever we have achieved is the result of the efforts of earlier generations no less than those of our own. It is also the result of an unwavering fidelity to our precious heritage, the heritage of a small nation that has suffered much, but at the same time has won for itself a special place in the history of mankind because of its spirit, faith, and vision.' Today, American Jews maintain the same rich heritage of which Prime Minister Ben-Gurion spoke. And just as our brothers and sisters in Israel, we owe much to our forebears who paved the way in the United States. 
Mr. President, the contributions of Jewish Americans to the life of our nation are undeniable. Virtually every area of American culture has benefitted from the talents of Jewish people, including science, medicine, business, government, literature and the arts. I know my colleagues join me and the millions of others who mark this special week to pay tribute to the countless people of Jewish faith who have contributed so much to the definition of our nation and the world.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, like the Phoenix, the nation of Israel rose out of the ashes of the Holocaust 50 years ago and the 2000 year search for a Jewish homeland ended. But, the birth of Israel was far from easy on that day. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion made his first radio broadcast from an air raid shelter as the precarious new nation came under immediate attack. 
Israel's founding father took the time to remind the first citizens of Israel what had been accomplished and what it would take to defend their dream. Ben-Gurion said, `whatever we have achieved is the result of the efforts of earlier generations no less than our own. It is also the result of an unwavering fidelity to our precious heritage, the heritage of a small nation that has suffered much, but at the same time has won for itself a special place in the history of mankind because of its spirit, faith, and vision.' 
In January of this year, I went to Israel for an international conference of Jewish legislators from around the world. In our discussions of the faith that we shared and Israel's 50th anniversary, I saw and heard the achievements of the `spirit, faith and vision' of which David Ben-Gurion spoke. That same ethos that was also embraced by such visionary leaders as Moshe Dyan, Golda Meir, Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin has helped Israel become a dynamic democracy with a thriving economy. I came away from the conference secure in the knowledge that Israel's faith and fortitude remain as strong today as they were when the dream was realized five decades ago. 
I believe it is also important to acknowledge the role the United States has played in the development of Israel over the past 50 years. President Harry S. Truman, the first head of state to grant Israel diplomatic recognition, expressed its special place in the hearts of Americans as he declared, `I had faith in Israel before it was established, I have faith in it now. I believe it has a glorious future before it-not just another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.' 
This special partnership which began with Israel's creation has been repeatedly tested since 1948. The United States has been unwavering in our commitment to helping the people of Israel develop their own economy and secure their own peace. We have helped give them the time that their founding fathers knew would work in their favor. Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I was delighted to be a cosponsor of House Joint Resolution 102, which the Senate unanimously passed last night. The resolution acknowledges the 50th Anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel and reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel. This is a fitting tribute to the history of Israel and I am proud that today we can celebrate this special, half century milestone together.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. It would throw real doubt and uncertainty into the NATO ratification process by linking the completion of that process to a subsequent action of Congress, specifically authorizing continued deployment of our forces in Bosnia. It is that doubt, that uncertainty, that complication, that ambiguity, creating an additional step before the ratification process is completed, that this amendment would create. 
We simply should not do that, no matter how we feel on the Bosnia issue. I must tell my good friend from Idaho that I have been one who has been very cautious about our continuing to be in Bosnia. I have indeed offered and have had amendments accepted on this floor reflecting that caution. We can stop, should we choose, our presence in Bosnia at any time we want through the power of the purse. We are not lacking in tools to control our participation in the NATO operation in Bosnia. We have those tools. We have used those tools. We may not have used them to the extent that my good friend or I would have liked, but we have used them. We used them in the authorization bill last year. We used them in the appropriations bill last year. We have a supplemental appropriation right now that we have recently passed for our troops in Bosnia. People who opposed that continuance or wanted to attach additional conditions to that continuation could have attached those conditions, or sought to attach those conditions, in the supplemental appropriations bill. I offered an amendment that was accepted on the supplemental appropriation bill, which required certain milestones that we say are our goals for Bosnia, 
requiring that those milestones be presented to NATO so that we could have NATO consideration of milestones which would lead us to exit Bosnia which would allow us to remove our combat forces from Bosnia. We have the tools. 
I understand linking things where it is necessary in order to gain for us a power we might not have otherwise. I could understand that. But where we have the power of the purse and could exercise that power to control the presence of combat forces in Bosnia, it seems to me that we are creating a needless ambiguity, a needless uncertainty, that we are throwing a monkey wrench into the ratification process by creating a subsequent step after the Senate votes on ratification. It is creating that doubt. It is the uncertainty. If we voted to ratify now, the instruments of ratification will not be deposited until the Congress takes an additional step. Again, if that were the only way of obtaining a power, then it would seem to me that there might be some argument for it despite the confusion. But where we have the power of the purse, we know how to exercise it. We have exercised it relative to Bosnia, not only in the supplemental but in the prior authorization and appropriations bills of defense. One other element is that another defense authorization will be coming to the floor hopefully in the next few weeks. We have another opportunity to exercise the power of the purse within the next month relative to our forces in Bosnia. 
So this is not only confusing and I think harmful in that regard, introducing really a monkey wrench into a process where we already have plenty of tools to exercise our will, it is needlessly being done. The power of the purse is one of the most important powers this Congress has, and this Congress has, when it has chosen, exercised that power. We can exercise it again. 
Just one final comment about this. In the supplemental appropriations bill, the amendment which I offered required that the President take to NATO the so-called benchmarks that were detailed in the President's presentation to the Congress. Last year we told the President in our appropriations bill that we want an exit strategy; we want to phase out American presence in Bosnia; we want to put more responsibility on the Europeans. By the way, I share those sentiments. I think the Europeans should take more responsibility and should take over that operation much more fully, and we should find a way to exit promptly in a reasonable period of time, removing our combat forces and instead supporting the operations with logistics and intelligence and certain other support. But that we should try to find a path for the removal of our combat forces from Bosnia. We have stretched our forces too many places around the world. 
My amendment on the supplemental bill, which is presently in conference, tells the President to enter into an agreement with NATO on the benchmarks which he detailed in the exit strategy and which he presented to us as required by the authorization and appropriations. 
I hope this amendment will be defeated because of the confusion that it would create relative to ratification, the uncertainty that it would create, the additional step, the roadblock that would be placed in the way of this process being completed and mainly, though, because it does all that, it does that damage unnecessarily. We have the power of the purse. We will have the opportunity to exercise that again within the next month relative to Bosnia should this body choose to do so. 
For those reasons, I hope my friend's amendment is defeated and that we ratify this treaty, or not, but that we not say with our right hand we are going to ratify it and then with the left hand say but that process cannot be completed until Congress takes an additional step relative to Bosnia. 
Mr. President, how much time is left to the opponents of this amendment?

Mr. LEVIN. The floor manager is not here. I would like to begin, and yield myself on the general issue of NATO, 5 minutes. I want to consult for one moment before I do that. 
Mr. President, unless my friend from Idaho wants to give himself time at this point, I yield myself an additional 5 minutes on the underlying NATO ratification. 
Mr. President, I want to speak today about three aspects of NATO enlargement. First, I want to focus on the stabilizing effect that NATO has had and that an enlarged NATO will continue to have on Europe; second I want to discuss the impact that NATO enlargement would have on Russia; and finally, I want to examine the common values that lie at the heart of the question before us. 
It will come as no surprise, based upon my floor speech on NATO enlargement that I gave on March 19, that I favor NATO enlargement. I am satisfied that it will help to enhance stability on the European continent, that it will not isolate Russia, and that the common values that undergird the Alliance are treasured in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Warner amendment that would mandate a pause of three years before the United States would encourage, participate in, or agree to any further enlargement of NATO after the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
At the outset, I would note that I am unaware of any rationale for choosing three years for a pause--it appears to be an arbitrary number and I think it is inappropriate to legislate on such an important matter on an arbitrary basis. 
Article 10 of the NATO Treaty states in pertinent part that `The Parties may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to accede to this Treaty.' NATO's door has been open since the establishment of the Alliance and has resulted in the admission of Greece, Turkey, Germany and Spain over the years. To mandate a three-year pause would be inconsistent with the policy that has guided the Alliance since 1949. 
Mr. President, the desire to join the Alliance has been a productive force for candidate nations who have been seeking to establish their credentials for admission by perfecting their laws relating to democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law, and the establishment of market economies and by reaching accommodations with their neighbors. We should not do anything to discourage these developments. 
But also importantly, I am concerned that a three-year pause would imply too much--that after three years, the Senate would support more nations joining NATO. Mandating a pause is no more logical than raising expectations as to when the next round of NATO accessions will occur. Further enlargement of the Alliance should be judged by the circumstances that exist at the time. I am not committed to further enlargement of the NATO Alliance after three years and I doubt that most of our colleagues are so committed. I fear that, by passage of this amendment, we would send a false signal to those nations that continue to aspire to NATO membership. 
Mr. President, as noted in Foreign Relations Committee Report on NATO enlargement, Secretary of State Albright has committed the Executive Branch to keep the Senate fully informed of significant developments with regard to possible future rounds of NATO enlargement and seek its advice on important decisions before any commitments are made. More recently, in a letter to Senator John Kerry that was released by the Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on NATO enlargement, President Clinton wrote in part that `I pledge to undertake the same broad pattern of consultation before making any future decisions about invitations of membership to other states, or making membership commitments.' 
Mr. President, those commitments and the Constitutional requirement for Senate advice and consent to any future amendments to the NATO Treaty that enlarge the Alliance are all that is necessary. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Warner amendment as both arbitrary and misleading.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the treaty before us not only promotes stability of Europe but also adds a measure of security to the United States. It also promotes universal values for freedom and democracy. 
The amendment before us simply broadens the language of a study that is already required in the resolution to include the other NATO countries besides those in Europe. 
I am one of those who is opposed to the commitment of a deployment of a national missile defense system before we know costs, threats, impacts on arms reduction, and technological feasibility. But this amendment does not call for any commitment to the deployment of a national missile defense; it simply broadens the geographical area of a study which is already provided for in the resolution. 
I believe with that understanding and those two words that have been stricken, I understand, on line 6 of page 2, this amendment should be acceptable to all of us.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Delaware, the Minority manager of the resolution of ratification regarding NATO enlargement. 
I had planned to submit an amendment to the resolution of ratification as I discussed in my floor speed of October 27, 1997. This amendment, simply put, would express the Sense of the Senate that the United States should consult with all NATO member nations, subsequent to the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic but prior to the consideration of any other nation for accession, concerning the desirability of establishing a mechanism to suspend the membership of a NATO member if it no longer conforms to the Alliance's fundamental principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law. 
Mr. President, I raised this issue with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger when he testified before the Armed Services Committee on January 29th. In response to my question as to whether NATO should have a mechanism to suspend a member, Secretary Kissinger stated:  
I think in situations in which a government emerges incompatible with the common purpose of the Alliance, there ought to be some method, maybe along the lines you put forward. I have not thought this through, but I fully agree this is a very important issue which does not apply to any of the new countries that are now before us. 
I also raised the issue of establishing a mechanism for suspending a NATO member with former Secretary of Defense William Perry when he testified before the Armed Services Committee on March 19th. I posed the question in the context of a NATO nation that no longer conforms to NATO's fundamental principles but still has a veto over NATO operations. Secretary Perry stated: 
That is a very good question, Senator Levin. What you are describing is a problem--in fact, I would call it a flaw--in the original NATO structure, the NATO agreements. And, in my judgment, this is a problem which should be addressed. It has been a problem for many, many years. And, therefore it is important, in addressing that problem to separate it from the issue of NATO accession. I would not in any way want to tie that issue to the NATO accession issue. 
We could have predicted several decades ago that that would cause a problem, there would be some major issue come up on which we could not reach consensus, and that would bring NATO to a halt, or that some member would depart from the NATO values. Happily that has not happened. But it is a potential problem, and I think we ought to address it. 
Mr. President, I do not intend to offer this amendment at this time because it has nothing to do with Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic and I do not want to suggest or imply any such connection. Nevertheless, I do believe it is an issue that needs to be raised within NATO councils. I believe it should be resolved before any additional accessions to NATO are considered. And so, I would ask the distinguished Senator from Delaware if he believes this is a matter that merits consideration?

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment provides a tax credit to teachers who return to school to learn education technology. The credit would be 50 percent of the cost of that training. The current situation across our country is that educators are trying to find ways to use technologies to enrich the learning experience and to prepare students for a world in which information technologies are increasingly woven into the fabric of our life and our work. 
School districts all over this land are making investments in hardware and in software and in connecting computers and in accessing Internet and in distance learning. I traveled around my State, and I have spent a lot of time doing this, focusing on education technologies in the last 6 months. And I find, of course, as you would expect, there is a great variety in terms of how advanced school districts are when it comes to installing good computers, putting in the necessary software, how many computers they have for their student body, how much so-called local area networks, how many of those they have in the school connecting the computers to each other, how much access to the Internet in their school, to what extent are they connected to nearby colleges or distant colleges and universities, and those kinds of efforts. A huge effort is being made with different degrees of success. 
But what these school districts tell me universally is that where they are falling short is in the development of their teaching staff in the use of the technologies they are able to acquire. That is the common story I get from every school district--that we need to train our teachers in the use of these technologies. Typically, we find that only about 5 cents of the technology dollar is going into professional development and 95 cents of the education technology dollar is going into the hardware and software and connecters and the access. 
This Government is spending a fortune, for instance, in the so-called universal service fund to provide every school that applies with a discount on their communication bills to access the Internet, for instance, and on some of their internal linkages. But where we are falling way below where we must be is when it comes to the training of our teachers, of our professional staff in the use of these technologies. 
This first chart shows, as of the time that the statistics were taken in 1994--and we do not think too much has changed since then; but this is the last available year--how the States are doing when it comes to the training of teachers. 
How much education technology training do our teachers have? The U.S. average, this red line on this chart, is 15 percent of our teachers; 15 percent of our teachers have at least 9 hours of training in education technology. That is it. In my State, only 10 percent of the teachers--1 out of 10--had at least 9 hours of training in their lifetime in the use of education technology. That is a woeful story. 
What it means is that with all of the dollars that are going into hardware and software and these other technologies that we are spending pennies on, what is critically important is the skills to use the technologies which are provided. The most difficult skill of all is the one that has been least acquired. That is the ability to integrate the material which is now available through these technologies into the curriculum. Very few teachers are accessing the information, the thousands of libraries now available to them through their computers, the hundreds of field trips which they now can take in their classrooms if they know how to use these technologies. Until our teachers have those skills and are given those opportunities, we are not using these technologies to their fullest or anywhere close to their fullest. 
What this amendment does is, it says to those teachers who are willing to go back for training, we will give you a tax credit of 50 percent of the cost of that training. Now, we already have a lifetime learning credit of 20 percent that is a credit against the cost of higher education. That has been a great advance. It is effective this year. This amendment builds on that lifetime learning credit. It says for those teachers who go back to gain the skills in the use of education technology, they will get a 50 percent credit. It is a significantly increased incentive to obtain those skills which are so critically necessary if we are going to make use of these technologies and if our children are going to have the kind of training and access to material which can only be given by their teachers, if they have these skills. 
The person who is the technology director for the Michigan Education Department is a man named Jamey Fitzpatrick. He was quoted as saying:  
For every dollar we spend on computer hardware and software in kindergarten through 12th grades, I think we would be lucky if we saw five cents on the dollar spent on training and support. 
If we continue with those kinds of ratios we will never realize the gain in student achievement that we think technology has the potential to elicit. We obviously need to put money into training. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Moseley-Braun be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. What we do is leave most of the beneficial aspects of the underlying education IRA bill in place--first of all, that is what we don't do; what we do do, however, is we do not permit withdrawals from that IRA for K through 12. That is the most controversial part of this bill, for reasons I will get to in a moment. 
The rest of the provisions of this bill we do not touch. We don't touch the expanded IRA relative to the cost of higher education. We don't touch the extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided education assistance in this bill. We don't touch the tax exclusion for withdrawals from State tuition programs or the limited school construction provisions in this bill. 
What we do, however, is not permit withdrawal from the IRA for the K through 12 expenses. We don't do that because this most controversial provision of this bill, it seems to me, is severely tilted against public schools. I want to show a chart that gives a picture of how serious this tilt is against public education in this IRA as it exists in the underlying bill. 
According to the Joint Tax Committee--and we have here a letter from the Joint Tax Committee which lays out these numbers--according to the Joint Tax Committee, the majority of the tax benefit will go to the 2.9 million taxpayers with dependents in private school. The minority of the tax benefit will go to the 35 million taxpayers who have dependents in public school. So, 35 million taxpayers, those with dependents in public schools, get less than half the bill. The 2.9 million taxpayers with children in private schools get 52 percent of the benefit. Translated into dollars, in another way, the average taxpayer with a child in private school gets a $37 tax deduction in the year 2002; the public school taxpayer gets a $7 dollar deduction in the year 2002. 
I want to read the provisions from the letter because that is reflected in this chart. The Joint Tax Committee says, `We estimate that of those eligible to contribute, approximately 2.9 million returns would have children in private schools. We estimate that the proposed expansion of education IRAs to withdrawals to cover primary and secondary education would extend approximately 52 percent of the tax benefit to taxpayers with children in private schools. We estimate that the average per return tax benefit for taxpayers with children attending private schools would be approximately $37 in tax year 2002. Conversely, we estimate that of the 38.3 million returns eligible, approximately 35.4 million returns would have dependents in public schools and that approximately 10.8 million of these returns would utilize education IRAs. We estimate that the proposed expansion of the education IRAs would extend approximately 48 percent of the tax benefit to taxpayers with children in public schools with an average per return tax benefit of approximately $7 in the year 2002.' 
I gather I have used my time, so I will not reserve the balance of it. I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. The demands that are being made on teachers, as a matter of fact, are what is behind my amendment, which is to provide a credit to teachers who now have all these new technologies that are brought into the schools to help those teachers go back to learn how to utilize those technologies, should they choose to do so. These demands are huge. We are putting a fortune into computers, software and connectors to Internet and everything else, but we are only putting pennies into the professional development of our teachers. 
This amendment would provide a 50 percent tax credit for the cost when those teachers go back for that training. It pays for it by not allowing the use of this new IRA in the K through 12 area because it is so skewed against public schools. That is the main point here. It keeps the IRA increase for college education, and it keeps other parts of this bill. But what it says is that withdrawals will not be permitted in the K through 12 grades because of the manner in which most of the money goes to private-school families, although they represent only 10 percent of the families with children in schools.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Bingaman be added as a cosponsor. 
Under current law, there is a learning credit in the Tax Code equal to 20 percent of a student's college education cost, up to $5,000. My amendment increases the percentage from 20 percent to 50 percent of those college costs for teachers who return to receive training in technology. We currently have this lifetime learning credit of 20 percent for college costs, up to $5,000. 
Because of the critical importance of our teachers learning how to utilize technology in the classrooms, this amendment would increase that credit to 50 percent of that teacher's college costs in those courses where he or she received training in technology. The amendment does not affect most of the beneficial aspects of the bill before us. It only removes the most controversial part of that bill relative to the use of the IRA in the K through 12th grades--I will come to that in a moment--but it leaves in place the other parts of the education bill before us, including the extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided education assistance, the provision of a tax exclusion for withdrawals from State tuition programs, the limited school construction provisions, and, again, the expansion of the education IRA as it relates to college and postsecondary education. 
This amendment is necessary in our school districts all over our country because they are making investments in technology, hardware and software, wiring together schools so they can connect their computers, and inside of the school building connecting computers through what is called `local area networks,' connecting our K through 12 classrooms to colleges and universities for distance learning through fiber optics. Lots of new technologies are being provided in our schools at great cost to our taxpayers. 
I have spent a lot of time traveling in my State. What I find is that no matter how advanced a school district is in the installation of these technologies, we do not have nearly enough of the professional development, the giving to our teachers those skills that are essential so that they can utilize these education technologies. 
School districts vary as to how much technology they have, how much access to the Internet they have, how modern their computers are, how many computers they have for their students, and how well-connected they are to the higher institutions to which they connect. They vary in that regard a great deal. But all of the school districts tell me their teachers who are so experienced in teaching in the traditional ways have not been given the skills to utilize these new technologies. So we are making these huge investments in hardware and software and wiring without making anywhere close to full use of these investments. 
A study that was conducted by the Education Testing Service at Princeton, NJ, shows that on the national average only 15 percent of our teachers at the time of the study had at least 9 hours of training in education technology in their lifetime. By the way, that training is mostly spent just teaching a teacher how to use a computer to, for instance, give their grades and keep track of attendance, to input. What we are talking about here is training teachers in the use of technology so that they 
can use that wealth of information that is now available, those thousands of libraries around the world, those hundreds of field trips that they can bring into their classroom through this technology. What our teachers need to do is have the opportunity to train themselves to use these technologies for those new, wonderful opportunities to bring exciting material into their curriculum, to integrate into their curriculum the material that is now available through these technologies. For instance, in my State, only 10 percent of the teachers had 9 hours of training in their lifetime in the use of education technology for any purpose. The national average is 15 percent. That meant that 85 percent of our teachers did not even have 9 hours of training in their lifetime in the use of education technology. 
For the younger generation, it is easy to learn how to input, it is easy to learn how to access the Internet. For those of us who are older, it is not so easy. It takes training. My children teach me how to input, how to access the Internet. For them, it is like breathing. For me, it is work. It is concentration. It is repetition. It is having a mentor. That mentor might be 5 years old. But for me it is more difficult. For our experienced teachers, it takes training. In many cases it takes returning to school. This amendment provides the incentive to go back to school to learn how to use the education technologies which are now made available to our teachers. 
This amendment pays for this by restricting the use of the expanded IRA that is in this bill to postsecondary education. This is a highly controversial part of the bill, as we all know. Senator Glenn offered an amendment to strike this provision just as it relates to K through 12. My amendment goes the same distance as Senator Glenn in trying to strike this provision for the reasons which he and so many others have spoken about on this floor. But it takes the funds that are freed up and invests them in this 50-percent lifetime learning credit for teachers who go back to learn how to utilize education technology. 
The provision in the bill relative to the use of these funds in the lower grades, K through 12, is flawed for many reasons, I believe constitutionally flawed, but it also has a fundamental unfairness. 
It is significantly tilted towards those families with children in private schools. This is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. These numbers are not mine; these are the numbers of the Joint Committee on Taxation. There are 35.4 million families filing tax returns who have children in public schools. Those families get less than half of the dollars which are utilized in this part of the pending bill; 48 percent of the dollars go to 35 million taxpayers, the ones with children in public schools. More than half, 52 percent, of the dollars, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, go to 2.9 million taxpayers with children in private schools. 
Now, that is a significant inequity. Putting aside its constitutional question, that represents a significant tilt away from public schools. This amendment would strike that part of the expanded IRA. It leaves all the other provisions in the education bill before us that I have talked about. The extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided education assistance is not touched. The tax exclusion it provides for withdrawals from State tuition programs is not touched by this amendment. The limited school construction language is not touched. The expansion of the education IRA for college and graduate cost is not touched. 
What is eliminated is the use of the expanded IRA for kindergarten through the 12th grade, and it uses that money instead to give incentives to teachers to learn how to use the technologies which are being provided at such great cost by our taxpayers to our schools. There is no point in spending a fortune on computers and distance learning and software unless our teachers have the training to fully utilize those technologies, and this amendment addresses that issue.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first on the question of why technology. In my earlier remarks I indicated why there was such a need for training in technology for our teachers. We make a number of special provisions in our law for technology. It's not unique. We make special provisions for lots of purposes, including language training. Why language training? Because there is a need that we have for language training. Why technology? Because obviously the incomes of our students are going to depend on how well they can use technologies and how well we utilize technologies in their training. For instance, we currently have a Technology Literacy Challenge Fund. That is part of our law; $425 million, I believe, in this year's fiscal budget. It is addressed towards technology because of the importance of technology. So there is nothing unusual about having special provisions for different parts of education and for training, and this amendment is focused on one of the very critical needs that we now have. 
Let me briefly quote the acting director of technology from the Michigan Education Department. His name is Jamie Fitzpatrick. I have worked with him closely over the past 6 months as I have traveled over the State visiting with schools and school districts in this technology area. This is what Mr. Fitzpatrick says, as quoted in a press dispatch: 
For every dollar we spend on computer hardware and software in kindergarten through 12th grades, I think we would be lucky if we saw 5 cents on the dollar spent on training and support. If we continue with those kinds of ratios, we will never realize the gain in student achievement that we think technology has the potential to elicit. We obviously need to put money into training. 
That is what this amendment is aimed at, giving an incentive to teachers, experienced teachers in their courses, to go back to get skills necessary to utilize these new technologies in their curricula. Otherwise we are not utilizing fully the potential of these technologies that come at such great cost to our parents. 
I would wager on the answer, if we ask the American people whether or not they think it is right for 35.4 million families with students in public schools to get less of a benefit from the current provision in this bill that we would draft--less of a dollar benefit than the 2.9 million families with students in private schools who get the lion's share of that IRA money for grades K-12. That's not my numbers. That's the Joint Committee on Taxation's numbers. I wish we had a way of taking a survey of families in America, to ask whether or not they think this provision in the pending bill fairly treats the families of America. I don't think it does, and I think those families want us to have our teachers fully trained to utilize these new technologies. I think that is why the support for this amendment comes from the grassroots, as I know it does from my travels around my own State. 
Mr. President if I have any time remaining, I reserve the remainder of that time.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, the argument that alleges or suggests that someone making $75,000 is wealthy, we did not address that issue at all. What this chart shows, though, is that the 2.9 million families with children in private schools get more of the benefit than the 35.4 million families with children in public schools. That is the disproportion and inequity that I point out in this amendment. 
We have almost 36 million families getting back less of a total benefit, 48 percent, than 2.9 million families with children in private schools. That is the argument. 
I do not have any time to yield back, but I thank the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, on the amendment that I offered before, I just want to read very briefly from the memorandum from the Joint Committee on Taxation which supports the chart I have used. This memorandum, which is now part of the Record, says that they estimate that `2.4 million of the returns [who have children in private school] would utilize education IRAs' and that those returns would utilize `52 percent of the tax benefit. . .' 
On the other hand, this letter says that the `35.4 million returns [with] dependents in public schools' would utilize 48 percent of the tax benefit. 
That is a direct quote from the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
Relative to the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, I will just speak briefly because I will turn the remainder of the time over to the Senator from Massachusetts on this issue. But I will say this. I do not disagree with his point that local school districts, communities, and parents should control the curriculum. I happen to be a strong believer in local control. 
Whether or not a school district wants to use new math or old math is something they ought to be able to decide. But one of the things they also should be able to decide is whether or not they want to utilize a national test which will give them some idea as to where their students stand relative to other students. 
If they do not like that idea, they should not have to give that test. That should be a local option. It is a local option under the President's proposal. It is not a mandatory test. It is voluntary as he proposes it. School districts can use it or not use it. The question is whether or not, then, we should deny a school district the option, whether we should deny a local community an option to use a tool if they see fit to use it. That is the issue. 
That tool may not be a useful tool. The Senator from Missouri may be correct. A school district may decide they do not want any part of it for the reasons that he gives. That should be the right and is the right of the local school district under the President's proposal. 
But it should also be an obligation available to a local school district if they think there is a benefit from utilizing a national test. Why deny a community? Why deny a local government, a local school district, a tool which they believe is useful? 
That is the issue. That is what would be denied under this second-degree amendment. I don't think we ought to deny that opportunity here for local school districts to make that choice. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous I be allowed to yield the remainder of my time to be under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to the April 30, 1998 Grand Opening of the new, and permanent, home of Gilda's Club, Metro Detroit in Royal Oak, Michigan. Gilda's Club is a support community for men, women and children who are living with cancer as well as their families and friends. 
Gilda's Club is named for the late comedienne Gilda Radner, a Detroit native who died at the age of 42 after a courageous fight against cancer. Gilda first became known for her portrayals of irreverent characters on `Saturday Night Live.' She also appeared on Broadway and in movies. Shortly before she died, Gilda wrote `It's Always Something,' a book about her experience living with cancer. Gilda's Club was born from Gilda Radner's wish for all people with cancer to have as strong a support group as she had. 
Gilda's Club aims to provide a friendly, residential haven for cancer patients and their friends and families. In this home-like setting, people living with or affected by cancer can share their experiences, participate in workshops and lectures, and attend social events. Gilda's Club is designed to enhance medical treatment with the emotional and social support which can be so crucial for those living with the disease. 
Thousands of people from communities throughout Michigan pulled together to make Gilda's Club's permanent home a reality. Many organizations and businesses have hosted fundraising events and have committed their own money to the cause. A comedy event is held once a year to raise funds for Gilda's Club, and thousands of people walk in the Annual 5K Gilda's Club Family Walk and Block Party. In 1997, this event involved more than three thousand walkers and raised more than $175,000. 
Mr. President, people living with cancer have long been able to rely on gifted and dedicated doctors to help them fight the disease which affects their bodies. Gilda's Club, Metro Detroit offers a critical supplement--emotional uplift--to the care cancer patients receive from their physicians. By promoting hope and healing, Gilda's Club will have an impact on thousands of people. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the efforts of the many people who have made Gilda's Club, Metro Detroit possible, and in extending our prayers and high hopes to everyone who walks through its doors.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 83rd Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Each year we remember and honor the victims, and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to have with us today. 
April 24, 1915 serves as a marking point for the government-orchestrated carnage that took place under the Turkish Ottoman Empire. On this date, over 5,000 Armenians were systematically hunted down and killed in Constantinople. This number includes some 600 Armenian political and intellectual leaders who were taken to the interior of Turkey and systematically murdered. During the eight year period from 1915 to 1923, approximately 1.5 million Armenians were killed and hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes. Many of these deaths were among the elderly and very young as they were forced on death marches with little food and no medical treatment. 
History records that the world stood by as the Armenians suffered, although there was ample evidence of what was taking place. Our Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, stated that, `When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact * * * I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this.' 
Not only did the world stand by while atrocities took place, but unfortunately it refused to learn the awful lessons that were taught during this period. When Adolf Hitler was planning the Jewish Holocaust he said, `Who today remembers the extermination of the Armenians?' However, most of the world has come to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. In 1929, Winston Churchill wrote the following: `In 1915, the Turkish Government began and carried out the infamous general massacre and deportation of Armenians in Asia Minor * * * the clearance of the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, could be. There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons.' 
Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the Armenian people will not be in vain. That is surely the highest tribute we can pay to the Armenian victims and a way in which the horror and brutality of their deaths can be given redeeming meaning. I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the Armenian Genocide.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment would put the Senate on record in support of sunsetting the tax code on December 31, 2001, before a system was set up to replace it and without assurance that such a system would be in place. 
There is no question that the Internal Revenue Code is too complicated and needs reform. In fact, as a result of the tax bill which was signed into law last year, 285 new sections were added. 
One of the problems with the amendment before us is that it would do away with the current tax system without a guarantee that it would be replaced in a timely and orderly manner, if at all, so people can plan their lives. The sunsetting is not dependent on the adoption of a replacement. Households and businesses rely on provisions of the tax code for budgeting purposes. 
Mr. President, we need a new tax code, but we also must make sure that a simplified and fairer tax code is in place. To pretend that we can sunset the current code without knowing what will take its place and without having the guarantee of a replacement in a timely manner, is misleading.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the United States Air Force Reserve on its 50th Anniversary, which will be celebrated across the country on April 14, 1998. The United States Air Force Reserve can trace its heritage back to the National Defense Act of 1916 which authorized a reserve corps of 2,300 officer and enlisted aviators. In 1917, the War Department established the First Reserve Aero Squadron. However, the Air Reserve was not formally established until after World War II. 
On July 26, 1947, the National Security Act was signed into law by President Truman. This act established the United States Air Force as a separate branch of our Nation's armed forces. On April 14, 1948, just seven months later, the U.S. Air Force Reserve was established. On April 27, 1948, the Air Reserve was transferred to the Air Force. In October 1948, President Truman directed the services to revamp their reserve components. As a result, the Air Force established the position of Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff for Reserve Forces to oversee the Air Reserve. The first person to fill this position was Lt. Gen. Elwood R. Quesada. On December 1, 1948, the Air Force established the Continental Air Command (CONAC) at Mitchell Air Force Base, New York. The CONAC's mission was to administer all Air Reserve programs. After the establishment of the CONAC, the Air Reserve's mission became more coherent and diversified. 
Since its humble beginnings during World War I, the Air Force Reserve has seen many dramatic changes as it has built itself into the world-class force it is today. Over the past fifty years the men and women of the Air Force Reserve have served with honor and distinction during the 1961 Berlin Crisis and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and in the major conflicts of Korea, Vietnam and in the Persian Gulf. Major General Robert A. McIntosh, the Commander of the Air Force Reserve Command, recently summarized the remarkable accomplishments of the Air Force Reserve. He said, `In five decades, we moved from a standby force, training on obsolete and war-weary airplanes, to a front-line force that is more capable than the air forces of many nations. We are a role model for keeping unique capabilities in a military framework without spending the money that a large full-time military requires.' 
As the Air Force Reserve celebrates its Golden Anniversary this month, we recognize that the Air Force Reserve truly does have a golden legacy. It is a legacy that we should all take time to reflect upon and honor. Regardless of any future threat our Nation may face, the Air Force Reserve will meet the challenge just as they always have. Air Force Reservists deserve the respect and gratitude of all Americans for their service and their sacrifice for our country. These volunteers exemplify daily their dedication to the ideals that make our country great. 
In Michigan, the 927th Air Refueling Wing at Selfridge Air National Guard Base will celebrate the Air Reserve's 50th Anniversary. The 927th ARW flies KC-135E Stratotankers to fulfill its mission of providing Global Reach for United States air power. The 927th has a rich history of service which includes missions in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and Bosnia. We in Michigan are very proud of the job the 927th is doing for our nation. 
I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the United States Air Force Reserve.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the University of Michigan Wolverines on the completion of a perfect 1997 football season. In September, the Wolverines began one of the toughest schedules in the Big Ten. The team was prepared to play some of the strongest teams in NCAA football. From their first victory against Colorado (27-3) to their last game of the season against Ohio State (20-14), Michigan dominated the field, surrendering few touchdowns with their top-rated defense. By November, the Wolverines had finished their regular season undefeated, with a Big Ten Championship, a Rose Bowl berth and their first chance at a National Championship in fifty years. 
In January, the Michigan Wolverines faced the Washington State Cougars in the 1998 Rose Bowl. Although the University of Michigan has more Rose Bowl appearances than any other Big Ten school, the Wolverines were appearing in Pasadena for the first time in five years. Senior quarterback Brien Griese led the team with 18 for 30 passing for 251 yards and three touchdowns. The Wolverines celebrated a 21-16 victory over Washington State, giving them their ninth straight win against opponents ranked in the Associated Press Top 10 and finishing with a perfect 12-0 season. 
The Rose Bowl victory clinched the Wolverines the Associated Press National Championship trophy and secured the co-national championship. The season became even sweeter for the Wolverines when University of Michigan junior Charles Woodson won the 1997 Heisman Trophy, football's most prestigious individual honor, and head coach Lloyd Carr was recognized as Coach of the Year. 1997 was undoubtedly an outstanding year for Michigan football, and possibly the best in school history. On April 9, President Bill Clinton will honor the University of Michigan Wolverines at the White House for their extraordinary athletic accomplishments and remarkable teamwork. I extend my heartiest congratulations to the University of Michigan football team on a perfect 1997 season--Let's Go Blue!

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the managers of the bill for accepting my amendment which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the Office of the Trade Representative regarding prospective IMF borrowing countries, including their status with respect to our trade laws, and to take these consultations with our Trade Representative into account before the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF is given instructions on the U.S. position regarding approving loans to those countries. 
I have had some difficulty supporting IMF reauthorization in the absence of requiring countries who are benefiting from an IMF funding bailout to remove restrictive trade practices and barriers that discriminate against American goods and American services. This amendment would put our trading partners on notice that the United States is going to take into consideration a country's discriminatory trade barriers to American goods and services as part of the process of determining American support for IMF loans. 
Title III of the Trade Act of 1974 includes both section 301 and super 301 trade laws. These are some of our strongest trade tools in the arsenal to fight unfair and discriminatory trade practices. 
If a foreign country is identified under these trade laws, it means that some of the most egregious discriminatory trade barriers are being kept in place to keep out American goods and services, and we have to use our trade laws to try to knock down barriers to our goods. We face discriminatory trade barriers too often. Trade is too often a one-way street, and where that is true with countries that are being considered for IMF loans, we should have the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF take into account those barriers and try to negotiate them away before approving the 
loan. 
That is the point of this amendment--to make sure that those discussions and considerations take place before IMF loans are approved. Countries that discriminate against our goods and our services should not benefit from these loans until they have taken steps to remove the barriers. I hope that this provision will send a strong message to any country in question that has these barriers and is seeking IMF loans; that it must take significant steps to remove trade barriers if it wants to be assured of U.S. approval of those IMF loans. 
Again, I thank the managers for accepting this amendment. I very much appreciate it. Those of us representing States that have industries and services that face these barriers in countries that are being considered for IMF loans very much want this kind of action to be taken. They want our trade laws to be enforced, and want any discriminatory barriers that continue to exist that are maintained by these countries to be removed, to be negotiated away before we decide what to do on the request for the IMF loan. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend from my home state of Michigan, Mr. Aldo Vagnozzi. Aldo is retiring after a long and distinguished career as a journalist for labor publications. 
In 1948, Aldo Vagnozzi began his career in journalism as a Senior at Wayne State University, writing for the Michigan CIO News. He became editor of the Michigan AFL-CIO News, and served in that position until 1968, when he joined the Detroit Labor News. By 1970, Aldo was already considered a legend by many of his fellow labor journalists for the way in which he kept the labor community informed about news affecting the working people of Michigan. One of his colleagues is quoted in the Detroit Labor News as saying `The movement for worker rights and justice has been immeasurably strengthened by his dedication to his craft and his talents as a labor journalist.' 
Although he is retiring after 50 years of work, that does not mean that Aldo Vagnozzi's commitment to the people of Michigan is also coming to an end. In early May, he will participate in the Michigan Labor Press Conference, where he will share with other labor editors and writers some of the insights he gained throughout his career. And Aldo will also continue his leadership in the public service arena as well. His strong principles and beliefs have earned him the support of people from all walks of life and political persuasions in his home city of Farmington Hills, Michigan, where he serves as the first directly elected mayor in history. 
Mr. President, throughout his 50 years in journalism, Aldo Vagnozzi has used the power of the written word to advance the cause of workers' rights, safety and justice. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting Aldo for his exceptional career and in wishing him well in his retirement.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Leahy for offering this amendment. It is a very important amendment to those of us in the Great Lakes for the reasons he has described. His initiative was aimed at making certain that Lake Champlain would be eligible to compete for certain funds. That eligibility is dependent upon Lake Champlain facing a common problem. 
There is no reason why Lake Champlain should not be able to compete for funds where they face a common problem with the Great Lakes, such as zebra mussels or contaminated sediments. So that was never the problem. The problem was the redesignation of Lake Champlain as a Great Lake, and that is what created the difficulty. 
Basically, what this Leahy amendment does is to reconfirm the historical definition of the Great Lakes. That historical 
definition of the five Great Lakes is learned by every child in the Great Lakes region. It is HOMES. It is the easy way for our children to learn what the Great Lakes are. HOMES--Lake Huron, Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Together they spell HOMES. That is a very significant part of our identity in the Great Lakes. 
Senator Leahy, in his amendment this morning and in his words on the floor, recognizes the importance of that historical identity to us, and we are very supportive of this amendment, indeed, have actively helped to create it, to cosponsor it. 
I also thank Senator Abraham who has played such an active role in this effort to maintain the Great Lakes as the traditional five Great Lakes. His role has also been critically important, as has the role of the other Great Lakes Senators who have been supportive of this amendment. 
There are many, many laws that designate the Great Lakes as the five traditional Great Lakes. Under the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act, for instance, the Great Lakes have been defined as the `five Great Lakes.' Under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, the traditional `five Great Lakes' have been designated. And so forth throughout history, both legislative and geographic, the `five Great Lakes' have been clearly identified as those five Great Lakes that I have just identified. 
I want to, again, state that this amendment may hopefully now resolve a controversy. We hope this will pass the House of Representatives. We believe it will. But this is not just a tempest in a teapot for those of us who live in the Great Lakes region. This is a matter of our very identity. The importance of these Great Lakes to us, to our economy, to our ecology, to our environment, and to our recreation is clear. So, in reversing the designation, as this amendment would, continuing Vermont and Lake Champlain as being eligible to compete for funds where there is a common problem is the right way to go. 
We thank Senator Leahy for his recognition of that. All of us who live in the Great Lakes region, I think, are now going to be assured that a traditional definition, which has been so important to us in our identities, will be maintained and will be restored. 
Now this language will hopefully pass the House of Representatives, and I am sure with Senator Leahy's support, it will do so. Again, I thank him, I thank Senator Abraham, and I thank our colleagues from the Great Lakes region for their effort in this legislation. 
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to build on the President's March 3, 1998, report to Congress that sets forth a series of benchmarks for the implementation of the Dayton accords in Bosnia. That report was submitted by the President pursuant to identical provisions contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 and the National Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1998. 
The benchmarks, which are described in the report as `concrete and achievable,' however, were established unilaterally by the administration and were not shared with or agreed upon by our NATO allies. 
My amendment would call for the President to seek agreement by NATO to those benchmarks to an estimated timetable for their accomplishment and to a process to review the accomplishment of those benchmarks. 
The amendment would thus attempt to ensure that all NATO members are using the same objectives and estimated time lines for their achievement and are committed to reviewing the situation if those time lines are not met. 
I want to stress, Mr. President, that the time lines are not deadlines, they are not rigid or inflexible; they are estimates. But I do believe that establishing benchmarks without an estimated timeframe within which you hope to accomplish those benchmarks is only doing half the job. This is particularly true when, as here, the benchmarks, with one exception, are largely beyond the control of the NATO-led stabilization force. 
That force, SFOR, can create the secure environment within which the civil implementation of the Dayton accords can take place and SFOR can provide support to the Office of the High 
Representative, the International Police Task Force, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, but SFOR cannot and should not seek to directly carry out those civil implementation functions. 
Thus, since the accomplishments of these benchmarks are generally beyond SFOR's control, it is important for NATO to agree on the benchmarks and the estimated time lines for their accomplishment so the Bosnian entities and the several international organizations are aware of what is expected of them. 
The amendment also calls for NATO to periodically review the accomplishments of the benchmarks within the estimated time lines that they establish and calls on the President to submit semiannual reports to Congress on the results of NATO's review. 
I am not here, Mr. President, criticizing the Bosnian entities or the international organizations involved in the implementation of the civil aspects of the Dayton accords. As a matter of fact, I am pleased with the progress that has been made over the last 6 months, particularly with the installation of a new government in the Republika Srpska. 
Finally, Mr. President, I believe, as I have expressed many times on this floor, that U.S. ground combat forces should remain in Bosnia only for a reasonable period of time beyond June of this year. I do not believe our commitment should be open-ended. This amendment, by seeking to ensure that everybody agrees on the same benchmarks and the same estimated time lines for their achievement, will, I believe, provide a framework by which to judge the movement forward to the time that U.S. ground combat forces can be withdrawn from Bosnia. 
Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Alaska has a second-degree amendment that he wishes to offer which is acceptable to me. I yield the floor.

I do so with the realization that this represents, in its most basic meaning, a serious commitment by the United States to treat an armed attack on any of these nations as an attack on the United States. 
NATO has been called the most successful alliance in the history of the world. It successfully deterred an attack by the former Soviet Union and also, very importantly, it helped to keep the peace among the nations of Western Europe. I am convinced that the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO will help ensure long-term stability and peace in Europe and will demonstrate our continuing engagement and leadership in transatlantic affairs. 
The inclusion of these three nations that are willing and able to defend the common interests will strengthen the alliance. Each of these nations provided forces to the United States-led coalition during the Persian Gulf war. Their troops are serving with the NATO-led stabilization force in Bosnia. Hungary provides a staging and training base for U.S. forces in Bosnia. All three are prepared to contribute forces to the United States-led force presently deployed in the gulf, if that proves necessary. They have, thus, already demonstrated their commitment to burdensharing and to be not just consumers of security but also contributors to a more secure Europe. 
Most important, I believe that a military invasion of Poland, or Hungary, or the Czech Republic would threaten the stability of Europe and involve the vital national security interests of the United States. All three of these countries have established good relations with their neighbors. For example, Poland and Ukraine concluded a declaration of reconciliation in December of 1997. Hungary ratified treaties on understanding, cooperation, and good neighborliness with Slovakia in March of 1995, and with Romania in September of 1996. The Czech Republic signed a formal reconciliation pact with Germany in January of 1997. 
Several issues need to be addressed as part of this momentous debate. These issues include the impact that enlargement will have on Russia, the commitment of these three nations to the principles of the NATO treaty, the cost of NATO enlargement, whether the door to further enlargement should remain open after the accession of these three nations, and whether the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should be delayed until they are admitted to the European Union. 
First, the impact of enlargement on Russia. I start this with the sobering thought that Russia is the only country that could destroy the United States. Additionally, although Russia does not today pose a conventional threat to NATO, it is a large and resource-rich country, whose policies of democratization and movement to a market economy are very important to the U.S. and its NATO allies. It is, therefore, an important national security interest of the United States to do what we reasonably can to ensure that NATO enlargement does not contribute to a reversal of Russia's course toward democratization and a market economy, nor contribute to a Russian view of the United States as a hostile nation. 
In a statement I made at the Armed Services Committee's first hearing after NATO's decision to enlarge, a hearing in April of 1997, in which Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified, I said the following: 
I believe that we must do everything we reasonably can to enlarge NATO in a way that contributes to a greater, rather than less, stability in Europe. How we enlarge NATO is critically important, along with whether we enlarge NATO, since we do not want to contribute to the very instability that NATO enlargement is aimed at deterring.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for the resolution on Kosovo of which I am an original cosponsor. 
The actions of the Serbian special police, who take their orders from Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, in indiscriminately attacking ethnic Albanians residents, including women and children, in Kosovo last week are an abomination. They remind us that it was Milosevic's desire for a Greater Serbia that led to the countless innocent victims in the war in Bosnia. If he is allowed to go unchecked in Kosovo, Milosevic will plunge the Balkans into war again. That cannot be allowed. 
The Contact Group, consisting of France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, has been following events in Kosovo closely for some time. On September 24, 1997, the Contact Group expressed its deep concern over tensions in Kosovo and called on the authorities in Belgrade and the leadership of the Kosovar Albanian community to join in a peaceful dialogue. I would also note that in a Joint Statement dated October 1, 1997, the United States and the European Union Presidency strongly condemned the use of force against peaceful demonstrators in Kosovo and called on the international community to join in the condemnation. 
The Contact Group repeated its call for peaceful dialogue on January 8, 1998, and on February 25, 1998, but it fell on deaf ears. 
On March 8, 1998, the Contact Group condemned the excessive use of force by the Serbian police that resulted in at least 80 fatalities and condemned the repression of non-violent expression of political views. The Contact Group noted that it was not endorsing terrorism and condemned terrorist actions by any group. Additionally, it called upon Belgrade to invite independent forensic experts to investigate the very serious allegations of extrajudicial killings. The Contact Group recommended a number of actions too numerous to detail here and demanded that Milosevic must: Withdraw the special police units and cease action by the security forces affecting the civilian population. Allow access to Kosovo for the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations as well as by representatives of the Contact Group and other Embassies. Commit himself publicly to begin a process of dialogue, with the leadership of the Kosovar Albanian community. Cooperate in a constructive manner with the Contact Group in the implementation of the actions it recommended which require action by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia government. 
The concurrent resolution, entitled Calling for an end to the violent repression of the people of Kosovo, call for the international community to respond affirmatively to the call of the Contact Group for the imposition of broad-based sanctions against the Government of Serbia if it fails to prevent atrocities by the police and paramilitary groups or does not otherwise comply immediately with the terms set forth by the Contact Group. 
Mr. President, Senator Jack Reed and I visited Belgrade in January 1997 and were impressed by the massive demonstrations in favor of the opposition `Together' movement. The several opposition parties and the students found their common opposition to Milosevic to be a rallying force. I would note that the United States--European Union Joint Statement of October 1, 1997 that I referred to previously, went on to deplore specific actions by Belgrade in removing Zoran Djindjic as the mayor of Belgrade, replacing the editor of Studio B television and packing the station's managing board. It held Milosevic accountable for attempting to reassert political control of the media in Serbia. That is the pattern: take over the media, commit atrocities, arrange for television to only show violence against Serb policeman, and then blame the whole situation on someone else. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal began its investigation last Tuesday of the recent events in Kosovo. I am also pleased that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced last Friday that the United States was making a contribution of $1.075 million to support the Tribunal's effort in Kosovo. 
Mr. President, a reading of the concurrent resolution will reveal that there are numerous references to Slobodan Milosevic. That is no accident and we need to send a personal message to him. I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge a great athletic achievement in the state of Michigan. On this past Sunday evening, the NCAA selection committee announced the 64 best college teams in America to go head-to-head in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Among this field of 64, five teams from the state of Michigan are included in the `March Madness' frenzy, making Michigan the most represented state in the tournament. These teams are Eastern Michigan University, Michigan State University, University of Detroit Mercy, University of Michigan and Western Michigan University. This is first time in Michigan history that five teams from the state have been in the NCAA tournament at the same time. 
In their wisdom, the selection committee recognized that there are many excellent basketball programs and extraordinary talent within the state of Michigan. Not only have the two traditional Michigan powerhouse teams, Michigan State University and the University of Michigan, proven that they are among the nation's elite teams, but some smaller basketball programs have also made their mark on this season by winning some key games and finishing strong within their respective conferences. 
Michigan State University ended an impressive season by tying with the University of Illinois for the Big Ten regular Season title, while the University of Michigan finished an equally impressive season by winning the first ever Big Ten Conference tournament. Both of these teams are highly seeded within their respective regions. Western Michigan finished tied for first place in the Mid-American Conference and received an at-large NCAA bid, which is their second ever NCAA berth. Eastern Michigan finished strong by winning the Mid-American Conference tournament and was pitted against Michigan State in the first round of the tournament. The University of Detroit Mercy was the Mid-Western Collegiate Conference regular season champion and also received an at-large bid to the tournament. 
I am looking forward to the next few weeks to see who will be crowned NCAA National Champion. While these great teams from Michigan fight it out to see who will be crowned National Champion, one thing remains clear: this has been a great year for Michigan basketball and I dare to say, the best has yet to come. Go Michiganders!!!

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Virginia. Indeed, we have worked long and hard on a number of issues, including the donor State issue. The amendment that I am going to call up in a minute is not a donor State amendment. We have had many of those, some of which we have had some success on, some of which we have not. 
Since the question of donor States has been raised, let me say for those 15 to 20 of our States that contribute historically much more than we get back in terms of Federal gas tax dollars, the bill that is before us now does take some small steps on a long road to fairness for those donor States. 
We hope that we can improve this bill further in conference from where it is now. There have been some small steps taken through the efforts of many. We are grateful for all of those efforts.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment will be modified in a moment. We have worked with the floor managers and their staffs to modify this amendment so it will be acceptable. What this does is improve the bill's focus on the transportation needs of small metropolitan and rural areas by involving them in a greater way in the planning process. 
It is important that a State transportation improvement program be developed with the cooperation of our nonmetropolitan planning organizations, as well as the metropolitan planning organizations. 
The bill, unless we adopt this modified amendment, will simply continue the ISTEA I structure, which only requires that nonmetropolitan area planning organizations be consulted in the planning process. We raise that one level to require that there be cooperation with those smaller units of government. That has a significance to our Department of Transportation and to the States and greater significance to the smaller units of government and their planning organizations so that they will be involved in a greater way in the planning process.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that. In fact, I look forward to the conferees looking at this balance. Right now, the metropolitan areas of our country have planning organizations, and the States are required to coordinate the plan with those metropolitan areas. But when it comes to the smaller areas, planning units, there is no such requirement. There is a `consultation' requirement, which is two notches below coordination. 
What we are simply doing here is having a little fairer balance with the smaller units. By the way, this concept has been approved by the National League of Cities. What we simply do here is say that the States will cooperate with these nonmetropolitan planning organizations so that we get a little greater input. But I would welcome, as a matter of fact, the conferees looking very closely at this concept. And I understand what the Senator said. It is with that understanding that we welcome the manager's support.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bill is going to help the State of Michigan address crucial transportation needs. Our highway infrastructure and our transit systems desperately require the increased funding that this bill promises to deliver. We should celebrate that Congress is finally spending all or nearly all the gas tax money put into the Highway Trust Fund on transportation. This means somewhere between $250 million to $300 million more for Michigan. 
However, this bill is a complex tangle of programs and funding. When the bill's managers sought to summarily add roughly $26 billion in new funding to the reported bill without sharing much information about how this would impact Michigan or the other donor states (states which pay more into the Highway Trust Fund than they receive out of it), I objected. As a Senator from a historical donor state, I saw no reason to rush to send more of Michigan's gas taxes out to other states. Then, when the Federal Highway Administration provided a chart showing Michigan's share of this new money was actually lower than our share in the reported bill, my objection was justified. 
I and other donor state Senators met with the bill managers to encourage them to accept changes to the bill that would improve our return on taxes sent to the Trust Fund. We argued for equity and fairness. But, because of the way these bills are constructed, it is hard for any state to improve its standing without other states losing. 
Then, the Majority Leader, as is his right and responsibility, sought unanimous consent to override germaneness requirements in order to adopt the tax and transit titles to the bill. I objected because I did not feel that Michigan had yet been adequately treated. We were certainly not at or above the so-called `91% guaranteed' return level, according to Federal Highway Administration charts. My objection slowed the bill down a little, but it gave me and other Senators, including Senator Abraham, the time to work with the bill managers to fashion a more equitable bill. 
The bill managers agreed to some further assistance for seven donor states, including Michigan, which we accepted and appreciated. And, I pushed a little more to get Michigan eligible for the new pot of money made available for the `high-density transportation program.' These two efforts now should add about $20 million annually to our average annual expected allocation to about $842 million over the next six years. 
That is the good news. More of the gas tax money being collected will be returning to the states for transportation purposes. Unfortunately, though more is being distributed, Michigan's return is not likely to improve by more than a few pennies on the gas tax dollar. In the last year of ISTEA, Michigan sent $631 million to the Highway Trust Fund account and got back $605 million. Under ISTEA II (average), Michigan will send $932 million to the Highway Trust Fund and receive back $842 million. So, although the overall pie has been increased by 39%, Michigan's slice has only increased by about 34%. 
Mr. President, I am voting for this bill because it takes a few small steps on the long road toward fairness for Michigan. We fought hard for those steps. But, while Michigan is getting considerably more money, it will contribute more still into the Highway Trust Fund, leaving Michigan in a significant `donor state' status. I hope my colleagues in the House will be successful in their upcoming battle.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the managers of the bill. I support this amendment. We have worked very hard on it. It represents a step towards greater fairness for some donor States who did not receive any benefits from other parts of changes in this bill. It is a long road, still, towards fairness--from our perspective, I emphasize--but this represents a step along the road and could not have been made without the help of our good friends from Rhode Island and Montana.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of Focus: HOPE. On March 8, 1968, Focus: HOPE adopted the following resolution: 
Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person we pledge intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, poverty and injustice. And to build a metropolitan community where all people may live in freedom, harmony, trust and affection. Black and white, yellow, brown and red, from Detroit and its suburbs of every economic status, national origin and religious persuasion we join in this covenant. 
In those simple, poetic words, Focus: HOPE began a journey that has remained true to its original vision thirty years later. Focus: HOPE was founded in one of the Detroit's most economically depressed areas by the late Father William T. Cunningham and Executive Director Eleanor Josaitis in the aftermath of the 1967 Detroit riots. Focus: HOPE's efforts initially centered on healing along racial lines, but in time have evolved into something much greater. As Father Cunningham has said, `traditional societal cancers like racism are so interrelated with other socioeconomic challenges that we can't look at a problem without looking at (the) whole context.' 
In the 1970's, Focus: HOPE began its Food Prescription Program which continues to provide monthly supplemental food to low-income pregnant and postpartum mothers, infants and preschool children. The 1970s also saw Focus: HOPE take a leadership role in securing low-interest mortgage and automobile loans for African-Americans, designing a race relations training program for desegregated schools, and establishing Focus: HOPE's WALK for Justice, an annual march through Detroit to show interracial harmony. 
The 1980's was a time of radical evolution for Focus: HOPE. During this period, Focus: HOPE transformed itself into the nationally recognized center for education and training that it is today. It established FAST TRACK, a computer assisted course which improves the reading and math skills of high school graduates. FAST TRACK prepares students for entry into the Machinist Training Institute (MTI), which produces skilled machinists who are needed in local industry and are able to command good salaries. Focus: HOPE also established its Center for Children, a Montessori school which supports the children of Focus: HOPE's faculty, students and the surrounding neighborhood. Focus: HOPE also established the Food for Seniors program which provides monthly supplemental food to low-income senior citizens. In order to support all of Focus: HOPE's programs, several for-profit companies were established. 
The 1990's have seen Focus: HOPE continue to expand. In 1993, Focus: HOPE's Center for Advanced Technologies (CAT) was established to allow interested MTI students to continue their education. This internationally recognized program awards associate's and bachelor's degrees in manufacturing engineering. Focus: HOPE is looking to the future by planning the establishment of Tech Villas, a state of the art residential learning center linked to the CAT, fulfilling the goal of becoming a national demonstration center for advanced manufacturing and training. 
Over the years, I have had the great opportunity to be with President Clinton, Gen. Colin Powell, Secretary Ron Brown and many others on tours of Focus: HOPE. While each of these dignitaries has walked away impressed by the size and scope of Focus: HOPE's mission, they have been equally inspired by the spiritual nature of Focus: HOPE. Focus: HOPE has changed the lives of thousands of people throughout metropolitan Detroit by bringing to life the proverb `Give a person a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.' 
While the past thirty years have undoubtedly been a great success for Focus: HOPE, 1997 was a very trying time for all who care deeply about this community. On May 26, Father William Cunningham, founder and inspiration of Focus: HOPE, passed away after a spirited battle against cancer. On July 2, the Focus: HOPE campus and the surrounding neighborhood were struck by a tornado, causing great damage to Focus: HOPE buildings. Under the magnificent leadership of Eleanor Josaitis and the hard work of the entire staff, Focus: HOPE has rebuilt and rededicated itself to Father Cunningham's vision. This difficult year has brought the community closer together as they celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the `Miracle on Oakman Boulevard,' Focus: HOPE.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to an important organization in my home state of Michigan which is helping to improve teaching and learning through the use of educational technology. The Michigan Association for Computer-related technology Users in Learning (MACUL), is holding its 22nd Annual Conference on March 12-13, 1998. 
Over the past several months, I have met with teachers, administrators, businesspeople and foundation executives to discuss how we can help teachers gain the skills they need to use computers and computer-related technology as teaching and learning tools. In these discussions, I have been told time and again that when it comes to promoting and encouraging technology use in our schools, MACUL is one of the most critical assets in Michigan. MACUL has more than 8,000 active members who represent every facet of the education community, from K-12 teachers to school district administrators and college professors. Throughout its 22 years, MACUL has trained, inspired and informed thousands of people. 
MACUL uses many strategies to promote equitable technology planning, innovative uses of technology in the classroom and support services for Michigan educators. The most prominent of these is the MACUL Annual Conference, considered by many people to be the premier event of its kind in the United States. It draws more than 4,000 educators from Michigan, neighboring states and Canada to share their experiences, learn about innovative technology-related programs and to view exhibits of hardware, software and other educational technology. This year's conference promises to be a valuable forum for all who attend. 
Mr. President, educational technology is not a thing of the future, it is here today. MACUL is working to help educators put computers and computer-related technology to work in their classrooms, and by doing so is enhancing both teaching and learning. I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing MACUL for its tremendous efforts and for making a difference in the lives of Michigan's teachers and students.

Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I agree with our key distinguished majority leader that action needs to be taken on this bill. There are many of us who have sought to learn the details in the amendment which was filed by the floor managers. We just got that amendment yesterday. I believe it is a complicated amendment. The details, the analysis came in yesterday. 
Many of us of the donor State position, for instance, want very much to try to achieve greater fairness in this bill. We are not trying to hold up the bill. We are trying to offer amendments to this bill that make it fairer from the perspective of States that, over the decades, have provided so much more funding to the highway program than has been received back by those States. We want that opportunity to seek greater fairness. 
The managers have been talking to us about some possibilities that would be foreclosed by a cloture vote. Relevant amendments that are not technically germane would be 
foreclosed. This unanimous consent agreement only protects certain items postcloture that are relevant. Clearly, the two committee provisions which the majority leader talks about need to be considered as part of this bill, but so do other relevant provisions which are very important to States that feel they have not gotten a fair opportunity. So because it treats differently relevant amendments, postcloture and the relevant amendments that are so important to donor States, for instance, which are not technically germane are not treated in the same way in this unanimous consent agreement as are the ones that are specified, I must reluctantly object.

Mr. LEVIN. If the majority leader will yield, I want to assure him that the so-called `donor States'--at least, I think I speak for many of those Senators--have been very focused indeed for quite a long time on this issue. It just didn't arise after cloture was filed today. As the majority leader knows, we have worked very hard with the managers. Once we got the analysis of their amendment, we agreed that that amendment would be added as original text. The analysis came in less than 24 hours ago. 
I know all the States in the Union feel that they want to do better. We all want a bill. Everybody wants a bill. We are determined to get a bill. Those of us who live in northern States surely would like it before May 1 because we are the ones that a tardy approval of the bill will hurt in terms of getting contracts signed. I know all of my colleagues, whether we are donor States or donee States, will work with the managers to try to come up with something over the weekend if possible. 
I thank the majority leader.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join my colleagues from Michigan in offering an amendment which I understand the committee will accept. I thank the managers. 
The first amendment allows improvements and construction on the United States approaches to the Ambassador Bridge from Detroit to Windsor, Canada, to be eligible for federal funding. As my colleagues may know, the Detroit-Windsor border crossing sees one of the largest, if not largest, volumes of international trade in the world. As such, the corresponding volume of traffic is tremendous, particularly truck traffic. The amendment does not allocate funds to repair the years of wear and tear, simply allows currently publicly owned streets and facilities to compete for federal funding. This amendment is important to the city of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the country because of the significant volume of international trade moving across the bridge.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank our friends on the committee for their effort here. And we are trying to get information to help us decide exactly how we should respond to the committee amendment. That information was requested as soon as the amendment was adopted. We are still awaiting for that information. 
I think it is only fair to those States, States that have been particularly put in a donor position decade after decade after decade, which is the case with many of our States, that we get the 
information that we sought. We very well--I am speaking just for myself--we very well may end up supporting this amendment. But it would seem to me, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that when an amendment this complex and this important to our States is brought to the floor, that where information is sought from the Department of Transportation, that information be forthcoming before we are expected to vote on this amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friends from Montana and Virginia for their support in our effort to get this information and, indeed, for their long, hard efforts to try to bring a conclusion to this effort to come up with a fair highway bill. 
The problem is, as the Chair and others know, there are some States that have not been treated equitably and fairly, at least in our eyes, over the decades. 
First, the Senator from Texas correctly says we have a National Highway System. And that is true. I do not think it would be possible to build an interstate across Montana if Montana only got back the amount of money in gas tax for the building of that interstate that was sent to Washington by folks buying gas in Montana. I have no doubt of the truth of that comment. 
I have been to Montana. I have been on those interstates. I understand that. I appreciate that. Indeed, I would support that if this were coming up for funding in the 1950s. But that does not explain why a whole bunch of other States that are not in that situation get back a $1.20, $1.40, $1.60, $1.80, $2 for every dollar they send. 
We can explain some of this to our constituents. And I have. I get up and use Montana as the example. And I say, it is only right, if you are going to have an Interstate System, that more money go to build an interstate in Montana than is coming from Montana. That is the point the Senator from Texas made. 
But, again, let me emphasize, there are a whole bunch of States that that is not applicable to, who have for decades gotten back a heck of a lot more than they have sent into this system and put into that trust fund. And those of us that have been in a donor position for decades, because of these formulas which were put in here many years ago, cannot possibly justify the huge amounts which many donee States have received which do not relate to the fact that they are sparsely populated and have large distances to cross. 
And while my friend from Texas may be correct in the case of some States falling into the donor or donee situation, depending upon what year you may be looking at, there are other States which have been in the donor situation constantly throughout where you cannot justify this. And there has been some effort in this bill to correct the unfairness. And I want to thank my friends from Rhode Island, Montana, Virginia, and to others, Texas, who 
participated in this effort to get a little more fairness for the so-called donor States. I want to thank them for that effort. 
Does it come close to repairing the unfairness? I do not know. And we are not going to know until we get this data. There are a lot of complications in these formulas. My dear friend from Virginia is right, you get all kinds of charts coming in. I mean, one chart which we already have shows that two-thirds of the States actually get a smaller percentage under the committee amendment than they did under the underlying bill. 
If that is true--and some of those being donor States--if that is true, how do donor States then get a guarantee of 91 cents back instead of 90 cents, if some of those two-thirds of the States that get a smaller percentage under the committee amendment are donor States? 
My State gets a smaller percentage under the committee amendment than it does under the underlying bill. You can add all the money you want, which is what the committee did, but the problem still is going to remain in terms of the percentage of the contribution unless something else happens here. We should be in a worse percentage situation under the committee amendment than we were under the underlying bill. But that is what we want to look at in terms of charts. 
I have questions about the density group. How is that defined? I have highly dense, congestive places in the State of Michigan, but I am not one of those 10 States. How is it defined? And why? And why is it that 10 States all get the same amount of money for density no matter where they may fall on some density chart? No matter where they fall, they all get the same amount of money year after year, but States that do not quite reach the level of density get nothing. I would like to at least know why and how, how that is arrived at. 
I have a number of questions which I would like to have answered. Are those special categories--for instance, density. When you get a density bonus or a density amount in this bill, does that count in terms of the donor State guarantee of 91 percent? Does that count towards that? We do not know. Perhaps some of the sponsors of the amendment could answer that question. 
And to my friend from Texas, my understanding is it is not 91 cents back on the dollar; it is 91 percent of contribution. And that, as a matter of fact, is not 91 percent of your contributions, because there is something taken off the top here. So it is 91 percent of the contributions of the amount which is distributed to the States which is less than 100 percent. 
I wish it were 91 cents on the dollar, I tell my good friend from Texas. I wish it were that every buck we are going to send to Washington, from here on in, we are assured we are going to get 91 cents back. That is not my understanding of what this bill does. 
So I think here that there is an underlying feeling on the part of many States two things: One, that we need a fairer treatment; and, two, that we want to see some data. And, three, speaking now for myself, when we receive that data, it may answer a whole lot of these questions so that indeed someone like me may end up voting for an amendment such as this, as being an improvement over the status quo. 
Now, there is another problem which none of us are going to solve here. And that is that there are offsets for this increase. And we do not know where those offsets are coming from. Because the budget is going to be adopted after we adopt this bill. And the Budget Committee is going to have to find, as I understand it for this upcoming year, $1 billion-plus. We do not know where that $1 billion-plus is coming from. 
Now, we are all in that boat. But it is a problem that we all ought to be concerned about. Is that $1 billion going to come from education? Is that $1 billion coming from veterans? It is going to come from domestic discretionary spending. And even those who vote for this amendment, it seems to me, have to be concerned with what lies down the road in terms of paying for this committee add-on. 
Again, that is nothing which data from the highway department is going to be able to answer. That is something which we are going to have to fight out or debate in the weeks and months ahead. But it is a real concern. It is an unanswered question. In this case it is a question which cannot be answered prior to the time when we will be voting on this amendment. But, nonetheless, it should be raised as a flag, I think, for all of us. Even those of us who intensely support this amendment, it seems to me, would have some concern about, how are we going to pay for the offset, to pay for the amount of money which has been added?

Mr. LEVIN. As I said, that is a concern that I hope all of us have regardless of how we end up voting on this amendment 
as to how that money is going to be paid for, how that offset is going to be achieved. 
Second is something I am very much concerned about. We keep hearing thoughts, rumors as to where this is coming from, but that will not be resolvable. I do believe the good chairman of the Budget Committee has indicated there will be no undue impact on any domestic discretionary program as a result, but I haven't seen those exact words--I have heard that secondhand--that the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has said something like no undue impact on any discretionary program. But I'm not going to quote him because I didn't actually see the quote itself. 
So what it comes down to is that we have an amendment that is pending. We have a request for information relative to a complicated amendment, made yesterday to the highway department. We don't have that information. 
If the managers of the bill and the sponsors of this amendment are willing to get that information forthcoming before our vote, it seems to me we either ought to have a quorum, as I understand they are on their way, or we ought to set aside this amendment for an hour or two so those of us who are not decided on how to vote on this amendment could be in a position where we could vote on it.

Mr. LEVIN. That is not correct. The Senator is not correct. I said about two-thirds of the States get a smaller percentage under the amendment than they do under the underlying bill. I will give the Senator some examples and have them printed in the Record. 
I believe this chart comes from the Federal Highway Administration. I think every State gets more money because there is a significant amount of money that is added to the pot. My statement is that about 38 States get a smaller percentage of a larger pot than they did.

Mr. LEVIN. If you look at the right-hand column, at the minuses, looking at the 6-year percentages with the so-called `option,' which is the committee amendment, 38 of the States have a little minus in front of them, meaning they usually get a slightly smaller percentage of the larger pot, which is represented by the amount of money totally there after the committee amendment is adopted. That is the reference I made. 
Every State gets more money and every State--to put it very bluntly, say that Michigan contributes an additional $110 million to the highway fund in this larger pot. That $110 million of the delta, the extra money going into this pot, to enlarge it, comes from Michigan, and we get back $100 million. These are hypothetical numbers. That means we are getting back more money, right? But we have put in, actually, a larger share of money towards the amount that is going out. 
My good friend from Texas, I am sure, would agree it is about 
time that the money that goes to the highway fund is distributed to the States. It is long overdue. We shouldn't be having surpluses built up from gas tax dollars which our people pay in order to build and maintain highways. That is long overdue. 
My point here, however, is that of the extra amount of that $26 billion that the committee adds, say Michigan's share of that $26 billion is $110 million--I am making up numbers here--and if we get back from that extra amount $100 million, the answer is, yes, we are getting back more than we did under the underlying bill, but it still could be a smaller percentage of the total than we would have gotten under the underlying bill.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
First, let me assure my good friend from Texas that I agree with most of what he said, including the reference to Senator Byrd, as not only a red letter day for West Virginia when Senator Byrd came to the Senate, but it was a red letter day for the Nation and for the Senate when Senator Byrd came to the Senate. And his effort on behalf of the Appalachian Regional Commission is one that I think is a justified effort. 
This is a national bill. I happen to agree with that. The Senator from Texas made reference to the fact that this is a national bill. This is also a complicated amendment. Those of us who have been in the donor status for decades want to understand. There are other Senators who would like to get the data that hopefully now the Transportation Department is providing us. But for those of us who have given tens of millions, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, as donor States, based on formulas which cannot be justified in our eyes, we surely want to understand what these new formulas provide, and why. 
I asked a question about the new density program. It is a new program. This is not one that has been in the law for some time like the ARC or the public lands. This is a new program based on density. How are those rules divided? For those of us who have dense areas in our States, why is it that we are not on the list while some others States are on the list? It may be a very good formula. It may be a fair formula, taken in context. But it is a new formula and one I surely want to understand since we have some dense areas in my State. 
We have asked for some information. I think it is only fair that we get this information. It is going to affect how at least some of us may vote on this amendment. Speaking for myself, it is going to affect how I vote on this amendment. In some sense, we are better off. There is a 91 percent assurance, we are told, that is built into the law. That is an improvement over the past. 
However, there are some disadvantages to the approach as well. One of the disadvantages is that we now are creating a very large uncertainty as to how these added funds are going to be paid for with other programs. We cannot solve that here. But we all have to understand that we are taking that risk. For those of us who are still in a significant donor position, even though it has improved over the last ISTEA, we have to weigh the risk of losing important discretionary programs against the improvements that we seek. 
My good friend from Texas talked about throwing a lifeline to somebody who is drowning. Is this a 10-foot lifeline to somebody who is drowning 20 feet offshore? That is the question we have to analyze. Does someone in the position of representing a donor State vote for this because it is an improvement, with all the risks that are there? Or do we vote no on this because it still embodies for 6 more years an unfairness that we perceive? 
All I am urging upon my colleagues is this: that surely fairness dictates, if not the outcome of formulas, we be given information upon which we wish to rely in voting on an amendment in a bill. As I said, I may vote for this amendment, I may vote for the bill, but we want information to help us make that judgment. For those of us who have been in a donor State position for decades, it seems to me that this is a fair thing for us to ask and a fair thing for us to expect. 
I have no need to talk longer on this. I do have a need to get the information which will permit me to make that assessment, which I have referred to. 
I will suggest the absence of a quorum, unless there is somebody else who wishes to speak, in order that we can now visit with the transportation people and obtain that information that we have been waiting for. 
Mr. President, unless there is somebody else who wishes to address the body at this point, I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I want to take a few moments to speak about the important developments that have taken place over the last several days relating to Iraq. 
On Monday afternoon I met for about an hour with Unscom Executive Chairman Richard Butler. Yesterday, General Tony Zinni, the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Central Command, who would lead any strike that the United States might carry out against Iraq, testified before the Armed Services Committee. I believe that the remarks of Chairman Butler and the testimony of General Zinni would be of interest to my colleagues and to the American people. 
I met with Chairman Butler in his office at United Nations Headquarters in New York. Senator Warner and I had traveled to the Persian Gulf region with Secretary of Defense William Cohen, at the Secretary's invitation, last month and, while Senator Warner was unable to travel to New York on Monday, a member of his staff, Judy Ansley, was able to attend my meeting with Chairman Butler. 
During the course of this meeting, we covered a host of issues concerning Unscom inspections relating to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. I will not attempt to cover all those issues today but I did want to recap some of the major points that he made. 
One of the most important points that Chairman Butler made was that people should not get bogged down in debating the detailed procedures that are being worked out at UN headquarters for Unscom to inspect the so-called presidential sites. Instead, the international community should focus on Iraq's clear commitment in the Memorandum of Understanding to finally implement the UN Security Council resolutions to give Unscom and the IAEA immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any site in Iraq. 
Chairman Butler noted a fundamental historic reality that from day 1 Iraq has sought to limit, mitigate, reduce and, in some cases, defeat the law (i.e. UN Security Council's resolutions) by a variety of devices. 
I want to just spend one more moment to restate that point. The details are obviously important. But the more you focus on the details that need to be worked out, the more that let's Saddam Hussein off the hook. And the hook here, which he is on and must be kept on, is his commitment and the U.N. resolution requiring that UNSCOM and the IAEA be given immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any sites in Iraq. 
That is the goal. That is the commitment. That is the requirement. That is what Iraq is bound by. That is undisputed. 
While, again, details are important, we should not be focusing on the details because the more we do the more Saddam Hussein is going to say, `Oh, all those are details subject to negotiation.' We don't want this to get bogged down in negotiations over details. We want to hold Saddam Hussein's feet to the fire. And the fire here is an unqualified commitment to immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any site in Iraq, including the Presidential sites. 
Saddam is the one who is going to try to raise and create ambiguity. 
Again, while, of course, there are details to be worked out, we should be the ones who are focusing on the clear, unambiguous requirement to open these sites to access. 
Chairman Butler confirmed that after Unscom became aware, despite earlier denials, that Iraq had possessed 2,100 gallons of anthrax and 3.9 tons of VX, Iraq claimed that it had destroyed those substances. He noted first of all, that was a violation of the UN resolutions, since destruction of such substances is to be carried out by Unscom, and second, that Unscom was unable to verify that Iraq had destroyed them. 
Chairman Butler made the point that since 1995, Unscom had found important indicators of weapons of mass destruction programs that Iraq has sought to conceal and about which they have lied to Unscom. He noted, moreover, that Unscom has evidence of a connection of significant biological substances to Iraq's special security organization, thus demonstrating that Saddam Hussein uses the same apparatus to seek or manufacture weapons of mass destruction that he uses to keep himself in power. 
Chairman Butler stated that Unscom only goes looking for things in two circumstances: one, when they have evidence that supports a search, such as documentation of the possession of growth media which could be used for biological weapons; and two, when Iraq lies to Unscom. In the latter case, a broad forensic investigation has to be undertaken. He was quick to add that just because a specific inspection doesn't `hit pay dirt,' doesn't mean that the search is over, particularly in view of Iraq's track record of lies and deception. 
Chairman Butler described the Memorandum of Understanding that UN Secretary General Kofi Annan negotiated with Iraq as a `high-level political commitment' that he `hopes to heavens the Iraqis observe.' He noted that he has talked to the Secretary General and has received the clarification that when a site, presidential or not, is inspected by Unscom, it will be his 
decision as to when and where the inspection takes place, how it is inspected, and who the members of the professional, technical part of the team are who will actually carry out the inspection. He also said that those decisions will be made by the Director General of IAEA with respect to nuclear matters. He added that this is consistent with the Secretary General's intention, that the details were being formalized within the United Nations, and that he would let me know if there were any changes to those details. 
Chairman Butler added that the diplomats who will accompany Unscom inspectors as observers to the eight presidential sites will be there to ensure not only that the Unscom inspectors comport themselves with dignity, but also that the Iraqis behave properly as well. 
Finally, Chairman Butler noted with concern that there has been a three and one-half month hiatus in some of Unscom's work in Iraq, but that he is very pleased that this agreement was worked out that should permit Unscom to resume the full spectrum of its activities and that they will shortly test the agreement. 
Madam President, Senator Warner and I have written to the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader urging them to invite Chairman Butler to come to Washington to meet with all Senators. Senator Warner and I certainly hope that an invitation will be extended and that Mr. Butler would respond favorably to such an invitation, as we believe that all Senators should have an opportunity to hear directly from this dedicated international public servant. 
Madam President, during his appearance before the Armed Services Committee, General Zinni testified that our friends in the Persian Gulf region congratulated the United States when Secretary General Kofi Annan negotiated the MOU with Iraq and they felt it was a victory for United States strength and resolve. He added, in response to my question, that he shared that view. He also testified that he agreed with Chairman Butler that the negotiation of the MOU leaves us in a better position to obtain Iraqi compliance with Security Council resolutions. 
I commend all of General Zinni's testimony to our colleagues. 
I again thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with many of the people from Saginaw, Michigan, as they recognize and honor Reverend Roosevelt Austin with the Coleman Temple Christian Board of Education `Living Legend' award. 
Each year, an individual is selected to receive this honor based on outstanding community service, achievement in the public and/or private sector, and commitment to the cause of political, social and economic advancement for African Americans. Reverend Austin certainly meets the criteria for this award. Recognized as one of the most influential leaders in the city of Saginaw, he is the pastor of Zion Missionary Baptist Church. 
Reverend Austin was ordained nearly 35 years ago, and since then he has truly made a difference in the lives of thousands of people. This is evidenced by the honors he has received from civic groups throughout the years, from the Citizen of Saginaw Award bestowed upon him by the city of Saginaw, to the Whitney M. Young Award, given to him by the Boy Scouts of America. He serves on the boards of numerous organizations in his community, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Commission on Quality Education for all Children, and Second National Bank of Saginaw. 
Members of Zion Missionary Baptist Church would say that the most important role Reverend Austin plays is that of a spiritual leader. Indeed, from his work in the Saginaw County Jail to the lives he touches each day in his own congregation, Reverend Austin is deeply devoted to his ministry and to the spiritual well-being of so many people in Saginaw. 
Mr. President, throughout his career, Reverend Roosevelt Austin has truly exemplified the ideals which are the foundation for the Coleman Temple Christian Board of Education `Living Legend' award. I know my colleagues will join me in recognizing Reverend Austin for his commitment to his community and to equality and justice for all people.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today is the 100th birthday of a very distinguished citizen of Michigan. 
Benjamin Halpern was born in Poland 100 years ago today. His story, in one sense, is the story of many immigrants who came to this land seeking safety and freedom and opportunity. 
He and his wife, Esther, worked hard, raised a wonderful family, and contributed to the strength of the country which gave him so much, including utilizing his amazing language skills to help immigrants to adjust and adapt and become productive citizens, and supporting a number of charitable and community organizations. 
Many of his and Esther's family were destroyed in the Holocaust. But they and part of their families did more than survive: they persevered, and in the process, helped preserve values of family and community which so characterize the ancient Jewish people of which they are so proudly a part. Along the way, his sense of humor has brought cheer to multitudes. 
This wonderful man happens to be my wife Barbara's father, and three of his loving grandchildren are our daughters Kate, Laura and Erica. 
They and Barbara's brothers, Irving and Daniel, and many other family members and a host of friends will be soon gathering together to say Mazel Tov to Ben as he heads toward the next millennium, when he will be well into his second century and the third century that he will have touched.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, let me commend the Senators from Maine and Vermont for their leadership. This amendment will strengthen the chances of this bill passing and, indeed, in many ways strengthen the bill itself. I lost track of the number of times this body has debated a need for campaign finance reform and was presented with reasonable bipartisan efforts and, yet, failed to get the job done. This is an issue which will not go away, and it is an issue which should not go away. 
Soft money contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars, indeed, of millions of dollars, have made the contribution limits in Federal election laws meaningless. Both the Republican and Democratic National Committees, national parties, solicited and spent soft money and used it to develop so-called `issue ads' which are clearly designed to support or defeat specific candidates. These soft money and issue ad loopholes are used to transfer millions of dollars to outside organizations to conduct allegedly independent election-related activities that are, in fact, benefiting parties and candidates. These soft money and issue ad loopholes are used by tax-exempt organizations to spend millions of dollars from unknown sources on candidate attack ads to influence election outcomes. 
The reality of our campaign finance system simply cannot be avoided. Soft money has blown the lid off contribution limits in our campaign finance system. Soft money is the 800-pound gorilla sitting right in the middle of this debate. 
Just look at Roger Tamraz, a contributor to both political parties. He is a bipartisan symbol of what is wrong with this system. He served as a Republican Eagle in the 1980s during the Republican administrations, and a Democratic Managing Trustee in the 1990s during Democratic administrations. Tamraz was unabashed in admitting that his political contributions were made for the purpose of buying access to candidates and officeholders, and he showed us in stark terms the all too common product of the current campaign finance system--using soft money to buy access. 
Despite condemnation by the committee and the media of Tamraz' activities, when he was asked at the hearing to reflect upon his $300,000 contribution in 1996, Tamraz said, `I think next time I will give $600,000.' 
Now he was taunting us. He was flaunting the fact that he had given $300,000, indicating that it's perfectly legal and you folks like it that way or else you would change it. That's what Tamraz told us. And the truth of the matter is, he was right. It is a sad truth. We can change it if we want to change it. And the next time he will give $600,000 or $1 million to do the same thing, to buy access to candidates and to officeholders. 
Most of the 1996 excesses involved activities that were legal, and they all centered around that 800-pound gorilla, soft money. Virtually all the foreign contributions that concerned the committee that just held hearings involved soft money. Virtually every offer of access to the White House or the Capitol or the President or to Members of the Senate or the House involved contributions of soft money. Virtually every instance of questionable conduct in the committee's investigation involved the solicitation or use of soft money. 
The opponents want to pretend this monster doesn't exist, but it is sitting right in the middle of this debate. It is not going to be removed until we address it. 
The bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill would do an awful lot to repair this system. It is not a new bill. It has been before this body for years now and it has received sustained scrutiny from Members on both sides of the aisle. 
The truth is that the soft money loophole exists as long as we in Congress allow it to exist. The issue advocacy loophole exists because we in Congress allow it to exist. Tax-exempt organizations spend millions televising candidate attack ads days before an election without disclosing who they are or where they got their funds, because we in Congress allow it. 
It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility for our share of the blame for this system. We alone write the laws. Congress alone can shut down the loopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election laws. 
When the Federal Election Campaign Act was first enacted 20 years ago in response to the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted a comprehensive system of laws including contribution limits and full disclosure of all campaign contributions. The requirements are still on the books, at least in form. Individuals are not supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate per election. Corporations and unions are barred from contributing to any candidate without going through a political action committee. Campaign contributions and expenditures have to be disclosed. 
At the time that these laws were enacted, many people fought against those laws, claiming that they were an unconstitutional restriction on first amendment rights to free speech and free association. And the law's opponents, including the ACLU, took their case to the Supreme Court. 
The ACLU is sometimes right and the ACLU is sometimes wrong, but they are always eloquent. And the reason they are always eloquent is that the first amendment is eloquent. But so are clean elections an eloquent idea. So are elections which are free and clean and democratic an eloquent idea. 
So the Supreme Court, in Buckley, had to weigh the ACLU opposition to the campaign contribution limits against the need for elections which were free and clean, both of corruption and the appearance of corruption--both. And the ACLU lost that issue in Buckley. 
It is frequently forgotten around here that there was an attack on the campaign contribution limits, which are now the law, that attack was led by the ACLU in the Buckley case, and the ACLU lost. The Supreme Court in Buckley upheld contribution limits and disclosure limits. It upheld them despite the eloquence of the ACLU in opposition to those limits in Buckley. 
Now, this is what the Supreme Court said in Buckley:  
It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions--in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. . . . To the extent that large contributions are given to secure political quid pro quo's from current potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. 
And then the Supreme Court said the following in Buckley: 
Of almost equal concern is . . . the impact of the appearance of corruption, stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. 
And the Court went on: 
Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent. 
So the Supreme Court weighed the free speech arguments of the opponents of campaign contribution limits and weighed that against the argument about the need to have elections which are free and clean, and to avoid the appearance of corruption. And they decided in Buckley that we, Congress, `could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is critical if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.' 
The same Court upheld tough disclosure requirements, effectively prohibiting anonymous or secret contributions to candidates and parties, despite arguments in Buckley that disclosure collides with first amendment rights of free speech and free association. The Court in Buckley said the following: 
Compelled disclosure has the potential for substantially infringing on the exercise of first amendment rights. But we have acknowledged that there are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement, particularly when the free functioning of our national institutions is involved. The governmental interests sought to be vindicated by the disclosure requirements are of this magnitude. 
So, despite the arguments of opponents of contribution limits and opponents of disclosure who base their arguments on first amendment concerns, the Supreme Court in Buckley said you can limit contributions and you can require disclosure because the governmental interests sought to be vindicated, the free functioning of our national institutions, is involved. And Congress can consider that. They used a balancing test, and that is the test that they would use when we pass McCain-Feingold. 
Now, relative to the question of the so-called magic words test on issue ads, it is true that two circuits have said that the Supreme Court has ruled that only if certain magic words are present can you then limit those ads to being paid for by regulated contributions. But another circuit, the ninth circuit, in the Furgatch case, has held that this list of magic words referred to so frequently here `does not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.' 
And of equal importance to the fact that the circuits are divided on the question of what constitutes issue advocacy and what constitutes candidate advocacy is the fact that the Federal Election Commission just recently, on a bipartisan basis, reaffirmed its commitment to a broader test that goes beyond the magic words test to unmask ads that use the guise of issue ads to advocate the election or defeat of a Federal candidate. 
The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on whether the FEC regulation is constitutional. But when you have at least one circuit and the FEC saying that you can have a broader test than the ones that have been adopted in the other circuits, there is a division of authority here which means that at least there is a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will affirm the FEC regulation. 
I wonder how much time I have remaining?

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
Relative to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, this amendment strikes an acceptable balance between the need to protect the integrity of our electoral process and the need to protect the rights to free speech. It would address issue ad abuse by creating a new category of electioneering ads, defined as ads that refer to a clearly identified candidate up for election and which are broadcast on the regulated media of television or radio close in time before an election. 
Now, why radio and television? The answer is that the Supreme Court itself has held that, due to the fact that these media, radio and television, are regulated, are licensed, and that the spectrum is limited, you can regulate these media in ways in which you cannot regulate newspapers or the printed word. The Supreme Court has ruled that there is a difference between Government regulating licensed media and unlicensed media, and where Government issues a license--gives out a license of great value for public media--it can indeed regulate the media in a reasonable way, ways it can't possibly even think of regulating newspapers or other print media, which are not regulated media. 
Indeed, the FCC has regulations on what can be said on radio and television. There are rules against obscenity on radio and television. There are rules about the numbers of commercials and the types of commercials on children's television. There are all kinds of rules for the regulated media of television and radio which do not exist relative to newspapers. So, it is not an uncommon distinction. It is a distinction which has been affirmed by the Supreme Court and it is not the effectiveness which is so much the issue, it is the fact that they are regulated, licensed media which, in my judgment at least, represents a significant difference. 
The Snowe-Jeffords amendment would impose a limited set of contribution limits and disclosure requirements on commercials on these licensed media. No corporate or union funds could be used to pay for them. Donors who provide more than $500 would have to be disclosed. These limits are well within the bounds of the contribution limits and disclosure requirements which have been upheld in Buckley as a constitutional means for protecting the integrity of our electoral process. 
Madam President, this is not the first time that loopholes have eroded the effectiveness of a set of laws. This happens all the time. The election laws are just the latest example. We saw that true with lobbying disclosure. We saw that true with gift bans. You adopt a set of rules and then people who want to try to evade those rules or push the envelope find loopholes. And then Congress has a responsibility to come along to try to close these loopholes in order to carry out the original intent of the statute. 
The question is whether or not we are going to do this now with the campaign contribution laws. We passed a law saying there is a $1,000 contribution limit to a campaign and now there is really no limit on how much you can contribute. All you have to do is give your millions to a party and have the party, then, spend the money on ads which are indistinguishable from ads attacking or supporting candidates. These ads are indistinguishable. You can put up two ads next to each other, ask any reasonable person, `Do you see the difference between this candidate support ad and this issue ad?' and people will look at those ads and say, `There is no difference at all.' 
We saw that in committee hearings, which the Presiding Officer and I and others participated in, in the Thompson committee, where we put up side by side a so-called candidate ad and an issue ad, with three words difference, one of which had to be paid for with limited funds and the other one which could be paid for with soft money or unregulated funds, and we had expert witnesses, including two former Members of this body, Senator Kassebaum and Vice President Mondale, who could see no distinction in those ads. And there is none. 
So we now have a farce. We have a sham. The campaign contribution limits, for all intents and purposes, do not exist. There is no $1,000 limit on giving money to a candidate. Just give $1 million to the candidate's party, have that party put a so-called issue ad on in that candidate's election, and it is indistinguishable from the so-called candidate support ad which has to be paid for with regulated funds. 
The question is whether we are going to do anything about it. The time for shedding crocodile tears about the 1996 campaign funding raising is over. We ought to wipe away these tears from our eyes and see clearly what the American people see. 
Over 80 percent of them, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll, believe the campaign fundraising system needs to be reformed; 78 percent of the American people think we ought to limit the role of soft money. A majority of this body wants to limit it. We saw that in the vote yesterday. 
The question now is whether or not the majority will of this body and the majority will of the American people are going to be carried out, and that is where we are. 
I hope that the chief sponsors--I am one of them, but I hope that the key named sponsors of this amendment will stick to their position and will insist that we finally be able to have an up-or-down vote on the enactment of McCain-Feingold. 
Last year, the Senate took up the issue of campaign finance reform, but never got past superficial gamesmanship. 
The misnamed Paycheck Protection Act, as their version of campaign finance reform, was offered last year to the McCain-Feingold as a killer amendment that singled out unions in an effort to punish them for their participation in the 1996 elections, perhaps even for the last victory won on the minimum wage. The amendment was not even limited to campaigns--it sought to defund unions and stop them from spending money on any political activity, including for example lobbying the Senate to enact another minimum wage increase. The purpose of the amendment wasn't to change the law, but to kill the bill--and that's what it did. 
This year, the same legislation was offered by the Republican leadership as their version of campaign finance reform. It is a killer bill--not intended for enactment but to kill campaign finance reform. 
A way around that killer legislation has been found by Senator Snowe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Feingold, Senator McCain, myself and others working on a bipartisan basis. Hopefully, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment will prevent campaign finance reform from being derailed again. 
Campaign finance reform is an issue that could convert a dedicated optimist into a doomsayer. But it is not doomsday yet. We have a bipartisan bill that provides the key reforms. We have a bipartisan coalition willing to defeat last year's killer amendment. We have an election around the corner in which our constituents can let opponents of reform know what they think of their opposition. 
So let's turn off the crocodile tears about the 1996 elections. Let's stop complaining about weak enforcement of the election laws, when the wording of those laws makes them virtually unenforceable. Let's stop feigning shock at the law's loopholes, while allowing them to continue. It is time to enact campaign finance reform. That is our legislative responsibility and our civic responsibility. 
Madam President, I would like to ask my friend from Maine about one of the changes that her amendment would make to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation, to make it clear for the record the reason for that change.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, proposes removing from the McCain-Feingold legislation all of Section 201, a section which would have codified several legal tests for determining when an expenditure expressly advocates the election or defeat of a candidate. The reason for striking those provisions is not because you or any of the other cosponsors of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment do not want to stop candidate attack ads that pretend to be issue ads, but because you are willing to leave that battle for the courts, is that right?

Mr. LEVIN. The courts have divided on whether the Buckley test, which includes providing so-called `magic words' which make an ad subject to the federal election laws, is the only way to determine when an ad is covered, or whether, as the Ninth Circuit decided in the Furgatch case, the Buckley magic words do not `exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.' Just a week or so ago, the Federal Election Commission reaffirmed its commitment to a broader test--one that goes beyond the magic words. I urged FEC to take that position, and I think it's the right one to take. Am I correct that it is not the Senator's intention or the intention of any of the cosponsors of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment to send a message critical of the FEC's position?

Mr. LEVIN. McCain-Feingold takes direct aim at closing the loopholes that swallowed up the election laws. In particular, it takes aim at closing the soft money loophole which is the 800-pound gorilla in this debate. 
As much as some want to point the finger of blame at those who took advantage of the campaign finance laws during the last election, there is no one to blame but ourselves for the sorry state of the law. The soft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it to exist. The issue advocacy loophole exists because we in Congress allow it to exist. Tax-exempt organizations spend millions televising candidate attack ads before an election without disclosing who they are or where they got their funds because we in Congress allow it. 
It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility for our share of the blame. We alone write the laws. We alone can shut down the loopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election laws. 
When we enacted the Federal Election Campaign Act 20 years ago in response to campaign abuses in connection with the Watergate scandal, we had a comprehensive set of limits on campaign contributions. Individuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate per election or $20,000 to a political party. Corporations and unions are barred from contributing to any candidate without going through a political action committee. 
At the time that they were enacted, many people fought against those laws, claiming that those laws--the $1,000, the $2,000 restrictions and the other ones--were an unconstitutional restriction of the first amendment rights to free speech and free association. The people who opposed the current limits on laws which are supposed to be there but which have been evaded through the loopholes, the people who opposed the law's limits, took their case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in Buckley that the campaign contribution limits were constitutional. I repeat that, because there has been a lot of talk on the floor about limits on campaign contributions being violations of free speech. The Supreme Court in Buckley specifically held that limits on campaign contributions were constitutional. 
It is unnecessary to look beyond the act's primary purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual, financial contributions--in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign . . . To the extent that large contributions are given to security political quid pro quo's from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined . . . Of almost equal concern is . . . the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. . . 
That is the Supreme Court speaking on limiting contributions and saying that Congress has a right to stem the appearance of corruption which results from the opportunities for abuse which are inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. 
Then the court said: 
Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence `is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.' 
Now the question is, what are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about the unlimited money? Now the test is us. It is time to quit shedding the crocodile tears, quit pointing the fingers. It is time for us to act. It is our responsibility legislatively and it is a civic responsibility. 
I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership, along with Senator McCain.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to express my support for President Clinton, in consultation with Congress and consistent with the United States Constitution and laws, taking necessary and appropriate actions to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs. 
I am presently in Moscow accompanying Secretary of Defense William Cohen on a trip that has taken us to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain. 
I believe that it would be useful to briefly review some of the historical record relating to Iraq's compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions leading up to the present crisis. 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 660 of August 2, 1990, condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanded that it withdraw its forces from Kuwait. The Security Council's Resolution 678 of November 29, 1990, affirmed by Resolution 687 of April 3, 1991, authorized the use of all necessary means to restore international peace and security. During this period and up to the actual use of force by the United States-led coalition, there were a series of diplomatic efforts to convince the government of Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. But Saddam Hussein didn't get it. 
Following the Gulf War, the Security Council continued the economic and weapons sanctions on Iraq that were imposed after it invaded Kuwait. The Security Council conditioned the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq's accepting the destruction, removal or rendering harmless, under international supervision, of its nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs and all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers. Despite the crippling international economic sanctions that have been imposed on his country by the international community, Saddam Hussein still didn't get it. 
In recognition of the need to reduce the harm to the Iraqi people that were caused by Saddam Hussein's misadventures, the Security Council on August 15, 1991, in Resolution 706, authorized the sale of Iraqi oil for the dual purpose of the payment of claims against Iraq and for the purchase of foodstuffs, medicines, materials and supplies for essential civilian humanitarian needs. That authorization was made subject to the Security Council's approval of a plan for such sales and for international monitoring and supervision to assure their equitable distribution in all regions of Iraq and to all categories of the Iraqi civilian population. But Saddam Hussein rejected the plan. It wasn't until a Memorandum of Understanding on the plan was signed by Iraq and the United Nations on May 20, 1996, and after several additional months of contentious negotiations on implementation details, that Iraq finally began pumping oil on December 10, 1996. That was more than 5 years after the Security Council authorized such action. Saddam Hussein still didn't get it. 
There were several major confrontations between Iraq and the international community over access for United Nations Special Commission on Iraq or UNSCOM inspectors between May 1991 and June 1993. That pattern of confrontation was repeated on numerous occasions from March 1996 to October 1997. Since that time, the situation worsened until Iraq agreed that UNSCOM could return to Iraq unconditionally. Although UNSCOM inspections resumed on November 21, 1997, access was denied to presidential palaces and many other sites, and in mid-January 1998, an inspection team headed by an American was blocked. By the way, there are many dozens of these palaces. Some have grounds as large as Washington D.C. They are suspect weapons of mass destruction sites as long as access is denied. 
And so we have reached the present moment in time in which Iraq is blocking the UNSCOM inspectors from performing their mission on behalf of the international community. Saddam Hussein still doesn't get it. 
Mr. President, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan stated it well at a press conference on February 2 when he said:  
I think no one in the Council is pushing for the use of force in the first instance. All those who are talking about it are looking at it as a last resort. We hope that President Saddam Hussein, for the sake of the Iraqi people, who have suffered so much, will listen to the messages that are being taken to him by these senior envoys from Russia, from France, from people in the region, leaders in the region and elsewhere, and really avoid taking his people through another confrontation. They don't need it; the region doesn't need it; and the world certainly can do without it. And so, hopefully, the leadership will have the courage, the wisdom and the concern for its own people to take us back from the brink. 
Mr. President, this crisis is due entirely to the actions of Saddam Hussein. He alone is responsible. We all wish that diplomacy will cause him to back down but history does not give me cause for optimism that Saddam Hussein will finally get it. 
Mr. President, Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs and the means to deliver them are a menace to international peace and security. They pose a threat to Iraq's neighbors, to U.S. forces in the Gulf region, to the world's energy supplies, and to the integrity and credibility of the United Nations Security Council. 
Mr. President, as I noted earlier, I have visited a number of countries in the Middle East with Secretary Cohen. In each country, we have met with the head of state. We've had a series of very positive meetings in every country. We're very confident that the support that is needed and has been requested from these countries would be forthcoming if diplomatic efforts fail to get Saddam Hussein to comply and if there is a military strike. They all say, in various ways, basically the same thing--he must comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions and, if he fails to comply and if there is military action, the responsibility is his and his alone since he has the key to a peaceful solution, which is compliance with the U.N. resolutions. And we are assured privately that we will have their support if diplomatic efforts fail and if military action is necessary.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will not support the legislation to rename the Washington National Airport. This is not legislation to name an unnamed airport or a new airport. Washington National Airport already has an appropriate name and has had that name since it opened in 1941. 
We should have a normal and systematic process for the naming of buildings, bridges, monuments, airports and other public facilities. The names of these landmarks should not bounce around from name to name in response to current events. Such decisions should be made in a non-political and careful manner weighing the many factors which come into play, including the concerns of local governments and authorities. 
There are many past Presidents, admired by millions of Americans, and others around the world, including Harry S Truman who have no monument in Washington, D.C. 
We have already, quite appropriately, recognized the accomplishments of President Ronald Reagan in several appropriate ways, including the new federal Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center at Federal Triangle (which is the largest building in D.C.) and the Navy's newest Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. 
The Washington Post, in an editorial this past Saturday titled `Don't Rename Washington National' stated, `It is a bad proposal on many counts, all of them going well beyond any public wishes to honor the former president.' 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post editorial be printed in its entirety immediately following my statement.

I hope that a number of these persons and groups will support the substitute. 
This dialogue began with the Committee's hearing on the bill on September 12th and continued through the end of January. The substitute does not make any radical changes to the bill as introduced, but it does clarify a number of important issues and lay to rest areas of possible uncertainty.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased to be introducing companion legislation to a bill prepared by Congresswoman Debbie Stabenow entitled the Safe Food Action Plan Act. 
The bill adds food safety as a new statutory priority in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research, education and extension programs. This should mean that more of the nearly $1.5 billion spent through existing grant and research programs, including the Fund for Rural America, will be focused directly on food safety. That's the kind of awareness that we need, to prevent and combat food supply contamination. 
The bill also creates a Federal Emergency Management Agency-like approach to dealing with food safety crises. Currently, there are at least 3 agencies within the Department of Agriculture that have some responsibility for preventing and controlling outbreaks of food borne disease, not to mention the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control. This bill establishes a Food Safety Rapid Response Team across internal division boundaries within USDA that will coordinate with other Federal agencies. If outbreaks do occur, the American people must be confident that the government is prepared to efficiently handle and limit such public health threats. 
This legislation was developed by Congresswoman Stabenow over several months with input from all parts of the food production and consumption chain and the Department of Agriculture. It is an excellent complement to the Administration's enforcement enhancement proposal. The Safe Food Action Plan is a sensible and cost-effective way to make the Federal government responsive and responsible. 
I hope the Agriculture Committee will seek to move this legislation as quickly as possible, and I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this important measure.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to a remarkable woman from Michigan, Peggy Posa. Peggy is retiring after more than ten years of service as Executive Director of the Coalition on Temporary Shelter (COTS). 
Before Peggy Posa arrived, COTS was considered an important emergency shelter for homeless people in Detroit. By providing this service alone, COTS was a key part of the network of community organizations which serve underprivileged residents of Detroit. Under Peggy's leadership, however, COTS has grown to be considered one of Michigan's most respected providers of housing and comprehensive services for homeless people. She led COTS through an expansion and renovation of three shelter facilities; the creation of twenty-three units of permanent supportive housing for frail, elderly and mentally challenged individuals; the creation of three transitional housing programs; and the development of a variety of support services designed to assist people seeking to regain economic self-sufficiency and decent, affordable housing. 
Peggy Posa is widely admired as an innovative and tireless leader on issues related to the problem of homelessness. While she is retiring from her full time responsibilities, she has said that she will continue to be involved with COTS on a part time basis. I have no doubt that her colleagues and the people she serves are grateful for her continued dedication and support. 
Mr. President, Peggy Posa and COTS can take pride in the fact that they have truly succeeded in helping people to change their lives. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Peggy's commitment to her community and in wishing her well in her retirement.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend one of Michigan's foremost business leaders, Mr. Art VanElslander, for his service as chairman of the successful Society of St. Vincent DePaul Capital Campaign. 
Mr. VanElslander is well-known throughout Michigan as the Chairman and CEO of Art Van Furniture, Michigan's largest furniture retailer and the sixth largest furniture retailer in the United States. Business success has enabled Mr. VanElslander to pursue his commitment to community service and philanthropy and benefit thousands of people. His involvement with the St. Vincent DePaul Capital Campaign is a prime example of his dedication and commitment. 
In 1995, just before Christmas, a fire destroyed the St. Vincent DePaul warehouse which served needy residents of the metropolitan Detroit area. The fire led to an outpouring of donations of clothing, bedding and toys from thousands of people in Metro Detroit. With those immediate needs met, thanks to the generosity of the community, the Society of St. Vincent DePaul began a fundraising campaign to meet their long-term needs--replacing the warehouse and building the St. Vincent DePaul Service Center, which would provide job training and employment placement, transitional child care for those enrolled in programs at the Center, a non-acute health care clinic, a resale thrift shop and an emergency food depot. To raise the $3.75 million needed to fund these projects, the Society of St. Vincent DePaul asked Mr. VanElslander to chair the campaign. 
Mr. VanElslander not only provided the leadership and spirit needed to successfully raise the money, but he pledged to match up to $500,000 in donations. His commitment to this campaign is a natural expression of his desire to help the less fortunate members of his community. 
Mr. President, we all benefit from the attention and energy of leaders like Mr. VanElslander. By helping those in need, they improve the strengthen the entire community. I hope my colleagues will join me in commending Mr. Art VanElslander for his generosity and for his leadership of the Society of St. Vincent DePaul Capital Campaign.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Alex Trotman and Mandell `Bill' Berman who will receive the 1997 Human Relations Award of the Greater Detroit Interfaith Round Table of the National Conference, on November 18, 1997. This important awards ceremony will take place during the Greater Detroit Interfaith Round Table's 50th Annual Dinner. 
The Greater Detroit Interfaith Round Table was established in 1940 as the local chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The Detroit community quickly supported the NCCJ's goal of providing a forum where people of varied faiths could explore and celebrate their differences. During the last 57 years, the Interfaith Round Table has promoted such understanding through its many popular programs and fora. 
The Human Relations Award recognizes leaders in the community `for moving us forward in building a city, State, and Nation committed to the ideals of dignity, justice, and respect for all people.' This year's recipients have displayed a strong personal commitment to promoting understanding among all races, religions, and cultures. Their great efforts are an inspiration to us all. 
Alex Trotman is chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Co. He was born in Middlesex, England, and came to the United States in 1969. Since coming to America, Mr. Trotman has used his unique vantage point to promote understanding among different people. He is currently a member of several organizations which promote international exchange, such as the Chase International Advisory Committee, the America-China Society, and the United States-Japan Business Council. 
Bill Berman is a Detroit native and, like me, a product of its public school system. After a distinguished career in industry, Mr. Berman is currently a member of the board of the Dreyfus Corp. He has also been closely involved with supporting his community. He has served in leadership positions of the Skillman Foundation, JESNA, and its Berman Research and Evaluation Center, Detroit Jewish Welfare Federation, and the United Way. 
Mr. President, I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Alex Trotman and Mandell `Bill' Berman on receiving the 1997 Human Relations Award of the Greater Detroit Interfaith Round Table.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that H.R. 1604, the Indian distribution judgment fund bill, passed the Senate yesterday. This bill cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, including my Michigan colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham. I would like to thank my colleague in the House, Representative Dale Kildee, for introducing this bill. I believe that H.R. 1604 will pass the House in the next few days and will then be signed into law by the President. 
H.R. 1604 is a very important piece of legislation for several Michigan tribes. To fully understand this bill, it is necessary to understand Michigan history. In the Treaty of 1836, the Chippewa and Ottawa Indians of Michigan ceded over 12 million acres of land in Michigan to the Federal Government. Approximately 15 cents per acre was given to the tribes as compensation for this land. 
In 1946, the U.S. Congress established the Indian Claims Commission, a body created to redress some of the worst injustices of the U.S. Government/Indian Nation treaty era. The Indian Claims Commission determined that the value of the land ceded by the Michigan tribes was 90 cents an acre, not 15 cents. In 1972, Congress appropriated $10 million as a final settlement for the land, but the money could not be distribute until the tribes reached an agreement on how the funds would be distributed. This amount has now grown to over $70 million. 
Over the last few years, the tribes have worked among themselves to come to an agreement as to the means of distributing the funds. H.R. 1604 is the result of this consensus between the parties. 
I would like to commend the tribal leaders for coming together to negotiate this agreement. It has taken many years and much negotiating. Tribal elder, Arthur LeBlanc, of the Bay Mills Indian Community, testified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on November 3, 1997, on behalf of H.R. 1604. Mr. LeBlanc, and other tribal members, will now be compensated for a settlement claim that has taken 25 years to fully resolve. 
In closing, I offer my strong support for H.R. 1604 and am hopeful that it will pass the House quickly and that the tribes will receive compensation for their land as soon as possible.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on the last day in October, Senator Thompson announced that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was suspending its campaign finance hearings in part because the committee did not have the caliber of witnesses and information to justify continuing the hearings. 
Mr. President, the Democrats on the Governmental Affairs Committee were promised 3 days of hearings during September or October on a number of unexamined issues involving important events during the 1996 elections. Had that commitment been kept, one of the days would have been spent looking at the largest single transfer from a political party to a tax-exempt organization in the history of American politics--$4.6 million, which the Republican National Committee gave to Americans for Tax Reform in October 1996, the final month before the 1996 elections. 
As this chart shows, over two-thirds of the money which ATR received in 1996, this tax-exempt organization, over two-thirds of that money came from the Republican National Committee. The size of this transfer is unprecedented. There is no record of an American political party giving even $1 million to a tax-exempt organization, much less four times that amount. 
If the Democratic National Committee had given $4.6 million to a labor union or environmental group in the month before the 1996 elections, I have no doubt that there would have been a searching investigation of the facts, if not full scale public hearings--and it would have been totally appropriate. But here--where the money was paid by the RNC to a tax-exempt group whose efforts were aimed at attacking Democrats--not a single hearing witness was called. Worse, the Governmental Affairs Committee failed to interview a single person from either the Republican National Committee or Americans for Tax Reform about this transfer. Given its mandate, the Committee's failure to investigate the $4.6 million was a highly partisan act which denied the Senate and the American public important information. 
But even without depositions or interviews or testimony, there is enough evidence through publicly available documents and the limited document production by the RNC, ATR, and some banks to piece together the outline of a coordinated campaign effort involving ATR that appears to circumvent hard and soft money restrictions, to duck disclosure, and to misuse ATR's tax-exempt status--all of which calls out for an appropriate investigation by the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department. 
Let's begin with what was said at the time about the $4.6 million transfer. In public statements, both RNC Chairman Haley Barbour and ATR President Grover Norquist denied that the money transfer was part of any coordinated effort between the two organizations. Mr. Barbour told the Washington Post on October 29, 1996, that `he had no understanding with Norquist about how the money would be spent,' while Mr. Norquist told the press that he had made `no specific commitment' to the RNC on how ATR would use the money. In short, the two principals would have the American public believe that in the final weeks before election day 1996, the RNC gave away $4.6 million to a supposedly nonpartisan, independent organization with no understanding or expectation as to how that money would be used. 
Not only does common sense tell us that this is unlikely, but the facts and documents behind this transaction indicate that it simply was not so. 
Let's look at what was happening around the time the money transfer took place. For months prior to election day, Haley Barbour and the RNC had been complaining about a television ad campaign funded by organized labor and others criticizing the Republican Party on the issue of Medicare. The RNC and Haley Barbour were telling anyone who would listen that the ads were distorting the facts and that Republicans were not out to cut Medicare. And yet, the RNC waited until October, the final month before the election, to start spending funds to respond to those ads. Here is Haley Barbour, at an October 25, 1996, press conference, explaining the RNC's decision to delay spending: 
[W]e made the decision not to borrow money last year or early this year in order to try to compete with the unions and the other liberal special-interest groups' spending. You see, our campaigns do come into the real election season late September and October without having spent all the money that--to match what the unions were doing. And you will see us--you are seeing now, and have been throughout the month of October, you are seeing Republicans using the resources that we've raised in voluntary contributions to finish very strong, to make sure our message is in front of voters when they are making their voting decisions. 
What steps was the RNC taking to ensure that its message was in front of voters when they are making their voting decisions in October? One step was to funnel $4.6 million in soft money to ATR which used the money on a massive direct mail and phone bank operation, targeting 150 congressional districts with 19 million pieces of mail and 4 million phone calls. 
The subject of the ATR mailings and phone calls was just what Haley Barbour referred to in his statement to the press--Medicare. The title of one ATR mailing says it all: `Straight Facts About You, Medicare and the November 5 Election.' This mailing urged senior citizens to ignore political scare tactics and stated `[t]here's barely a difference between the Republican Medicare Plan and President Clinton's Medicare Proposal.'

Mr. LEVIN. This `Memorandum for the Field Dogs' is a document which, again, came from the files of the Republican National Committee and states the following in its entirety: 
Re: Outside Mail and Phone effort, 
Attached is a rotten copy of the 1st of 3 mail piece[s] that will be sent to 150 selected congressional districts it will be directed at [sic], `a map of which has been included for your viewing pleasure.' 
We discussed this effort during Wednesday's conference call. 
This is an effort undertaken by Americans for Tax Reform. They are attempting to warn seniors about Democrat Mediscare tactics. . .' 
This memo to the field personnel provides clear evidence that the RNC had advance information about ATR's mailing effort. It shows that the RNC had a copy of ATR's first direct mail piece even before it was sent out. In the words of the memo, attached is a copy of the first of three mail piece[s] that will be sent. 
It shows that the RNC knew it was the first of three mailings, and that it was being sent, not to specified cities or counties or zip codes, but to specified Federal Congressional districts--150 congressional districts to be exact--that it will be directed at. And to ensure that RNC field personnel knew precisely which districts had been targeted, the memo includes a map * * * for your viewing pleasure. 
The fact that the mailing targeted congressional districts, rather than cities or zip codes, shows clearly an election-related intent. The fact that this information was communicated to RNC field personnel doing election-related work at the time is more evidence. The memo also states that RNC field personnel had discussed the effort undertaken by Americans for Tax Reform in a previous Wednesday's conference call. Any fair reading of this memo throws cold water on the claim that there was no understanding between the RNC and ATR about what ATR was doing. 
But, one may ask, what evidence is there that the RNC knew when it gave ATR the $4.6 million how ATR intended to spend it? Again, let's look at the facts and the documents. 
First, let's look at an October 29, 1996 invoice sent to ATR 
by the John Grotta Co. This is the company that actually managed the direct mail and phone bank effort for ATR in October 1996. It is a company, I might add, that has also run direct mail campaigns on behalf of the RNC and is owned by an individual--John Grotta--who is a former western political director for the RNC. The invoice shows that ATR owed John Grotta various amounts at various times throughout October 1996. The grand total owed to the company, not including postage for the mailings, was $3,325,498.60. 
Based on an analysis of ATR's bank records, which are in Committee files, on October 1, 1996, ATR had a total in its two bank accounts of $294,078.50--a tenth of the cost of the direct mail-phone bank effort. 
Lo and behold, though, in October 1996 the RNC began pumping money directly into one of ATR's bank accounts. The $4.6 million total would prove more than enough to pay for the direct mail-phone bank effort. What a coincidence. Or was it? 
A closer look shows that the $4.6 million was, in fact, not one donation, but four payments spread throughout the month of October. And if we compare the timing of each payment to the billing dates for the direct mail-phone bank operation, we find that each donation came at a very convenient moment for ATR. 
According to the invoice, ATR owed John Grotta an initial payment of $195,177.50 on October 7, 1996. On October 4, 1996, three days before that initial payment was due, the RNC gave $2 million to ATR. The RNC didn't write a check to ATR--it wired the funds directly into ATR's bank account. Five days later, on October 9, ATR paid its bill to John Grotta. 
Two weeks after that, ATR faced another $1,313,677.40 in bills owed to John Grotta. These bills were due on October 18 and October 22. And what should happen on October 17, but that the RNC provided a second, well-timed donation to ATR--this time in the amount of $1 million. Again, this money was wired directly into ATR's account. Within days of receiving it, ATR paid John Grotta $1,418,544.38. 
ATR had another John Grotta bill due on October 24, 1996--this one in the amount of $1,104,000. On October 23, 1996, however, the total in ATR's bank account was $216,344.93. But once again, ATR got the money it needed. On October 25, 1996, the RNC made a third well-timed donation to ATR--$1 million wired into ATR's account. Within hours of receiving this donation, ATR paid John Grotta $1,104,000. 
One week later, at the end of the month, ATR faced another John Grotta bill due in the amount of $607,776.72. On the day before that bill was due, the total in ATR's bank account was only $70,085.65. But on the next day, the very day that the $607,000 bill was due, the RNC wired ATR a fourth and final, well-timed donation--in the amount of $600,000. Within 2 hours of receiving the RNC donation, ATR paid off its bill to John Grotta. 
Are we supposed to believe that the timing and amounts of RNC payments to ATR, when compared to the billing dates and amounts owed by ATR to John Grotta, were mere coincidence? Are we supposed to believe that the RNC's $600,000 payment just in time to pay a $600,000 bill was sheer luck--a $600,000 coincidence? And that there was no coordination or understanding as to how the RNC money would be used by ATR? 
That's what Haley Barbour and Grover Norquist told the American public. But let's look past those statements to some other things Mr. Barbour and Mr. Norquist have said. In a news conference at RNC headquarters on October 29, 1996, Mr. Barbour was asked about the RNC's $4.6 million donation to ATR. Here's what he said:  
We made a contribution to Americans for Tax Reform, which is a conservative, low-tax organization. You'll see in our FEC report now and at the end of the year that we've made contributions to a number of organizations that are like-minded, share our views, promote our ideas. 
Then he went on to say the following: 
As you know, when we do advertising, when we do advocacy, no matter what we do, we typically have to pay for it, either totally with FEC dollars or a mixture of FEC and non-FEC dollars. While our fundraising among small donors has been nothing short of spectacular, we often find ourselves in the position where we cannot match up non-FEC funds with enough FEC funds. 
Those are the key words, `We find ourselves in the position where we cannot match up non-FEC funds with enough FEC funds.' To put it in words which are more familiar to the American public, `We cannot match up soft money with enough hard money.' 
Haley Barbour went on to say at that press conference: 
So, when we came to that point, we decided we would contribute to several groups who are like-minded and whose activities we think, while they're not specifically political, we think are good for the environment for us. 
In an article in the Washington Post on February 9, 1997, again referring to the RNC contribution to ATR, Mr. Barbour was quoted as saying that groups like ATR `have more credibility' in pushing a political message than the parties themselves.' So here we have Mr. Barbour saying that the RNC gave ATR $4.6 million in soft money, because it didn't have enough matching hard dollars to allow the RNC to do the advertising itself, and further saying that having groups like ATR do the political advertising provides more credibility than having the RNC do it itself. And yet Mr. Barbour claims that he had no understanding with ATR as to how the RNC's contributions to ATR would be used? 
Then there are Mr. Norquist's statements. When asked to comment on the $4.6 million, Mr. Norquist told the Washington Post on December 10, 1996, `We just ramped up on stuff we were going to do anyway. They, the RNC, the conservative movement, knew the projects we were working on.' 
The facts and documents indicate that the RNC was using ATR as a surrogate to do what the RNC itself had neither the hard dollars or the credibility to do on its own. Such actions raise questions about whether the RNC was deliberately circumventing hard money requirements as well as disclosure requirements. They also raise questions about whether the RNC was deliberately misusing a supposedly nonpartisan, independent tax exempt organization to promote the RNC's campaign agenda. 
Americans for Tax Reform is a 501(c)(4) organization that is exempt from taxation. A (c)(4) organization is supposed to be engaged in social welfare that promotes the common good and general welfare of the people of the community. Social welfare organizations may not engage in campaign-related activity as their primary activity. The relevant Tax Code regulation 1.501(c)(4)-1 describes the prohibited activity as `direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.' An analysis of ATR's bank records for 1996 indicates, however, that the $4.6 million that the RNC provided was more than two-thirds of ATR's income. The fact that RNC funds outmatched ATR's other funding by a 2-1 margin raises the issue of whether the RNC funding made electioneering ATR's dominant pursuit in violation of its tax exempt status. 
The tax abuse issue doesn't end there. Up to this point, for simplicity's sake, I've been referring only to Americans for Tax Reform, the 501(c)(4) organization. But ATR has an affiliate, run by Grover Norquist out of the same office, called the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation. This foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization which is prohibited by Federal tax law from engaging in any campaign activity. 
But it turns out that the foundation was very much engaged in the direct mail-phone bank operation and served as a second conduit for RNC funds spent on that operation. Of the $4.6 million provided by the RNC, ATR actually transferred about $2.3 million to the foundation which, in turn, paid almost half the direct 
mail-phone bank bills. In effect then, the RNC funneled soft money through two tax exempt organizations--one a 501(c)(4) and one a 501(c)(3)--to pay for an advocacy effort it could not do on its own due to a lack of matching hard dollars. ATR paid approximately $1.8 million for the operation, while the ATR Foundation paid approximately $1.5 million. 
How do we know? Believe me, Mr. President, it wasn't easy to find out. The committee subpoena for ATR bank records was intended to cover the ATR Foundation, and the bank was willing to produce the foundation's records, but felt it could not do so under the wording of the subpoena without ATR's consent. When the minority asked ATR to allow the bank to produce ATR Foundation records, ATR refused. And when Senator Glenn asked the committee chairman to issue a new subpoena to the bank explicitly requesting ATR Foundation records, the request was ignored. So we were forced to piece together the foundation's role from the documents we already had. 
To make a long story short, we followed the money. On October 4, 1996, the RNC wired $2 million to ATR. On October 17, the RNC wired another $1 million to ATR. The next day--October 18--ATR transferred $508,000 to the ATR Foundation. Four days after that--on October 22--ATR transferred another $851,000 to the ATR Foundation. On October 25, the RNC wired yet another $1 million to ATR. That very day ATR transferred $1 million to the ATR Foundation. The result is a pattern of RNC money coming into ATR and then being used by ATR either to pay the direct mail-phone bank bills directly, or going an extra step of being passed by ATR to the ATR Foundation which then paid bills. What makes this pattern all the more intriguing is that ATR bank records for the year-and-a-half preceding October 1996 do not include a single month in which ATR transferred money to its foundation. Yet in October 1996, ATR gave its foundation over $2 million. 
Why did ATR take this extra step and involve its foundation? We'd like to ask Mr. Norquist, but so far have been denied any opportunity to do so. 
How do we know, then, that the foundation used RNC funds to help pay for the direct mail-phone bank effort? We found two types of evidence. First, comparing the October 29 John Grotta invoice to ATR bank records shows that, for every recorded bill payment but two there is a corresponding wire transfer from ATR's bank account to John Grotta. The two exceptions are two bill payments that were both shown as made on October 25, 1996--one in the amount of $468,000 and one in the amount of $1,104,000. Both payments are shown on the invoice as having been made by ATR, but there is no corresponding wire transfer from ATR's bank account. However, both payments were made after ATR had transferred over $2 million to the ATR Foundation. Common sense tells us that the foundation must have paid the bills on ATR's behalf. Of course, having been denied access to ATR Foundation bank records, we don't have the bank records documenting foundation payments to Grotta. However, we do have one of the mailings that this money paid for. And right there, in black and white, underneath the heading `Straight Talk About You, Medicare & the November 5 Election' are the words, `Paid for by AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM FOUNDATION.' 
The documents and public statements of Mr. Barbour and Mr. Norquist indicate that RNC soft money went through ATR and ATR's 501(c)(3) foundation and paid for a direct mail-phone bank operation that, if the RNC had done it directly, would have required either all hard money or a hard money-soft money split. Was the RNC laundering money through the ATR affiliates to avoid having to use any hard money to pay for the mailings and telephone calls? Was the RNC funnelling payments through the ATR affiliates to capitalize on ATR's greater credibility? Was the RNC knowingly misusing ATR's tax exempt status by causing electioneering to become the primary activity of the (c)(4) organization and by passing funds through a (c)(3) foundation that is prohibited from engaging in campaign activity? The evidence is powerful and should have been explored at a committee hearing. 
There's more. The RNC's $4.6 million paid for more than the John Grotta direct mail-phone bank operation which cost about $3.3 million plus postage. Although Mr. Norquist told the Washington Post on December 10, 1996, that ATR `didn't do televised issue ads,' the evidence is overwhelming that ATR did. One ad, of which we have a videotaped copy, attacked then-Representative Robert Torricelli, the Democratic candidate for Senate in New Jersey for allegedly missing votes. A company called Title Wave sent ATR an invoice for $8,524 to produce the ad, which was called `Torricelli/`Missing'.' Invoices from Mentzer Media Services, Inc., charged ATR $325,230 for a media buy in New York/New Jersey media markets and another $56,656.25 for media buys in Philadelphia/New Jersey media markets to keep the ad on the air during the month of October right up to November 4, the day before the election. 
RNC funds delivered to ATR were used to pay for the ad. On October 4, 1996, the same day it received $2 million from the RNC, ATR wrote a $4,000 check to Title Wave as partial payment on the ad's production costs. Two weeks later, ATR wrote a $4,900 check to a company called Soundwave. The memo at the bottom of the check stated that it was payment on an invoice for the `Torricelli ad.' And beginning on October 8 through the end of the month, ATR's bank records show a series of wire transfers to Mentzer Media Services totaling $374,830 for the media buys. At the beginning of October, ATR's bank account balances had stood at just over $290,000. After receiving the influx of RNC dollars, ATR spent over $383,000 on an attack ad against the Democratic senatorial candidate in New Jersey. 
Documentary evidence suggests ATR's involvement with other television ads during the 1996 election season. Two were allegedly sponsored by an ATR affiliate called Women For Tax Reform, which was formed in August 1996, housed in ATR's offices, headed by ATR's Executive Director Audrey Mullen, and which has had no apparent existence apart from the two ads. Both ads attacked President Clinton by name with one scheduled for airing on television in Chicago in August during the Democratic Convention. 
In addition, the RNC produced out of its files the script of a television ad which was apparently designed to be sponsored by ATR and used to attack Democratic candidates running for open seats. The document states at the top, `RNC-TV/Open Seat TV:30/`Control'.' The ad requires inserting a photo of a Democratic candidate, stamping `Wrong!!' over it, and then inserting the `Democrat Tax Record' under the photo. The last line of the ad is: `For more information call Americans for Tax Reform.' At the bottom of the document, in small type, it states: `As of 10/15/96 4:50 PM/ Approved by legal counsel.' This document not only suggests coordination between the RNC and ATR on TV ads, but also a sufficient investment of resources to involve a written script and legal consultation. Since officials from the RNC and ATR refused to be interviewed and when subpoenaed refused to appear, we don't know whether any ad was actually broadcast. Whether or not one was, this RNC-produced document indicates coordination. 
There's more. Documents indicate that RNC coordination efforts may have extended to organizations other than ATR, and that the RNC may have taken steps to pay for coordinated activities using not only its own funds, but also funds from third parties which the RNC solicited and directed. Here are some of the key documents. 
The first is a memorandum dated October 17, 1996, marked `confidential,' from Jo-Anne Coe, RNC finance director, to Haley Barbour, RNC chairman, Sanford McCallister, RNC general counsel, and Curt Anderson, RNC political director. The memo discusses Coe's efforts to forward certain sums of money to various tax exempt organizations, including a $100,000 check from Carl Lindner to ATR, another $100,000 check from Mr. Lindner to the National Right to Life Committee, and $950,000 from several sources to the American Defense Institute. The memo poses questions about how certain checks should be handled and requests quick action `so I 
can put this project to bed.' 
The project itself is not described in the memo; however, a second document may shed light on that question. It is an October 21, 1996 memorandum from Jo-Anne Coe to Haley Barbour. This memo states:  
As soon as we meet and hopefully come to some resolution on the joint state mail project, I will forward these checks to the three organizations. In the meantime, I am respectfully withholding delivery of the checks until we have the opportunity to discuss this matter. 
Could the `joint state mail project' be the project referred to in the October 17th memo from Coe to Barbour? Could it refer to ATR's $3.3 million direct mail-phone bank effort? Could it refer to mail efforts by other organizations as well, since the memo cites three organizations as being involved in the project? Is the fact that the RNC Finance Director was `respectfully withholding' checks to these three organizations evidence that the RNC was exercising control over their performance in the mail project in exchange for funding? A committee hearing could have tried to get answers to these questions. The majority denied us that opportunity. 
In the meantime, we must puzzle over two letters bearing the same date, October 21, 1996, as the Coe memo to Barbour on the joint state mail project. Both letters are from Jo-Anne Coe. The first letter is addressed to Grover Norquist, president of ATR, and the second to David O'Steen, the executive director of the National Right to Life Committee. Each encloses a $100,000 check from Carl Lindner to the organization, as described in the October 17 memo. Ms. Coe states in both letters: `Glad to be of some help. Keep up the good work.' It appears that the RNC may have directed its contributors to help the RNC by making their checks payable to these tax exempt organizations but then to keep control of the situation, have the contributors send the checks to the RNC. The RNC then forwarded the checks to the organizations, probably in support of the `joint state mail project.' 
Two other documents raise similar coordination questions. The first was produced by the RNC and has the same `confidential' heading as the October 17th memo from Jo-Anne Coe to top RNC officials, although no author is named. This document discusses contributions to ATR, the National Right to Life Committee, American Defense Institute, United Seniors Association, the City of San Diego, and `CCRI' which is the California ballot initiative on affirmative action. Each organization is analyzed in terms of whether contributions to it would have to be reported to the public and whether a contribution would be tax deductible. The final document is a list of the same organizations other than the ballot initiative. By each organization's name is a large dollar figure. The figure for ATR is $6 million. 
What do these figures mean? Does the $6 million for ATR mean that, in addition to giving ATR $4.6 million directly, the RNC funneled another $1.4 million to ATR in third-party contributions such as the $100,000 check from Carl Lindner? How were those funds used? Did the RNC exercise some control over those funds? We'd like to ask. Unfortunately, despite the repeated requests and efforts by the minority to seek RNC and ATR testimony voluntarily and then by subpoena and to have the few subpoenas that were issued enforced, the committee never interviewed or deposed anyone connected with these documents. 
Improper coordination between a national political party and tax exempt organizations was a hot topic in this committee when the political party involved was the Democratic Party. Some committee members charged that President Clinton's participation in DNC issue ads was improper or illegal, even though these ads were paid for by the required soft money-hard money split. I repeat that, because this is a very important point of distinction: the DNC issue ads were paid for by the required soft money-hard money split. But in the Americans for Tax Reform case, the facts suggest that the Republican Party sent millions to ATR for issue advocacy in order to avoid using any hard money at all for those efforts. To recall 
Mr. Barbour's words, they didn't have enough hard dollars to match up. 
The committee also held an entire day of hearings to take testimony from Warren Meddoff about his asking for, and Harold Ickes' providing, suggestions for contributions to tax exempt organizations. But the RNC did much more than make suggestions. It actually collected checks, contolled checks, and delivered checks to tax exempts which were allied with it. The RNC may have directed millions of dollars to these organizations for `joint state mail projects,' television ads and other campaign activities. 
Another unanswered question is how the RNC and ATR handled the $4.6 million on their own tax returns. Section 527 of the Tax Code suggests that one or the other organization had to treat this sum as taxable income. Did that happen? We don't know, and the committee has yet to ask. 
On April 9, 6 months ago, Mr. Norquist told the press that he would `cheerfully testify before the committee.' But he then refused to be either deposed or interviewed. Even when he was finally subpoenaed for a deposition, he refused to appear. ATR also refused to produce documents in response to a committee document subpoena, claiming, `ATR has never engaged in electioneering of any sort. It has never advocated the election or defeat of any candidate for any office at any time; it has never run political advertising on any subject.' 
Yet it is beyond dispute that Grover Norquist was a key figure in the 1996 elections. He was profiled in Elizabeth Drew's 1996 election analysis, Whatever It Takes, for convening regular Wednesday meetings in ATR offices attended by conservative activists, RNC officials and GOP candidates. Drew describes him as `one of the most influential figures in Washington' at the time. In Norquist's 1995 book, `Rock the House', celebrating the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, prominent Republicans provided glowing quotations, with Haley Barbour calling him `a true insider,' and Rush Limbaugh calling him `perhaps the most influential and important person you've never heard of in the GOP today.' 
Mr. Norquist meets the test that Chairman Thompson laid down for a high caliber witness. And ATR's role in the 1996 elections--how it spent the $4.6 million in RNC funds, how much money was directed to it by the RNC from third parties and how those funds were spent, and the window that ATR's actions opens onto RNC's coordination with tax exempt groups--were unexplored topics in the Senate campaign finance investigation. 
And the ATR hearing is not the only hearing missing from the Senate campaign finance investigation. 
A second hearing we would have re-requested would have looked at the Republican National Committee and Dole for President campaign. Out of the more than 75 witnesses who testified before the committee over the 3 months of hearings, not one witness was called from the Republican National Committee, other than with respect to the National Policy Forum, or from the Dole for President campaign. What most people don't know is that the committee never even interviewed a single person from the Dole campaign, and request after request from the minority for deposition subpoenas were refused. And although the committee permitted two limited interviews of RNC officials, Haley Barbour and Scott Reed, no questions were allowed to be asked duringthose sessions on any topic other than the National Policy Forum and no other person from the RNC was ever interviewed or deposed. 
That means that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is concluding its investigation into the 1996 elections without ever asking a single question of the RNC or Dole campaign on such topics as evasion of Federal campaign limits, improper coordination, misuse of issue advertising, misuse of tax exempts, money laundering by a top campaign official, or inadequate document production--all the topics that the committee pursued vigorously with the Clinton campaign. This see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach to GOP conduct in the 1996 elections has not 
only seriously skewed the investigation, but it has also left an regrettable stain on the bipartisan traditions of the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
A third hearing would have looked at Triad Management--a totally new phenomenon in American electioneering and one which appears to have violated a number of principles of Federal campaign law, from contribution limits to FEC registration to full disclosure. Triad is a private corporation that was set up by experienced GOP political operatives to conduct multimillion dollar activities directly affecting the 1996 elections. Among other activities, Triad created two tax exempt organizations, collected millions of dollars in secret contributions to them, and then used the tax exempts to air millions of dollars worth of television ads affecting Federal campaigns. Triad also conducted hundreds of `political audits' of GOP campaigns, paying experienced campaign professionals to advise the campaigns on how to improve their operations. Triad also may have arranged for individuals who contributed the maximum allowable amount to GOP candidates to evade Federal contribution limits by laundering additional contributions from these individuals through political action committees. 
Triad undertook all of these activities without ever registering with the Federal Election Commission, or disclosing any contributions or expenditures. Yet this wholesale abuse of Federal campaign law has not been deemed by the majority to be worthy of a single hearing witness or depositions. 
Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs Committee's failure to investigate the $4.6 million payment by the Republican Party to Americans for Tax Reform, its failure to hold one day of hearings or hear from one witness with respect to Triad Management, and its failure to hold one day of hearings or call one witness from the RNC or Dole campaign on these critical issues is simply unjustifiable. The majority's commitment to allow Democrats 3 days of hearings in September or October was not kept. As a result, important information such as the ATR story was kept from the American public. 
That is not just some process question about subpoenas and depositions. That is a question about whether or not relevant testimony within the scope of the jurisdiction of the committee should have been obtained and should have been made public and made subject to examination and cross-examination. 
The Senate investigation was half an investigation. The other half remains for the Treasury Department and Justice Department to investigate.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the subcommittee having jurisdiction over civil service issues, I am introducing today, at the request of the administration, legislation that would make two changes to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. I introduce this legislation as a courtesy to the administration without taking a position on its merits so that it can be given proper consideration and so that concerned parties can have the opportunity to comment on its potential effects. 
The two changes to the Civil Service Reform Act relate to the authority of the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] to seek judicial review of Federal personnel management decisions issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board [MSPB] and by arbitrators. The first change would allow OPM 60 days, rather than the 30 days under current law, to file a petition for review of an MSPB final decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The time available for employees to appeal would not be affected by this change. 
The second change would eliminate the discretion of the Federal circuit to decide whether to hear OPM petitions for review. Currently, OPM must file a petition with the Federal circuit and ask the court to hear its appeal. If enacted, this change would require the Federal circuit to hear every appeal from a final MSPB decision brought by OPM.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate has gone on record in support of a measure aimed at humanizing the process through which adult biological relatives separated by adoption, who are looking for each other, can make contact. 
The passage of this Craig-Levin bill would not have been possible without the steadfast leadership of Senator Larry Craig. His sensitivity, his commitment, his compassion and his clear understanding of this issue has been enlightening to all of the Members of this body. Let me also thank Senator McCain and Senator Landrieu for their commitment and bipartisan spirit throughout our discussions on this issue. 
Mr. President, we are deeply touched by the difficulties experienced by adult adopted persons, birth parents, and separated siblings who, often for many years and at great expense, have been seeking one another. Aside from the natural human desire to know one's roots and genetic heritage, there are other important reasons why many birth relatives seek to make contact with each other. Some are seeking a deeper sense of identity, some need vital information which may affect their own mental and physical health and some are facing momentous family decisions that require more knowledge about their heritage; and a substantial percentage of birth parents say they want to be available to the adult children many relinquished at birth, during a time of stress, should they also desire to make contact. 
We believe that S. 1487, the National Voluntary Mutual Reunion Registry, deals with these needs and emotions in a careful and sensitive way. The legislation permits the HHS Secretary, at no net expense to the Federal Government, to facilitate the voluntary, mutually requested exchange of identifying information that has been mutually consented to in a signed notarized statement of identifying information by the birth parent, adult adoptee 21 years or older or adult siblings. 
This legislation does not call for the unsealing of adoption records. Currently, over half the States provide for voluntary and mutual reunion facilitation. However, State-based systems are restricted, by nature, to the geographic boundaries of the State. Since we are a mobile society, that limitation reduces the utility of State-based systems. Adoptions are often started in one State but finalized in another. Additionally, the adoptee, birth parent or siblings may be a resident of several different States during their lifetimes. 
Finally, Mr. President, this legislation does not mandate, but simply gives the Secretary the discretion to facilitate voluntary, mutual reunions, if she so chooses.

Would it be fair to say that the adoption of this short term bill would in no way prejudice efforts later on in the next session of Congress to have consideration of amendments, such as No. 1376, and other formulas which are more equitable to many of our States that have not, in our view, been treated equitably.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in bringing the conference report on the DOD authorization act to the Senate floor this morning. It has been a long and difficult conference in which we had to address and finally resolve some very difficult issues. 
First, I want to congratulate Chairman Thurmond on the successful conclusion of the conference and thank Senator Thurmond for the open and bipartisan spirit in which he conducted this conference on the Senate side. Without his leadership, this conference report wouldn't be here. He had to make some difficult decisions. He did that on a bipartisan basis, and I want to commend him for it. 
I thank the chairman and the ranking member on the House side, Congressmen Spence and Dellums, for their cooperation. 
We worked hard to reach a fair conclusion on the issues in the conference. I think we have succeeded. There are some provisions in the bill that I don't agree with. But, overall, I think we reached a good compromise on the major issues. And I hope the President will sign this bill. 
Let me start with the action that we took to begin the implementation of the Quadrennial Defense Review. These are important steps. There hasn't been a lot of focus on them. But these are important actions which we took. The QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, was completed in May. The conference report begins to implement some of the recommendations of the QDR. 
For example, the conference report would permit reductions in Active and Reserve and end strengths below the fiscal year 1997 level, as the Department of Defense continues to restructure and streamline both combat and support functions in an effort to free up funds for the services' modernization priorities. 
Second, the conference report calls for annual reductions of 5 percent in headquarters staffing over the next 5 years in an effort to reduce the so-called tooth-to-tail ratio. 
The conference report would provide funding for a number of the Army's Force XXI initiatives. The QDR set a goal of `digitizing' an entire Army Corps by 2004--and the funding in this bill will continue that process. 
Finally, the conference report would make some positive changes in the area of privatization of depot maintenance work recommended by the QDR by permitting the privatization of up to 50 percent of such work, in lieu of the 40 percent cap currently imposed by law. 
Mr. President, I think it is very unfortunate that Congress has not followed the QDR recommendation to give the Defense Department authority to conduct more base closure rounds. We lost that battle on the Senate floor this year, but this issue is just simply not going to go away. I think more and more people are going to realize that we are going to have to close some unnecessary bases if we are going to free up money for other important needs, including the modernization of our forces. 
The bill also takes a number of important steps to improve the quality of life of our troops. 
For example, the conference report includes a 2.8-percent pay raise for active duty military members. If the bill were not enacted, this pay raise would be limited to 2.3 percent because of the statutory link between military and civilian pay raises. However, Federal civilians will receive an average .5 percent in locality pay that is not available to active duty military, in addition to their 2.3-percent pay raise. 
So the 2.8-percent pay raise for active duty military is fair, it is needed, and it is dependent upon the passage of this conference report. 
The conference report also includes authority for significant increases in special pay and bonuses available to respond to critical recruiting and retention problems which have been highlighted by the Department of Defense. If the bill were not enacted, these authorities would not be available to the Department. Specific groups that would be affected include aviators, nuclear-qualified officers, dentists, military members on overseas tours, military members receiving family separation allowances and/or hazardous duty assignment pay, and military members serving in hardship duty locations. Those increases in those special pay and bonuses are critically necessary. They are dependent on the passage of this bill. 
The conference report includes significant reforms of the existing structure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for military members. These reforms would simplify the management of these allowances and better target the allowances to those individuals in geographic areas with the greatest need. 
The conference report provides authority for the Department of Defense to begin construction on fiscal year 1998 military construction projects, which include a number of important quality-of-life and training-related facilities. As our chairman has said, if this bill is not enacted, construction of these projects cannot begin, and they are needed. And these are quality-of-life issues. 
The conference report terminates the Reserve Mobilization Insurance Program. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of Defense will continue to lose $10 to $12 million per month as deployments and obligations continue. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the conferees agreed to authorize the full budget request of $382 million for the Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, and $158 million for the related programs in the Department of Energy. 
The House bill also contained some very restrictive provisions that would have made it difficult for these programs to continue in the coming year. I am pleased that those provisions were either dropped or modified by the conferees. Combating the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of the greatest national security challenges that we face. And the cooperative threat-reduction programs are on the front line of our efforts to meet this challenge. 
Those programs are an investment in America's security. Those programs make it less likely that there will be a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Those programs are a very, very cost-effective way of reducing probably the greatest threat that America faces. I am glad that we were able to fully fund the budget request and, again, either eliminate or modify some needlessly restrictive provisions on the use of those funds. 
There were three issues that we had to deal with in conference that the administration said, if we didn't resolve satisfactorily to them, would result in a veto of this bill. 
First, Bosnia; 
Second B-2's; 
And, third, depots. 
All three of these issues were raised by provisions in the House bill. And, after a lengthy battle, we have successfully addressed each one of them. 
First, on the issue of Bosnia, I think we had a good outcome. The administration again said they would veto a bill that included a funds cutoff for United States military presence in Bosnia. We avoided that outcome with a provision similar to the one in the Department of Defense appropriations conference report that authorizes the President to override a funds cutoff if he certifies that the continued presence of American troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998, is required to meet United States national security interests. 
But, equally important in my view is the sense-of-Congress language which I sponsored in the Senate that says clearly it is the sense of the Congress that, one: 
First, United States ground combat forces should not participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia after June 1998; 
Second, that a western European Union-led or a NATO-led force, without the participation of United States ground combat forces, may, indeed, be a suitable follow-on force; and that a western European Union-led force could be under the European Security and Defense Identity initiative; 
Third, this language provides that the United States may decide to provide appropriate support to a follow-on force, including command and control, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a Ready Reserve force in the region; 
And, fourth, this language provides that the President should inform our NATO allies of this sense-of-Congress language and strongly urge them to prepare to provide for such a follow-on force. 
The second veto issue was the B-2 bomber. On this issue, we believe that we avoided a veto threat by following the appropriations conference outcome. We authorized a total of $331 million either for procurement of additional B-2 aircraft or for maintenance and upgrade of the current B-2 fleet. We left it up to the President to decide which option to select. 
I obviously hope and expect that the President will decide not to buy any more B-2's. 
That clearly is the position of the Senate, and I hope he makes the decision quickly so that we can put this issue behind us and so the Air Force can begin to spend the money on what is needed, which is to fix some of the problems with the current B-2 fleet. The senior military civilian leaders of the Defense Department have said repeatedly that we don't need and cannot afford any more B-2's. 
Now, on depot maintenance, which is the most difficult issue that we faced, it took the longest time to resolve in this conference, and that issue is how do we allocate depot maintenance work of the closing air logistics centers at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. With a lot of jobs at stake, there are obviously strong feelings on both sides of this issue. And those feelings are understandable. 
I think we all ought to realize that people who have an interest in their home States are going to fight strongly for those States and for what they perceive as fairness for their home States. That is why we are here--at least one of the reasons we are here--to represent strongly the interests of our own State. And so the kind of strength that we faced in the feelings on this issue was understandable and it is understandable. 
The Depot Caucus representatives of the depots that remain open felt that the President had ignored the spirit of the base closure process by pursuing a policy of privatizing the work at Kelly and McClellan, and that was the so-called privatization or privatizing-in-place approach. The Senators from Texas and California fought equally strongly to ensure that the work could remain at the closed depots. 
Now, I will state candidly that I disagreed with the assertion of the Depot Caucus that the Base Closure Commission prohibited privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan, and I have said this before, that in my judgment the 1995 Base Closure Commission left it up to the Department of Defense to decide how to redistribute the Kelly and McClellan work. The Commission's recommendation explicitly directed the Department of Defense to `Consolidate the workloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.' So there was an either/or in the Commission recommendation--either consolidate the work loads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities. 
I also disagreed with the legislation which was proposed by the Depot Caucus which was included in the House bill which would have prohibited the Department from privatizing in place until the three remaining Air Force depots were operating at 80 percent of capacity--in effect prohibiting the Air Force from keeping any of the work in California or Texas. 
I voted against that proposal in our committee, and I voted against it in conference because I felt that it was one sided. Had that provision remained in this bill, I would not be supporting the conference report. But as the present Presiding Officer fully knows, that provision is not in this conference report. What we have instead is a provision that is aimed at providing a level playing field for competition between the closed depots and the depots that remain open. 
Now, I have always believed that competition results in the best value to the Department of Defense and to the taxpayers, and I believe it is the right solution to the depot dispute. 
The conference language includes seven specific criteria to help ensure that the Air Force does not tilt the playing field. These requirements were written by Members and staff who are neutral in the fight between the closed bases and the remaining air logistics centers. Now, I reiterate, Members who actually voted against the position of the Depot Caucus in conference took the lead in drafting this compromise, and our sole objective was to ensure a fair competition and each of these requirements was included for that purpose. 
We had some objections from both sides of the issue in the Congress and from the administration about almost every proposal that was ever put on the table, but the bottom line is that we believe this compromise is fair. We believe the Department of Defense can make it work fairly. I support the compromise because I believe it will lead to the fair and open competition that is the best and perhaps the only answer to this dispute. 
We have heard several arguments from opponents of this provision. First, one draft of the compromise bill language contained a sentence which stated that `appropriate consideration may be given to differences in cost or performance risk associated with the location of performance.' 
In the final version, the bill language was replaced with report language which stated:  
The Department would be expected to consider real differences among bidders in cost or capability to perform the work based on factors that would include the proposed location or locations of the workloads. The consideration of such differences does not constitute `preferential treatment.' 
Both the bill language in the earlier version and the report language in the final version gave the Department the flexibility to consider both cost and risk factors associated with the location of performance. Both are consistent with the Department of Defense's current practice, and I just simply cannot see any substantive difference between them. 
Second, opponents of the fair competition compromise oppose a provision authorizing teaming agreements between the public depots and private contractors. In my view, such teaming arrangements simply give each offeror, each bidder, the opportunity to put together its best bid. The Deputy General Counsel of the Department of Defense, who also now happens to be the nominee to be the new Under Secretary of the Air Force, recently testified before the Armed Services Committee that he could not see anything anticompetitive about public/private teaming arrangements. If teaming agreements result in better bids and better value for the Department of Defense and the taxpayer, then it seems to me we should encourage these arrangements and not prohibit them. 
Third, opponents of the compromise language have said that it would unfairly stack the deck against Texas and California by permitting the public depots to fudge their bids by hiding overhead costs. In fact, the fair competition provisions specifically require the Department to consider all direct and indirect costs that will result from the various offers. So, far from permitting the depots to hide costs, the provision requires the Department of Defense to consider all costs. 
The statement of managers states that the Department should consider all savings including `any overhead savings, i.e., reduced administrative costs, more efficient utilization of facilities that would result from the consolidation of work loads for the remaining public facilities.' 
However, it is up to the Department of Defense to determine what overhead savings, if any, may result from a particular offer. Nothing in the conference report or the statement of managers permits or encourages any offeror to hide costs or authorizes the Department to consider any overhead savings that it has not determined to be valid.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I agree with the statement of the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee that section 359 does not apply to any current or future solicitations or contracts for workloads that have already been privatized at a former military installation before the enactment of the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization Act. The conferees were aware of my colleague from Kentucky's concerns about the successful privatization that has already occurred at Louisville and section 359 represents a compromise that does not affect workload currently performed at Louisville under existing contracts or under any recompetition of those contracts. I would also note that the requirements of this provision would not apply to any other workloads that Louisville may choose to compete for, unless those workloads were performed at a military installation that was approved for closure or realignment under the 1995 BRAC round, and are proposed to be converted to private sector performance for the first time.

Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the distinguished Chairman. The depot maintenance provisions in the bill are consistent with DOD's current policy and practice on core logistics capabilities and will not require the Secretary to bring in-house any work currently performed by private contractors. As under current law, the Secretary of Defense gets to decide what capabilities are core logistics capabilities, what workloads are necessary to maintain those capabilities, what is cost efficient, and how much workload is necessary to ensure cost efficiency.

Mr. LEVIN. I agree. This language requires that during peacetime the public depots perform certain types of depot maintenance workloads necessary to retain the capability to maintain mission essential weapon systems, and that sufficient amounts of work should be assigned to these depots in order to ensure that the personnel necessary to perform the maintenance are operating efficiently. This does not mean that the Department would be required to perform maintenance on all mission essential weapon systems within public depots; it simply requires that the Department retain a capability to maintain this equipment, should it become necessary.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before I yield 4 minutes to my friend from New Mexico, let me also add my thanks to Senator Byrd for the tremendous contribution he makes to the committee. We all know the contribution he makes to the Senate, but he makes also an important contribution to the Armed Services Committee, which is not noted as often as it should be but I want to note right now. 
I thank him for his support of the conference report.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the arguments that has been made is that if this conference report is enacted that the private industry will be reluctant to bid on the work of the closed depots. In fact, some elements of industry had announced that they intended to bid on the Kelly and McClellan work well before the compromise was even written. Most of the concerns raised by those groups relate either to features of the current law that they don't like, or to features of the compromise that the Department of Defense has accepted as fair and not sought to change. 
We cannot just simply give the work to industry without any competition. We must have fair competition. That was the purpose of these provisions in the bill. Those of us who wrote these provisions have no depots at stake, and no issues at stake in our States. In fact, we voted against the provision of the Depot Caucus in the conference because we thought it was one-sided. I voted against a similar provision which was offered by Senators here during our deliberations in the Armed Services Committee. But those of us who have drafted the provision in this final bill have intended and attempted--and we think succeeded--in drafting a provision which will ensure fair and open competition. That is our goal. We don't want to tilt this one way or the other. 
We couldn't get the parties to reach an agreement. We waited months for the parties to try to reach an agreement. We tried to negotiate an agreement that everybody would agree to. We couldn't get everybody to agree to any particular language. We never could reach an agreement. 
Finally, those of us who had the responsibility of bringing a bill to the floor, and getting a defense bill passed because of all the critical provisions in here for our military people, decided we would draft the best possible provision that we could that would guarantee open and fair competition and would not tilt this one way or the other. We have that responsibility, and we think we carried it out fairly. 
One significant part of this compromise is a simple sentence which is aimed at guaranteeing a level playing field for both sides. The sentence states: 
No offeror may be given any preferential consideration for, or in any way be limited to, performing the workload in-place or at any other single location. 
That sentence means exactly what it says. No preferential consideration may be given to Kelly and McClellan, and no preferential consideration may be given to the depots that remain open. They have to compete on a level playing field. 
That is what this compromise is all about. At one point the argument was made that by prohibiting the Air Force from giving preferential consideration to either side that we might somehow preclude them from considering real differences in cost or risk. I don't accept that argument. We consider legitimate differences in cost and risk in virtually every competition. That is fair consideration--not preferential consideration. It is not preferential treatment to consider differences in cost and risk any more than it is preferential treatment to award a contract to the low bidder. 
My staff has confirmed this with top procurement officials at the Department of Defense. Although we did not believe the concern to be well-founded, the conferees decided to remove any question over the interpretation of this language by clarifying in the 
statement of managers that the consideration of differences in cost or risk associated with the location of performance is not preferential consideration, and the managers' language states that consideration of such differences in cost and risk is not only permitted but it is expected. 
In short, we bent over backwards to address concerns about this proposed compromise. This is a fair compromise. It provides a level playing field without preference to either side. And I hope that the Senate will act to put this issue behind us. 
We also heard the statement that the requirement for the Department of Defense to ensure that the depots are operated as cost effectively as possible will have the effect of precluding any work from going to the private sector. That statement is not accurate. 
Nothing in the depot maintenance provisions requires that all the work go to the depots, as has also been stated. Under these provisions, the Secretary would retain broad discretion to determine which workloads should be retained in public depots and which should be subject to private-public competition. 
First, the sentence in question is nothing more than a clarification of existing law which already requires the Department of Defense to:  
. . . maintain a logistics capability, including personnel, equipment, and facilities to ensure . . . 
That word is in existing law. 
. . . a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources for contingency situations. 
And prohibits the contracting out of any logistics activity identified by the Secretary as necessary to maintain that logistics capability. 
Second, this sentence applies only to workloads that the Secretary of Defense determines to be necessary to maintain core logistics capability. Under current law, the Secretary gets to decide what capabilities are core logistics capability. And the Secretary gets to decide what workloads are necessary to maintain those capabilities. 
Third, the Secretary of Defense--not the Congress--gets to decide what is cost efficient and how much workload is necessary to ensure cost efficiency. The statement of managers expressly states that this provision does not require the performance of all core logistics workload in public depots. 
This is what the statement of managers says: 
The provision does not require that maintenance for all weapons systems necessary for the execution of DOD's strategic and contingency plans be performed at public facilities. 
In short, it is the Secretary--not the Congress nor the depot caucus. It is the Secretary who gets to decide what functions will be performed in-house under this provision. 
On the basis of extensive consultation with the Department of Defense officials, starting last spring, we are convinced that the depot maintenance provisions in the bill are consistent with the Department's current policy and practice on core logistics capability, and will not require the Secretary to bring in-house any work currently performed by private contractors. 
In fact, the Department of Defense has informed us that on the basis of the bill's change from 60-40 to 50-50 they expect to be able to contract out slightly more work than they can under current law. 
The main argument that is being made here is that somehow or other this bill prevents real competition. I assure our colleagues that this bill not only intends to guarantee fair competition, but is the best effort that we know how to make--those of us that have no stake in the outcome of this debate--this is the best effort that we can make to objectively and fairly come up with provisions which will guarantee and ensure as fair and open a competition as possible. 
Far from prohibiting public-private competition, these provisions mandate competition for depot maintenance work, and require that all qualified public and private sector offerors be permitted to compete. 
The provisions establish seven simple conditions to ensure that this competition is carried out on a level playing field. Again, I emphasize these provisions were written by Members and staff who are neutral in the fight between the closed bases and the remaining Air Force depots. The sole objective here is to ensure fair competition. And each of the provisions was included for that purpose alone--a 
level playing field for competition by ensuring that appropriate factors are considered in a balanced manner. The bill expressly prohibits the Department from giving any preferential treatment to either the closed depots or the remaining ALCs.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let us be clear about the letter that was printed in the Record. That letter is not a statement of the President. That was what the senior advisers said they would do if certain problems cannot be solved. We think those problems have been solved in this bill. They can be solved in the implementation of this bill. 
One of the arguments, just to give you an example, that the opponents of this bill made, is that the provision authorizing teaming agreements between public depots and private contractors is anticompetitive. We asked the Defense Department when they were up in front of us as to whether or not they were anticompetitive. And here I am going to read the specific question of Senator Kempthorne: 
Do you believe that allowing public depots and private enterprise to team together to bid on these workloads is anticompetitive? And, if so, would you explain why. 
We have heard this morning, and we heard before that the teaming provision is one of the so-called anticompetitive provisions in this bill. What does the Defense Department have to say about that? Their current Deputy General Counsel, Mr. Peters, who was before the Armed Services Committee the other day, when asked that question by Senator Kempthorne said the following: 
Senator Kempthorne, I do not believe and I do not believe the Department feels that that provision is anticompetitive. We certainly do not feel it is anticompetitive. 
This bill has been stymied for months over one provision. We need a defense authorization bill for many, many reasons. There are provisions in here that are critically important to the well-being of the men and women in the military. When the parties who have a direct interest in this dispute could not resolve this dispute in a way satisfactory to all of them, Senator Thurmond and I decided that we would get our staffs working and do the very best we could to have a fair and open competition provision. 
That is what we have accomplished. There is not one senior defense official who is on record as saying that this provision does not provide for a fair and open competition. It is not the Defense Department that has gone on record as saying that this is not a workable provision to create a fair and open competition. Not one senior official in the Defense Department has so stated on 
the record. 
May I say, I have had a number of off-the-record conversations with members of the Defense Department which lead me to conclude that this is a very workable provision, indeed. 
Mr. President, the President has not said he will veto this bill. I don't believe he has decided what to do. I hope that when he weighs the pros and cons in this bill that he will sign this bill. It is important to the uniformed military. It is important to the security of this Nation. 
I want to close by thanking my good friend, Chairman Thurmond, and his staff. He and our staffs have worked together, very, very well together, throughout the consideration of this bill.  
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 5 years ago Congress directed EPA, in consultation with NOAA and the Army Corps, to conduct a comprehensive survey of data regarding aquatic sediment quality in the United States. Sometime within the next few weeks, this long overdue report will be submitted to Congress. Because of the widespread contamination that EPA, working with the Army Corps and NOAA, has found, this report should sound an alarm for all of us. While we have made great progress on preventing pollution from many sources, we have severely neglected the problem of contaminated sediments. This contamination is a legacy of decades of hoping that pollution would flow down the drain or off the land and out of sight never to bother us again. But, now we know where a significant portion of it is and it's not going anywhere soon until we do something about it. 
The report, `The Incidence and Severity of Sediment Contamination in Surface Waters of the United States,' identifies approximately 96 areas of probable concern [APC's]. In these watershed areas, sampling indicates there is a significant possibility of adverse aquatic wildlife or human health effects due to contaminated sediments. These APC's can be found throughout the country including Boston Harbor, the Detroit River, Green Bay, along the Mississippi, Puget Sound, San Francisco Bay, Seal Beach, Mobile Bay to the Middle Savannah, to name a few. This concentration of sites is surprising when one considers that of the 2,111 watersheds recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey, there is no sediment quality information on about 90 percent of them or about 1,900 watersheds. 
Mr. President, this report has to be used with caution because it is only a first step. There is obviously insufficient information to make sweeping claims about the extent of contamination in sediments across the country, though EPA plans to develop the report into a national sediment inventory, a continually updated centralized assemblage of sediment quality measurements and state-of-the-art assessment techniques. However, `based on the evaluation [in the report], sediment contamination exists at levels indicating a probability of adverse effects in all regions and states of the country.' We must be cautious too about leaping directly from evidence of contamination to evidence of adverse effects due to that contamination. Unfortunately, Federal Government agencies have been slow to agree upon and provide sediment quality guidelines to inform States and the public about contamination that could cause adverse human health effects. This sluggishness has prevented development of the true picture of the potential risks contaminated sediments pose. 
In the Great Lakes, we have been concentrating our efforts on contaminated sediments for some time. We realized some time ago that our industrial legacy would need attention. That is why I authored the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990, which formalized the process of developing remedial action plans [RAP's] in areas of concern [AOC] in the Great Lakes, where beneficial uses are impaired. These AOC's are not too dissimilar to the APC's described in the sediment report, because contaminated sediments are a significant component of the environmental and public health risk associated with AOC's. Unfortunately, despite all of the efforts by local and State governments to prepare RAP's, very little Federal money has gone into their development and even less into implementing them to clean up the waste and prevent further contamination. That needs to change. 
The Federal Government has to commit more of its resources to helping States and local governments clean up the industrial legacy that lurks beneath the water's surface in harbors and rivers across the Nation. To date, Federal agencies have been too reluctant to carefully examine the risks that these contaminated sediments pose for fear of the costs of cleanup and because the technologies necessary have not been adequately developed. But, as we have learned in the Great Lakes, these contaminated sediments are the source of much of the continuing pollution of our surface waters, as they recirculate pollutants into the water bodies that are then taken up by fish, birds, humans, and other living organisms. So, if our goal is to have fishable and swimmable waters again, we need to use every took that we can to begin addressing the cleanup. 
I am introducing legislation today to authorize the use of Superfund money to expedite remediation of contaminated sediment sites across the Nation. Many of the most persistent, bioaccumulative toxics found in contaminated sediments are derived from the same chemical feedstocks taxed to fill the Hazardous Substance Superfund, so it is most appropriate that those moneys be used to clean up sediments. 
The bill allows the EPA Administrator to use the Superfund to remediate contaminated sediments, but limits the amount to no more than $300 million annually. In expending funds, EPA is to give priority consideration to sediment sites which do or could adversely affect human health or the environment. Further, there is a preference given for sites in watersheds where the local governments are actively engaged in trying to prevent further contamination of the sediment and are willing to contribute 25 percent or more of the costs of remediation. 
Under the bill, EPA would have to do a better job of integrating its Water and Superfund programs' approach to contaminated sediments. Specifically, the hazardous ranking system used in Superfund to estimate the potential risks associated with a conventional terrestrial site will be revisited to determine if it adequately assesses risks associated with aquatic contaminated sediments. And, EPA would be required to promulgate final numerical sediment quality criteria for the 10 toxic, persistent, or bioaccumulative substances most likely to adversely affect human health and the environment by 2001. 
In addition, EPA would have to identify the 20 contaminated sediment sites that are most likely to adversely affect human health and the environment and have not been the subject of Federal or State response actions. And, to address the lack of data on contaminated sediments at Superfund sites, EPA would have to report on their occurrence and associated risk. 
Mr. President, I consider this to be a fairly modest bill. It does not set aside a specific percentage of the Superfund that must be spent on contaminated sediment cleanup, through I think that might also be helpful. And, it does not place great demands on Federal agencies, States or local governments. What it does do, however, is seek to bring resources and attention to bear on a very pressing problem. This problem has been clearly illustrated in EPA's report and it is a tenacious one that will not get any smaller. Unfortunately, our current system lets contaminated sediments fall between the regulatory and environmental policy cracks in the pier. And, there it will stay on our harbor and river bottoms, polluting fish, water, and vegetation until we act. 
I urge my colleagues from all parts of the country to consider cosponsoring this legislation, but particularly want to encourage the attention of Senators from coastal areas or from States with environmentally sensitive and industrialized watersheds. I believe that the approach taken in this bill is a necessary first step toward cleaning up contaminated sediments and I will be working to incorporate this into whatever Superfund reauthorization bill comes before the Senate.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator McCain in introducing the Federal Reports Elimination Act of 1997, which will eliminate or modify 187 outdated or unnecessary congressionally mandated reporting requirements. This legislation will reduce unnecessary paperwork generated, and staff time spent, in producing reports to Congress that are no longer relevant or useful. 
Senator McCain and I introduced and got enacted similar legislation in 1995, Public Law 104-66, the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995. In that legislation we eliminated or modified 207 congressionally mandated reporting requirements and placed a 4-year sunset on all other reports that were required to be made on an annual or otherwise regular basis. We also required in that legislation that the President include in the first annual budget submitted after the date of enactment of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 a list of the congressionally mandated reports that he has determined to be unnecessary or wasteful. The President provided a list of nearly 400 reports in the fiscal year 1997 budget along with comments on why the agencies involved felt the reporting requirements should be eliminated or modified. In many instances, the administration states, the reports are obsolete or contain duplicate information already conveyed to Congress in another report or publication. 
For example, one report that is required of the Department of Agriculture asks the agency to provide to Congress a list of the advisory committee members, principal place of residence, persons or companies by whom they are employed, and other major sources of income. This information may be useful at the agency level, but is not significant to Congress. The administration's recommendation for elimination of this report stated that the `preparation of this report is time consuming and may not be of particular interest to Congress. If the requirement for an annual report is deleted, the information contained in the report would still be available upon request.' 
Another example of unnecessary reporting is the requirement to provide reports for programs that have never been funded. The Department of Energy was tasked to provide a biennial update to the National Advanced Materials Initiative Five-Year Program Plan in support of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, for which funds were never provided. The Department of Justice never received funding for a program that required the submission of a report to the Judiciary Committee on the security of State and local immigration and naturalization documents and any improvements that occurred as a result of the Immigration Nursing Relief Act of 1989. The Department of Transportation has never received funding for a requirement to study the effects of climatic conditions on the costs of highway construction and maintenance. The National Advisory Commission on Resource Conservation and Recovery for the Environmental Protection Agency is tasked with providing an interim report of its activities. This Commission was established and commissioned in 1981 and has never met nor received funding for its activities. 
The Vice President's National Performance Review estimated that Congress requires executive branch agencies to prepare more than 5,300 reports each year. That number has increased dramatically from only 750 such reports required by Congress in 1970. The GAO reports that Congress imposes close to 300 new requirements on Federal agencies each year. 
And preparation of these reports costs money. The Department of Agriculture estimated in 1993 that it spent more than $40 million in preparing 280 mandated reports. 
In developing this bill, Senator McCain and I wrote to the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant Senate committees and asked them to review the list of reports, under their jurisdiction, that the administration identified as no longer necessary or useful and, therefore, ready for elimination or modification. We wanted to be sure that the committees of jurisdiction concurred with the administration in their assessment of the lack of need for these reports. Many of the committees responded to the request. Those responses were generally supportive and some contained only a few changes to the administration's recommendations. Some committees identified reports under their jurisdiction which they wanted to retain because the information contained in the report is still of use to the committee. Those suggestions were incorporated into the bill so that the bill reflects only those reports for which there is general agreement about elimination or modification. 
Senator McCain and I are introducing this bipartisan legislation to reduce the paperwork burdens placed on Federal agencies, streamline the information that flows from these agencies to Congress, and ultimately save millions of taxpayer dollars. I hope we can act quickly on this legislation.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly outstanding business leader and philanthropist from my home State of Michigan, William Davidson. Bill Davidson has been chosen as the honorary chair of the Council of Michigan Foundations 25th annual conference, which takes place November 5-7, 1997. 
Bill Davidson is one of Michigan's most renowned businesspeople. He is the chairman of the board and president of Guardian Industries, an international manufacturer of flat glass products for the construction and automotive industries. He is also the majority owner of the Detroit Pistons Basketball Club, the Palace Sports and Entertainment Arena, Pine Knob Music Theater, the Detroit Vipers hockey team, and the Detroit Neon soccer team. 
Bill has received numerous citations and awards for his philanthropic activities, his contributions to the glass industry, and professional sports. Some of these awards include the Phoenix Award, an honorary doctoral degree from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, the Order of Merit in Labor of the Highest Class from the Republic of Venezuela, the Fred M. Butzel Award for Distinguished Community Service, and membership in the Michigan Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. 
One of Bill Davidson's most remarkable traits is his commitment to improving the lives of people throughout the world. Giving is an important part of his life, and he is known locally and nationally for his philanthropic vision and generosity. He does not take success for granted and is most thankful for what he has achieved. As a result, he chooses to support institutions and programs which help develop the minds and bodies of tomorrow's leaders. 
It is this commitment to philanthropy that was the guiding force for his creation of the Pistons-Palace Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the Detroit Pistons and the Palace of Auburn Hills. Bill Davidson and the foundation have contributed millions of dollars to support meaningful youth and recreation programs throughout metropolitan Detroit. The Pistons-Palace Foundation is quickly gaining recognition in the National Basketball Association and receiving national attention for its work in the city of Detroit, specifically through the PARK program, which works to revitalize neighborhoods by refurbishing and renovating parks and installing outdoor basketball courts and other recreation equipment at sites. 
Developing tomorrow's leaders through higher education is another of Bill Davidson's highest priorities. He contributed $35 million to establish the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan School of Business Administration. The institute strives to help countries as they make the transition to free market economies and to assist companies which seek to operate successfully in those countries. To that end, the Davidson Institute offers seminars for business and government leaders from countries with economies in transition and develops faculty fellows who teach or work in those countries upon completion of the program. Bill also established the world's first educational institution entirely dedicated to the international management of technology-based companies at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. Bill Davidson's commitment to keeping Jewish education strong led him to help to create graduate school of Jewish education at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City, which trains educators for North America. 
It is not possible to do Bill Davidson's lifetime of good works justice in a few words, but there is no doubt among anyone who knows of him that he is a truly remarkable person. His dedication to improving people's lives and the unpretentious way he goes about that quest has earned him respect and gratitude from countless people around the world. Millions more who will never know of Bill Davidson have benefited from his efforts and accomplishments. 
Mr. President, all of us in this body can learn from the examples set by Bill Davidson. I know my colleagues will join me in offering him congratulations and best wishes on this important occasion.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I expect that the Senate will give its approval to President Clinton's nomination of Dr. Edward Gramlich. This will bring the career of this distinguished University of Michigan professor full circle. Thirty-two years ago, Dr. Gramlich had his first professional experience with a research job at the Federal Reserve. Shortly, he will be returning to the place where he got his start in 1965, although this time he will not be a researcher but a Member of the Board. 
Dr. Gramlich received his BA from Williams College and his MA and Ph.D. from Yale University. Since then he has held positions in a variety of government and academic areas. His academic positions include over 20 years at the University of Michigan as Dean of the School of Public Policy, Chairman of the Economics Department, Director of the Institute of Public Policy Studies and always Professor of Economics and Public Policy. He also held temporary positions at various other universities including Monash, George Washington, Cornell and Stockholm Universities. 
Dr. Gramlich's government and research experience covers a wide range of subject areas. In 1970, he was the Director of the Public Research Division at the Office of Economic Opportunity where he studied economically efficient ways of dealing with poverty. In his capacity as Deputy and later Acting Director of the Congressional Budget Office, he worked to reduce the burgeoning deficits of the mid-1980s. While working on the Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security, he proposed a plan to preserve the social protections now built into Social Security while providing for enough total saving so that future retirement benefits can be preserved. In addition, Dr. Gramlich has written dozens of journal articles and reports on issues ranging from Social Security and school finances to Major League Baseball and deficit reduction. 
In Dr. Gramlich's testimony before the Banking Committee hearing on his nomination, he said, `I strongly feel that both economic and social goals are important. . . . A good economist should know how to balance both objectives, which is what I have tried to do throughout my career.' This philosophy culled from his substantial experience has served his well in many capacities. The Banking Committee showed its full confidence in him in voting to approve the nomination, and I fully expect him to fulfill the expectations that the President and the Senate have placed in him.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we will move to this conference report. This conference report contains hundreds of legislative provisions, thousands of funding provisions which had to be resolved. The issue that took us the longest to resolve was the difference about depot maintenance work at the closed air logistic centers at Kelly and McClellan. Probably the last month was taken up trying to resolve that issue. No agreement was ever reached. 
So we, the members of the committee, had to do the best that we could to try to reach a fair and a just conclusion that would not tilt this toward either direction. That is what we attempted to do. 
Otherwise, we would give up on getting a defense authorization bill to the floor and we were not willing to give up that. There are too many issues at stake in this bill that are important to this country not to bring this bill to the floor and not to bring the conference report to the floor. 
We know there are very strong feelings on both sides of the depot issue, and it is understandable. To ever denigrate the strength of any Members' feeling about regulating the interests of their State--I think all of us have to accept that feelings are very strong on this issue. Representatives of some States felt that the President had ignored the spirit of the base closure process by pursuing a policy of privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan. Others felt equally strongly that the work should remain at the closed depots. 
I will state candidly that I disagreed with the assertion of the depot caucus that the Base Closure Commission prohibited privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan. The 1995 Base Closure Commission left it up to the Department of Defense to decide how to distribute the Kelly and McClellan work. The Commission's recommendation directed the Department of Defense to `Consolidate the workloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.' That `or' is a critical `or' in the BRAC report. 
I also disagreed with the legislation proposed in the depot caucus and included in the House bill which would have prohibited the department from privatizing in place until the three remaining Air Force depots were operating at 80 percent of capacity--in effect, prohibiting the Air Force from keeping any of the work at California or Texas. I voted against that proposal in our committee and I voted against it in conference because it was one-sided and unfair. Had that provision been included in this bill, I would have strongly opposed the conference report. 
Mr. President, that provision is not in the conference report. But what we have instead are provisions aimed at providing a level playing field for competition between the closed depots and the depots that remain open. I have always believed that competition results in the best value to the Department of Defense and to the taxpayers, and I believe that is the right answer to the depot dispute. 
The conference language includes seven specific criteria to help ensure that the Air Force does not unfairly tilt the playing field.

Mr. LEVIN. These requirements were written by Members and staff who are neutral in the fight between the closed bases and the remaining air logistic centers. Our sole objective was to ensure a fair competition, and each of these requirements was included for that purpose. 
We had complaints from both sides of the issue from the Congress, from the administration, about every single proposal that was put on the table. It went on for months. But the bottom line is that sooner or later those of us who were not involved in this struggle had to reach a conclusion as to what would be a fair and just competition. We believe we achieved that, and that the Defense Department can make it work to achieve a fair and open competition. 
I say that after many consultations between my staff and myself and the Defense Department. I support this compromise because I believe it will lead to a fair and open competition that is the only answer to this dispute. Keeping this dispute going and going and going is not going to resolve this dispute. We learned that from months of fruitless effort.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on that subject, I didn't realize that such a resolution was coming forward this evening. But having heard the nature of the resolution, I commend my good friend from Vermont for forwarding this on behalf of the sponsors of the resolution. As it happened, by pure coincidence, today in the Foreign Relations Committee, I supported the nomination of David Hermelin, of Michigan, to be our Ambassador to Norway. I made reference to the fact that Mrs. Ruppe, also from Michigan, had served with tremendous distinction as our Ambassador to Norway, as well as she had served the Peace Corps as its director. 
So it is quite a coincidence that this resolution is coming forward today with her name commemorated at the Foreign Relations Committee with great warmth. I wanted to just rise to give my strong support to this resolution. It is highly appropriate.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate World Food Day. World Food Day takes place on October 16 and in the words of Catherine Bertini, executive Director of the U.N. World Food Program, is an opportunity to `not only rededicate ourselves to the battle against hunger and poverty but also acknowledge that millions of people have been saved from the scourge of famine because of the commitment of the United States and other members of the international community.' I would also like to honor the many humanitarian relief workers who often risk their lives to deliver assistance. 
Natural disasters and civil unrest can produce countless refugees with no way of feeding themselves. Humanitarian relief workers often brave grave dangers in these situations to deliver food to the hungry. One of the many heroes who risk their lives to feed the needy is, Russell Ulrey, of Detroit, MI. In 1993, Mr. Ulrey served as emergency logistics coordinator in southern Sudan for the World Food Program, the largest international food aid organization in the world. During his time in Sudan, Russell Ulrey led a barge trip up the Nile to feed hungry Sudanese. This dangerous trip led Ulrey through the heart of that nation's bloody civil war. Ulrey's mission came under fire several times but succeeded in delivering eight barges carrying 2,600 tons of food. Ulrey's trip up the Nile was the first of 25 that WFP made, delivering 65,000 tons of food. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to highlight the exploits of Russell Ulrey and the thousands of other relief workers that risk their lives daily to feed the world's needy. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring their efforts and World Food Day.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sojourner Truth, a leader in the abolitionist movement and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of equality for women. The 200th anniversary of Sojourner Truth's birth is being celebrated this year throughout the United States. 
Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree in 1797 in Ulster County, NY and served as a slave under several different masters. She bore four children who survived infancy, and all except one daughter were sold into slavery. Baumfree became a freed slave in 1828 when New York State outlawed slavery. She remained in New York and instituted successful legal proceedings to secure the return of her son, Peter, who had been illegally sold to a slave-owner from Alabama. 
In 1843, Baumfree, in response to a perceived command from God, changed her name to Sojourner Truth and dedicated her life to traveling and lecturing. She began her migration west in 1850, where she shared the stage with other abolitionist leaders such as Frederick Douglass. In October 1856, Truth came to Battle Creek, MI, with Quaker leader Henry Willis to speak at a Friends of Human Progress meeting. She eventually bought a house and settled in the area. Her antislavery, women's rights, and temperance arguments brought Battle Creek both regional and national recognition. Sojourner Truth died at her home in Battle Creek, November 26, 1883, having lived quite an extraordinary life. 
Sojourner Truth was a powerful voice in the women's suffrage movement, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the right of all women to vote. She was a political activist who personally conversed with President Abraham Lincoln on behalf of freed, unemployed slaves, and campaigned for Ulysses S. Grant in the Presidential election in 1868. Sojourner was a woman of great passion and determination who was spiritually motivated to preach and teach in ways that have had a profound and lasting imprint on American history. 
In 1851, Sojourner delivered her famous `Ain't I a Woman?' speech at the Women's Convention in Akron, OH. She spoke from her heart about the most troubling issues of her time. Her words on that day in Ohio are a testament to Sojourner Truth's convictions and are a part of the great legacy she left for us all.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of Mr. Peter Karmanos, Jr., Peter who is being honored on November 4, 1997, by the Detroit B'nai B'rith Foundation with the 1997 Great American Traditions Award. 
B'nai B'rith is awarding its highest honor, the Great American Traditions Award, to Peter Karmanos for `. . . his concern for the sick, for his understanding of the abused, and for the quiet, unassuming way he provides for others.' 
Peter Karmanos is a name with which many people around the Nation are familiar. Some know him because he is the chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Compuware Corp., which is one of the largest independent software vendors in the world. Peter helped to make a small startup company into Michigan's fifth largest exporter, a company with more than 7,000 employees worldwide. Peter has striven to make Compuware a healthy and friendly place to work, providing a company-subsidized cafeteria, day-care center, and wellness center, as well as racquetball and basketball courts at its world headquarters in Farmington Hills, MI. 
Others know of Peter Karmanos because he co-owns the Carolina Panthers of the National Hockey League and the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League. Peter's passion for hockey has led him to sponsor youth hockey teams, which have given countless young people the opportunity to play the sport Peter loves so much. 
Peter Karmanos has earned a reputation as an outstanding leader in his industry and in the world of sports. But he is perhaps most remarkable for the extraordinary support he has given to efforts to make his community a healthier and safer place. In 1995, Peter made the single largest contribution in Michigan history to fight cancer, donating $15 million to establish the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, in honor of his first wife. The institute integrated the efforts of the major cancer-fighting organizations in Detroit--the Michigan Cancer Foundation, the Meyer L. Prentis Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Detroit Medical Center, and Wayne State University. Peter and his wife, Debra, have involved Compuware in the nationwide cancer research fundraiser `A Race for the Cure.' Debra and Peter also cochaired the first ever major fundraiser for HAVEN, a shelter for abused women. 
Mr. President, Peter Karmanos truly exemplifies the spirit of the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions Award. His corporate citizenship and dedication to improving the lives of others are truly an inspiration. I hope my colleagues will join with me in offering congratulations and best wishes to Peter Karmanos on this important occasion.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor and strong supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill, and I want to explain this afternoon in some detail why I support a key section in the bill that is the subject of much debate. It is section 201, the provision that is intended to stop what we call issue ad abuse. By issue ad abuse I mean the mislabeling of candidate ads as issue ads in order to evade contribution limits and the disclosure requirements that now exist in Federal campaign law. 
I want to emphasize this point because it has been overlooked, it seems to me, by so many of us during this debate. Current law restricts contributions and the Buckley case has upheld that restriction as being consistent with the first amendment. Section 201 is not only constitutional within Buckley but it is also critically important to campaign finance reform. I want to spend some time explaining why. 
Now, Buckley--which I think has been cited by just about everybody who has spoken in this debate--is the touchstone for drafting constitutionally permissible Federal campaign finance laws. So I want to start with Buckley. In Buckley, the Supreme Court upheld a strict set of limits on campaign contributions to Federal candidates, despite impassioned argument, including by the ACLU, that such limits impermissibly restricted first amendment rights of free speech and free association. 
This is what the Court said in Buckley, and I will be quoting at some length because it is critical in understanding the permissible limits of campaign finance law and limits: 
It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions--in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a successful campaign. The increasing importance of the communications media and sophisticated mass mailing and polling operations to effective campaigning make the raising of large sums of money an ever more essential ingredient of an effective candidacy. To the extent that large contributions are given to secure political quid pro quo's from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . . 
Of almost equal concern is the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements and the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. . . . 
And the Court went on: 
Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence `is also critical. . . if confidence in the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.' . . . Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed. 
In other words, the Supreme Court explicitly held in Buckley that eliminating actual and apparent corruption of our electoral system--corruption which is `inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions'--was a compelling enough interest to justify Congress in imposing campaign contribution limits, although such limits collide with unfettered first amendment rights of free expression and free association. 
The Supreme Court adopted a balancing test, looking at what was the restriction on the first amendment compared to the public interest in avoiding the appearance of corruption in elections where there are unlimited financial contributions. 
Now, what did the Supreme Court do in the area of contributions? They upheld a $1,000 contribution limit on contributions that an individual may make to a Federal candidate. Despite the argument that that limit collided with pure free speech rights--an argument made by the ACLU in the Buckley case and not adopted by the Supreme Court in Buckley--quite the opposite. They approved the contribution limit. The Supreme Court not only said that the $1,000 limit on contributions to candidates was constitutional, but it also upheld an overall ceiling of $25,000 on the amount of money that a single individual could give to all Federal candidates in a single year. 
Now, how does the Court explain that? If the $1,000 limit is constitutional, how, then, would it be constitutional to limit the number of $1,000 contributions in effect to 25 candidates? Why shouldn't people be allowed to give $1,000 to 50 candidates if they want? 
The language of the Court is again very instructive as to the balancing test that they adopted relative to weighing limits on contributions and any impingement on first amendment rights. Here is what the Supreme Court said:  
The overall $25,000 ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction on the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support. But this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate or huge contributions to the candidate's political party. 
The Supreme Court went on to say: 
The limited additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid. 
So the Buckley Court not only upheld limits on contributions of $1,000 per candidate per election, they also upheld an overall limit of $25,000 in a test which weighed the restrictions on associational freedoms and first amendment freedoms against the need for clean elections, against the need to avoid the appearance of corruption, which in the Supreme Court's words, arises from unlimited financial contributions to candidates. 
The Supreme Court said Congress may try to avoid the appearance of corruption that results from unlimited contribution to candidates by putting limits on the contributions to any one candidate and on the total number of contributions to all candidates combined. Why? In order to prevent `evasion of the contribution limit' by a person who might `contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate or huge contributions to the candidate's political party.' 
That is Buckley. Now, we haven't heard a lot about that part of Buckley in this debate yet, but that's Buckley. We have heard, and properly so, about that part of Buckley which put limits on expenditures and acts inconsistent with the first amendment. But what we have not heard enough of is those parts of Buckley which rule constitutional the limits on contributions to candidates. It is that part of Buckley that upholds the constitutionality of limits on contributions, which is at the core of McCain-Feingold. Because it is in order to avoid the evasion of existing law and its limits on contributions that the McCain-Feingold bill is designed as it is. That is why we believe that it is perfectly consistent with Buckley. 
The Buckley opinion also upheld disclosure requirements. By sustaining these disclosure requirements, the Supreme Court effectively approved the prohibition of anonymous or secret contributions to any candidate or political committee. It also effectively approved the prohibition of direct campaign spending by anonymous or secret persons. Again, the Supreme Court adopted a balancing test even when it came to disclosure. 
I know that the Presiding Officer has a particular interest in the need for disclosure--an interest that I think most Members of this body share. Many of us also want to put limits on soft money contributions. On that, there is a difference inside this body. But in terms of disclosure, I know that the Presiding Officer has had a very sincere and a very longstanding interest, one I think most of us would share. 
Here is what the Court said relative to the first amendment's application to disclosure requirements: 
Compelled disclosure has the potential for substantially infringing on the exercise of first amendment rights. But we have acknowledged that there are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement, particularly when the free functioning of our national institutions is involved. The governmental interests sought to be vindicated by the disclosure requirements are of this magnitude. 
So, again, it is a weighing test. The Supreme Court said explicitly that compelled disclosure--which I think probably all of us in this body support in one fashion or another--has the potential for substantially infringing on the exercise of first amendment rights. But then the Court went on to weigh the value of disclosure against the infringement and said that we have a legitimate public interest in coming down on the side of disclosure. The Court listed three compelling interests in requiring disclosure. 
Later Supreme Court decisions built upon the base provided in Buckley. One key case was Austin versus Michigan State Chamber of Commerce in 1990. The Supreme Court in Austin upheld a Michigan State law which prohibited corporations from making independent expenditures, except through a political action committee which is subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements. Despite the corporation's argument that its first amendment rights were being violated, the Supreme Court specifically held that Michigan could bar the corporation from placing an ad endorsing a specific candidate. 
In other words, a corporation was told by the Supreme Court that Michigan has a right to prevent you from putting on an ad that endorses a candidate. It quoted extensively from the Massachusetts Citizens For Life case, a 1986 case. 
Here is what the Supreme Court said in the Michigan case, again quoting an earlier case significantly but having additional language of its own: 
`The resources in the treasury of a business corporation . . . are not an indication of popular support for the corporation's political ideas. They reflect instead the economically motivated decisions of investors and customers. The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.' We therefore have recognized-- 
Here again, we get into a weighing test that `the compelling governmental interest in preventing corruption support[s] the restriction of the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form.'. . . Regardless of whether this danger of `financial quid pro quo' corruption may be sufficient to justify a restriction on independent expenditures, Michigan's regulation aims at a different type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas. 
So we have contribution limits approved by the Supreme Court. We have disclosure requirements approved by the Supreme Court. We have a ban on corporate independent expenditures except through a PAC approved by the Supreme Court. 
Each of these campaign finance restrictions has been upheld by the Court in the face of arguments that these restrictions were inconsistent with the first amendment. In each of those cases, the Supreme Court acknowledged that there was some impingement on pure first amendment rights but weighed that against the public interest in clean campaigns.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Of course the Senator knows they can run ads saying you ought to be defeated. They can run all of those ads they want. But under the law that we have passed, they must use contributions which comply with the limits which we have adopted. So they are free to run those kind of ads. But they must comply with law when they run those ads. 
The question is whether they should have unlimited, undisclosed funds to run ads which effectively say to defeat or elect somebody but do not comply with the limit. That is what we are facing. 
So, unless the Senator is suggesting that we repeal the existing law, which puts restrictions on contributions for ads which advocate the election or defeat of a candidate--that is the existing law--unless the Senator is proposing that, then it seems to me we should make that law effective and not put form over substance. And when you have two ads which are functionally the same and equivalent, treat one as though it is different from the other. 
That is the issue which we are now facing on the floor, as to whether we want to enforce existing law to eliminate what we call a loophole, which clearly is the avoidance of a magic word in an ad which functionally is the same and which any reasonable person would say unmistakably is calling for the defeat of Congressman Ganske, as an ad which uses the word `defeat' itself. 
But, again, unless the Senator is calling for the repeal of existing law, it seems to me we are then in the situation where we are either going to make those limits work, those contribution limits work, which have been approved by the Supreme Court in Buckley, or else we are going to continue the current system where those limits are evaded and where you have all this soft money which comes into these campaigns, which I don't think was the intent of our law when we adopted the reform that we did after Watergate.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. I think the language of the Furgatch case is such that it is much more than the magic words which determine whether or not an advertisement effectively supports the election or defeat of a candidate. Just to read some of the language from Furgatch, what Furgatch does, of course, is look at that famous --as my good friend from Kentucky knows--footnote in the Buckley case, footnote 52, which uses seven magic words. The question is, are those the only words which determine whether or not an ad advocates expressly the election or defeat of a candidate? 
Here is the Furgatch test. Here is what the Furgatch case says: 
We begin with the proposition that `express advocacy' is not limited to communications using certain key phrases. The short list of words included in the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley does not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. A test requiring the magic words `elect,' `support' or their nearly perfect synonyms for a finding of express advocacy would preserve the first amendment right of unfettered expression only at the expense of eviscerating the Federal Election Campaign Act. Independent campaign spenders working on behalf of candidates could remain just beyond the reach of the act by avoiding certain key words while conveying a message that is unmistakably directed to the election or defeat of a named candidate. 
So they then provided an alternative test. We are now talking about the ninth circuit in Furgatch, which says that the term `express advocacy' means a communication that advocates the election or defeat of a candidate by expressing unmistakable and unambiguous support for or opposition to one or more clearly identified candidates when taken as a whole and with limited reference to external events such as proximity to an election. 
Now, that test was basically adopted by the Federal Election Commission in its current regulation. So we have a current regulation which basically adopts the unmistakable test. Under the law, as I understand it, Congress had about 30 days within which to review that regulation. We did not overturn that regulation of the Federal Election Commission. It has to date, in a case which the Supreme Court refused to review, been left in limbo in the case. 
The Supreme Court, by the way, it has been said in the Chamber here, struck down Furgatch, or more accurately----

Mr. LEVIN. I was just getting the exact wording. 
I think today it was said in the Chamber that the Federal Election Commission test has been stricken by the Supreme Court's decision today, and that is simply not accurate. 
What the Supreme Court decided today was not to review a case, not to review a case from a court of appeals in which the Court said that the Federal Election Commission regulation was not constitutional. But we have another court of appeals in the Furgatch case adopting language which is the basis of the Federal Election Commission regulation, and the Supreme Court didn't review the ninth circuit's decision. So we have two decisions unreviewed by the Supreme Court, the ninth circuit decision with Furgatch language and a first circuit decision with the FEC language which is based on Furgatch----

The ninth circuit has adopted the Furgatch test, which was then adopted by the Federal Election Commission. So we have a situation where we have circuits split. We have the ninth circuit adopting the Furgatch test, saying if something unmistakably calls for election or defeat of a candidate, that amounts to the express advocacy which is prohibited--not prohibited but which is subject to limits and regulations of existing law. You have the fourth circuit and the first circuit that have reached a different conclusion on that. So you have a split in the circuits, and today the Supreme Court as of this moment decided to leave that split where it is, to leave that issue in limbo.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. No; I find it very clear in the fourth and first circuits. But I also find in the ninth circuit, a very clear opinion which reads, in part, as follows: 
We begin with the proposition that `express advocacy' is not strictly limited to communications using certain key phrases. The short list of words included in the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley does not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. A test requiring the magic words `elect,' `support,' et cetera or their nearly perfect synonyms for a finding of express advocacy, would preserve the first amendment right of unfettered expression only at the expense of eviscerating the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
I find those words to be very clear as well, to answer my friend from Kentucky, but the Supreme Court did not accept cert in that case either. So we have the Supreme Court not accepting appeals from circuits which have reached different conclusions. The answer to the question of my friend is I find the words of the fourth circuit clear, I find the words of the first circuit clear, and I find the words of the ninth circuit clear. Very clear. 
What could be clearer than a finding of the circuit court in the ninth circuit that says, `The short list of words included in the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley does not exhaust the capacity of the English language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate'? 
It is a very clear statement. 
The Supreme Court is going to have additional opportunities to address this issue, because there are additional cases which will be coming to the Supreme Court. Hopefully, they will see fit to resolve the dispute between the circuits on this issue. 
Just to briefly continue with the Furgatch court, the Furgatch court went on to say the following: 
First amendment doctrine has long recognized that words take part of their meaning and effect from the environment in which they are spoken. . . . However, context cannot supply a meaning that is incompatible with or simply unrelated to the clear import of the words. With these principles in mind, we propose a standard for `express advocacy' that will preserve the efficacy of the Act without treading upon the freedom of political expression. 
And here is the conclusion of the Furgatch court, again, left where it was by a Supreme Court about 10 years ago. So this is the law in the ninth circuit. The Furgatch court said: 
We conclude that speech need not include any of the words listed in Buckley to be express advocacy under the Act, but it must, when read as a whole, and with limited reference to external events, be susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate. . . . [S]peech is `express' for present purposes if its message is unmistakable and unambiguous, suggestive of only one plausible meaning. 
That test, which I think most of us would agree is a real-world test, that test was adopted by the Federal Election Commission by a vote of 4 to 2. It was adopted after extensive public debate. It was presented to the Congress in 1995 under a mandatory 30-day period of review. It encountered no opposition here, and it encountered no opposition that I know of in the House of Representatives. But, this issue has not been ruled on by the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court, again, as we all know, announced today that it declined to review a case out of the first circuit which went the other way from Furgatch, leaving a split in the circuits between those who do and those who don't approve of using the Furgatch test to distinguish between candidate and issue ads.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Ann Arbor District Library for being chosen the 1997 national library of the year by the Library Journal. The Ann Arbor District Library is being recognized for providing innovative and comprehensive services to the public in a highly responsive manner. Some of the recent changes at the Ann Arbor District Library include investments in technology to provide an extensive CD-ROM collection and Internet and World Wide Web connections. Also of note is the library's award winning welcome to the library packet which is aimed at parents of at-risk children to encourage reading, education, and child safety. All of these innovations have resulted in a significant increase in the library's usage. 
Standing alone, the library's technological innovations, public awareness campaigns and exemplary service would be reason enough to merit this prestigious award. However, what is even more remarkable about the Ann Arbor District Library is that all of these new changes took place during a time of tremendous transition. In 1994, the Ann Arbor District Library was still part of the Ann Arbor Public School System. That same year, voters in Michigan approved a state-wide tax restructuring proposal which had the effect of preventing the Ann Arbor District Library from renewing its tax levy under the school districts. In order to survive, the Ann Arbor District Library had to become its own public entity with its own governing board and its own millage. Not only did the library succeed at doing all of this in only 2 years, but it also managed to institute all of those wonderful changes as well. 
It took the exceptional talents of many dedicated library staff, trustees, and community members to institute new programs and services in a seamless manner to its patrons while simultaneously creating a new public entity from the ground up. In particular, I would like to recognize and congratulate the Ann Arbor District Library's administrative team which consists of the library's director, Mary Anne Hodel and her top deputies, Tim Grimes, Lana Straight, Don Dely, Gary Pollack, and Marge LaRose. 
The Library Journal's selection of the Ann Arbor District Library as the 1997 library of the year is a fitting tribute to all of the hard work that went into establishing this library as an important, well utilized and well run public institution.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I want to speak today about the independent counsel law and the political pressure being put on the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel in the campaign fundraising investigation. 
One Member has called on the Attorney General to resign. Some Members of the House are threatening impeachment proceedings against the Attorney General unless she reaches their conclusion on the appointment of an independent counsel. 
For 18 years I served as either the chairman or ranking Democrat on the subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over the independent counsel law. I have been actively involved in three reauthorizations of this important statute. And having experienced and studied the history of this law, I am deeply disturbed by this type of pressure being exerted. 
Politically motivated attempts to intimidate the Attorney General runs directly counter to the fundamental purpose of the independent counsel law and counter to our constitutional system that makes the prosecution of crimes the sole responsibility of the executive branch. 
The independent counsel law was enacted in the aftermath of Watergate. The Watergate committee recommended, and the Congress agreed, that we need a process by which criminal investigations of our top Government officials should be conducted in an independent manner as free as possible from any taint of favoritism or politics. 
This was necessary, we decided, in order to maintain the public's confidence in one of the basic principles of our democracy, that this is a country that follows the rule of law. So we established a process whereby the Attorney General would follow certain established procedures in reviewing allegations of criminal wrongdoing by top Government officials and decide at certain stages whether to ask a special Federal court to appoint a person from the private sector to become a Government employee to take over the investigation and conduct it independently from the chain of command at the Department of Justice. 
We wanted the public to have confidence that the investigations into alleged criminal conduct by top Government officials were no less aggressive and no more aggressive than similar investigations of average citizens. We particularly wanted to remove partisanship from the investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking process. 
We established the requirement that if the Attorney General receives specific information from a credible source that a crime may have been committed by certain enumerated top Government officials, the Attorney General has to conduct a threshold inquiry lasting no more than 30 days to determine if the allegation is frivolous or a potential legal problem. The top officials who trigger this so-called mandatory provision of the act are the President, the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries of the executive branch departments, plus very top White House officials who are paid a salary at least as high as Cabinet Secretaries or Deputy Secretaries and the chairman and treasurer or other top officials of the President's campaign committee. 
If, after the threshold inquiry, the Attorney General determines that there is specific information from a credible source that a crime may have been committed by a covered official, the Attorney General must then conduct a preliminary investigation lasting no more than 90 days in which she gathers evidence to determine whether further investigation is warranted. If after the conclusion of the 90-day period the Attorney General determines that further investigation is warranted with respect to a covered official, then she must seek the appointment of an independent counsel from the special court made up of three article III judges appointed for 2-year terms by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. 
In crafting the independent counsel law, we contemplated a role for Congress with respect to the appointment of an independent counsel in a specific case. We included a provision that is tailored to the purposes of the statute. The independent counsel law explicitly provides that the appropriate avenue for congressional comment on the appointment of an independent counsel is through action of the Judiciary Committee. 
The law provides that either a majority of the majority party or a majority of the minority party of the members of the Judiciary Committee may request the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel. 
Upon receipt of such a letter, the law provides that the Attorney General must respond in writing to the authors of the letter explaining `whether the Attorney General has begun or will begin a preliminary investigation' under the independent counsel law, setting forth `the reasons for the Attorney General's decision regarding such preliminary investigation as it relates to each of the matters with respect to which the congressional request is made. If there is such a preliminary investigation, the report shall include the date on which the preliminary investigation began or will begin.' 
The Attorney General is not obligated to trigger the statute when she receives such a letter. She is not required to initiate a threshold inquiry or conduct a preliminary investigation. She is only required to respond within 30 days. That is the process that we provided for in the independent counsel law for Congress to express an opinion in triggering the statute. That is how the procedure works. 
The Attorney General has the sole discretion to determine if the statute is triggered and if an independent counsel should be appointed. That is a constitutional requisite of the statute, and without that discretion, the Supreme Court has said that the separation of powers principle is violated. Congress has the very specific way I indicated to express its opinion on the subject to the Attorney General. In the last analysis, as our chief law enforcement officer, it is her decision alone to make. 
While the independent counsel law was designed to make sure that a covered official doesn't get preferential treatment with respect to a criminal investigation, equally important was the concern that the official not suffer worse treatment or a selective process prosecution that would not be applied to an ordinary citizen. In the din surrounding these calls for the Attorney General to seek the appointment of an independent counsel, that very important feature has been lost. 
In 1981, our subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the independent counsel law held the first oversight hearings on its implementation. We had a number of knowledgeable witnesses, and we had several years of experience with the statute to review. 
One of the cases that the subcommittee reviewed at the time was the case of Hamilton Jordan and Tim Kraft, top White House officials in the Carter administration, who were accused of using a controlled substance at a party in violation of the criminal code. Then Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti testified at the time that under ordinary circumstances the Department of Justice, exercising its discretion on when to prosecute, would not generally prosecute a case such as that against a regular citizen even though there might have been a violation. But because the law at the time didn't permit the Attorney General to consider prosecutorial policies of the Department in deciding whether or not to seek appointment of an independent counsel, the Attorney General felt obligated to seek appointment of independent counsels in those two cases. 
Here is what then Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti told our subcommittee in 1981 about this decision: 
In normal circumstances, the Department does not investigate or prosecute every possible felony or every possible fact, or circumstance that comes to its attention. Historically, and within the law, it exercises discretion. It stays its hand in individual cases, not for the purpose of advancing or threatening personal interests, but for the purpose of doing justice and advancing the common good. 
This discretion is one of the great prerogatives that devolves upon the Department of Justice and the Executive under the common law. It is enormously important, and it is honored every day in every U.S. attorney's office in tradition and in practice. 
Any discretionary power, of course, can be abused. And if the Department's investigatorial and prosecutorial discretion should be exercised capriciously or irregularly, it would threaten and not advance the interests that it is designed to serve. 
For that reason, over the years we have developed guidelines that structure and restrain the exercise of our discretion in individual cases, thereby introducing a measure of principle and regularity into a sensitive and subjective process. 
Attorney General Civiletti went on to say the following:  
In some instances these guidelines take the form of explicitly written standards concerning specific statutes and specific kind of offenses and procedures. In other instances they are unwritten understandings or policies that are followed within the Department. 
What's the point of the reference to regularity if the purpose of the special prosecutor provisions is to ensure that the high officers in the Government will receive an impartial treatment at the hands of the Department of Justice? 
His answer: 
I am not sure that the statute goes as far as it might to accomplish that objective because the special prosecutor is given the freedom to disregard the standards, the limits, the discretionary judgments that have been entered over the last 100 years in the Department of Justice, and set about on his own course, which for each special prosecutor could be entirely different under different standards and promote great misfortune to the subject of the particular investigation.' 
Now, in light of Attorney General Civiletti's testimony, the subcommittee decided to amend the independent counsel law to require--and it is a requirement; it is not discretionary--to require that the Attorney General follow policies of the Department of Justice relative to the question of whether to prosecute a case even where evidence of a violation may exist. 
We concluded that it was important to not let the independent counsel law be used as a weapon to punish a top official who would not otherwise be subject to prosecution if he were a regular citizen. Senator Cohen, with whom I cosponsored the 1982 reforms, and I were both clear that the purpose of the independent counsel law is to provide for criminal investigation of a top government official in a manner no better and no worse than anybody else. 
We are not just talking about the written policies of the Department of Justice. Congress specifically rejected that limitation and included language in the statute requiring the Attorney General to follow both the written and unwritten policies of the Department of Justice.

Mr. LEVIN. If we take these elements and apply them to the case of the President or Vice President making phone calls from the White House, it becomes clear to me that the facts do not fit the statute. 
Any phone calls they may have made, would have been solicitations made at the place where the person being called was located. We know that from the Supreme Court's decision in U.S. versus Thayer. And we know for section 607 to apply, that location has to be a location where Federal employees are performing their official duties. 
In applying the prosecutorial policy and practice of the Department of Justice in this case, with respect to this law, the Attorney General, may well and properly find that she would not prosecute a noncovered official under these facts. If so, she is not allowed by law to seek the appointment of an independent counsel. 
Madam President, the pressure being put upon the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel is undermining the basic principle of this law and the nonpartisan spirit which has been so important to its operation. The effort to shoehorn the conduct of the President and Vice President into the prohibitions of an arcane law, never used under similar circumstances, violates our understanding of the criminal justice system--just as it would if cases had been brought against Senators who have already made similar calls from their Senate offices. 
One Senator was reported in the Wall Street Journal several years ago as saying he `figures he spends two hours a day dialing for cash from his Washington home, his car, and his mobile phone;' he says he can even place calls from his Senate office. `I do it wherever I am,' the Senator is quoted as saying. `I can use a credit card. * * * As long as I pay for the calls, I can make calls wherever I want to call.' 
Another of our colleagues was reported, when phoning to remind potential donors of a fundraiser, to have left a recorded message on an answering machine to call him at his Senate office for more information. 
And, a third Senator's signature appeared on a solicitation letter in which potential contributors were invited to call his Senate office with questions about the fundraising solicitation. Have these Members been criminally prosecuted for a violation of section 607? No. Should they have been? No. The judgment of the Attorney General not to prosecute in these visible cases is further evidence that there has not been a policy to prosecute under section 607 when a solicitation is made to a person not on Federal property when solicited. 
When President Reagan was in the White House, he called the Republican Eagles who were meeting in a Government building--the auditorium at the Commerce Department. The President called and among his remarks, he said the following: 
I am genuinely sorry I couldn't be there in person with you today. . . . but we have the Eagles down to the White House quite often so I will be seeing you soon. In the meantime I'm sending Secretary Schultz, Secretary Regan and other members of the Cabinet over to keep you abreast of what's going on. In fact you will be seeing more of my Cabinet today than I will. . . . Let me say to you Eagles how important your contributions are to the Republican Party. . . . [T]o keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it. You there today help to keep the light of the Republican Party burning brightly. 
That call was made 15 years ago in September 1982. And here, with this call, the persons being urged on were actually in a Federal building--just what section 607 seems to cover. And it's very likely that the contributions referred to were hard money contributions. But should there have been an independent counsel appointed to investigate President Reagan to determine whether or not he violated section 607? No--it shouldn't have happened then and shouldn't happen now. But where were the threats, where was the orchestrated chorus then? 
If we don't want our President or Vice President making fundraising calls, then we should pass a law to that effect and make it explicit. If its OK for them to make them from their taxpayer subsidized home or cars but not from their offices, then make it clear in the law. I question whether we really want criminality to hinge on whether the President makes a fundraising call from the Oval Office or from his upstairs office in the family section at the White House or from his car or from the phone booth on the corner? I, for one, would rather the President or Vice President not make fundraising calls, period. That's what we intended when we enacted public financing of our Presidential campaigns--but the soft money loophole changed all that. We've got to fix that. We should eliminate the soft money loophole--not utilize an ambiguity surrounded by a technicality to push the President or Vice President into an independent counsel investigation as if it is intended to be some form of punishment. The independent counsel process was never intended to be used this way. 
Madam President, the Attorney General has a job to do. It has been given to her by the Constitution and the independent counsel law. She is now required to act to the best of her ability to follow the law--to conduct a thorough criminal investigation of all of the allegations; to follow the evidence wherever it leads; to follow the requirements of the independent counsel law--and this has too often been forgotten--including the requirement that she follow Justice Department discretionary policies about whether to prosecute when deciding whether to seek an independent counsel. 
The political pressure on the Attorney General does a disservice to the Nation which is awaiting an objective and fair review. The political pressure on the Attorney General undermines the independent counsel law, which is dependent upon an application free from partisan pressure. If she finds that the criteria for triggering the independent counsel law has been met and that the Justice Department practice has been to prosecute in a case similar to this, so be it. But if she finds the criteria haven't been met, or if she finds that there has not been a policy of prosecution under section 607, so be it. 
If those calling for an independent counsel want the Attorney General to follow the letter of the law with respect to section 607 because they think it means a possible criminal investigation and prosecution--and I have already shown why I disagree with that position--then they also have to urge the Attorney General to follow the letter of the law with respect to the appointment of an independent counsel. And the letter of that law has required, since 1982, that the Attorney General follow the policies and practices of the Department of Justice in determining whether independent counsel should be appointed. Again, it has not been the policy or practice of the Department of Justice to prosecute a solicitation under section 607 if the person being solicited is not on Federal property. If the Attorney General agrees, then she is not permitted to seek an independent counsel under the 1982 amendment to the independent counsel law. 
Those urging the independent counsel appointment can't have it both ways. If they look at the spirit of section 607, or if they look at its letter, the Attorney General would be on firm ground should she seek not to appoint an independent counsel. 
Madam President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Gen. John M. Shalikashvili on the occasion of his retirement after serving on active duty for more than 39 years, the last 4 years of which he has served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
General Shalikashvili's life is a marvelous American success story. Many people are aware that he was born in Warsaw, Poland of stateless parents and came to Peoria, IL, at the age of 16. What is not generally known, however, is that when he became a naturalized American citizen shortly before he graduated from Bradley University, it was the first nation of which he was a citizen, and that he was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly after graduation. He is the only Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is a naturalized American citizen and the only Chairman who was drafted into the military. 
Mr. President, I won't attempt to describe all of General Shalikashvili's military achievements, but I would like to include a few of his experiences that I believe molded his outlook and enabled him to perform in such a superb fashion as our Nation's senior military officer. 
General Shali, as he likes to be called, served in Vietnam during the Tet offensive and in Korea in the early 1970's. His experience in combat and in a theater in which U.S. forces faced a strong and unpredictable military foe undoubtedly prepared him to be the strong spokesman for the men and women in uniform and a strong advocate for maintaining our Nation's military might second to none. 
I have been struck by General Shali's frequent reference to his experience in 1991 as the head of Operation Provide Comfort. This operation brought the Iraqi Kurds down from the mountains of northern Iraq and eastern Turkey where thousands were dying and helped them to return to their towns and villages. He has described that experience as the toughest challenge and, at the same time, one of the most gratifying things that he has done. Mr. President, it has been my experience that our finest military leaders are also people who are caring human beings. General Shali's compassion and humanity comes clearly through in his recollection of his experience with the Iraqi Kurds who suffered so much at the hands of Saddam Hussein. 
General Shali also served in a number of positions in Europe both during and after the cold war. Just last week, I had an opportunity along with Senators Roth and Biden and other members of the Senate NATO Observer Group to meet with General Shali and the chiefs of defense of our NATO allies. I observed with pride the respect and admiration that the senior military leaders of our NATO allies have for General Shali. I am sure that it was also evident to them that all of the Senators at that meeting have the highest regard for General Shali. With his European upbringing and his several assignments in the European area, including as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, General Shali has been a unique leader as NATO has been carrying out its internal adaptation and its enlargement. 
Mr. President, I am sure that there will be a number of tributes paid to general Shali here on the Senate floor, elsewhere in the Capital area, and around the world. Some will no doubt recount his extraordinary performance as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have chosen to highlight only a few and perhaps lesser known aspects of General Shali's career because I believe they demonstrate his qualities of leadership, compassion, humanity, and courage. 
General Shali has been a superb Chairman, a true friend of the men and women who serve our Nation, and I count myself fortunate to consider him a good personal friend. I salute him for the former and cherish the latter.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate the Senators from Arizona, Wisconsin, Maine, and other Senators who have joined so strongly in this effort--an important bipartisan effort--to finally reform the campaign finance laws. The system is terribly broken. I think most of us know that, and I hope enough of us will get together to really reform it properly. 
The time has finally come for Congress to decide whether we are going to fix this system, which is in shambles, and fix the laws that are now doing so much damage to public confidence in our governmental operations. These laws are now so full of loopholes that what was intended to be limits on campaign contributions in effect are easily evaded. And if we are going to close those loopholes we must do it together. This will not happen if Democrats and Republicans do not come together. It is going to require that kind of a bipartisan effort if we are going to restore public confidence in this campaign finance system. 
For the past couple of months, members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have sat through hours and days of hearings on the failings of our campaign finance laws. We have asked dozens of witnesses hundreds of questions on the problems of the 1996 elections. 
My constituents are asking me just one question. `Are you going to do something about it?' That is what they want to know. They have heard our questions. They have heard the answers. They know we have observed the witnesses. They have seen and heard the debate. And, of course, the majority who have not been able to watch the hearings personally know that the campaign finance system is a subject of great debate. 
Yet the question I get wherever I go is, `Are you going to do something about it?' It is a simple question. It is a direct question. My answer is, `I hope so, and I am sure going to do everything I can to see that we finally do in fact close the loopholes that have made a shambles of the laws that are supposed to set limits on how much money could be contributed by individuals to our campaigns.' 
The Senate hearings have focused much of their time on allegations of illegal conduct in the 1996 elections. But the vast majority of what the public doesn't like is not what is illegal, although they surely don't like that. It is what is legal. Most of it involves the so-called soft money or unregulated money because both parties have gotten around the law of the 1970's by establishing a whole separate world of campaign finance. That is the world of so-called soft money--contributions that are not technically covered by the limits under current law. 
In the 1996 election, the Republican Party raised more than $140 million in soft money. The Democrats raised over $120 million. 
That is how we get to these enormous sums of money in the last campaign, like the $1.3 million to the Republican National Committee from just one company in 1996 and a $450,000 contribution from just one couple to the Democratic National Committee the same year. 
Once that soft money loophole was opened and once that loophole was viewed as being legal, the money chase was on, and that chase has been carried on by both parties. When you couple that with the high cost of television advertising, you have the money chase involving just about all candidates. The chase for money has led most of us in public office or seeking public office to push the envelope and to take the law to the limits in order to get the necessary contributions. The money chase pressures political supporters to cross lines that they should not in order to help their candidates get needed funds. The money chase in political campaigns is a serious disease and it has become chronic. Most of us have been affected by it. Most of us have spent too much time fundraising and in the process pushing the fundraising rules to their limits. We know in our hearts that the money chase is a bipartisan problem and that bipartisan reform is the right way to go. 
If the Senate hearings have exposed illegal practices that would otherwise go unpunished, that is useful. If the hearings have also exposed activities that are currently allowed but which should not be, and if that arouses public opinion so that Congress will end the money hunt, that would be a major contribution. But if those hearings leave no solid record of legislative reform behind, we will have done something far worse than missing an opportunity. We will be deepening public pessimism and thickening the public gloom about this democracy's ability to restore public confidence in the financing of our campaigns and our elections. And that is why I believe the enactment of major campaign finance reform is so critical. Existing law says that individuals cannot contribute more than $1,000 now to any candidate or political committee with respect to any election for Federal office. Existing law says that corporations and unions can't contribute at all to those candidates. And Presidential campaigns are supposed to be financed with public funds. That is the law on the books today. And yet we have all heard stories of contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, from corporations and from unions--Roger Tamraz giving $300,000 to Democrats. What happened to the $1,000 contribution limit? 
Here is a Democratic National Committee document relative to DNC trustees. These are major contributors, I think $100,000, and they're offered various events to attend if they make that large contribution. What are the events? The events are two annual trustee events with the President in Washington. That is just an offer of access for contributions. But these are not the contributions that the law is supposed to limit to $1,000 for each candidates. These are $100,000 contributions. These are the soft money contributions. And these are the connections to access. Both parties do it. 
Here is the 1997 RNC Annual Gala, May 13, 1997. Right in the middle of all of this angst, all of this concern about big money and access, it has this dinner. It is open, nothing hidden about this. Cochairman of the Republican National Committee Annual Gala, $250,000 fundraising goal. 
What do you do? You sell or purchase, sell or purchase, Team 100 memberships or Republican Eagle memberships. That's $100,000 I believe for Team 100. And what do you get? You get, among other things, luncheon with the Republican Senate and House committee chairman of your choice. It is the open offer of access in exchange for a contribution, and the contribution is soft money. It is not the $1,000 contribution to come to a dinner. It is give or raise $250,000 and you get lunch with the committee chairman of your choice. It is like the Democratic National Committee offer, give $100,000 and you get two receptions with the President. 
Now, one of the ways we are going to stop this abhorrent offer of sale of access in exchange for contributions is if we get to the soft money loophole it is the most direct way to get to it. Here are some other examples, recent examples of soft money. This is, I believe, a Team 100 document, a Republican document called hot prospects. Who is the third prospect? Some retired inventor. And here is what the document says.  
We are working on getting him an appointment with Dick Armey so we can get his other $50,000. 
These are documents which came up in our investigation, in our hearings. We can get his other $50,000 if we can get him an appointment with Dick Armey. The public sees that and they respond the way I respond. That is abhorrent. What are we doing, offering access in exchange for a contribution? And the amount of money here is abhorrent. `His other $50,000.' That means he has already given $50,000. Here is a total of $100,000. What happened to the $1,000 limit? 
We thought there was a law. The problem is that in the race to compete and to win in our Federal elections, candidates and parties have found a way around the law. And that is the soft money loophole. Hard money, the contributions which are regulated by campaign finance laws, is, indeed, hard money. It is harder to come by. So soft money is easier to raise. You can get $100,000 or $500,000 from just one corporation or individual. You don't have to go to 500 different people and raise $1,000, and you don't have to go to 5,000 people and raise $100 the way you do with hard money. You can just find one person, one corporation wealthy enough or willing enough to pay a half-million dollars and then you accept that contribution. 
Now, there is another part of the current law which says if you spend money in an election in support of a candidate or opposed to a candidate, you have to spend money that is only raised the hard way, following the limit. But one of the greatest areas of abuse in the 1996 election was the use of hundreds of millions of dollars of unregulated, unlimited, and undisclosed money to broadcast so-called issue ads just before an election--ads that any reasonable viewer would interpret as attacking or supporting a particular candidate.

Mr. LEVIN. So the result is now a vicious combination, outside of the limits of our campaign finance laws, of, one, huge amounts of money; two, funding the worst type of campaign attack ads. And the net result is that the exceptions to our campaign finance laws have swallowed the rules. The rules basically no longer exist. It is up to this body and to the House to restore limits--restore some fences around contributions so what we intended to do, and the portion of what we did that was affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Buckley case, can be operative in the real political world that we operate in. 
It is a daunting task to plug these loopholes, to make the law whole again--to make it whole, to make it effective. If we don't do this, if we do not act on a bipartisan basis and adopt real campaign reform, and if we do not make real what Congress intended to do 20 years ago, and which the Supreme Court has said we can do, where the advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate is involved--we are allowed to act relative to campaign contributions. We know that. We were told that in Buckley. Providing our aim is at those contributions which go to the effort to elect or defeat a candidate, we are permitted to act providing we act in a way which is clear and has a bright line, and which is aimed at a problem, a societal problem which we identify. Clean elections are something that we are allowed to seek to achieve. We are allowed to seek to achieve the reduction of the impact of aggregated money by corporations and power by corporations and unions. That has been permitted by the Supreme Court. It is up to us, now, to fashion a bill which complies with those standards and we believe this bill does. 
If we do not do it, if we do not put a stop to the money chase and the attack ads that are overwhelming the system and disgusting the American people, we will let down our constituents. Marlin Fitzwater, who was the press secretary for President Bush, made this statement in April 1992. He made this statement following a dinner for President Bush, at which the major contributors, soft money contributors, were offered access, private receptions with the President in the White House. It was a very open offer of access in exchange for major contributions, contributions of soft money. This is what Marlin Fitzwater said very openly and honestly in April 1992, following that dinner: `It buys access to the system, yes. That's what the political parties and the political operation is all about.' 
He spoke the truth. He spoke the tragic truth that buying access to the system is what the political operation is all about and, too often, what the political parties are all about. We have to change that. We have to restore to the political process what the political parties and the political operations should be all about, which is listening to people, communicating with people, organizing people, grassroots effort--yes, raising contributions in small amounts, limited amounts as we intended to do in the 1970's when we passed that law. That is what the political operation and the political parties should be all about. 
But whether or not they are going to, again, be about that instead of about raising $50,000 and $100,000 and $250,000 and $1 million in soft money, which is spent in the functionally equivalent way--the same way, apparently, as the so-called hard money--whether we are going to be able to do that is going to be dependent on whether or not we can pull together Democrats and Republicans as Americans, realize that we have a sick system of campaign finance raising and money raising, and change it--close the loopholes, respond to the demand of the American people that the money chase and the excessive contributions and the attack ads end. 
In the next week or two, that is a decision we are going to make. I believe the majority of the Senate will support significant reforms and the President has said he will work for the passage of McCain-Feingold and will sign it with enthusiasm. The time for waiting while we document further campaign abuses that we all know exist is over. The time for ending those abuses is here. 
I want to close by again commending the sponsors of the bill for their steadfast efforts and their commitment to campaign finance reform. It is a privilege to be part of their cause.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention to the HEAT'S ON partnership of Grand Rapids, MI, which serves people who need special assistance in preparation for the harsh winter months that lie ahead. 
On Saturday, September 27, 1997, plumbers and steamfitters of UA Local 70 and the Mechanical Contractors Association of Grand Rapids will join together with Community Action to participate in the 10th annual HEAT'S ON Day. The HEAT'S ON--Handicapped and Elderly Assistance to Serve Our Neighbors--Program began in 1987 in Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN. HEAT'S ON Day has become an annual event in the Grand Rapids area, as members of plumbers and steamfitters local 70 and the Mechanical Contractors Association of Grand Rapids donate their time and talents to ensure that the homes of elderly and disabled people in Grand Rapids and the nearby cities of Grandville, Kentwood, Walker, and Wyoming are safe for the winter. 
Participating servicepeople check homes approved for the program and repair and replace broken parts in furnaces and heating units. They also install easy-to-read thermostats and smoke alarms for people who need them. In the past 9 years, HEAT'S ON participants have discovered more serious--and potentially life-threatening--problems, such as plugged chimneys, defective furnaces, and homes exposed to carbon monoxide poisoning. These discoveries have enabled homeowners to have the problems repaired before suffering dangerous accidents. 
HEAT'S ON is a community effort, as evidenced by local businesses who contribute time, money, and products to help defray the costs. Consumers Power, Meijer, and Dominos are just a few of the local businesses who participate in this vital program. 
HEAT'S ON Day brings together many people to help ensure that nobody who requires assistance needlessly suffers through a cold winter. In Grand Rapids, union workers and business owners combine their resources and abilities to serve those in need. They are an inspiration, and they deserve our recognition. I know my colleagues will join me in extending our congratulations and thanks to the HEAT'S ON partnership of Grand Rapids, MI for 10 years of service to their community.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the sixth anniversary of Armenian Independence. 
With the fall of the Soviet Union, Armenians were quickly faced with the possibility of realizing a vision which they had long sought--independence. On September 21, 1991, Armenia held a referendum to decide its future. More than 94 percent of Armenia's eligible voters turned out to support independence. Two days later, on September 23, the Armenian Parliament made the people's desire official when it declared Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union. 
The historic vote for independence on September 21, 1991, has far greater significance when examined in light of Armenia's modern history. Throughout the last century, the Armenian people have experienced incredible hardship and tragedy in their efforts to rule themselves. Armenia began the 20th century under the control of the Ottoman Turks. Ottoman Turk rule turned savage at the beginning of World War I when it waged a government-organized genocide on the Armenians. During the Armenian Genocide of 1915-23, 1.5 million people perished as the Ottoman Turks tried to permanently silence Armenian calls for independence. 
Following the defeat of the Ottoman Turks in World War I, Armenians were able to briefly fulfill their wishes of independence. On May 28, 1918, the Republic of Armenia was established. However, this independence was short-lived as the Republic of Armenia soon collapsed because of renewed Turkish and Soviet pressure. On November 29, 1920, Armenia was declared a Soviet republic and spent the next 71 years under Soviet rule. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia was finally able to fulfill its goal of self-determination. 
Today, September 23, Armenia celebrates the sixth anniversary of its independence. I know that the many Armenian-Americans in Michigan and the United States join in this celebration. The support Armenian-Americans have given to their homeland has been indispensable as Armenia emerges from many years of Soviet domination. I applaud their efforts and the efforts of the Armenian people to build an independent and democratic Armenia.

Mr. LEVIN. If my colleague would yield for a moment, it is my understanding that the bill appropriates $700 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund [LWCF] for land acquisition which have been set aside for a variety of projects, some of which will be identified after consultation with the administration and the House. I believe approximately $285 million of those funds have not been designated for specific projects.

Mr. LEVIN. If my colleague will yield further, I think it is also important to point out that the sale of these inholdings by the Great Lakes Fishery Trust will help generate funds for fishery enhancement programs and preserve critically important frontage along rivers that flow into the Great Lakes. If, however, these lands are not purchased quickly, then the Great Lakes Fisheries Trust could face significant costs, including taxes and administrative fees. Such costs would put the trust in the uncomfortable position of either having to sell these lands 
commercially or paying these costs and thereby reducing the flow of funds destined for financing improvements in the Great Lakes fishery.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will oppose the Bryan amendment to reduce funding for Forest Service road construction, reconstruction and obliteration, and to eliminate the purchaser credit program, because the amendment will make two activities more difficult to accomplish in the pursuit of the goal of ending new road construction in inappropriate areas. These two activities are obliteration of improperly placed, environmentally damaging or unused roads and reconstruction of those roads that serve regenerated stands. The administration has indicated that this amendment would cause the Forest Service to construct fewer new roads, yet the administration already has the power to construct fewer new roads without this amendment. 
Eliminating the purchaser credit program may make sense. Certainly, the public lands management agencies of the Federal Government should have consistent policies on appropriately allocating the costs of building roads for timber access and other uses. But, the program's elimination will not necessarily save taxpayers' money. There are many policy and budget issues that should be sorted out at a Committee hearing on the matter before Congress acts on this. 
Mr. President, I could support an amendment written to limit the number of miles of new roads in environmentally sensitive areas, however, the flaws in the Bryan amendment make its impact on this objection uncertain.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will conduct a markup of S. 1173, the Intermodal Transportation Act of 1997. It is time that a bill be reported to the Senate for thorough and careful consideration, as the expiration of ISTEA is only 2 weeks away. So far, we have very little information about the impact of this recently introduced bill. The committee's report to accompany the bill, and analyses from the U.S. Department of Transportation, should be very helpful to Senators in estimating the bill's merits. I look forward to reviewing that report in detail. 
Some proponents of the bill say that States will be guaranteed 90 percent of their contributions into the highway trust fund. There were statements like this just before ISTEA was enacted, and which never materialized, so my colleagues will understand if I reserve judgment. The committee, with the help of the Federal Highway Administration, will hopefully show us that that 90 percent is actual. For the moment however, the information available now should concern all donor States. 
According to technical assistance provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation, it seems that paying for a 90 percent of contributions guarantee would cause the ITA bill to exceed the amount allotted in the 5-year budget agreement by approximately $10.059 billion. Yet, committee staff have indicated that the bill is just within the budget targets. There seems to be a contradiction there somewhere.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Fiscal years--   1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budg. Auth. in Budget Agreement 24.695 23.196 23.701 24.198 24.711  Budg. Auth. to get 90% of Contrib 20.291 30.374 26.085 26.654 27.156 27.655  Difference -4.404 +7.178 +2.384 +2.456 +2.445  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
According to general information provided thus far by the committee, estimating the State-by-State average return from ITA, Michigan would see about $696 million annually over 6 years. However, according to Federal Highway Administration projected gas tax receipts, Michigan will contribute and would receive the following at a 90 percent guaranteed rate of return on contributions:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Fiscal years-- Average   1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Proj. Contributions (millions) 795 1,198 1,027 1,049 1,066 1,087 1,037  Proj. Obligation Auth. (at 90% guarantee) 715 1,078 924 944 951 976 931  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
So, the average return to Michigan under a bill that provides a true guarantee of 90 percent of contributions would be about $931 million. That is about $230 million more annually than the committee's estimate. What's the explanation? It is not yet clear. 
I would like to support a Transportation authorization bill that treats States fairly. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available right now to make that assessment. I am concerned about what I have learned about the bill. I strongly encourage the committee or the Department to provide Senators, as soon as possible, with charts showing the likely apportionments and allocations that each State can expect for each year for the life of the bill, including information on the actual average return that each State can expect in terms of total obligation authority, assuming USDOT's gas tax receipts projections and the balanced budget agreement levels for transportation. 
Mr. President, though I am generally pleased that the committee is proposing to modernize the factors in the basic allocation formula to do away with postal routes and other obsolete factors, I was dismayed to learn that S. 1173 would add a convoluted and highly suspect payment to States that seem to receive special treatment. I am referring to the ISTEA transition payments. I strongly urge the committee members to strike this unnecessary and unfair provision during markup. 
There are many questions that need to be answered about that provision. For instance, are these ISTEA transition payments subject to an obligation limitation? Can they grow over time? Shouldn't they phase out if they are truly transition payments? Shouldn't the fiscal year 1997 basis used in calculating these transition payments be the authorized amount and not as amended in a supplemental appropriations bill? 
Mr. President, I would like to support a fair bill to reauthorize our Nation's transportation systems. This bill holds some promise, but there are too many unanswered questions at this point to make a final conclusion.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ukrainian Independence Day. Since its independence on August 24, 1991, The Ukrainian Government has taken several bold steps to reform the country after many years of Soviet rule. We should take this opportunity today to review the success that Ukraine has recently experienced. 
In 1994, Ukraine held legislative and Presidential elections. These elections were carried out in an open and fair manner that bodes well for stable democracy in Ukraine. Ukraine now exhibits signs of a healthy democracy, including the existence of multiple interests represented within the Government, and last year, Ukraine overwhelmingly enacted a new constitution which guarantees the right of private ownership. 
Ukraine has also focused on reforming its economy with some significant results. The Government has taken steps to improve the investment climate in Ukraine. In order to further promote privatization, the President of Ukraine signed the State Privatization Program for 1997. Ukraine also launched a new currency, the hryvna, and inflation has been reduced dramatically. 
Ukraine's efforts on security issues may be its most successful. The Government has been rightfully lauded for its efforts to rid Ukrainian soil of nuclear weapons by faithfully following guidelines under the START I Treaty and other agreements. And, by joining the Partnership for Peace Program for NATO membership, Ukraine has shown its determination to contribute to the security of Europe. 
The people of Ukraine deserve our admiration and support for the fine work they have done in such a short period of time. The Ukrainian-American community in Michigan is in the front ranks of such support. I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the sixth anniversary of Ukrainian independence.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the U.S. Air Force on its 50th anniversary, which will be celebrated across the country on September 18, 1997. 
On July 26, 1947, the National Security Act was signed into law by President Truman. This act established the U.S. Air Force as a separate branch of our Nation's Armed Forces. On September 18, 1947, W. Stuart Symington was sworn in as the first Secretary of the Air Force. Eight days later, Gen. Carl A. Spaatz became the Air Force's first Chief of Staff. 
While 1947 marked the beginning of the Air Force as we know it today, the U.S. official involvement with the military applications of flight actually started 40 years earlier in 1907. On August 1 of that year--just 3 years after the Wright Brothers' historic first manned flight--the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps was established. This was the forerunner of today's Air Force. The Aeronautical Division's mission was to `take charge of all matters pertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and all kindred subjects.' It is from this initial mandate that the Air Force has evolved into the indispensable force which today provides the United States with `Global Reach, Global Power.' 
With its founding in 1947, the Air Force became an equal partner with the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps in our Nation's Armed Forces. It did not take long for the Air Force to make history. Within 2 weeks of its creation, the Air Force hit the first of many impressive milestones. On October 14, 1947, a young Air Force captain by the name of Chuck Yeager courageously piloted the X-1 on the first supersonic flight. 
Beginning in June 1948, it was the Air Force that was called upon to take the lead in the Berlin Airlift. Dubbed Operation Vittles and over the course of the next 15 months, the Anglo-American airlift delivered a total of 2.3 million tons of food, fuel, and supplies to sustain the people of that beleaguered city. 
The theme of this 50th anniversary year for the Air Force--`Golden Legacy--Boundless Future'--is very appropriate because facing challenges has been the hallmark of the Air Force. They have always aimed high. The Air Force has achieved countless numbers of aviation firsts that are the envy of the aeronautical world. Lesser known actions, though, are also an important part of the Air Force's golden legacy and should also be celebrated. For instance, on July 1, 1949, the Air Force became the first service to announce an end to racial segregation in its ranks. 
The greatest strength in all of the military services has always been in its members themselves. Without any doubt and question, Gens. Hap Arnold and Jimmie Doolittle and Sen. Ira Eaker are great Air Force legends in their own right. So too though is Lt. Col. John Paul Stapp, a Air Force flight surgeon who in 1954 rode a rocket sled to 632 mph and then decelerated to zero in 125 seconds. He survived more than 35 times the force of gravity in order to determine if a pilot could eject from an airplane at supersonic speed and live. We should also remember Col. Robin Olds who, on January 2, 1967, became the first and only U.S. Air Force ace with 12 victories in World War II and 4 victories in Vietnam. 
Over the past 50 years the men and women of the Air Force have served with honor and distinction in the major conflicts of Korea, Vietnam, and in the Persian Gulf. They have been the faithful stewards of two-thirds of America's arsenal of nuclear weapons. They have kept the peace deep below the Earth in missile silos and high in the heavens in reconnaissance aircraft. 
The Air Force truly does have a golden legacy that we should all take time to reflect upon and honor. I am confident that the Air Force's rich history is the foundation of its boundless future. Regardless of any future threat our Nation may face, the Air Force will meet the challenge just as they always have. 
I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United States Air Force.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the need for organ transplants has continued to outpace the availability of transplantable organs. However, studies have shown that this trend can be reversed by improving the process that families experience in hospitals. Congress recognized the vital role that hospitals can play in organ donation when it enacted legislation to require hospitals to be responsible for facilitating organ donation. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, requires organ procurement organizations and hospitals to establish organ donation protocols to enable hospitals to initiate requests, on a routine basis, for organ donation. 
A recent Harvard School of Public Health study, based on the examination of thousands of medical records in 125 hospitals in four regions of the United States, found that despite the legal responsibility to inform surviving family members of donation options, many hospitals frequently fail to do so. According to the study, 27 percent of potential donors were lost either because health professionals did not identify potential donors or did not ask families about organ donation. 
Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today seeks to bring attention to the potential of hospitals to alleviate the donor shortage, and to shed some light on the fact that hospitals can improve their donor policy by instituting demonstrated best practices in organ donation. There are a number of major initiatives underway focusing on hospital practices in organ donation that can result in saving thousands of additional lives in the not-too-distant future. 
For example, the Michigan Hospital Association (MHA) is embarking on an important initiative to encourage its members to improve their organ donation effectiveness. It includes identifying stragies designed to improve the organ donation consent process and examining all aspects of the process, from community education to provider interaction with the family. The initiative will also generate specific recommendations to improve the tissue donation process, as well as major organ procurement. 
The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations is in the midst of a major pilot project to conduct reviews of deaths that have occurred in hundreds of hospitals across the country. This project will provide an unprecedented level of information on organ donor potential and performance and lead to targeted strategies to help hospitals improve their effectiveness. 
Additionally, The Partnership for Organ Donation, in collaboration with the University HealthSystem Consortium (an alliance of 70 academic health centers), has begun a major initiative to improve organ donation practices in hospitals across the country. The goal is to increase organ donation significantly in these hospitals by institutionalizing best-demonstrated practices. The project follows an `action research' design, which includes diagnosing hospital performance, building consensus on the donation protocol, establishing a donation team in the hospital, educating all relevant staff in-depth, enacting the new protocol, and on-going monitoring for quality assurance. The project ultimately will lead to practice guidelines for organ donation, which, if adopted nationwide, could provide organs for many of the 53,000 Americans currently awaiting transplants. it is currently being implemented in a number of leading hospitals, including Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan, Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical College of Virginia Hospitals, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital and Clinics, Ohio State University Medical Center, Medical College of Ohio, St. Vincent Medical Center of Ohio and Riverside Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. 
Collectively, these innovative endeavors will prove that patterns of nondonation can be modified. Mr. President, my amendment is aimed at encouraging hospitals to alleviate the donor shortage and sheds some light on demonstrated best practices that can improve organ donation in hospitals. It also expresses the sense of the Senate that hospitals that have significant donor potential shall fulfill their legal responsibility to assure a skilled and sensitive request for organ donation to eligible families. The Harvard study estimated that 5,600 additional lives could be saved each year if hospitals improved their practices relative to donation requests. A Gallup survey indicated that 85 percent of the American public supports organ donation, and 69 percent describe themselves as likely to donate their organs upon death. 
Mr. President I understand that the amendment has been accepted. I thank the managers of the bill for their support. I would also like to acknowledge the support and cosponsorship of this amendment by Senator Thurmond, Senator Durbin, Senator Inouye and Senator Dorgan. Mr. President, I understand that the managers will also accept the Durbin-Levin amendment requesting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services together with the General Accounting to conduct a comprehensive survey of donor hospitals to ascertain:

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about media coverage in Bosnia and the importance of a fair, free, and independent media to the safety of United States and allied forces, the implementation of the Dayton peace accords, and peace for the Bosnian people. 
Recent events in the Serb area of Bosnia have served to highlight the disruptive role that the media, particularly television, can play as we have witnessed what Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, characterized as `organized disorder.' 
It was the potential for television-incited violence that led me to propose in my floor speech of July 30 the deployment of the EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft to jam Bosnian Serb television and to broadcast television and radio programming directly to the Bosnian people. I also made that proposal in writing to National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. I understand that the deployment of Commando Solo is under serious consideration at the Pentagon at the present time. 
In making my proposal, I specifically cited a provision of the Agreement on the Military Aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement that gives NATO's Stabilization Force Commander the authority to do all that he deems necessary and proper to protect the SFOR and to carry out its responsibilities.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to the 60th anniversary of an important educational institution in Michigan. On October 10, 1997, Henry Ford Community College will dedicate a new Learning Resource Center and kick off a year of special events to celebrate its six decades of providing educational opportunities to the people of Michigan. 
Henry Ford Community College, which is located in Ford Motor Co.'s hometown of Dearborn, first opened its doors in 1938 as Fordson Junior College with 200 students. Today, approximately 20,000 students attend classes at HFCC's 75-acre main campus and its auxiliary learning center in Dearborn Heights. Many transfer to 4-year institutions after completing 1 or 2 years at HFCC. Others are enrolled in two-year associate degree programs in arts, science, or business. Still others are enrolled in non-credit or continuing education courses, seeking to upgrade their job skills to remain competitive in the marketplace. 
I know that the administrators and instructors at Henry Ford Community College are proud of their reputation for turning out graduates who are well prepared to enter the work force. In fact, HFCC believes that this is so central to its mission that it offers up to 16 hours of free additional workplace training to any graduate whose entry-level technical job skills are deemed to be lacking by an employer. HFCC's Office of Corporate Training works with area businesses and manufacturers to design training programs for their employees, which are held either at HFCC or on the job site. HFCC also offers skilled trade and special job training programs designed to help laid off workers return to the work force more quickly. 
While preparing students for additional education and the workplace are the central goals of Henry Ford Community College, it is also deeply involved in the cultural life of the community. HFCC's cultural activities program provides lectures, performances, and films for the general public. They also sponsor the Enrichment for Young People program, which gives young students the opportunity to take classes in art, theater, and music. Senior citizens are welcomed at the annual Senior Citizens Day on campus, and they may take classes free of charge year round. Concerts, plays, art exhibits, and other performances are offered throughout the year, and are open to the public. 
For 60 years, Henry Ford Community College has been an integral part of the educational and cultural fabric of metropolitan Detroit. This vibrant institution has helped tens of thousands of people to realize their dreams, whether to upgrade professional skills, attain a degree, or simply learn something new about an interesting subject. Mr. President, I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in extending congratulations to the men and women of Henry Ford Community College on the occasion of its 60th anniversary.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of a remarkable person from my home State of Michigan, Mr. Clare Jarecki. Clare will be receiving the 1997 Reflection Award, which is given each year by Aquinas College to an individual who reflects the values Aquinas College seeks to impart to its students--commitment, vision, service, loyalty, integrity, and trust. 
Clare has been a business and community leader in Grand Rapids, MI, for more than 50 years. He served as president and chairman of the board of Jarecki Corp., which was formed by the merger of Jarecki Products, Inc., and Nichols & Cox Lumber Co. Jarecki Corp. grew to be extremely successful, and was once the largest independent tool and die manufacturer in the world. 
The Grand Rapids area contributed greatly to Clare Jarecki's success, and he chose to become involved with a number of organizations dedicated to improving the welfare of the people of Grand Rapids. He has served on the boards of directors of organizations like the YMCA, the Community Chest, the Rehabilitation League and the Greater Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce, as well as a trustee of Blodgett Memorial Hospital. He was instrumental in the creation of U.S. 131, the north-south expressway, which contributed greatly to the growth and development of Grand Rapids and the surrounding area. Clare has been honored and recognized by both Ferris State University and Michigan State University as a distinguished alumnus. 
Throughout his life, Clare Jarecki has endeavored to make his community a better place. In doing so, he embodies the values for which the Reflection Award is conferred. Mr. President, I ask that you, along with my colleagues, join with me in sending congratulations and best wishes to Clare Jarecki on this important occasion.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Balance Budget Act of 1997 which takes us the final step in a process begun in 1993. It reflects a considerable bipartisan accomplishment. While I don't agree with it in every specific, it gives a significant boost to education, provides for the largest investment in health care for children in 30 years, protects Medicare and Medicaid, and it reaches a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
In 1992, the deficit in the federal budget was $290 billion which represented 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The most recent estimate of the deficit for fiscal year 1997 is $67 billion, approximately eight-tenths of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Over the 5 years from 1993 to 1998, the deficit has been reduced by about $1 trillion from the deficit for those 5 years projected at the time. This remarkable progress has come about in large part as a result of the deficit reduction package which President Clinton presented in 1993, and which this Senate passed, without a single Republican vote, by a margin of one vote, the Vice President's. 
The economy has responded to the steady reduction of the deficit. The economy grew for the first quarter of 1997 at a 5.9 percent rate, with an inflation rate of 2.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 5 percent, the lowest in 24 years. This compares to an unemployment rate in 1992 of 7.5 percent. More than 12 million new jobs have been created since President Clinton took office. Now, this bill holds the promise of bringing us even closer to finishing the job. 
I opposed this bill when it originally passed the Senate in part because it included a provision to increase the eligibility age for Medicare, and a second provision to require a $5 per visit copayment for home health care. I am pleased that both provision were deleted from the legislation by the conference committee. 
I am also pleased that this bill restores benefits for legal immigrants who are currently receiving assistance or who become disabled and protects the minimum wage and other protections for welfare recipients moving from welfare to work. 
Mr. President, this bill will secure the Medicare trust fund for at least the next decade, and provides for additional preventive benefits. It represents hard work and compromise and demonstrates that when the Congress moves in a bipartisan way, much can be accomplished.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support this bipartisan tax reduction bill. This package has the right priorities, emphasizing education for young people, health coverage for children, and tax relief for working families. It represents a significant improvement over the bill originally passed by the Senate, which I opposed. 
The improvements in the bill over the Senate bill are numerous. For instance, the $500-per-child tax credit has been greatly expanded to include more working families with children. Last week, I highlighted several Michigan families that would receive significant benefits under the $500 per child tax credit in the President's plan but would receive no benefit under the House or the Senate bills. The compromise agreement grants those Michigan families substantially the same benefits that the President's plan would. One of those working families is the Ginn family from Saginaw, Michigan, with an income of $25,000 per year, who would receive no benefit under the $500-per-child credit in the Senate bill but would receive more than $1,200 in tax credits under the compromise version. Another family is the Shannon family, from Livonia, MI, with an income of $18,460 a year, that has a 1 1/2 -year-old son. They too would receive nothing under the child credit in the Senate bill but would receive the full $500 under the compromise version.

Mr. LEVIN. The education tax cuts that will make college more affordable for millions of families have been increased by nearly $7 billion over the Senate bill under the compromise agreement. The legislation includes the $1,500 HOPE Scholarship tax credit which is available for students in their first 2 years of college. It also includes a provision that was not included in the Senate bill to give a 20-percent tuition deduction for a student's junior, senior, and graduate educations. There is an extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided education assistance for 3 years and a welcome reinstatement of the student loan interest deduction which allows those paying back their loans to deduct up to $2,500 per year. 
I am also pleased that the President insisted that the Empowerment Zone concept that has helped revitalize Detroit and other Michigan communities be added to the bill. 
While there is much to applaud about this legislation, it's not the tax bill I would have written. While the Treasury Department and the Joint Tax Committee have been unable to supply an analysis of the distribution of the benefits of these tax cuts in time for this vote, I believe that more of the benefit of this bill is directed to those who need it least. I would have preferred a tax bill which targeted even more of its benefits to working families. 
The Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax [AMT] has been significantly weakened in this bill and a significant number of profitable companies will pay no tax as a result of this change. The AMT was added to the Tax Code to ensure that profitable companies pay some tax. While the capital gains holding period was lengthened by 6 months, I would have preferred a tax bill which more narrowly targeted the capital gains tax cut. 
There is one more area of this bill which could use some improvement. While many of the tax provisions that I have already mentioned I fully support, this bill as a whole does not do anything to simplify the Tax Code. In fact, it is likely to add a significant number of pages to the code and add a significant amount of time to the time it takes for taxpayers to prepare their return. I hope that in the near future we can improve the Tax Code and make it and the IRS easier to deal with. 
However, Mr. President, even with its imperfections, this bill is an improvement over both the House and Senate passed bills, includes more of the President's and Democrats' priorities emphasizing education for young people, health coverage for children, and tax relief for working families. For those reasons, I will support it.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that the text of a letter from the Governors of Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey, Indiana, and Pennsylvania, to the Chairman of the House Commerce Committee be printed in the Record. 
The Governors correctly urge the House Commerce Committee to swiftly move forward on comprehensive legislation to provide states and local governments with the authority to regulate the interstate transportation and flow of solid waste. 
Mr. President, the Senate has repeatedly passed such legislation and it is my hope that we will do so again before the end of this year. The majority leadership in the House has certainly given the impression that this important matter is not a priority item, despite the pleas for help from state and local governments around the country who are besieged by out-of-state waste or find their local waste management investments becoming increasingly uneconomical. I join with the Governors in urging the House Commerce Committee and the Congress to quickly pass legislation to provide more control over solid waste planning decisions to state and local governments.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the people of India, as they prepare to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their nation's independence from Britain. Led by Mahatma Gandhi, whose philosophy and practice of nonviolent civil disobedience was the cornerstone of the people of India's campaign, their long struggle for self-rule came to a triumphant end on August 15, 1947. The victory won by the people of India served as a model for American civil rights leaders, like Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and inspired oppressed and disenfranchised people throughout the world. For these and many other reasons, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senate Resolution 102, which designates August 15, 1997, as `Indian Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Indian and American Democracy.' 
The Golden Anniversary of India's independence provides people of Indian descent with an opportunity to celebrate the immeasurable achievements they have made in their homeland and in countries throughout the world. There are vital Indian communities from China to Michigan. In fact, Michigan's Indian-American community is one of the leading ethnic groups in my home State, and its members have made important contributions to the local economy and culture. Many of Michigan's Indian-Americans are professionals who play key roles in sectors like the automotive industry and the field of medicine. Many others are entrepreneurs, and Indian-Americans in Michigan own more than 600 businesses with thousands of employees. 
Indian-Americans are justifiably proud of the tremendous strides their homeland has made in the last 50 years. India is the world's largest democracy, with nearly 1 billion people. With a middle class of approximately 250 million, India is an increasingly important market for American goods. India's economy has been advancing rapidly, with a large stock market and strong high-tech enterprises like aircraft and automobile manufacturing, a computer industry, and its own space program. 
Mr. President, the 50th anniversary of India's independence provides an opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation to the Indian-American community. I know my colleagues join me in recognizing the profound contributions Indian-Americans have made to American society, and in offering congratulations to the people of India and their descendants throughout the world who are celebrating this important date in history.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wisconsin and congratulate the great Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin for their steadfast leadership on this issue. It is a privilege to join their cause and to join with others, Senator Collins and Senator Cleland, in the Chamber this morning to speak on behalf of this bill. 
Mr. President, I have in my hand here a copy of the current Federal campaign finance law. It says that individuals cannot contribute more than $1,000 to any candidate or political committee with respect to any election for Federal office. It says corporations and unions cannot contribute at all. In Presidential campaigns you are supposed to be financed with public funds. 
That is the law on the books today. So how is it that we hear about contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, corporations and unions? Why do Presidents and Presidential candidates spend long hours fundraising for hundreds of thousands of dollars? How is it possible, we ask? We thought there was a law. 
Well, there is, but in the race to compete and win elections, candidates and parties have found a way around the law, and that way is what we refer to as soft money. It is called soft money as opposed to hard money, which is the money regulated by the campaign finance laws, because soft money is easier to raise. You can get $500,000, say, from just one corporation or individual. You do not have to go to 500 different people and raise $1,000 each as you do with hard money. You can find one person who is rich enough and willing enough to pay a half-million dollars or more and you can then accept that contribution. 
There is another part in current law which says that if you spend money in an election in support of a candidate or opposed to a candidate, you have to spend only money that is raised the hard way, following the limits. But here is a TV ad, and there are dozens like this one, and here we have a transcript of this TV ad, and anyone who would see this ad would think that it was opposed to a particular candidate. But this ad was produced and aired not with hard money, as the law requires, but with soft money, and here it is. It reads this way:  
Who is Bill Yellowtail? He preaches family values but he takes a swing at his wife. Yellowtail's explanation. He only slapped her, but her nose was not broken. He talks law and order but is himself a convicted criminal. And though he talks about protecting children, Yellowtail failed to make his own child support payments, then voted against child support enforcement. Call Bill Yellowtail and tell him you don't approve of his wrongful behavior. 
Now, there is no doubt that that ad, which was bought and paid for by an organization called Citizens for Reform, was designed to defeat Bill Yellowtail, but because it doesn't use any of the seven so-called magic phrases like `vote against' or `defeat,' it is not governed by our campaign finance laws. 
Why? Because it is viewed as an issue ad, at least up until now, and not a candidate ad, and it can be paid for with soft money. Now, nobody really believes that fiction, but that is what the law currently allows. 
So, Mr. President, you have the vicious combination under the current campaign system and outside of the control of our campaign finance laws of contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from one individual or corporation funding campaign ads that go directly for or against a particular candidate. The net result is that the exceptions to our campaign finance laws have swallowed up the rules. Our campaign finance laws are a sham and a shambles. Now we face the daunting task of trying to plug those loopholes, to make the law whole again and in making it whole to make it effective. 
I am pleased to be here today to announce our intention, Mr. President, to get the Senate, one way or another, to take up the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill in September. We are hopeful, of course, that we can work out an agreement with the majority leader to allow us to have an up-down vote on the bill. But if that cannot be arranged, we are committed to getting this legislation before the Senate in spite of the absence of such an agreement. It is not our preferred way to approach this legislation, but it may be the only way we can get it before the Senate. I hope not, but it may prove to be the only way. 
Some will argue that we should first complete the campaign fundraising investigation into the 1996 elections currently being conducted by the Governmental Affairs Committee. But they know that we do not need more evidence to prove this crime. And the current state of our campaign finance system is a crime. What is already unlawful, of course, must be prosecuted, but too much of what is currently lawful should be unlawful. The McCain-Feingold bill is a comprehensive bipartisan bill supported by over a majority of this Senate. The President has said in a letter read by Senator Feingold that he welcomes the opportunity to sign it. There is strong support in the House of Representatives. We are determined to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate and to keep it before the Senate until we get an up-down vote, and we are determined to do that in September. 
The Fourth of July was supposed to be the date by which this legislation was to be considered. This year July comes in September, and we will act to get this legislation considered in an up-down vote by the Senate in September. 
Again, I commend the leaders of this effort. It is going to take great strength and great energy to overcome the opposition, but we are determined to use our full energies to do just that. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important sense of the Senate. It should help to dispel any concerns that Members may have had regarding the Transportation appropriations bill and its potential effect on the ongoing reauthorization process for highway and transit funding. This measure puts the Senate's intention on record that none of the funds in S. 1048 are to be distributed according to the old, unfair formulas. 
Mr. President, the State of Michigan has long been contributing more into the highway trust fund than it receives in Federal money for highways or mass transit, due to the old discriminatory formulas. The changes to previous law included the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 [ISTEA] slightly improved Michigan's return. Unfortunately, it largely continued the decades-old unfair pattern of sending significantly more to small States than they contributed without any valid justification. My State's problem has been further compounded by limitations on obligations through the appropriations process that reduce our total dollar return. As a result, our average ratio of contributions to obligations for highway funding under ISTEA has been approximately 80.5 percent, while mass transit has been even worse with an average ratio of 42.3 percent.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy on the matter of guidance for the distribution of fiscal year 1998 highway and transit appropriations provided by the bill before us. 
It is my understanding that S. 1048 would not, if it became law, direct or otherwise assume that the allocation and apportionment of highway obligation authority to the States from the highway trust fund shall be distributed under the expiring ISTEA formulas or any other distribution scheme. Would the chairman confirm that understanding?

Mr. LEVIN. As a Senator from a donor State, I appreciate the Senator's remarks. I am looking forward to improving Michigan's return on gas tax dollars contributed into the highway trust fund and wanted to be certain that Senate action on this bill did not preclude or prejudge that debate. 
From my review of the mass transit provisions in the bill, it appears that the committee has assumed the old distribution formulas and allocation method. This is a problem for Michigan, and perhaps the chairman's State too, since Michigan is a significant donor State in terms of receipts of transit grants versus contributions to the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. In fact, the Michigan Department of Transportation calculates that Michigan's return at approximately $.53 on the gas tax dollar. According to the Community Transportation Association of America, Alabama receives approximately $.16 per gas tax dollar. 
I am particularly concerned about section 49 U.S.C. 5309(m), which treats bus and bus facilities very poorly in relation to other categories. And, I believe that section 5307 and related sections should be modified to more accurately reflect States' contribution into the mass transit account. These expiring sections and others in title 49 need to be rewritten to provide greater fairness to States that do not have subways or major fixed guideway facilities. 
Does the Committee's bill assume that funds appropriated in this bill for mass transit grant and loan formulas and other mass transit program will be distributed according to the authorizations in title 49 that expire on October 1, 1997?

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chairman for his willingness to clarify these matters, though the mass transit situation is very unfortunate from an equity point of view. This is obviously not the best situation. We need to move an authorization bill for both highway and mass transit programs before October 1, 1997. Debate and resolution of that matter is long overdue. I realize these are difficult and significant matters and that the balanced budget agreement has locked in a lower level of spending on transportation than most of us would have liked, but we will need sufficient time to analyze and debate whatever bill that the Senate Environment and Public Works, and the Banking Committees report to the Senate. It would be very, very unfortunate, if there is an attempt to present a bill to the Senate without adequate time to consider it before the October 1 deadline.

As he may know, the State of Michigan and the Federal Highway Administration are working together in the use of advanced carbon and glass composites as reinforcements for concrete to replace steel in the manufacture of prestressed bridge beams and bridge decks. The House Appropriations Committee report encourages FHWA, through its structures research program, to assist the State in designing and deploying monitoring protocols and systems.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Dr. John Hamre to be Deputy Secretary of Defense. The position of the Deputy Secretary of Defense is one of the most important members of the Secretary of Defense's team. The Deputy serves as the Secretary's alter ego; he traditionally exercises primary responsibility for the internal management of the Department of Defense; and he acts for the Secretary when the Secretary is absent. 
Those are all very important responsibilities. The decisions that Secretary Cohen and his deputy make will have a major impact on the security of our Nation, on the protection of our national interests, and on the well-being of the men and women of our Armed Forces. I have complete confidence in John Hamre's ability to perform these important responsibilities. 
John is, of course, very well known to many Members of the Senate from the 8 years he spent on the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Since leaving the committee staff in 1993, John has moved on to serve as the Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Defense. 
In this capacity, John has devoted a tremendous amount of time and energy to bringing about meaningful and much-needed reform in financial management within DOD. John would be the first to acknowledge that the job is far from finished, but the progress under his leadership has been substantial in my view. For example: 
DOD is in the process of consolidating its accounting offices, moving from 333 offices to only 21 in less than 5 years. DOD had closed 230 accounting offices through fiscal year 1996 and is scheduled to close an additional 103 in fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 1998. 
As a result, DOD has been able to reduce employment at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service [DFAS] from more than 31,000 in fiscal year 1993 to 24,000 today. DFAS operating costs have dropped 25 percent in 4 years, from $1.6 billion in fiscal year 1993 to $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997, in constant fiscal year 1993 dollars. 
DOD has consolidated its civilian pay systems from 25 systems in fiscal year 1991 to 2 systems today and hopes to be down to a single system next year. The system that DOD has designated to take over all civilian pay accounts has gone from handling 15 percent of DOD accounts in fiscal year 1992 to a projected 73 percent in fiscal year 1996 and 83 percent in fiscal year 1997. 
DOD has consolidated its military pay systems from 24 systems in fiscal year 1991 to 4 systems today and hopes to be down to 2 systems next year, with only the Marine Corps maintaining a separate system. The system that DOD has designated to take over all military pay accounts has gone from handling 15 percent of DOD accounts, other than Marine Corps accounts, in fiscal year 1991 to a projected 65 percent in fiscal year 1996 and 90 percent in fiscal year 1997. 
DOD contract overpayments have dropped from $592 million in fiscal year 1993 to $184 million in fiscal year 1996. 
The two most significant categories of problem disbursements--unmatched disbursements and negative unliquidated obligations [NULO]--have dropped from $34.3 billion in June 1993 to $7.9 billion in January 1997. Unmatched disbursements are cases in which a payment has been made, but cannot be matched to its obligation authority; NULO's are cases in which too much money is disbursed, for example, contractor overpayments, or the wrong obligation has been charged. 
The third category of problem disbursements--in-transit disbursements--has increased recently, but is still down substantially over the long run, from $16.8 billion in June 1993 to $11.1 billion in January 1997. In-transit disbursements are cases in which a payment has been made, but the obligation has not yet been matched to its obligation authority, and more than 180 days have passed. 
Over the last several months, a number of statements have been made about Dr. Hamre's handling of progress payments under complex contracts using money from more than one appropriation. While there is no evidence that the existing progress payment system has ever resulted in a violation of the Antideficiency Act, Dr. Hamre has acknowledged that this system is incapable of meeting all applicable requirements, and he has been working hard to address the problem. 
On Wednesday afternoon, I received a letter from Eleanor Hill--the inspector general of the Department of Defense--who first identified the progress payment issue. In response to a joint request from the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and myself, Ms. Hill reviewed the steps taken by Dr. Hamre to address the progress payment issue. Her letter concludes:  
Given current statutory requirements, we believe that the procedures and timelines outlined in those memoranda are appropriate at this time and demonstrate positive movement toward fixing this longstanding problem. 
I am pleased that Dr. Hamre has taken the actions necessary to address the progress payment issue in compliance with existing requirements. But we also need to make sure that these changes are in the best interest of the taxpayers and the Department of Defense. I have asked Dr. Hamre to review the issue and let the Armed Services Committee know if any legislative changes may be needed in this regard. 
Mr. President, I think President Clinton and Secretary Cohen have made an excellent choice with this nomination. I strongly support John Hamre's nomination to be Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to working closely with him and Secretary Cohen in the future.

Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased that the bill managers were able to accept my amendment to prohibit Army Corps consideration of permits that would result in the diversion of ground water from the Great Lakes Basin. 
As my Great Lakes colleagues know, the Army Corps recently stated its opinion that ground water is not covered by section 1109 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. This section states that, `No water shall be diverted from any portion of the Great Lakes within the United States, or from any tributary within the United State of any of the Great Lakes, for use outside the Great Lakes Basin unless such diversion is approved by the Governor of each of the Great Lakes States . . .' and places contraints on funds for any Federal agency study of the feasibility of such a diversion. As I have indicated to the Army Corps, a careful review of the act's legislative history, the Great Lakes Charter, the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, the Federal charter of the Great Lakes Commission and its predecessor, and subsequent congressional authorizations and appropriations referencing the waters of the Great Lakes Basin, shows that ground water recharging or discharging into the Great Lakes is clearly part of the Great Lakes Basin hydrologically speaking and is therefore not divertable without adherence to section 1109. In a nutshell, I disagree with the Corps' conclusion. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Great Lakes region and the conferees to keep this provision intact. This 1-year prohibition will provide time for the appropriate parties to get together and determine how best to proceed, including possible legislative clarification, to permanently prevent covert diversions of a very precious resource, ground water in the Great Lakes Basin.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senators Jeffords and Bryan to bring solar and renewable energy funding levels closer to the administration request than was provided in the Appropriations Committee's bill. And, to clarify the importance of continuing Department of Energy support for solar thermal energy dish/engine systems. 
The committee report proposes to disallow the continued deployment of additional dish/engine systems. Such a prohibition would stifle some very promising environmental technology and most probably break a cost-sharing agreement between the Department and Stirling Thermal Motors of Ann Arbor, MI. And, the language unfairly singles out solar dish/engine systems for elimination, even though competing and funded technologies are more mature and nearer to commercialization. 
I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment so that precommercial research and development can continue on important solar technologies, including solar thermal dish/engine systems. These systems, including thermal motors, have great potential for providing cleaner and more efficient electrical power for all sectors of the economy, potentially including transportation.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to note my concerns with this amendment, which has close to 50 cosponsors. It would establish the position of Senior Representative of the National Guard Bureau and would add that position as the seventh member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Mr. President, the composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a very serious matter. The Joint Chiefs function as an advisory body to the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and the President. Changes in the composition or functions of the Joint Chiefs should only be effected after long and careful consideration. 
Mr. President, of all the issues we considered during the committee process that led up to reporting the landmark Goldwater-Nichols bill to the Senate, one issue was more contentious than any other and took more committee time than all others. That issue was the establishment of the position of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The committee eventually decided to create that position by a one-vote margin. Moreover, although the committee decided to create the position, it decided not to make the Vice Chairman a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As a matter of fact, the Vice Chairman was not made a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff until 1992, some 6 years after the position was created. In contrast, the Stevens amendment would add a new member to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Armed Services Committee has not held one hearing on the matter. I would also note that Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili oppose this amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment has the same language as the original second-degree amendment in almost all respects but a few relatively minor ones. It is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution. It is not a funding cutoff. It is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that our ground forces should be out of Bosnia in June 1998. It has the same language as last night relative to the possible support for a European follow-on force, either through the European Security and Defense Identity, which is part of NATO, or in some other kind of a NATO-led force, but without the participation of the U.S. ground combat forces. 
It adds a provision at the end that the President should consult with the Congress with respect to any support to be provided to such a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on force in Bosnia after June 1998. And then there are some findings in front that are factual findings before the sense-of-the-Congress language that is the heart of last night's and this second-degree amendment. 
Mr. President, very briefly, we should send a message that our troops on the ground in Bosnia will be out by next June. That is the policy of the administration. We should support that mission description. We should do so in a way that will not undermine the goals of Dayton, or undermine the flexibility of our commanders in the field. The funding cutoff was too rigid, too inflexible, and too far in advance. So this approach was adopted. 
General Shalikashvili and Secretary Cohen sent us a letter on July 9 that, in two sentences, reflects the spirit and heart of my second-degree amendment. 
Part of that letter reads as follows: `We remain committed to a June 1998 withdrawal date.' That is Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili speaking. The next line also is reflected in this sense-of-the-Congress resolution: `However, we strongly oppose a statutorily mandated withdrawal of the United States forces from the NATO-led Stabilization Force by that date or, indeed, any specific date.' It points out that, our forces must be able to proceed with a minimum risk to U.S. personnel: legislating their redeployment schedule would completely change the dynamic on the ground and could undercut troop safety. 
I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from General Shalikashvili and Secretary Cohen be printed into the Record at this time.

Mr. LEVIN. Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Feingold, whose initiative it was that put us on the path to making a statement to sending a message about congressional intent, which this amendment reflects. Even though there is no funding cutoff, as I believe there should not be, there should be a strong statement as to what congressional intent is at this time and under these circumstances. And this second-degree amendment that I offered last night, and have slightly modified again, which has now been adopted, is a bipartisan amendment; it always has been. 
Senator McCain has been active in this. Senator Reed from Rhode Island, my first cosponsor, has been a very, very strong active person in the debate of this issue. I want to also express my particular gratitude to Senator Reed of Rhode Island for his constant involvement and participation and help in drafting this language. 
With that, I thank Senator Warner, as always, for his work in trying to bring people together. My good chairman, Senator Thurmond, as always, is helpful in trying to resolve these issues. And the two leaders have been very active as well. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my amendment would establish a cost cap on the cost of the next nuclear aircraft carrier, and ensure that we achieve the savings that we expect from beginning to fund the ship next year, which is a number of years earlier than planned. 
Mr. President, the committee bill authorizes $345 million in fiscal year 1998 to begin incrementally funding construction of the next Nimitz class nuclear aircraft carrier, CVN-77, based on claims of cost savings by the shipbuilder. The Committee did not adopt safeguards to ensure that the taxpayers actually receive the savings on which this unusual action is based. Those are the safeguards which are contained in this amendment. 
Let me just review the bidding. The Navy budget projects a total cost of $5.2 billion for CVN-77, funded normally--that is, with advance procurement of $695 million in fiscal year 2000 and the remaining $4.5 billion of full funding in fiscal year 2002. 
The shipbuilder--Newport News Shipbuilding--has come forward with a proposal to save $600 million by having the Government provide funding for CVN-77 earlier than the Navy budget proposes it. This claim has been repeated over the last 2 months in a highly visible media campaign. 
The shipbuilder claims that we could buy the CVN-77 under their alternative for $4.6 billion--a savings of $600 million --if we provide incremental funding over the next 5 years, starting with $345 million in fiscal year 1998. 
I have been very skeptical in the past of providing phased or incremental funding for defense programs. The normal method of funding major defense procurement programs is to provide full funding in one lump sum in the year in which the program is started, with the exception of certain limited long-lead items which are funded through advance procurement. As a general rule, incrementally funding major weapons programs reduces visibility over total program costs, and can lead to a `buy in' situation in which it becomes more difficult to control total program costs and future cost growth. 
Mr. President, I believe that we should try to achieve savings in Defense modernization wherever we can, particularly savings of the magnitude of $600 million. Meeting our modernization goals for the military services over the next 10 years within a stable defense budget is going to be a significant challenge. We need to look for innovative ways to save money, and this approach to funding the CVN-77 looks like something we should do if--and this is the critical if--we really save money. At the same time, I feel strongly that we must protect the interests of the taxpayer, if we are to take full advantage of the opportunity for savings. 
It will disadvantage the tax payer if we incrementally fund CVN-77 without the assurances that the reason for doing it--saving dollars--is in fact achieved. 
That's why we should adopt this amendment putting a ceiling on the total cost of this ship that is in line with what the shipbuilder promised. 
If we don't, we will be in a terrible bargaining position. 
The amendment puts a limit on the total cost of the next carrier, using the cost cap language that was developed for the Seawolf submarine as a model. The amendment: establishes a cost cap of $4.6 billion for CVN-77, $600 million below the Navy's budget estimate fully funding this ship in the usual manner; it excludes outfitting and post delivery costs; and it adjusts the cost cap automatically to reflect changes in inflation or costs attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or local laws. 
This amendment adds three important additional provisions: 
It includes a proviso that allows the Navy to change the cost cap for the ship based on changes in costs that are incurred by inserting new technology--compared to the previous carrier, CVN-76. 
It includes a proviso that allows the Navy to change the cost cap for the ship if the funding is changed in later fiscal years from the plan on which the shipbuilder based his proposed savings. 
And it includes an annual reporting requirement on changes in the end cost of the CVN-77, so there will be visibility into the technology improvement program that will allow the Navy to demonstrate how technology insertion is causing any substantive changes in the end cost of the ship. 
My bottom line is that, despite my overall concerns about incremental or phased funding, I am willing to support this funding approach for the next aircraft carrier, because I believe we can achieve the savings under the phased funding approach. We must, however, have a vehicle to guarantee that the Government will achieve the promised savings, which is the driving argument for phased funding. 
Mr. President, this amendment will help guarantee those savings, while providing room to adjust the price of CVN-77 for the legitimate factors indicated. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. I agree with the Senator from Virginia. The $600 million savings that we all expect to achieve are based upon the funding profile set forth in the smart buy proposal. I will work with the Senator from Virginia to ensure that we maintain that funding profile and achieve these savings, and I expect the Navy to do the same. 
If for any reason the Navy fails to include the funding profile in its budget request, the amendment that we are offering provides a specific remedy: the funding limitation would remain in place, but would be adjusted to address the impact of the changed funding profile. Paragraph (2)(E) of the amendment specifies that the limitation will be revised to reflect any adjustments needed to accommodate a change in funding. Would the Senator from Virginia agree that this is the effect of this amendment?

Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. I certainly share his concern about any action by DOD to retroactively apply a new standard, or to apply the terms of a rule that has been withdrawn. 
However, the Department of Defense disputes the contractor's position, and says that the issue is currently in litigation. I understand that the House has included a provision addressing this issue in their version of the bill, and I don't think we should lock this in until we have an opportunity to hear out both the contractor and the Department. 
I would be happy to work with Senator Robb on this issue, and if it turns out that the Department has retroactively applied a new standard, I will fully support the Senator from Virginia.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, talk about emotions. We ought to share the emotions of the business people who can't compete, who aren't allowed to compete on products that are being bought by the Federal Government--their Government using taxpayers' money paying more for products, created in a prison by prisoners, rather than by people outside of prison, who are not allowed to compete because of the monopoly which is given to Federal Prison Industries. 
You talk about raw emotions. Try a Vietnam vet who is trying to sustain a small business who isn't permitted to sell his product to the Government at a much cheaper rate than the Government is paying with Federal Prison Industries. You want to talk about raw emotions. Put yourself in the position of the small business person. 
Listen to this one from Access Products from Colorado Springs. They couldn't bid on an Air Force contract for toner cartridges because the FBI exercised its right to take the contract on a sole source basis. 
This is a letter from a small business person in Colorado. 
Federal Prison Industries bid on this item, and I was told that the award had to be given to Federal Prison Industries. Federal Prison Industries won the award at $45 per unit. My company's bid was $22 per unit. The way I see it the government just over-spent my tax dollars to the tune of $1,978. Do you seriously believe that this type of procurement is cost effective? I lost business, my tax dollars were misused because of unfair procurement practices mandated by Federal regulation. This is a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, of how the procurement system is being misused and small businesses in this country are being excluded from competition with the full support of Federal regulation. 
Do you want to talk about emotions? My good friend from Texas: How about the Vietnam vet trying to run a furniture business? This is what he testified to in front of the House. `Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran twice wounded fighting for our country effectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's business which the Veterans Administration suggested that they enter?' 
My good friend from Texas usually believes in competition. I have heard him on this floor as eloquently as anyone talking about competition. That is all we are talking about here. We are only talking about allowing people to compete to sell at the lowest price. 
We are not trying to say that Federal Prison Industries should not be able to compete on products that are sold to the Federal Government. Of course, they should. But should not the small businessperson paying the taxes be allowed to compete? 
We talk about emotions on this floor and feeling emotional about a subject. Put yourself in the position of the small businessperson whose price is lower. Despite the fact that prisoners' wages run from 23 cents an hour to $1.15 an hour, despite the fact that Federal Prison Industries pays no income taxes, no need to provide health or retirement benefits to workers, a private businessperson still, in many cases, is able to produce that product more cheaply and is told: Sorry, it's got to go to Federal Prison Industries. He's a clothing producer; he's a textile producer; he's a product producer, and he is told Federal Prison Industries has the monopoly. They have exerted their right to prevent you from coming in at a lower price. There is an established price, and even though you can beat it, private businessperson, sorry. 
With all of the advantages, the price advantages that Federal Prison Industries has--cheap labor, no medical cost, no income taxes--if they can't beat a commercial price for a product, then the taxpayer should not make up the difference. 
Now, this is a very fundamental issue. Of course, prisoners should work. But if they cannot with all those advantages produce a product more cheaply than the commercial world can produce it, they ought to be looking at other products. They ought to be looking at things which we import and are sold to the Government. There they will not be unfairly displacing American businesses and American workers who can produce something more cheaply than can Federal Prison Industries. 
Now, that is what this issue is about, and I want to make sure that we all focus on this. This is an issue of where a business can provide the product more cheaply. This is not an amendment which says that where an American business can supply a product, Federal Prison Industries should not be allowed to supply it to the Government. That is not this amendment. This is simply an amendment which says where the commercial provider can offer a product to the Government, its Government, our Government at a cheaper price than Federal Prison Industries, Federal Prison Industries should not be able to determine that its product at a higher price must be bought by the Federal Government. 
Now, we are talking a lot of bucks here. The Defense Department is the biggest purchaser. This is what Master Chief Petty Officer Hagan stated when he was--he is from the Navy--testifying in front of the House National Security Committee. This is his testimony about the Federal Prison Industries monopoly on Government contracts and how that monopoly has undermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for sailors. 
How is that for emotions? Are our sailors entitled to the best that can be bought at the cheapest price? Or are we going to say that because Federal Prison Industries hasn't figured out what they can produce which is now imported or what they can produce which now has a higher cost--and the recycling business is a wonderful example of that--because Federal Prison Industries has not figured out what can be produced which does not in a noncompetitive way displace American businesses and American labor, that is OK. 
It is not OK. 
This is what the Navy witness said.  
Speaking frankly, the FPI product is inferior, costs more, and takes longer to procure. FPI has, in my opinion, exploited their special status instead of making changes which would make them more efficient and competitive. The Navy and other services need your support to change this law. 
We are here on a defense bill. This is what the Navy representative testifying in front of the House said. 
The Navy and other services need your support to change this law and have FPI compete with private sector furniture manufacturers under GSA contracts. Without this change, we will not be serving sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and efficient way. 
We have had estimates now on the cost to the taxpayers that results from this monopoly where Government agencies are forced to buy products at higher than the lowest bid. The Deputy Commander of Defense Logistics wrote in May 1996 that Federal Prison Industries had a 42 percent delinquency rate in its clothing and textile deliveries compared to a 6 percent delinquency rate for commercial industry. 
Now, for this record of poor performance--that is just the performance statistics: 42 percent delinquency on Federal Prison Industries versus 6 in the private sector--for this record of poor performance, Federal Prison Industries charged prices that were an average of 13 percent higher than commercial prices. And 5 years earlier, the Department of Defense inspector general reached the same conclusion, reporting that Federal Prison Industries contracts were more expensive than 
contracts for comparable commercial products by an average of 15 percent. 
Since the Department of Defense bought about $150 million last year from Federal Prison Industries, this overpricing is costing a lot of money, and that is the issue here. 
Now, the good Senator from Texas is correct, that this bill does not address a problem that he sees. He would like to see Federal Prison Industries be able to use prison labor at from 23 cents an hour to $1.15 an hour with no medical benefits and no income tax, he would like to see products produced by Federal prison labor out in the commercial market, and he calls people that do not want to deal with that greedy. I do not, any more than I think it is wrong to tell China that if they want to produce products with prison labor, they are not going to be able to use those products to displace American workers and American businesses. I do not think that is wrong. 
We have a fundamental difference on that issue. And he is sure right. This bill does not reverse those laws because once you did that, you would have businesses in this country going bankrupt in huge numbers because they would have to be dealing with 23-cents-an-hour prison labor. And we have decided as a people that that is not fair to American business. It is not fair to American business either that even though they can sell a product at a cheaper price to an American Government agency, it will not be allowed to do so where Federal Prison Industries has established a monopoly and asserted that monopoly for that item. It can sell more cheaply and the odds are pretty good the product will be better. The agency will want to buy it, but it is told, sorry, you can't buy at less and frequently a better product because Federal Prison Industries has decided to assert a monopoly in that area. 
There are areas where Federal Prison Industries can move. They have been urged to do so. We have had meeting after meeting, forum after forum, summit after summit with Federal Prison Industries. Of course, you want to keep people in prison busy, but you have to keep them busy in a way that is not unfairly and anticompetitively dealing with American businesses. 
And, by the way, that is why the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the National Association of Manufacturers support this amendment. And that is why it has such strong bipartisan support, cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Robb, Helms, Kempthorne, Daschle, and Burns. It has bipartisan support because this is a procurement issue. It is a competition issue. It is a fundamental, commonsense, fairness issue that an American business ought to be allowed to compete with Federal Prison Industries for sales to its own Government. 
If a commercial product is costing more than the prison product, that may not be fair, but that is not touched by this amendment. This amendment only goes to the cases where the commercial product is cheaper than the Federal Prison Industries product. 
Mr. President, it is time for the mandatory sourcing rule of Federal Prison Industries, this monopoly that they assert, although their products are more costly, to be changed. There is no better bill to change it on than a defense bill since the Defense Department is the biggest object of that monopoly. The testimony before the House committee is clear that our service personnel are not being given the products that they deserve--best quality, cheapest price--because of an artificial 
monopoly which is allowed to exist. 
It is not supposed to be this way, by the way. The theory of this monopoly would be that if Federal Prison Industries can come in cheaper than a commercial product, then it would be allowed to do so because of the work which we want our prisoners to be engaged in. But it is being abused. It is being abused. And when Federal Prison Industries asserts that monopoly in cases where its prices, despite all of its advantages, are higher than the commercial world, then they should not be allowed to continue to deal with the business world and the workers of America in that way. 
Just this morning my staff received a telephone call from an acquisition official at an agency that I am not going to name because I do not want to get them in any trouble, but following last night's debate this acquisition official asked when this Federal Prison Industries amendment was likely to be enacted. Of course, we do not know whether it will be enacted. But the official explained that their agency was in the process of making a substantial purchase of office furniture and was told that it would have to buy it from Federal Prison Industries. They requested a waiver from Federal Prison Industries. That request has been denied. The agency in question has had a history of problems with Federal Prison Industries, the official said. `Quality, price, delivery, timing, you name it.' And when my staff explained that we do not know whether the amendment would be enacted, much less when it would be enacted, the official stated, `Well, we would probably be willing to wait a few months because we certainly don't want to get stuck with their stuff.' 
Now, the good Senator talked about waivers, and that is fine. But we ought to use the marketplace. He has frequently said, and I agree with him, at least in most circumstances, that we ought to look to the commercial world to provide us the best products at the cheapest prices. We make an exception with prisoners because if they can produce a product, even though it is cheaper, we say it is important that we keep people working and we will allow that product, providing it is at least no more expensive than the commercial product, we will then--that was the intent--allow that product to be the one which is bought by our Government. 
And there is even some unfairness in that if you are in the business trying to compete with that cheap labor. But what this amendment does is simply say where the commercial product, despite all of those advantages of 23 and 40 and 50 cents an hour and a dollar an hour labor and none of the benefits and no income tax, despite all those benefits, when an American business can produce a product more cheaply than Federal Prison Industries, then surely it is unfair, anticompetitive for that product to have to be bought from Federal Prison Industries. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas made a number of points, and one of them particularly I want to comment on. He said, `If there is a problem of the price not being competitive, then let's adjust it.' That is this amendment. That is exactly what this amendment does. There is a problem, and the problem is that even when the price of the prison product is more than the commercial product, that is, noncompetitive, nonetheless, Federal Prison Industries can direct the purchase. 
So the problem, which was identified with the `if' word by my friend from Texas, is the problem which this amendment addresses. I don't know why any of us need a study on the principle involved 
here. The principle involved is a pretty direct, simple principle. If the commercial product is cheaper than the prison-made product, then don't stick the taxpayers with the extra cost and don't cause the private business person out of prison the loss of that sale. That is the principle. If that is true 10 percent of the time or 15 percent of the time or 5 percent of the time, it is the same principle. And that is the principle we will be voting on: Whether or not we want to have a study to see how often the principle is violated, or whether or not we want to vote for the principle, and it is the principle which is driving this amendment. 
I have a letter from a citizen of Texas: 
I am writing in regards to reforming Federal Prison Industries and ending its mandatory source status. I am a business person and a resident of San Antonio, TX. Not only do I reside in the heart of Texas, but also in the heart of military bases. It is virtually impossible for me to make a living due to the mandatory status implemented by the Federal Prison Industries. I urge you to support and follow Senator Carl Levin and his legislation that would allow businesses to compete with FPI for Federal contracts. 
Those are the keywords. You can put them in bright lights: `Allow them to compete.' That is the principle. 
She goes on: 
Today, we are prohibited from doing so. If a product is made by a Federal prison, then Federal agencies are forced to buy that product. It would also help Government agencies by allowing them to compare price and quality from a broader array of sources. 
That is the principle. Mr. President, our good friend from Texas said that he is sure the American people, by at least a vote of 10 to 1, would want our prisoners to work. I think it is much more than that. I hope it would be 100 to 1. But I think it would be 1,000 to 1 that people want our Government to buy the products at the best price. That is the discipline of the marketplace. That is what a free enterprise economy should be about. 
Do we make an exception to that rule when it comes to certain products that are made by slave labor in other countries? Yes. Have we made an exception for saying it is unfair to American business that prison-made products in America should not compete in the commercial world? When the Senator from Texas says that he would like to turn prisons into industrial parks, is that fair to Americans who are not in prison who need more than 20 or 30 or 40 cents an hour to survive? Is that really fair? I don't think so, and this amendment, he is surely right, does not reverse the prohibition on that. But all this amendment does is to allow the private sector to compete when its price is lower. 
It is not going to destroy or devastate the Federal Prison Industries. It is going to force them to be producing things where they can do it price competitively with all the advantages they have, and there are many things that they can sell to the Government which fall in that category. There are areas of recycling where we do not now recycle because the cost of labor is so high it does not pay to recycle. Prison labor is a very good source of potential labor for that. 
There are things that Government buys that are important--and I emphasize that the Government buys that are important--where prison labor would not be displacing American businesses and where, indeed, it would make good sense and would be fair for those products to be produced and bought by the U.S. Government. 
All we are doing is implementing the very principle which the Senator from Texas said: `If there's a problem now with prices not being competitive, let's adjust it.' That is this amendment. That is all we are doing, we are adjusting it. We are saying, let American Government agencies buy products from American businesses when they can do so more cheaply than the product that they are now being forced to buy too often by the Federal Prison Industries.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Murray amendment for a number of reasons. Before I get to them, let me just say that I think all of us recognize that the issue of abortion can stir so many emotions so quickly that it is important for us to understand what any amendment before us does and what it does not do. It is important to really focus on both. What does it do and what doesn't it do? 
This amendment would allow a woman seeking an abortion to pay for it from her own funds at a military hospital overseas. That is what it does. There has been a prohibition on this use of military hospitals since the 1996 Defense Authorization Act was enacted. This amendment would repeal that prohibition. In doing so, the amendment would allow a woman serving in our Armed Forces overseas who chooses to have an abortion to have that abortion performed in a modern American medical facility by well-trained doctors who have volunteered for that duty, provided that all costs and fees associated with the abortion are paid in advance, using private funds. 
This amendment would give the female service members stationed overseas the same access to the high standards of medical hygiene, technology, and medical care that is enjoyed by other female service members stationed in the United States under the same standards of medical care enjoyed by the women of America who have not chosen to serve their country in the military. 
And to establish that equitable access this amendment would permit the Department of Defense to reinstate a policy that existed prior to 1988 which was reinstated by the President in 1993 but was prohibited by Congress in 1996. Under that policy that would be reinstated should this amendment become law, as I believe it should, military women stationed overseas, as well as adult female dependents of male or female service members living overseas, would be able to exercise their right to have access to a safe abortion procedure without being put at risk by having to rely on the medical facilities available on the local economy which may not be up to the same high standards found in American hospitals. That is a constitutional right that we are talking about here. Many would disagree that it should be, and I think we should respect that. 
There is disagreement over this issue as to whether or not that right which would be protected by this amendment should be protected by the Constitution. Surely people who are of good faith disagree on that question. But it is a constitutional right. Women who exercise that right would be required to pay the full cost for an abortion near their duty station by well-trained doctors who have volunteered for such work. 
What does the amendment not do? It does not provide the taxpayer dollars to pay for the abortion because the woman must pay the full cost. The Defense Department would be required to compute that. I don't think that really is the issue here, although it has been raised. The words `taxpayers funds' have been raised here. I don't think that is really the issue. Because I think if the opponents of this amendment were satisfied that there is no even indirect cost which would not be paid for that their opposition would end. And it is the intent of the amendment, if it is law, that the full cost be paid by the woman in advance and the responsibility is on the Defense Department to compute those costs. 
So, again I repeat. I don't think that is really the issue. The real issue is the underlying issue of whether or not an abortion, even if paid for fully by the woman, should be performed in a hospital overseas. 
Another thing the amendment does not do is require military doctors to perform abortions nor allow their careers to be affected if they choose not to perform abortions. It protects the right of doctors in the military not to perform abortions and protects their careers, if they choose not to perform an abortion. 
The amendment does not provide free abortions in military hospitals. The current prohibition on the use of Federal funds for abortion remains in effect. It is an important point. There is a prohibition on the use of Federal funds on abortions which remains in effect under this amendment. All costs associated with an abortion would be the responsibility of the patient. 
Mr. President, this amendment would avoid placing women who serve our country overseas in an inequitable position relative to women who have chosen not to serve our Nation, and I hope this amendment is adopted. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes in support of my amendment which is cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Robb, Helms, Kempthorne, Daschle, and Burns. 
The issue really is the opportunity to sell goods and services. That is, indeed, the issue. The question is whether or not the private sector ought to have the opportunity to sell its goods and services when its price is better than the price of Federal Prison Industries. That is the issue. 
The national performance review had as one of its reforms in procurement that we should require Federal Prison Industries to compete commercially for Federal agency business. That is what we are talking about--whether they ought to have a monopoly so that even though their goods are higher in price, Federal Prison Industries is able to say that an agency must buy their product. That wasn't the intent of the Federal Prison Industries law. The intent was that they are supposed to be competitive. They have all kinds of advantages. 
The labor prices in prisons, needless to say, range from something like 23 cents an hour to $1.15 an hour. They don't pay income tax, no medical benefits, no retirement, and no benefits, obviously. So they have tremendous economic advantage to begin with. Nonetheless, with all of those advantages, what we have said is, if they can produce something more cheaply than the private sector, that the Federal agencies ought to be able to buy that product, and they should. What this amendment simply says is that if the private sector, despite all of the advantages that Federal Prison Industries has in terms of cheap labor--no income tax, no medical costs, and so forth charged to the product --if, despite all of that, a business can produce a product more cheaply that it ought to be able to sell that product to its Government. 
So the issue is exactly the opportunity to sell goods. But it is the opportunity for business people in the private sector to sell goods to their Government. The frustration level is very high here. We get letters from people--veterans who write us, who say, `Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in and take business away from a disabled Vietnam vet twice wounded fighting for the country effectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's business which the Veterans' Administration suggested he enter?' 
This is a man who can't bid. He is not allowed to bid on a product his own Government is buying. 
Here is a letter that comes in from Colorado from Access Products of Colorado. The award in this case went to Federal Prison Industries, although the charge to the Air Force was $45 for this particular unit. This private sector guy was offering it at $22 per unit. So the taxpayers are paying twice as much, and he is not allowed to sell a product that he makes on the outside to his Air Force. 
The private sector is very deeply involved in my amendment, and very strongly supportive of it. The NFIB strongly supports it. The chamber of commerce strongly supports the Levin-Abraham amendment. The National Association of Manufacturers strongly support this amendment. The reason they support it is because of the principle that it embodies--the principle of competition. That principle is that people who are in business struggling to make a living wanting to sell to their Government ought to at least be allowed to bid competitively against Federal Prison Industries which has tremendous advantage and does frequently underbid the private sector because of those advantages in terms of labor costs and all the other advantages they have. 
That frequently happens, that their prices are much lower than the private sector because of all those advantages. But when the private sector is able to produce a product, be it clothing or furniture, or whatever, more cheaply than Federal Prison Industries, it ought to be allowed to sell to its Government. And that is why this issue is so important to the private sector. 
My time is up. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEVIN. I wish to introduce a letter from a coalition called the Competition in Contracting Act Coalition. I want to read this letter because it is short and it states our case, I think, very well. 
The coalition is made up of 28 organizations, 204 businesses that support the Levin-Abraham amendment relative to the mandatory source status of Prison Industries. And this is what the letter goes on to say: 
Your legislation would allow businesses to compete with the FPI for Federal contracts. Today they are prohibited from doing so. If a product is made in a Federal prison and Federal agencies are forced to buy that product, the only way around the requirement is for an agency to seek a waiver from FPI . . . Your bill would implement a recommendation of the National Performance Review which stated that our Government should `take away the Federal Prison Industries status as a mandatory source of Federal supply and require it to compete commercially for Federal agencies' business.' 
This solution would help manufacturers by eliminating the barrier to competition and allowing the bid process to take place. It would help Government agencies by allowing them to compare price and quality from a broad array of sources.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Finally, Mr. President, I want to just make reference to two examples, two Federal agencies that believe the current system is totally inefficient and wasteful. 
First, the Veterans Administration has sought the repeal of the mandatory preference on several occasions because Federal Prison Industries pricing for textiles, furniture and other products is routinely higher. The VA officials estimate that the repeal of the preference will save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency alone, making that money available for veterans services. 
Mr. President, the estimate that we have received based on testimony from the deputy director of Defense Logistics in a 1996 letter to the House of Representatives is that Federal Prison Industries has a 42-percent delinquency rate. This is the deputy commander of the Defense Logistics Agency. He says that FPI has a 42-percent delinquency rate compared to a 6-percent delinquency rate for commercial industry--7 times the delinquency rate. And for that record of poor performance, Federal Prison Industries prices were an average of 13 percent higher than commercial prices. 
I yield 1 additional minute to complete my statement here, Mr. President. 
Some years earlier, the DOD inspector general had made a similar assessment and reached a conclusion that FPI contracts were more expensive than contracts for comparable commercial products by an average of 15 percent. 
So here you have the Defense Logistics Agency in 1996 saying that the prices were 13 percent higher than commercial prices. The DOD inspector general a few years earlier in a study said comparable commercial prices are 15 percent cheaper than Federal Prison Industries. 
We are not suggesting in any way that Federal Prison Industries not be allowed to compete. Quite the opposite. It is fine that they compete, and it is fine that people are working. But it is also fine that people work on the outside and they should not lose their jobs on the outside when they can produce something more cheaply with all the advantages that people have on the inside in terms of cheap labor. If people working on the outside can produce a product more cheaply, for heaven's sake, it seems to me fundamental fairness is that the person not in prison be allowed to sell to his own Government a product that he can produce more cheaply than can be produced inside of that prison. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we obviously want people in prison to work, but we also want people who are out of prison to have an opportunity to compete. The current Federal Prison Industries approach will not permit people to compete even when their prices are lower than the Federal Prison Industries price. That is not fair to all the small businesses in this country. Hundreds of them have banded together in a Competition in Contracting Act Coalition. Small businesses in all of our States just want the right to compete when their prices are lower. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Abraham.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has offered an amendment, which has as its purpose sending a very clear sign to our friends in Europe, our allies, to the administration, and to the people of America that it is our intention that our forces be out of Bosnia by the middle of next year. And I happen to share that goal. I think it is important that if we are going to be credible militarily, that when we have a mission and we set an end point for that mission, as we have, and particularly where the military side of that mission has now been accomplished--the military side--that for our military to be credible, we should live up to the mission's shape, the mission's description. 
Now, part of this mission--and it was stated when these troops were sent in--was that they would complete their mission by the middle of next year, and they were given certain other tasks and, militarily, those tasks have been assigned. The civilian side of the Dayton accords have not been fulfilled, surely. And it is my clear belief that the civilian side of the Dayton accords are not going to be completed by the middle of next year. There are going to be many years before those civilian goals in Dayton can be achieved. 
It is my own personal belief that there is going to need to be a follow-on force in Bosnia if the gains which have been made are not going to be lost. There have been some significant gains. I also believe that the Europeans should take a greater responsibility for that follow-on force, and they should know now that it is the intention of the Congress that a follow-on force, which is likely to be necessary, or may be necessary, is going to be one that will not have American ground combat troops. 
That is goal 1 of this second-degree amendment. It is to state the sense of the Congress that American forces leave Bosnia by the middle of next year, as planned, as scheduled, as part of the mission. 
But there is another part to the second-degree amendment. That part is a reference to the Europeans, as providing a follow-on force, if necessary, through something called the European Security and Defense Initiative, which is an initiative inside of NATO, using NATO's assets, which has been approved by NATO, but which is connected to the western European Union. It is an effort to get greater European initiative in European affairs. It is a way of saying we will support the Europeans in taking that initiative through the use of NATO assets, but without having Americans in the lead everywhere that NATO operates. 
It is something the Europeans have said they want many, many times. It is their initiative inside NATO. It has been approved by NATO. NATO, in January 1994, gave its full support to the development of a European Security and Defense Initiative to strengthen the European pillar of the alliance, and in order to allow our European allies to take greater responsibility for the common security in their common defense. It was designed to enable, as I said, the western European Union to carry out operations using NATO assets and capabilities. That is the other part of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
So I want to commend the Senator from Wisconsin, and many others in this body, who want to keep us to the mission statement, the mission goal, part of which is that our troops would be removed by the middle of next year. Again, I emphasize the military part of the Dayton accords have been completed. Our military has done a spectacular job. We should be supporting our military, and we are. This second-degree amendment avoids the excessive statement that is made when one says there is going to be a cutoff in funding, but at the same time sends a strong message that it is Congress' intent that there not be United States forces on the ground in Bosnia after next year. It gives a little greater flexibility. 
A funding cutoff, under these circumstances, when our military is there now, successfully, is too blunt an instrument. It is just too inflexible an instrument. It will take away bargaining power that currently exists both with our allies and with some of the negative regressive forces inside of Bosnia. We are going to have plenty of time to act to cut off funds, should that be necessary and should the circumstances dictate. But we should not commit ourselves a year in advance to cutting off funds when there is sufficient time at a later time to do so. 
So this second-degree amendment sends a strong message, which is the intent of the Senator from Wisconsin--an intent that I happen to share--but it does so without either undermining the morale of our troops, or without harming our chances for further progress in Bosnia. 
So, Mr. President, I basically have reached a number of conclusions that are reflected in this amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator McCain of Arizona. These are the conclusions that I believe are accurate, based on a lot of personal visits to Bosnia and a lot of study. 
One, there is an absence of war in Bosnia, and that 
situation is likely to remain as long as there is an outside armed force in Bosnia. 
Two, the civilian implementation of the Dayton accords is lagging far behind military implementation. 
Three, central governing institutions are developing in Bosnia, but there is a long way to go. The Bosnian Serbs have not yet decided even that it is in their best interest to cooperate. 
Four, reconciliation among the Bosnian factions has barely begun. 
Fifth, the central role played by the United States has reinvigorated the NATO alliance and re-established America's leadership. 
Six, the United States should continue its leadership role and remain involved in Bosnia. 
Seven, our European NATO allies have sought to become less reliant on the United States, and mechanisms including the European security and defense initiative are being developed to allow them to play a larger role. 
Next, either a Western European-led force, with its core made up of the forces of our European NATO alliance, or a NATO-led force, without a U.S. ground combat presence, should be ready to provide a follow-on force if an armed outside force is necessary to keep the peace in Bosnia after S. 4 completes its mission in June of 1998. 
Mr. President, that is the thrust of this amendment. It is aimed at making a strong statement in terms of congressional intent, but it is also aimed at avoiding too blunt or too inflexible an instrument a year in advance of when the American troops should be removed from Bosnia.

Mr. LEVIN. I think they would see it in two ways. 
First, I think they would see that we are supporting the administration which has stated its position that our troops would be out of there. The administration position is that our troops will be out by the middle of next year. So I think they would see the Senate as going on record as supporting that position of the administration. So they would see some unity in that respect. 
But they also, I think, would see in this second-degree resolution something which is very important. This amendment says that the Europeans and we in NATO talked about greater European initiative. We have now put one in place, and it is being implemented as we speak. 
I checked with General Shalikashvili and I have checked with our leadership in Europe. This European security and defense initiative in NATO adopted by NATO with our support to give the Europeans--not only give them assets to carry out greater European initiatives but to encourage European initiatives. And this is what this amendment also does. It says we support the administration's position that these troops be out. We are going to let you know a year in advance. We are not going to have the funds cut off. It is too inflexible. It is too rigid. That is not part of this sense-of-the-Congress resolution. They will see that as avoiding that kind of inflexibility and rigidity because a lot of things can change possibly. 
On the other hand, it is important that we send that signal that we let the Europeans know that that is our plan, and that is our intention, and that is the administration policy. 
I have visited a number of European capitals, and I have heard the same things which my good friend from Virginia has 
heard about a number of Europeans saying, `We are pulling out if you pull out.' But I have also heard European leadership say maybe there is a way--maybe there is a way that, if the United States plays a more supporting role but not necessarily troops there on the ground, but a more supporting role in some other form that maybe, maybe, it is possible that a follow-on force made up of European forces can stay there. Just the way the British today took that initiative with our help, and at some risk, as we know. There were some casualties. 
So a follow-on force could show that kind of greater European initiative with our support, but without our ground forces being on the ground. 
So I think there are a couple of messages that are involved in the second-degree amendment. And it has the kind of balance which I know my good friend from Virginia is struggling to do which is not to pull the rug out from under, not to have an absolute funding cutoff, but, on the other hand, expressing some clear message that the policy under current plans of having our troops leave in the middle of next year as scheduled is something that we intend at this time to happen.

Mr. LEVIN. The amendment which I have introduced along with Senator Reed and Senator McCain states that it is likely there is going to be a need for a follow-on force for the very reasons the Senator from Virginia states. The Dayton accords civilian goals have not been achieved, and I do not see any prospect that they will be achieved by the middle of next year. I do not see any realistic prospect that we are going to see a million plus refugees resettled, war criminals captured, all the new arrangements, civilian arrangements that have been magnificently provided for in the Dayton accords achieved by the middle of next year. 
I just do not see that happening. But I do not want to see an open-ended commitment of American troops. I think we undermine the credibility of the use of military force when we set a date, as we have; set military missions, which we have; see those missions achieved, which they have been, the military mission achieved, which they have been, and still leave our military there. That turns them into a police force for which I do not think they should be used. I think for the credibility of military forces, if you have a mission, if it is clear, achieve it and leave. 
Well, we had a clear mission militarily. It has been achieved. We have a date for departure, and I think under current circumstances we ought to say it is our intention that we are going to depart as planned. But to have a funding cutoff, it seems to me, goes too far. It is too rigid, too inflexible, too far in advance. 
How do you balance those goals? How do we send a signal to the Europeans that, look, we probably are going to need a follow-on force on the civilian side and you folks have indicated your willingness to take greater initiative in your own backyard. We are willing to help. But we also have a mission which has been accomplished there militarily. We are militarily spread all over this world. We have to have some kind of end points to military missions which have succeeded, and that is the balance which is set forth in this second-degree amendment--to end the open-ended commitment and to, I think, make credible the use of military force by setting a clear mission, seeing it achieved and then departing as scheduled. 
So it is somewhat different from the good Senator from Wisconsin, but I have to tell you that the direction he is moving in, sending some kind of a signal a year in advance, I think is very helpful, providing it is accompanied with this awareness of the likelihood of the need for a follow-on force and our willingness to be supportive of it while we are not with combat forces there on the ground. That is the balance in this second-degree amendment, avoiding some of the concerns, I think, or meeting some of the concerns at least, that the Senator from Virginia has discussed about not wanting to pull the rug out from under in an inflexible, rigid way but nonetheless saying to our European friends: Folks, it is time for you to take some greater initiative. We will be there to help, but it is time for you to show some leadership as well.

Mr. LEVIN. There are two things that are gained. First of all--this suggestion, by the way, is General Shalikashvili's. I put a lot of stock in the kind of suggestions he makes. It can very well be a smaller force, and it is less of a target. American troops, as I think the Senator from Virginia would acknowledge, have been the target of choice too often. Not having American troops there as targets, it seems to me, would be a plus. Having a smaller number nearby makes them less of a target and, on the other hand, does provide some deterrence as well as accomplish some significant cost savings. So there are 
both cost savings involved as well as reducing the risks and the threat to American forces.

Mr. LEVIN. NATO has adopted a policy where the Europeans will take greater initiative without American presence. It is called the European Security and Defense Initiative. It was adopted in January of 1994. It is a NATO policy. 
So, yes, we are a big part of NATO, and we do more than our fair share. I know the Senator would agree with that. We do more than carry our load, and we have more than enough of our personnel around the world at risk. It is time that the Europeans in their own neighborhood take on a greater share of the risk. This is a way of achieving that balance. But it is a NATO initiative. This European Security and Defense Initiative is a NATO initiative, approved by NATO. That is what is referred to in the second-degree amendment.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Robb, Helms, Kempthorne, Daschle, and Burns. This is to implement the recommendation of the National Performance Review that we should require Federal prison industries to compete commercially for Federal agencies' business instead of having a legally protected monopoly. 
Mr. President, our amendment will eliminate the requirement for Federal agencies to purchase prisoner-made goods even when they cost more and are of lesser quality. This amendment will ensure that the taxpayers get the best possible value for their Federal procurement dollars. If a Federal agency can get a better product at a lower price from the private sector, it should be permitted to do so. The taxpayers will get the savings. 
Many in Government and in industry point out that the Federal Prison Industries' products are often more expensive than commercial products, inferior in quality, or both. For example, the Deputy Commander of the Defense Logistics Agency wrote in a May 3, 1996, letter to the House that Federal Prison Industries had a 42-percent delinquency rate in its clothing and textile deliveries, compared to a 6-percent rate for the commercial industry. For this record of poor performance, the Federal Prison Industries charged prices that were an average of 13-percent higher than commercial prices. Five years earlier, the DOD inspector general reached the same conclusion, reporting that the Federal Prison Industries' contracts were more expensive than contracts for comparable commercial products by an average of 15 percent. Now, the Department of Defense made roughly $150 million in purchases from Federal Prison Industries last year, and so this is currently costing the Department of Defense, alone, $25 million. 
Mr. President, it just makes no sense that, with all of the advantages in terms of labor price, which is nominal in prison, that they can assert a monopoly which gives them the right to sell to the Defense Department products at a greater cost than the Defense Department could buy them in the commercial market, and this amendment would correct that. 
At this point, I want to yield to my good friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham, for his statement. I ask unanimous consent that I be immediately recognized thereafter to complete my statement.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, last July, a master chief petty officer of the Navy testified before the House National Security Committee that the FPI monopoly on the Government furniture contract has undermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for its sailors. This was his testimony. 
Speaking frankly, the FPI product is inferior, costs more, takes longer to procure. FPI has, in my opinion, exploited their special status, instead of making changes that would make them more efficient and competitive. The Navy and other services need your support to change the law and have Federal Prison Industries compete with private sector furniture manufacturers under GSA contract. Without this change, we will not be serving sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and efficient way. 
There was a coalition that joined together to try to provide for competition. All we are asking for is the private sector to be allowed to compete when its product costs less and when its product is a better quality. The competition in contracting at coalition is made up of 28 organizations and 204 businesses. Their letter, in part, reads as follows, that this amendment would implement a recommendation of the National Performance Review which stated that our Government should `take away Federal Prison Industries' status as a mandatory source of Federal supplies and be required to compete commercially for Federal agencies' business.' This solution would help manufacturers by eliminating the barriers to competition and allowing the bid process to take place. 
We received a letter from Access Products of Colorado Springs, CO. They were denied an opportunity to bid on an Air Force contract for toner cartridges because Federal Prison Industries exercised its right to take the contract on a sole-source basis. 
This is a small business in Colorado trying to sell to the Government. They have to compete with incredibly cheap labor in the prisons, which ranges between 23 cents an hour and $1.15 an hour. That is labor paid in the prison. This small business in Colorado makes this product, and they want to sell it to the Government. Here is what they write. 
My company bid $22 a unit. The Federal Prison Industries' bid was $45 a unit. 
The Government ended up paying $45. So here you have a small business struggling to survive against Federal Prison Industries paying incredibly cheap prices for its labor, comes in with a bid of half of what that product is bid by the FPI and loses the bid. 
We are not trying to get a monopoly for the private sector. We are trying to eliminate this monopoly which is assumed by FPI, which allows it to say, this product, since it is produced by FPI, must be used by the Federal agencies, even though it costs the taxpayers more and, in many cases, is nowhere near as good in quality. 
This is what the Access Products folks in Colorado Springs went on to say: 
The way I see it, the government just overspent my tax dollars to the tune of $1,978. The total amount of my bid was less than that. Do you seriously believe this type of product is cost effective? I lost business. My tax dollars were misused because of unfair procurement practices mandated by Federal regulation. This is a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, of how the procurement system is being misused and small businesses in this country are being excluded from competition with the full support of Federal regulations and the seeming approval of Congress. It's far past time to curtail this company known as Federal Prison Industries and require them to be competitive for the benefit of all taxpayers. 
The Veterans' Administration sought repeal of this mandatory preference on several occasions on the ground that FPI prices for textiles, furniture, and other products are routinely higher than identical items purchased from commercial sources. Most recently, Veterans Administration officials estimated that repeal of this preference would save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency alone, making that money available for veterans services. 
We all want to do what we can do reasonably to make sure that work is available for Federal prisons. But the way that we are doing it is all wrong. 
As one small businessman in the furniture industry put it in very emotional testimony at a House hearing last year:  
Is it justice? Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran who was twice wounded fighting for our country and give that work to criminals who have trampled on honest citizens' rights, therefore effectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's business which the Veterans Administration suggested he enter? 
Here you have a veteran of Vietnam who has entered into the 
business at the suggestion of the Veterans Administration, and he is not allowed to compete on a level playing field with Federal Prison Industries. 
Our amendment is supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business and Industry Industrial Furniture Manufacturers Association, the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, the Industrial Fabrics Association International, the Competition in Contracting Act Coalition, and hundreds of small businesses from Michigan and around the country. 
Mr. President, there is something fundamentally wrong with the procurement system which says that a small businessperson cannot compete even though his price is lower than a Federal Prison Industries' price, which has the cheapest labor in the country, 23 cents an hour to $1.15 an hour, and when we tell the veterans who open up small businesses and want to supply the Veterans Administration with a product, that they can't compete because the Federal Prison Industries has a monopoly on a product. We are not dealing fairly with either that veteran or that small businessperson. 
There are many products which this Government buys that are imported which are not produced with American labor of small business, and instead of diversifying to produce those products currently imported and made with non-American labor, we have Federal Prison Industries continuing to focus on textiles, furniture, on items which displace American workers and American small businesses because they have a monopoly. 
We are not seeking a preference. I want to drive home that point. We are not saying Federal Prison Industries should not be allowed to compete. It is the opposite. We are saying American small businesses should be allowed to compete where their price is cheaper and when their quality is better. For Heaven's sake, they ought to be allowed to sell to their Government and not be faced with a monopoly which charges more for even a less quality product frequently, as these letters explain, and nonetheless, sells to the Government at a greater expense to the taxpayers. 
That is why the NFIB, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, all of these small businesses in all of our States are pleading with us to end this monopoly situation. 
Let me read from some of their letters. The National Federation of Independent Business says, in a letter dated June 19, 1997: 
Today, federal agencies are forced to buy prison-made products through Federal Prison Industries (FPI) . . . This is yet another example of avoidable government waste as virtually all such items are available from the private sector, which provides them more efficiently and at lower prices. In addition, such mandatory purchases from the FPI costs America jobs. Firms that can't enter an industry or expand production, can't hire new employees. 
The Chamber of Commerce says, in a letter dated June 19, 1997: 
The Chamber has long-standing policy that the government should not perform the production of goods or services for itself or others if acceptable privately owned and operated services are or can be made available for such purposes. We recognize the importance of the productive training and employment of our nation's inmate population. However, we believe that our federal prison system should not be given preferential treatment at the cost of our nation's small business owners. We believe that there are other substantial sources of work available to inmates that would not infringe upon the private sector's opportunities to compete for government contracts. 
The National Association of Manufacturers says, in a letter dated June 25, 1997: 
The present system that gives FPI a virtual lock on federal government contracts has hurt thousands of businesses, resulted in higher cost(s) for goods and services bought by the government and in many cases has resulted in loss of jobs and business opportunities for our members. Removal of the `FPI mandatory source status is an idea [whose] time has come . . . 
Mr. President, our amendment would not require FPI to close any of its facilities, or force FPI to eliminate any jobs for federal prisoners, or undermine FPI's ability to ensure that inmates are productively occupied. It would simply require FPI--which currently ranks as one of the sixty largest federal contractors--to compete for federal contracts on the same terms as all other federal contractors. That is simply justice to the hard-working citizens in the private sector, with whom FPI would be required to compete.

FFTF 
Mr GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Smith] in a colloquy to clarify a provision within the bill's title on Department of Energy national security programs. Section 3134 limits, for a prescribed time period, the funds made available by the National Defense Authorization Act for the purpose of evaluating tritium production to two options: use of a commercial light water reactor or building an accelerator. As you know, DOE has decided to evaluate, in addition to a commercial reactor and an accelerator, the Fast Flux Test Facility, as known as the `FFTF,' as a possible back-up production option to provide interim quantities of tritium. The FFTF is currently, and in the future proposed to be, funded from sources not covered by this bill, specifically, the non-defense Environmental Management account and the civilian Nuclear Energy account. Accordingly, would the Subcommittee chairman agree that the limitation contained in section 3134 is not applicable to FFTF and similar options that are funded through programs wholly unrelated to that monies provided by this defense bill.

It is a comprehensive statement. It is thorough. It is intellectually solid. It is based, most importantly, on experience. There are some times theoretical statements that we hear that do not have that kind of a base and experience. 
The Senator talked about old values of this country and new threats. He set forth what these new challenges and new threats are. But he also underpinned our commitment as we hope to reflect in this bill with his help the old values which he has so superbly represented throughout his life. 
I just simply want to thank the Senator from Nebraska for his commitment, for his dedication, for his patriotism, and for taking the time to set forth in a document, as he did this morning, and in speeches he gave this morning, some of the most critical challenges that this Nation faces.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment which has been offered by Senator McCain to have an additional 
two rounds of base closings. I do so for many, many reasons. But let me just cite first that we have a recommendation which is as strong a one as I have ever seen from the uniformed military of this country, pleading with us to reduce excess baggage, the infrastructure that they no longer need because it is costing money which is desperately needed elsewhere. 
We cannot successfully do what we need to do for the defense of this Nation, they are telling us--and I will quote that letter in a moment--if we continue to carry excess infrastructure which we simply no longer needed. Now, we are going to hear lots of reasons why it is tough to do it and lots of reasons why we should not do it. We will address those one by one. 
But when you get a letter, which we have received, signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, every single member, a so-called 24-star letter, it does not happen very often around here. But when we get a letter from General Shalikashvili and the Vice Chairman Joe Ralston, and each of the Chiefs signing a letter as succinct and to the point as this one is, I think we ought to give it the most serious consideration. We cannot just shed this and say, base closing is tough or we cannot prove precisely how much money it saves. We have a pretty good idea, by the way, and I will get to that in a moment. But we just cannot simply say, base closings are tough. And they are. Let me tell you, my State knows it. Percentagewise, it is one of the 10 hardest hit States with base closings, and we still have facilities where people feel they are at risk. 
But this is what the letter from the Joint Chiefs says. It is addressed to our chairman, Senator Thurmond. I am going to read it all. It is a short letter, but it is very much to the point. 
Dear Mr. Chairman. 
As the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) appropriately notes, achieving the type of force this country will need in the 21st century requires significant increases in our investment accounts. Given other pressures on the federal budget, we must make every effort to find the funds within the Department of Defense budget. 
Now that is point one. We have to make every effort we can to find the funds necessary for future investments in the defense of this country inside the defense budget. That is a statement based on reality. It is a statement based on the desire of all of us to get down to a zero deficit and to begin to pay off the national debt. It is a statement based on the reality that the defense budget is not going to grow faster or in a different way than what we have projected in our 5-year defense budget, unless, of course, world circumstances change. 
Then the letter goes on: 
Since the end of the Cold War, the Defense base structure has been reduced approximately 26 percent. When the QDR reductions are complete, the overall end strength of the department will have been reduced by over 36 percent. 
We strongly support further reductions in base structure proposed by the Secretary of Defense. Any process must be based on military utility, but sensitive to the impact such reductions will have on the Service communities in which our people live. 
We ask your assistance in addressing this difficult issue. 
Now, they are asking our assistance to do something which is difficult, and it is difficult politically, and every one of us knows that. I don't think there is any one of us who has a facility in our State that we have not been worried about it, that we have not gone to bat for, that we have not been an advocate for and, in some cases, have won a battle for a base and, in other cases, lost a battle for a base. 
That is one of the reasons we are here, to be advocates for our States, and we do that proudly. I have done that for bases in my State. I have won some and I have lost some. We have lost every Strategic Air Command base in my State--all three, gone--and it has been painful. They have been in rural communities. In one case, most recently, up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, it was the largest single employer in the Upper Peninsula, Sawyer Air Force. 
Has the environmental cleanup gone as predicted? It has not gone as fast. Have we struggled to make sure the leases are available to people who want to lease that property? We have; we work with them every day. Is it working out OK? It is. Is it tough? It is. Have there been dislocations? Yes. But is there any alternative if we are going to do our job to come up with the necessary resources to defend this country? Is there any alternative but to shed the excess baggage which our Joint Chiefs are asking us to shed? This is not easy for them, either. Those are communities that they have their hearts and souls in. But what they are telling us is we must bite this political bullet again if we are going to save the funds necessary for modernization, for investment accounts, for readiness, for the other things which we need to do in our defense budget. 
The Quadrennial Defense Review reached the same conclusion. The Secretary of Defense has reached the same conclusion. So the amendment is simple. It authorizes the same process that we used in 1991, 1993, and 1995 for two new rounds in 1999 and 2001. We have changed this process over the years. We have tried to make the environmental cleanup faster. We worked on the leases to make sure that they be available to lease land, even before it was finally cleaned up. We tried to improve the notice requirements, the fairness requirements. We made lots of changes over the years. But to say we are going to not continue to do what our uniformed military says we must do to avoid wasting billions of dollars each year because it is politically difficult or because we cannot determine the precise amount, in an audited fashion, of the savings, it seems to me, is inconsistent with the desire of this body to protect the Nation's defense. 
This process has the Secretary of Defense, again, making recommendations to a commission, nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate. During those confirmation hearings, we got into all of the kinds of issues and concerns which each of us has relative to base closing. The commission, after being confirmed by the Senate, reviews these recommendations and makes their own recommendations to the President. The President then reviews the recommendation, either sends those back to the commission for additional work or forwards them, without changes, to the Congress, and then the recommendations of the commission go into effect unless disapproved by a joint resolution of the Congress. That is the process. 
Has it been perfect? It has not. There have been many changes made in this process over the years. This amendment is open to other changes in terms of how do we approve the process. But to say that the process is not perfect means we should perfect it. It does not mean that we should ditch it when it has led to significant savings already and when it is essential to lead to additional savings in the future. 
The case for closing more military bases is simply clear, and it is compelling. From 1989 to 1997, the Department of Defense reduced total active duty military end strength by 32 percent, and that figure will grow to 36 percent by 2003 as a result of the recently completed Quadrennial Defense Review, known as the QDR. So we are going to be reducing the active end strength, the number of people in our military, by 36 percent. But even after the four base closure rounds that are now completed, the reduction in domestic base structure will be 21 percent. So we have a gap. We have excess. We have surplus. We have baggage we must shed. We have facilities that are no longer being fully used, facilities that are not being run in a 
way which makes economic sense. These are facilities which we can no longer justify keeping. 
Which are those facilities? Does anyone really believe that we on the Senate floor could decide which facilities need to be closed? It was the inability of the Congress to make those kinds of decisions which brought the Base Closure Commission into effect to begin with. We realized a few years back that we could not close bases ourselves. It is too difficult politically. There are too many pressures on us. There are too many tradeoffs that are possible. So we created a BRAC commission, giving ourselves a final right to veto, but basically saying that this is the only realistic way we are going to downsize the unneeded structure. 
Now, this year, General Shalikashvili, who is our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, testified before our committee as follows: `As difficult as it is politically, we will have to further reduce our infrastructure. We, perhaps, have more excess infrastructure today than we did when the BRAC process started. In the short run, we need to close more facilities, as painful and as expensive as it is.' That is his quote. 
One line in that quote, I hope, if nothing else, will remain with us: `We, perhaps, have more excess infrastructure today than we did when the BRAC process started.' 
Now, both the QDR and the independent National Defense Panel--and this is the group of citizens outside the Defense Department that have been appointed by the President--both the QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, inside the Defense Department, and the independent National Defense Panel have concluded that further reductions in DOD infrastructure--that is the base structure of the Department of Defense--are essential to free up the money that we need to modernize our forces. 
On May 23, Secretary Cohen wrote to the chairman, Senator Thurmond, and to me, asking the Congress to act this year on his request to authorize two additional base closure rounds in 1999 and 2001. Though we will not get the final report of the National Defense Panel until later this year, they do have an interim report dated May 15 which accompanies the Quadrennial Defense Review. This is what the outside citizens panel said about base closures:  
We endorse the Secretary's plan to request authority for two additional rounds of base closure and realignment. We strongly urge the administration to support legislation that will start this process in 1999 and encourage Congress to approve the request despite constituency challenges. 
Several weeks ago, the Armed Services Committee received a letter, as I indicated, which all six members of the Joint Chiefs signed. We do not get these 24-star letters every day or every week or even every year. I am not sure I can even remember the last 24-star letter that we have received. But now the Chiefs, every one of them, say that the committee should reduce base structure supported by the Secretary of Defense.

Mr. LEVIN. The service chiefs have also made the case for shrinking our base structure. In testimony before the committee, General Reimer said: 
We cut 36 percent out of the force structure and 21 percent of the infrastructure in the Army. I think we need to balance those two out or we are going to pay a heavy price that we should not have to pay. 
The testimony of the service chiefs makes this point very clear. The issue is not base closures or no base closures. The issue is either we shrink the base structure or we are going to have to cut modernization. If we make the wrong choice and do not close any more bases, this problem is not going to go away. If we keep excess bases open and try to protect modernization by cutting the size of our forces instead, that will further increase the amount of excess base structure, which will, in turn, increase the pressure to close bases. 
This problem is not going to go away. This problem will get worse if we delay it. If we cut forces instead of closing bases, that will inevitably lead to increased operating costs and increases days away from home for the smaller number of personnel who will be left. This issue is not going to go away. It will fester and get worse unless we address it. It will not be easier to determine and make this decision a year from now or 2 years from now than it is now. 
The reason there is so much pressure coming from our defense establishment to authorize more base closures is because the Defense Department understands that reductions in the base structure are essential to the modernization of our forces. Every dollar we spend to keep bases open that we do not need--excess bases--is a dollar we cannot spend on modernization programs that our military forces do need. 
As Secretary Cohen said in his preface to the QDR report:  
In essence, our combat forces are headed toward the 21st century, but our infrastructure is stuck in the past. We cannot afford this waste of resources in an environment of tough choices and fiscal constraint. We must shed weight. 
This is not just a choice which the Defense Department faces. This is not just Secretary Cohen's problem. This is our problem, and it is a problem which will get worse unless we make this decision earlier rather than later. 
We cannot just tell the Department of Defense, `Reform yourself.' The Department of Defense can reform if they want to, which they do, but they can't reform if we can't let them. It requires legislative action. As General Fogleman, who is Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said to our committee, `Getting lean and mean is no easy feat. We can be mean if we have to, but we need your help to get lean.' 
Make no mistake, if we don't act this year to approve and to authorize additional base closure rounds, there will not be any additional base closures before the turn of the century. No bases have been or will be closed outside of the Base Closure Commission process contained in this amendment, and every year we delay facing this issue, we delay achieving the potential savings that we need to modernize our forces. 
Now, the argument has been made that we can't prove exactly how much previous base closures have saved. I agree that we don't know exactly how much base closures have saved. We can't audit it; it is not that precise. But I don't know of any disagreement over the fact that closing bases has saved, and will save, substantial amounts of money. The savings don't always come as quickly as the Department of Defense originally forecasts, for a number of reasons. But the savings have been there, and they are documented. 
The CBO concluded in that same report, which was read before, that `BRAC actions will result in significant long-term savings.' Now, the Department of Defense makes an estimate on savings. These estimates are available for Members of the Senate. They are based on 100 or so reports of base closings. Their estimate is that implementing the BRAC actions in the first four rounds will result in $23 billion in one-time implementation costs--that is the cost--and this is offset by savings of $36.5 billion--that's the savings--for a total net savings of $13.5 billion. So that is between 1990 and 2001 when the implementation of the first four rounds is supposed to be concluded. That is a net savings--deducting the investment from the gross savings--of $13.5 billion. That's what Secretary Cohen has written us. That is what he has testified to. That is the best information that is available. 
Secretary Cohen estimates that each of the additional BRAC rounds that he is asking the Congress to approve will save $1.4 billion a year once they are fully implemented. That is comparable to the savings that will be achieved from the 1991 and 1995 rounds. 
Maybe 5 years from now we are going to find that the actual savings from the first four rounds of base closures will be slightly smaller or slightly larger than the $5.6 billion I have referred to. But there is no question that there are large, ongoing savings from shrinking our base structure. Before the first base closure round, we had approximately 500 domestic military bases. When all of the bases from the first four BRAC rounds are closed, we will have about 400 bases. So 80 percent of the bases will remain after all four BRAC rounds are implemented, even though we will have seen a reduction of one-third of our force structure. 
Now, the exact amount that we are saving is impossible to prove--these are approximations and estimates--for lots of reasons, including the fact that these savings represent money we would have spent to pay civilians we no longer have and to operate bases that we no longer have. So they are, by definition, estimates; we can't audit them. But I cannot imagine someone trying to argue that we are not going to save large sums of money by operating 400 bases instead of 500 bases. That is 100 fewer bases at which we have to pay for electricity, heat, water, telephone service, maintenance, and security. 
These BRAC savings, Mr. President, are an important part of the funds that are going to finance the future modernization of the armed services that will keep our military the most technologically advanced and lethal fighting force in the world. 
Some people have expressed concern that funds from base closures may not go toward modernization. But this amendment includes a provision that would require the Department to ensure that all savings that come from future base closings go toward modernization programs. 
Now, over the last few months, another issue has been raised, an issue relative to the question of privatization in place. Some of our colleagues complain about the implementation of the 1995 Base Closure Commission recommendation with respect to the closing of two Air Force depots, at Kelly and Sacramento. There are clearly very strong feelings on this issue, and understandably so. I don't agree with those who say that what happened, however, in 1995, whatever one's view of those events are, somehow justifies refusing to ever close any more bases. 
My own view is that we should let the market decide the most efficient way to redistribute the workload of these two closing depots and that the way to let the market decide that is through a fair and open competition. 
Deputy Secretary of Defense John White testified before our Readiness Subcommittee in May that the Department's policy is no longer to privatize the work of these two closing depots in place, but to compete their workload between the public depots and the private sector. Secretary Cohen wrote a letter to the majority and minority leaders reaffirming the Department's policy of competing this work. He also testified before our committee that, `If you disagree with giving the commission this kind of discretion'--he was referring to privatization in place-- `then you can always restrict it in the future.' 
That is what the amendment does. To address the problem of privatization in place for future BRAC rounds, this amendment includes language that would allow the Secretary of Defense to privatize in place the workload of a closing military installation only when it is explicitly recommended by the Base Closure Commission as either the correct way to close the base or as one option. 
But whatever our view is of privatization in place at the 
two air logistic centers that were closed by the 1995 Base Closure Commission, that is no reason to cut off our nose to spite our face and keep excess base structures open at a huge, unjustifiable cost in the future. 
As I said a moment ago, I know personally how painful the base closing process is. Michigan never had a very large military presence, but we rank seventh among all States in the percentage of total BRAC job losses. So we know in our State, and we know that we have a few additional facilities that some people think could be at risk. 
If we are serious about modernizing our military forces and if we are serious about maintaining the qualitative technological edge that we have, then we have no choice but to reduce our infrastructure costs so that they are in line with our foresight. 
The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs are right. We need to close more bases if we are going to modernize our forces, and we are not going to be able to do that unless this amendment is adopted. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just briefly, a few comments on the BRAC amendment of Senator McCain, myself, Senator Robb and others. 
First, on the cost question. The Defense Department has testified on the savings. Their testimony is part of the record. The Under Secretary for Defense, John Goodman, before the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, testified that their estimate of net cost in savings are as follows: 98 major installations closed through BRAC, costs through 2001, when they would be fully implemented, $23 billion; savings through 2001, in billions, $36.5 billion. That is a $13 billion savings during that period, and then after 2001, recurring savings, every year, because we had the courage to pass four BRAC rounds, of $5.6 billion. 
Now, that is our modernization shortfall. That is why the Joint Chiefs of Staff, every single one of them, plead with us, in a very direct letter, plead with us to support the Secretary of Defense in his request for two more BRAC rounds. 
Now, there is no use coming to this floor and talking about the need to modernize or to make sure we have the most advanced forces in the world, the most ready forces in the world, with the highest moral in the world, when we are not willing to take the steps that are necessary to make those things possible. We know we are not going to get increases in the defense budget. We know we have a 5-year budget that we have to live within. 
So the question, then, is, are we going to keep excess baggage, infrastructure, which the Defense Department says is no longer necessary? It is a tough choice. I could not agree more with my friends from Oklahoma and Mississippi and others who have spoken about the difficulty that communities go through. My communities in Michigan have gone through it and will again if we pass this BRAC round. Three Air Force base communities, all three SAC bases, gone. We know something about that. We know about the pleas that we made to the BRAC commission and the Defense Department. We know about that. We know the urgencies of those pleas. But there is no alternative. 
History has proven over and over again that if you are going to get rid of excess infrastructure--and we know we have excess, and the experts are telling us that--it seems to me we have no reason to disbelieve the Joint Chiefs when they tell us we have this major surplus of capacity. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, says we have more excess capacity now than we did when we started the BRAC process because we have reduced the size of our force. Are we listening? When we get these kind of pleas from the uniformed military not to waste money on bases that they cannot afford to maintain, are we listening to them, or are we going to take an easy way out, which is to say give us a report. 
We have a report: the Defense Department. That is the report. That chart is the report for the Defense Department. Now, can they prove those figures so that they can be audited? No, these are estimates of the Defense Department. That same Congressional Budget Office which points out that the estimates cannot be confirmed with precision, also says this, which is not reported. I didn't hear the opponents of this amendment quote this part of the CBO report, although I may have missed it, in fairness to them. I didn't hear it. CBO believes that BRAC actions will result in significant long-term savings. 
Now, we can delay it. They will be longer term. We heard the argument, `Look how long it has taken for the environmental cleanup,' and that is true. It will take longer if we don't close a base, to clean up that base environmentally, than if we do. We know that, by the way, historically. We have money to clean up bases we are closing where we don't have money to clean up bases that are staying open. If we are worried about the speed with which a base is cleaned up, they are cleaned up more quickly, I say, ironically and sadly, when they are closed than when they are kept open. That is a pretty sad comment, but that is a fact. That is the reality. 
So if we want to speed up the environmental cleanup, you don't keep a base open to that purpose, and you surely don't delay closing bases which need to be closed if the environmental cleanup has taken too long. It will take longer if you delay the closing. Delaying closing of needless infrastructure does not speed up the environmental cleanup of that infrastructure; it delays the environmental cleanup of that infrastructure. 
Now, we are talking here about a significant sum of money in this defense budget. I want to just repeat these estimates: $5.6 billion is the estimate. People say, `Well, we don't have the dollars.' Yes, we do. Here is the report from the Defense Department. There is the chart from the Defense Department. These documents here are the basis of that report. I am not so sure how many of us want to go through each one of these to see if those figures add up to the $5.6 billion, but here they are. The savings are real. Even the CBO, which says they can't confirm the precision, the accuracy of these estimates, says, again, CBO believes that BRAC actions will result in significant 
long-term savings. 
We just got a report from Secretary Cohen addressed to Senator Thurmond, a letter that reads as follows: `As the Senate moves to final consideration of its version of the FY 98 defense authorization bill, I urge you to support the McCain-Levin amendment authorizing BRAC rounds in 1999 and 2001.' 
Now, he is giving the estimate of the two additional rounds in terms of the recurring savings. I am sure this is what the next sentence means, because we had this testimony, in effect. 
We estimate two additional rounds would result in savings of approximately $2.7 billion annually. 
I know from previous testimony he is referring to the recurring savings. That is a significant hunk of change, even in the defense budget. 
And then he says something we ought to listen to. 
These savings are absolutely critical to the department's modernization plan. 
He goes on: 
There have been some questions regarding the savings actually realized from previous base closures. We have taken these questions seriously and asked the Department of Defense Inspector General to take an independent look at this issue. The Inspector General's preliminary results indicate that there is no basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly cost effective. 
I am going to repeat that before I continue because that is sort of the bottom line here. 
The Inspector General's preliminary results indicate that there is no basis for concern that BRAC has not been highly cost effective. 
And then Secretary Cohen goes on to say: 
The preliminary audit examined BRAC 1993 actions, including the largest Navy closure, Mare Island, and eight Air Force Bases closed or realigned. For these bases, the IG found that DOD overestimated costs by $148 million and underestimated savings by $614 million. 
The IG's report is attached to his letter. This report goes through some of the reasons why they actually underestimated here the savings. 
So, instead of, at least on this study by the IG, the bases actually saving us less than predicted, the closing of those bases that were studied by the IG turned out to save us more than was projected by a significant amount, and the reasons for it, again, were set forth in the IG's report. 
There is another argument that we have heard, and that argument is that this action has been politicized. There will be arguments back and forth as to whether or not the privatization in place that occurred at two facilities was consistent or not with the Base Closing Commission. You can argue that either way. Obviously, the State that is affected positively by the President's or the Defense Department's decision feels it was perfectly within the scope of the Base Closing Commission's report. The States which were negatively affected, in their view, by that decision argue it was not contemplated by the Base Closing Commission. 
The Base Closing Commission report, however, says that these facilities `consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or'--and that is the critical word for those who argue one side of this issue, `or'--`or to private-sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council.' 
Well, the Defense Depot Maintenance Council determined those two actions should be taken so that they could be privatized in place. I think that, at least, is reasonably, arguably, provided for by the Base Closing Commission report. It says `or'--`to consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private-sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council,' 
as the alternative to consolidating the remaining workloads to other DOD depots. 
Two options were laid out by the Base Closing Commission. The DOD followed one option. They privatized in place. But whichever side of that argument one takes--and we have heard both arguments--that is no excuse, even if one follows the view that that was politicized, that they should not have been privatized in place. They should have gone to other DOD facilities, and that was a political decision. 
If one accepts that argument and concludes that is right, what reason would that be not to have future rounds of base closings? What we simply would do, as we have done in this bill, is to make sure that there will be no privatization in place in the future without the specific recommendation of the Base Closing Commission, which is created in this amendment. Why would we want to cut off our nose to spite our face, even if one believes that it was politicized? Why would we want to say we don't want to save $2 billion in the future because DOD or the President politicized the last round? We will cure the problem and disallow privatization in place, unless it is explicitly provided for by the Base Closing Commission--more explicit than the language that I even read. 
Now, our amendment does that. We are not going to cure the perceived problem of this privatization in place action by denying future base closings and denying savings of $2.3 billion a year, which Secretary Cohen says is the estimated savings from the next two rounds of base closures. We are not going to cure that problem. We are going to make our problem worse, not better. 
Now, we can address that problem, and some may want to do that with amendments on this floor. If they wish, they are free to try to offer amendments to reverse that decision. My own view is that we ought to make sure that that action is competitive and is certified by the inspector general of the Department of Defense as being a fair and open competition as between the various alternatives that are sought here. 
Let the marketplace decide--that is my view--in a fair and open competition. But there have been some proposals that maybe there ought to be amendments to cure what is perceived to be that political problem. That at least addresses the problem. Denying future rounds of base closings, which will deny us savings of billions of dollars, doesn't cure the perceived inequity or unfairness that resulted, many feel, from the privatization in place decision of the Defense Department. We are not curing the problem. We are just denying ourselves savings. 
So there is not a logical connection between those two actions. Now, I understand. If I were representing one of those three States, I know I would feel the same way they do. At least I think I would. I can understand that. We all represent States and feel passion for the States we represent. We all represent our States as advocates. We believe in them and we believe they ought to get a fair shake. When we don't think they got a fair shake, we are on the Senate floor pleading for our State. So I understand. 
As I said, I understand the pain of base closing. We have been through it, and we might face more. But I also understand what the Joint Chiefs are telling us when they say we have excess, surplus baggage, that the infrastructure exceeds the number of personnel that we now have. `The tail is too big for the tooth,' as they say in the military. We have to slim down. When General Shalikashvili, who is a distinguished soldier, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, says we have more surplus capacity now than we did when the BRAC closing process began, we should listen. 
We are listening. We have offered this amendment to give us a chance to proceed to shed the excess weight that Secretary Cohen has asked us to shed, to save the billions that we need and cannot afford to waste if we are going to fully protect and defend the security of this Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. As I indicated before, Mr. President, since we are talking about estimated savings, the IG that was requested by the Department of Defense to make these estimates found that the costs were overestimated by $148 million and savings underestimated by $614 million, which means in this study by the DOD IG, there were significantly greater savings than had been predicted by the BRAC commission. That, of course, is somewhat different--very different--in terms of the evidence of that presented by the distinguished Democratic leader. We are not sure whether the leader's numbers came from the original Department of Defense estimates before they went to BRAC, and that is something we will check out, because in all but one case, the commission produced savings significantly less than had been requested by the Department of Defense. 
Finally, relative to the argument that the cost of previous base closures have been underestimated, one of the reasons the original Department of Defense estimates were high was that they estimated the savings from the sale of land. We changed the rules in the middle on that one. The revenue never materialized because we changed the rules, very consciously, to provide that most base property would be given away when the base was closed rather than sold. We did that to make economic redevelopment more feasible. That has benefited all of our States just about where these closings have taken place. So that is another possible explanation for the difference in these numbers. 
I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment and very much oppose the Dorgan amendment. I hope we will listen to General Shalikashvili. This is what he said when he testified: 
As difficult as it is politically, we will have to further reduce our infrastructure. We have more excess infrastructure today than we did when the BRAC process started. We need to close more facilities, as painful and as expensive as it is. 
We should listen to the head of our uniformed military. The Secretary of Defense has told us we cannot afford this waste of resources in an environment of tough choices and fiscal constraint. We must shed weight. The savings are on this chart. They have been estimated by the Department of Defense. We have a letter from all of the Joint Chiefs pleading with us, it is called a 24-star letter, all the Joint Chiefs, and the chairman and the vice chairman pleading with us to shed excess weight. 
I hope we will not adopt the Dorgan amendment. If we adopt it, it will destroy the possibility that this year--this year--as we propose in the McCain amendment, we will again do what we must do, as painful as it is. And those of us who come from States which have had bases closed and which face additional base closings, as I do in my State, understand that pain.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I oppose the amendment to reopen the Navy's decision to donate the U.S.S. Missouri to Pearl Harbor. 
These are obviously very difficult decisions for all of us to make because of the friendships with the Senators from the States involved. I do believe, under these circumstances, the GAO found that the Navy's donation process was impartially applied, to use their words. They are critical of some aspects 
of the process and many of these processes are not perfect in their application. But to me, the key words of the GAO report are that the Navy's donation process appears to have been impartially applied, and the GAO's statement on page 10 where they say that on June 5, 1996, each of the five applicants was notified for the first time that `In addition to the financial and technical information that you've provided, your application will also be evaluated in terms of its overall public benefit to the Navy and to the historical significance associated with each location to include the manner in which the ship will be used as a naval museum or memorial.' Notification was made in writing, with telephone confirmation. 
The GAO also reports on page 12 that none of the applicants requested clarification of the June 5 letter or expressed concern about the additional requirements at the time, and all responded to the letter. 
That, to me, is a very critical fact, that when the additional requirements were spelled out in that June 5 notification, that all the applicants responded to the letter with the additional requirements and none requested clarification or expressed concern. 
Was this a perfect process? It was not. The GAO acknowledges that, and indeed, the Navy acknowledges that. Was this process sufficiently fair so that we should not reopen the Navy's decision to donate the Missouri to Pearl Harbor? It seems to me that it does meet that test. 
I will oppose the amendment and vote against reopening the Navy's selection process. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank the majority leader for yielding.

But in my conversation with the majority leader, I was led to believe--and I think this would be very helpful--that if we are making good progress on getting rollcall votes late tomorrow and the next day, that there is a possibility at least that there will be no need to proceed with the cloture vote on Thursday. And I want to thank him for that.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Indiana would respond to this question before I make my own statement in strong support of his amendment, in gratitude for his amendment, and his leadership in this area. Did I understand the Senator said that he asked consent to lay his amendment aside? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-levin-mi-2-19970707</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. We are hopeful this amendment can be accepted, so I am glad this amendment would not be laid aside. Again, I commend the Senator from Indiana for the extraordinary leadership that he and Senator Nunn, when Senator Nunn was in this body, have shown in this area which contributes so much to the security of this Nation. 
One of the most cost-effective and successful defense programs that we have to reduce threats to our country and to enhance our national security is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program that Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn started in 1991. This program at the Department of Defense, and its companion programs at the Department of Energy, have produced important results in reducing the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their materials. I was disappointed that the bill before the Senate, as it came before the Senate, does not authorize the funding level requested by the administration for these important programs, so I fully support the Lugar amendment. 
In addition to commending Senator Lugar, I particularly want to commend Senator Bingaman for his effort to restore these funds during the Armed Services Committee markup process. Since 1991, these threat reduction programs helped three Newly Independent States, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, to completely rid themselves of some 6,000 nuclear weapons that they inherited from the former Soviet Union. The CTR programs have also permitted Russia to implement the START I treaty ahead of schedule, helping eliminate over 800 Russian nuclear missiles and bombers. These are weapons that will never again threaten the United States. 
The Department of Energy has worked to secure tons of nuclear weapons materials, primarily plutonium and highly enriched uranium, that were and to a significant extent still are under inadequate safeguards and vulnerable to theft or diversion. Keeping these dangerous materials out of the hands of would-be proliferators reduces the likelihood that nuclear weapons will threaten us. There is just no more important thing that we can do for our Nation's security than to secure these nuclear materials and to eliminate these missiles. 
The job, though, is only partly finished, and much more needs to be done. That is why it was so disappointing that the committee bill reduced the budget request for these programs by $135 million, including a reduction of $60 million for the Department of Defense cooperative threat reduction programs; a reduction of $25 million for the Department of Energy Materials Protection, Control and Accounting Program; and a reduction of $50 million, which was the total amount requested for the DOE International Nuclear Safety Program. 
Given the great concern that the committee has appropriately expressed for the danger of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and materials and the committee's interest in taking steps to reduce this danger, those reductions were surprising indeed. In my view we should be considering what additional efforts we can take to reduce these threats. While the threat from such proliferation is more likely and immediate than the threat from a ballistic missile attack on the United States, Congress has pushed to increase funding for national missile defense while reducing funding for cooperative threat reduction. We are underfunding the latter program at our clear peril. 
There are numerous cooperative threat reduction programs that need to be funded on an urgent basis. For example, Ukraine decided in mid-May to eliminate all of its SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles, a decision which the United States encouraged and welcomed. We should help Ukraine eliminate these missiles so that they can never again be used. 
Furthermore, there remain large quantities of nuclear materials that need to be secured and accounted for. The list of unfunded cooperative threat reduction and related DOE projects is long and it represents an urgent opportunity for the United States to take tangible and permanent steps to reduce 
threats to our security. For a tiny fraction of the defense budget we can accomplish extraordinary gains. The proliferation in nuclear safety problems remains considerably larger and more serious than the response has been so far. 
One of the allegations which was made which supported these cuts in committee was that there was $700 million in unobligated cooperative threat reduction funds floating around, and thus it was argued that the cooperative threat reduction programs could absorb a $60 million cut. But that is not the case. The cooperative threat reduction has $513 million in unobligated funds but of this, $200 million will be obligated by the end of the year and all of the remaining $313 million has been committed to specific countries by signed agreements. 
On another part of this program, which was the reduction in the DOE Materials Protection, Control and Accounting Program, by the end of June 1997, all of the fiscal year 1997 funds were obligated and sent to the laboratories for implementation. The assumption that the 1998 fiscal year request can be reduced and offset with uncosted balances from fiscal year 1997 or fiscal year 1996 without programmatic impact is incorrect. The net result of a reduction of fiscal year 1998 funds would be a reduction in the planned programmatic activities. There is a critical need for this program. The materials protection, control and accounting programs have a clear and direct relationship to the national security policy of reducing the amount of fissile material available for threat or diversion. 
So, I hope we can be fully up to the challenge of taking advantage of this opportunity to eliminate some of the most serious threats to our security. In order to take advantage of this opportunity, we must at least fully fund these threat-reduction and safety programs at the requested level. I hope in the future the administration and the Congress will agree to provide higher levels of funding for these programs, which, again, are as important to our national security as any programs that I know. So, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of the Lugar amendment and I hope all of our colleagues will support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I join the chairman's call for those who have amendments to bring them to the floor, if possible, today or tomorrow. One of the problems is, however, that we are facing a cloture motion vote, and, if that is approved--and it must be the first vote--a number of amendments that people have indicated they want to offer would not be germane. 
I want to spend just a moment or two on the situation that we are now in relative to this pending cloture motion. 
The bill before the Senate is the product of 4 days of debate and thoughtful consideration during markup by the Senate Armed Services Committee. At the end of the markup, the committee voted unanimously to report this bill to the floor. It was an 18-to-0 vote. 
This bill is consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement, and I fully expect that at the proper time the Senate will give the bill a strong bipartisan vote. We have not reached that time yet. 
In recent years the Senate has debated more than 100 amendments to the defense authorization bill and has taken 10 to 20 rollcall votes a year. This has typically taken up to 50 to 60 hours over a period of a week or so. Last year, for example, we disposed of 159 amendments with 19 rollcall votes, and over 63 hours of debate. 
I don't see any reason to expect that Members will be offering any fewer amendments, although we always can hope that might be the case, or that it will take significantly less time to dispose of them this year than it has in the past. Like previous defense authorization bills, the bill before us is almost 500 pages long, and includes more than 300 separate provisions. 
But on Friday before the recess when the majority leader filed a cloture motion the Senate had been considering this bill--and it is a complex bill--for less than 8 hours, mostly on a Friday morning after most Members had left town and after the majority leader said there would be no votes. Not a single nongermane amendment has been adopted until this recent series of amendments, and no major defense-related amendment has yet been offered. 
The major issues before us--the base closure issue, the depot issue, possibly missile defense, Bosnia, NATO enlargement--have yet to be raised. To say the least, I was surprised to see a cloture motion filed at this early stage of the Senate's deliberations. That approach might make some sense if there were sign of obstruction or delay in the consideration of the bill. But that has not been the case. The floor managers on both sides, as the chairman has said, are prepared to consider and debate any amendment that may be forthcoming. We are prepared to address issues and to move on with the Senate's business. But we have not had an opportunity to do that. And we are not going to have an opportunity to vote on any amendment prior to the vote on cloture tomorrow since, as I understand the schedule established by the majority leader, no votes can be scheduled for today and the first vote tomorrow will be the cloture vote. 
Members well know that the rules constrain consideration of amendments in a postcloture situation. And they are extremely confining rules. To be in order an amendment must also be relevant but germane under a very strict definition of germaneness. Under postcloture rules any amendment, no matter how relevant to the defense of the Nation, is nongermane if it expands powers available under the bill, if it introduces a new subject matter, or if it funds a program not already funded in the bill. Any portion of an amendment that is not germane makes the whole amendment out of order, and an amendment may not be modified without the unanimous consent of the Senate. 
If we were to vote cloture the major amendments that we all expect to consider in the course of the debate would be nongermane and could not be voted on by the Senate. For example, we have pending before us this afternoon an amendment relative to the funding of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. Unless we act on that amendment this afternoon--that is an amendment which is addressing one of the greatest threats that is faced by this country--that amendment would not be in order, and we could not even vote on it. 
Senators who question the administration's proposal for distributing the workload of the two air logistics centers closed in the last BRAC round would be denied the opportunity to raise the issue on this bill if cloture passes. That is whether 
or not they come and debate it this afternoon, and that is whether or not they come and debate it tomorrow morning. The reason is because it is not germane technically to the bill in a postcloture situation. 
I don't happen to support adding those provisions to this bill. I don't think we ought to add provisions to this bill that reallocate workloads. I think we ought to leave that to a fair process. But that is not the point. 
Senators were asked to deliver amendments relating to this subject of distributing the workload at the two air logistics centers which were closed in the last BRAC round, and they would have no opportunity to bring their amendments back on that subject if cloture were voted on tomorrow. 
Again, under the unanimous-consent rule that we are operating under, cloture is the first rollcall vote that this Senate is going to be able to have. 
There is another major issue that should be debated and that we know will be debated. That has to do with future base closure rounds. We had a very lively discussion and debate on that in the Armed Services Committee. 
There are many of us who talked in support of the amendment of Senator McCain relative to two new rounds of base closures. If we deny those two new rounds we will be denying one of the highest priorities of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But at least we ought to have a vote on the subject, and if we vote on cloture tomorrow--which must be the first vote regardless of when the BRAC amendment is offered, whether it is offered this afternoon or offered tomorrow, since under the unanimous-consent agreement that we are operating under the first vote must be on cloture--and if that vote passes tomorrow, then we would not be able to vote on whether or not to add two new rounds or perhaps one new round of base closure. That is just not right. 
Amendments regarding foreign policy issues that are not currently addressed in the bill various Senators may want to offer. Amendments may be offered on Bosnia or on NATO expansion. Those amendments would be out of order if cloture is voted tomorrow. The House version of this bill has a major Bosnia-related provision. It would cut off funds for United States ground troops in Bosnia after June 30 of next year. That is a highly significant issue. While we don't have to debate it in this bill, I think that some Senators may feel otherwise. I don't think they ought to be barred from raising the issue should they choose, even though I may not agree with their amendment. 
Many other amendments that Members are planning to offer this year would be out of order. Amendments involving the funding formula for the National Guard Challenge Program, amendments relative to the North Dakota flood close claims of Air Force personnel, amendments relative to the reauthorization of the Sikes Act, to facilitate the preparation of integrated natural resources management plans for military lands, amendments to provide recruiter access to juvenile court records, and so forth. 
This is not the way that we should be doing business. We should not be voting on cloture before we have had an opportunity to vote on important amendments, and we will not have that opportunity under the unanimous-consent agreement that we are operating under. We should not be denying Members the opportunity to offer key amendments which will require rollcall votes before the amendment process is even begun in earnest. 
I hope that we can continue to clear as many amendments as possible this afternoon and tomorrow morning. 
I happen to agree with the chairman. People who have amendments should come down here and debate them. But the problem this cloture motion creates for us is that we can't have rollcall votes until after the vote on cloture tomorrow. And we know that a number of amendments are going to require rollcall votes--legitimate amendments involving base closures and involving the depot issue which so many of our Members feel so strongly about. 
That is why I hope we will not invoke cloture tomorrow. I think that invoking cloture would be unfair to Members who want to bring up amendments which require rollcall votes and to have us dispose of those amendments. 
So, Madam President, again, whether or not cloture may be needed at a later stage in the debate of the bill, it would surely be premature to invoke cloture tomorrow before the disposition of many important amendments, controversial amendments and tested amendments, which arguably require rollcall votes. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. The reason I raise this, Madam President, is this is an example of where we are prematurely faced with a cloture vote. I say premature, because we have not had an opportunity to vote on key amendments and will not have an opportunity to vote on key amendments, including the Cochran amendment, before cloture. Because under the unanimous-consent agreement that we are operating under, cloture is going to be voted on first. That is the first vote tomorrow. 
It strikes me as being unfair to amendments and to those sponsors of amendments who have put in a serious effort on major security issues. 
I do not know how I am going to vote on the Cochran amendment. I am studying the amendment. It raises a very significant issue relative to American security. But it is not technically germane because of our postcloture rules. It surely is relevant to this bill in any, I think, general sense. We are talking about the security of this Nation and we are trying to weigh the issue here, the pros and cons of the Cochran amendment. Surely, it is a serious national security issue which the Senator from Mississippi has raised, the chairman of a subcommittee which has had hearings into a very important issue. 
So I urged before that we not invoke cloture tomorrow for a number of reasons and stated that there were a number of very significant pending amendments that would be or might be ruled nongermane after cloture, and I failed to list this amendment as an example of that type of amendment that could very well fall although I think by any reasonable definition of national security this surely is relevant to that issue. 
So I commend my good friend from Mississippi for raising this issue. 
Again, it is an issue that I am going to be giving some real study to this evening. It is a very thoughtful amendment. It is a carefully drawn amendment. It is based on a current classification. And I want to commend him on it and hope that he will be able to at least have a vote on his amendment. That very well will be impossible if cloture were invoked tomorrow. 
Madam President, I want to ask another parliamentary inquiry because there is a second-degree amendment which is also pending, a second-degree amendment to the Cochran amendment. I ask the Chair the following question. 
Would the question put relative to the Grams amendment receive the same response from the Chair as my question relative to the Cochran amendment?

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of a remarkable young man from the city of Midland, MI. Garrett Russell, an 8-year-old second grade student at Siebert Elementary School, collected more than 100 bicycles and $25,000 worth of toys to give to victims of the flooding in Grand Forks, ND. 
When Garrett saw footage of the flooding he was immediately moved into action. He asked his classmates to help him provide toys to the thousands of the children in Grand Forks who were forced to leave their belongings behind as they fled from their homes. Word of Garrett's `Kids Helping Kids' campaign spread quickly and caught the imagination of the generous people of the Tri-City area. Donations arrived daily, reaching a total of more than 3,000 toys and 100 bicycles. 
Garrett, his sister Elise, and his parents, Dean and Kathy Russell, loaded the toys into a truck and drove to Grand Forks to distribute them to the children there. Lutheran Social Services of Grand Forks held a festival on Saturday, June 14, 1997, at which Garrett gave away most of the toys to the 1,200 children who attended. The following day, Garrett and his family gave the rest of the toys away as they visited the homes of families who had lost almost everything they owned. 
Garrett has received praise from many people since he began his campaign to brighten the spirits of the children of Grand Forks, especially from his classmates and from the people who benefited from his endeavors. The Midland Daily News quoted his friend, 7-year-old Anna Brown, who said, `I think it was generous of him because most kids don't start a campaign just because they see something on the news.' Grand Forks resident Judy Holweger, whose son, Joel, received a bicycle at the festival, said, `It really lifts these kids' spirits. They've lost a lot.' Garrett's schoolmate, Claire Liang, may have put it best when she said, `Not everyone has a big heart like Garrett.' 
We can all take inspiration from Garrett Russell's example of generosity and selflessness. I know my colleagues join me in commending Garrett for his outstanding accomplishments, and in wishing the people of Grand Forks, as well as all those affected by the flooding this spring, a speedy and complete recovery.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with disappointment that I oppose the reconciliation bill before the Senate today. I supported the budget agreement entered into by the congressional leadership and the President and I supported the budget resolution passed by the Congress last month. Both of them provided the broad parameters for a tax reduction package. I was hopeful at that time that the package of tax reductions worked out by the Finance Committee would be targeted to assist working families, particularly those with children. The package before us, however, is too regressive. It does too little to assist working families with education expenses, and it provides too large a tax break to those who need it least, at the expense of those who need it most. For that reason, I supported the Democratic alternative offered by Senator Daschle which would have provided a much larger proportion of its benefits, more than half of the tax cut, to middle-income families, the lowest 60 percent of wage earners. Unfortunately, that substitute for the committee's bill was defeated. 
The legislation before us is out of balance. More than 42 percent of the benefits of its tax cut provisions go to the top 10 percent of income earners. By contrast the lowest 60 percent, middle-income families and below, receive less than 14 percent of the benefits. In my view this is not equitable. 
The broad based capital gains tax cuts and the reductions in the estate tax largely benefit those among us that need it least. In contrast, I support the education tax cuts which the President has proposed, a $500 per child tax credit adequate to provide tax relief to middle-income families with children, and capital gains relief for homeowners. Also, I believe that, if consistent with deficit reduction goals arriving at a balanced budget, that targeted capital gains relief for long-term investments and an incremental approach to estate tax relief should be used. 
Mr. President, I am also deeply concerned that this bill may result in large deficits in the years beyond this decade. In 1981, I opposed the Reagan tax cut because I was convinced that it would lead to huge deficits. We have paid dearly for the debt which resulted from that legislation. Only now, 16 years later, do we finally have a realistic opportunity to balance the budget once again. In 1992, the deficit in the Federal budget was $290 billion which represented 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The most recent estimate of the deficit for fiscal year 1997 is $67 billion, approximately eight-tenths of 1 percent of the gross domestic product. 
Over the 5 years from 1993 to 1998, the deficit has been reduced by about $1 trillion from the deficit for those 5 years projected at the time. This remarkable progress has come about in large part as a result of the deficit reduction package which President Clinton presented in 1993, and which this Senate passed, without a single Republican vote, by a margin of one vote, the Vice President's. We should not now, by passing a tax bill like the one before us, head back down the road toward a new large future deficits. That is why, I supported the Dorgan amendment to sunset elements of the tax cut, if deficit reduction targets were not being met, and that is another important reason I cannot support this bill. 
I know that the Senate is about to pass this bill. I hope that the conferees, the House and Senate leadership, and the President will engage in future negotiations which will result in a final product which is more equitable, which does more to invest in our children through their education, and which does not risk large deficits in the years after the turn of the century.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today Senator Thompson and I are joined by Senators Glenn, Abraham, Robb, Rockefeller, Roth, and Stevens in introducing the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997. The bill would put into law--first, basic requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules; second, a process for the review of existing rules where there is a possibility of achieving significantly greater net benefits; and third, executive oversight of the rulemaking process. It builds on the bipartisan Roth-Glenn bill that was unanimously reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee in 1995. 
This bill would require agencies, when issuing rules that have a major impact on the economy or a sector of the economy, to do a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the benefits of the rule justify its costs and to determine whether the regulatory option chosen by the agency is more cost effective or provides greater net benefits than other regulatory options considered by the agency. If the rule involves a risk to health, safety or the environment, the bill requires the agency to do a risk assessment as part of the analysis of the benefits of the rule. 
The bill also requires agencies that issue major rules to establish advisory committees to identify existing rules that the agency should consider for review because they have the potential, if modified, to achieve significantly greater net benefits. It would also codify the review procedure now conducted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [OIRA] and require public disclosure of OIRA's review process. 
The bill is significantly different from S. 343, the Dole-Johnston bill which I strongly opposed and which was rejected by the Senate in the 104th Congress. 
It does not create a supermandate that would amend existing laws nor does it contain mandatory decisional criteria that would establish new standards for an agency to meet. It does require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses for major rules and explain whether the benefits of the rules justify the costs and whether the rule is cost-effective than the other alternatives considered by the agency. It does not mandate the outcome of the process, only the process itself. 
It does not provide for judicial review of the process for, or the contents of, the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment. The cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are made part of the rulemaking record for judicial review of whether the final rule is reasonable. 
It does not provide for a petition process for challenging existing rules. It provides for advisory committees to identify rules for possible review, 
gives the agency head the discretion to select rules for review especially taking into account the resources of the agency, and requires the agency to review the rules scheduled for review in 5 years. 
Mr. President, many people think that when many of us fought hard against the Dole-Johnston bill that we didn't really want to reform the regulatory process. Well they are wrong. Many of us were disappointed that we were unable to pass a comprehensive regulatory reform bill in the last Congress. We weren't going to support bad reform, but that doesn't mean we didn't want to see good reform. Those of us who believe in the benefits of regulation to protect health and safety have a particular responsibility to make sure that regulations are sensible and cost-effective. When they aren't, the regulatory process--which is so vital to our health and well being --comes under constant attack . By providing a common sense, moderate and open regulatory process, we are contributing to the well being of that process and immunizing it from the attacks on excesses. 
Mr. President, I've fought for regulatory reform since 1979, the year I came to the Senate. I even had as part of my platform back in 1978, the legislative veto--which would give Congress the chance to block excessively costly and burdensome regulations before they take effect. That was my battle cry for years. I worked with former Senator Boren, for instance, trying to get an across-the-board legislative veto bill enacted into law. Last Congress we were finally able to get a version of that adopted. 
I was also the author of the Regulatory Negotiation Act which was passed in 1990 and reauthorized in 1995 to encourage agencies to use the collegial process of negotiation in developing certain rules in order to avoid the delays and costs inherent in the otherwise adversarial process. 
As for an overall regulatory reform bill, I've supported such legislation since 1980, when the Senate first passed S. 1080, the Laxalt-Leahy bill only to have it die later that year in the House. 
At the same time, I took a strong stand against several damaging regulatory reform proposals from the House including an overall moratorium of regulations and against the Dole-Johnston bill in the Senate. I will not support any regulatory reform proposal that I believe would roll back important environmental, public health and safety protections. Nor will I support any regulatory reform proposal that I believe will lead to gridlock in the agencies or the courts. We certainly don't need that. 
We do need--better cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, more flexibility for the regulated industries to reach legislative goals in a variety of ways, more cooperative efforts between government and industry and less `us versus them' attitudes. 
Based on these common principles, Senator Thompson and I have been working for months on this legislative proposal that I hope will yield a more rational and fair regulatory process and better, more flexible, more cost-effective and more enforceable regulations. 
Let me highlight some important features of this legislation. 
First, we say right from the beginning, in the section on findings, that cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful tools to help agencies issue reasonable regulations. But they are only tools; they are not the sole basis upon which regulations should be developed or issued. They do not, we explicitly state, they do not replace the need for good judgment and the agencies' consideration of social values in deciding when and how to regulate. 
We define benefits very broadly--expressly taking into account nonquantifiable benefits. There is nothing in this bill that suggests that the assessment of benefits by an agency should be only quantifiable. On the contrary, this bill explicitly recognizes that many important benefits may be nonquantifiable, and that agencies have the right and authority to fully consider such benefits when doing the cost-benefit analysis and when determining whether the benefits justify the costs. We emphatically do not intend for the benefits part of the equation in the cost-benefit analysis to be limited to merely those benefits that are quantifiable. 
We direct the agencies to consider regulatory options that provide flexibility, where possible, to the regulated parties. I have been a longtime proponent of performance standards in regulations and not the so-called command and control approach. This bill urges the agencies to include in its identification of possible regulatory approaches that permit flexibility in achieving the required goal, either through performance standards or market type mechanisms. 
The definition of major rule, to which the provisions of this bill apply, is limited to those with a $100 million impact on the economy and those otherwise designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [OIRA]. 
The bill requires an agency issuing a major rule to evaluate the benefits and costs of a `reasonable number of reasonable alternatives reflecting the range of regulatory options that would achieve the objective of the statute as addressed by the rulemaking.' I am quoting these words, because they are significant. The bill doesn't require an agency to look at all the possible alternatives, just a reasonable number; but it does require the agency to pick a selection of options that are 
available to it within the range of the rulemaking objective. 
This cost-benefit analysis, of which any risk assessment would be a part, is intended to be transparent to the public; that is, those of us outside the agency--Congress, the regulated community, the beneficiaries of the regulation, the general public--should be able to see and understand the thinking the agency used to select the regulatory option it did, as well as the underlying scientific and/or economic data. Agencies should not hide the important information that forms the basis of their regulatory actions. 
Another important provision of this bill is the one that requires the agency to make a reasonable determination whether the benefits of the rule justify the costs and whether the regulatory option selected by the agency is substantially likely to achieve the objective of the rulemaking in a more cost effective manner or with greater net benefits than the other regulatory options considered by the agency. This is not in any way a decisional criteria that the agency must meet. This only requires the agency to make its assessment. And, if, as the agency is free to do, it chooses a regulatory option where the benefits do not justify the costs or that is not more cost effective or does not provide greater net benefits than the other options, the agency is required to explain why it did what it did and list the factors that caused it to so. Those factors could be a statute, a policy judgment, uncertainties in the data and the like. There is no added judicial scrutiny of a rule provided for or intended by this section. The final rule must still stand or fall based on whether the court finds that the rule is arbitrary or capricious in light of the whole rulemaking record. That is the current standard of judicial review. 
The bill says that if an agency cannot make the determinations required by the bill, it has to say why it can't. Use of the word cannot does not mean that an agency rule can be overturned by a court for its failure to pick an option that would permit the agency to make the determinations required by the bill. The agency is free to use its discretion to regulate under the substantive statute, and there is no implication that such rule must meet the standards described in the determinations subsection. It does mean, though, that the agency is required to make such determinations and let the public know why it picked the regulatory option that it did, and if it can't say, or determine, that the regulatory option it chose is the most cost effective or provides greatest net benefits, it must say why it chose it. This legislation requires only that the agency be up front with the public as to just how cost beneficial and cost effective its regulatory proposal is. 
The risk assessment requirement in this bill, unlike previous bills, is not unduly proscriptive. It establishes basic elements for performing risk assessments, many of which, again, will provide transparency for an agency's development of a rule, and it requires guidelines for such assessments to be issued by OIRA in consultation with the Office of Science and Technology Policy. 
Peer review, Mr. President, is required by this bill for both cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments, but only once per rule. Peer review is not required at both the proposed and final rule stages. There is great concern in the public interest community, that there will not be sufficient personnel available with appropriate expertise and independence to serve on each of these peer review bodies. I am hoping to pursue that issue at greater length during our committee hearings. 
There is a similar concern by the public interest sector as to the availability of a balanced cross-section of individuals to serve on the advisory committees required for the review of rules. Service on such bodies obviously takes time and expertise and both of those cost money. I hope we can also address the concerns about the possibility of inadequate levels of participation by groups and interests which have fiscal constraints that could preclude their full participation. 
Mr. President, the review of rules provision in this bill is also a reasonable approach. Unlike past proposals, it does not provide for an automatic sunset of a rule that is not reviewed pursuant to the schedule. Rather it provides for the agency to determine during the review period of rules it chooses to review whether 
it is going to continue, modify, or repeal the rule under review. If it fails to make that determination and take the appropriate action, the agency can be sued under the existing provision of the Administrative Procedure Act to force agency action unlawfully withheld. 
Rules would be scheduled for review under the provisions of this bill, only at the discretion of the agency head. However, the public would know the list of rules recommended for review by the advisory committee. The advisory committee would recommend those rules for review that, if modified, could result in substantially greater net benefits to society. That is the standard the committees are supposed to apply. The agency must review the recommendations of the advisory committee and develop a schedule for review of rules taking into account the resources available to the agency to conduct such reviews. 
Judicial review has been of great concern to those of us who want real regulatory reform without bottling up important regulations in the courts. There is no judicial review permitted of the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment required by this bill outside of judicial review of the final rule. The analysis and assessment are included in the rulemaking record, but there is no judicial review of the content of those items or the procedural steps followed or not followed by the agency in the development of the analysis or assessment. Only the total failure to actually do the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment would allow the court to remand the rule to the agency. 
Finally, Mr. President, the bill puts into law the requirement that the President establish a process for reviewing rules and coordinating Federal agency regulatory actions. Despite over 15 years of Executive orders that impose such a requirement, Congress has yet to put such a responsibility of the President into law. This bill would do that. And with that responsibility goes the obligation of the President, acting through OIRA, to make public the process and results of its review of agency rules. This is an important element of accountability, and such disclosure should not depend upon the whim of the President but rather on the requirements imposed by permanent law. 
So those are some highlights. Senator Thompson has committed to hearings on the bill. Everybody will be given an opportunity to comment and identify potential problems and possible improvements. 
I believe this bill will improve the regulatory process, will build confidence in the regulatory programs that are so important to this society's well-being, and will result in a better--and I believe--a less contentious regulatory process.

<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, we passed by voice vote amendment No. 556. It was an amendment which Senator McCain and I authored, and I want to spend a moment describing what that amendment does. 
The amendment provides that it is the sense of the Senate, based on findings that, `(1) currently businesses can deduct the value of stock options as business expense on their income tax returns, even though the stock options are not treated as an expense on the books of those same businesses; and (2) stock options are the only form of compensation that is treated that way. It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on Finance of the Senate should hold hearings on the tax treatment of stock options.' 
Mr. President, for the past several years, the Wall Street Journal has published a special pull-out section of the newspaper with an annual analysis of the compensation of top corporate executives. Last year's section had this headline: `The Great Divide: CEO Pay Keeps Soaring--Leaving Everybody Else Further and Further Behind.' 
Business Week featured this cover story on its 47th annual pay survey: `Executive Pay: It's Out of Control.' 
Both publications analyze the pay of top executives at approximately 350 major American corporations, and their analysis shows that the pay of chief executive officers continues to outpace inflation, others workers' pay and the pay of CEO's in other countries, as well as company profits. According to Business Week, CEO's total average compensation rose 54 percent last year to over $5.5 million, which came on top of 1995 CEO pay increases averaging 30 percent. 
Meanwhile, the average 1996 raise for the average worker, both blue collar and white collar, was about 3 percent. In 1996 the average pay of the top executive was 209 times the pay of a factory worker. Little known corporate tax loopholes are fueling these increases in executive pay with taxpayer dollars. This loophole allows companies to deduct from their taxes multimillion-dollar pay expenses that never show up on the company books as an expense. Every other form of compensation is shown as an expense on company books. There is only one exception, and that is stock options. 
There is a link of all this to taxpayer dollars. Suppose a corporate executive exercises stock options to purchase company stocks and makes a profit of $10 million. Right now, the company employing the executive can claim the full $10 million as a compensation expense and deduct it on the company's income tax return. 
Someone might say, so what? All companies deduct pay expenses from their taxes. That's true. But there is an important difference here. Every other type of employee pay shows up on the company books as an expense and reduces company earnings. Stock option pay is the only kind of compensation that companies can claim as an expense for tax purposes without ever showing it as an expense on their books. That's because current accounting rules encourage, but do not require, companies to treat stock option pay as a company expense, so companies can continue to game the system. 
A single corporate executive exercising stock options can provide a company with a $10 million, $50 million, or even a $100 million expense which the company can deduct when reporting company earnings to Uncle Sam, but omit it when reporting company earnings to stockholders and the public. That is not right. Either stock option pay is a company expense or it isn't. Either this expense lowers a company's earnings or it doesn't. Something is clearly out of whack in a tax law when a company can say one thing at tax time and something else to investors and the public, and it is a double standard which should end. 
Senator McCain and I introduced legislation in April to put an end to the double standard. It simply says that a company can claim stock option pay as an expense for tax purposes to the same extent that the company treats that stock option pay as an expense on its books. Companies would no longer be able to claim that stock options cost them large amounts of money when claiming a tax benefit, but then turn around and claim that it cost them nothing when reporting them to stockholders and the public. 
Opponents of the legislation claim that it would tax stock options. That is simply not true. Companies will continue to get a tax deduction, not a tax increase, on the options they claim as an expense on their books. For the options that they don't count on their books, they couldn't continue to receive a tax benefit in the form of a deduction. The choice is theirs. 
Others argue that this amendment will hurt the average employees who receive stock options from the company's stock option plan. Right now, stock option pay is overwhelmingly executive pay. In 1994, in the most extensive stock option review to date which covered 6,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, Institutional Shareholders Services found that only 1 percent of the companies issued stock options to anyone other than management and 97 percent of the stock options issued went to 15 or fewer individuals per company. 
Nevertheless, there are a few companies that issue stock options to all employees and do not disproportionately favor top executives. Our bill would allow those companies that provide broad-based stock option plans to continue to claim existing stock option tax benefits, even if they exclude stock option pay expenses from their books. By making this limited exception, we would ensure that average worker pay would not be affected by closing the stock option loophole. We might even encourage a few more companies to share stock option benefits with average workers. 
Still others argue that there is no way to estimate what the cost of stock options plans are and that we're basing a tax deduction on estimates. But there are a number of places in the tax code that use estimates to determine the amount of a deduction. 
The bottom line is that the bill that Senate McCain and I introduced is not intended to stop the use of stock options. It is not aimed at capping stock options or limiting them in any way. It would not limit the level of executive pay. That is an issue between the executives and shareholders of the company. Our bill is aimed only at those companies that are trying to have it both ways--claiming stock option pay as an expense at tax time, but not when reporting company earnings to shareholders and the public. It is aimed at ending a stealth tax benefit that is fueling the wage gap, favoring one group of companies over another, and feeding public cynicism about the fairness of the federal tax code. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, closing this tax loophole generates $181 million over 5 years and $1.57 billion over 10 years all of which will be dedicated to reducing the deficit.

The current law allows a 12-month limit. The old requirement was 24 months. The Governors argue and the community colleges argue--and I think it is very persuasive--that being in vocational education should count toward that work requirement. There is no cost to the Treasury. 
It will help people to complete a community college education and to count that toward the work requirement under the welfare bill.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Levin-Jeffords amendment increases from 12 to 24 months the limit on the amount of vocational education training that a State can count toward meeting its work requirement under the new Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. Under the old welfare law, recipients could attend postsecondary vocational education training for up to 24 months. I strongly support the new law's emphasis on moving welfare recipients more quickly into jobs, but I am troubled by the law's restriction on vocational education training, limiting it to 12 months. Two-year community college study, for instance, would not meet the requirement. 
Mr. President, the limitation on postsecondary education training raises a number of concerns, not the least of which is whether persons may be forced into low-paying, short-term employment that will lead them back onto public assistance because they are unable to support their families. 
Study after study indicates that short-term training programs raise the income of workers only marginally, while completion of at least a 2-year associate degree has greater potential of breaking the cycle of poverty for welfare recipients. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median earnings of adults with an associate degree are 30 percent higher than adults with only a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. 
Mr. President, let me just give some examples. The following are jobs that a person could prepare for in a two-year community college program and the salary range generally applicable to the positions: 
NATIONWIDE 
Accounting, $14,000-$28,000. 
Computer technician, $14,000-$31,000. 
Law enforcement, $13,500-$25,000. 
Dental hygiene, $18,000-$60,000. 
Respiratory therapy tech, $21,000-$32,000. 
MICHIGAN 
Computer programing, $24,800-$42,900. 
Radiology technician, $22.235-$32.425. 
Legal assistant, $28,630-$30,000. 
Child care development (supervisor), $23,590-$29,724. 
Registered nurse, $24,400-$38,135. 
Mr. President, the National Governors Association recognizes the merits of this amendment and has called for its passage. I urge my colleagues to support it because it will help us reach the new law's intended goal of getting families permanently off of welfare and onto self-sufficiency.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association [AHEPA], which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. The AHEPA, whose mission is in part, `To promote good fellowship, and endow its members with a spirit of altruism, common understanding, mutual benevolence, and helpfulness to their fellow man,' is an important organization with a strong chapter, district 10, located in my home State of Michigan. 
In 1922, the AHEPA was formed in response to antiimmigrant sentiments directed toward United States immigrants of Greek descent. The AHEPA's primary goal was to help newly arrived Greeks become United States citizens and to share in the civic life of our country. To do so, the AHEPA formed schools which taught English and the principles of American government to new immigrants. In the process, the AHEPA also hoped to educate all Americans about the significant heritage and contributions immigrants of Greek descent add to the American community. 
Today, the AHEPA is an international organization with chapters in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, and Greece, as well as the United States. There are more than 1,000 chapters in North America alone, comprised of more than 60,000 members. The AHEPA promotes goodwill and positive relations between these countries by providing significant financial resources to a number of civic-improvement programs. These include charities, scholarships and other educational programs, cultural activities, athletic programs, local Greek communities and the church, and patriotic activities. Membership is not limited to people of Greek descent, although most members do share that ancestry. 
The AHEPA has counted many notable political leaders as members, including former Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and former Vice Presidents Hubert Humphrey and Spiro Agnew. Several Members of this body are or were members of AHEPA, including my good friend from Maryland, Paul Sarbanes, and a man we all deeply miss, the late Paul Tsongas from Massachusetts. 
Mr. President, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association is truly a remarkable organization. Born out of the need to help new Greek immigrants assimilate into American culture, today the AHEPA encourages all of us to aspire to great things, to help those in need and to strengthen channels of communication between cultures. I know my colleagues will join me in saluting the men and women of the AHEPA and its auxiliaries for 75 years of commitment and dedication.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in bringing S. 936, the national defense authorization bill, to the floor, and I want to congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for the extraordinary effort he has put in on this bill. He has really guided this bill through thick and thin, so that we are in a position where we can bring this bill to the floor. It is his commitment and his energy that he devotes to national defense that has made this possible. I congratulate him on that. 
I want to reiterate the comments of the chairman of the committee that we are here debating S. 936, which is the bill that was reported yesterday. Now, this bill is almost identical to S. 924, which was the version of the defense authorization bill that was reported earlier this week. The exception is that the bill before us does not contain certain provisions relative to depot maintenance that were in the earlier bill. That has been the subject of a number of colloquies here this afternoon. 
This bill meets the guidelines of the budget agreement and the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution. The members of the committee didn't agree on every provision; we never do, of course. There are several critical areas where I believe this bill needs to be improved. I will be working to make these improvements during the debate and during the conference. But despite the few disagreements that existed, there was--again, as this committee traditionally does--a very strong sense of bipartisanship and a spirit of cooperation that permeated the discussions and the markups. I want to join my friend, the chairman of the committee, in thanking all of the members of the committee and the staff for the hard work put up to get this bill to this point. 
The chairman has summarized major provisions of the bill, and I want to take a few moments to give my perspective on some of the key provisions. 
First, relative to the implementation of the quadrennial defense review recommendations, for the most part, this bill is consistent with the administration's defense policies and programs. The budget agreement this year demonstrated that there is a growing consensus between the President and the Congress over the level of defense spending for the next 5 years. It is not going to be possible, at these funding levels, to maintain today's force levels at their current readiness posture, provide the pay and the quality of life for our military members and their families that they deserve and that we are obligated to provide, and still to modernize our forces to meet possible future threats. We are not going to be able to do all that at the agreed-upon funding levels. 
In my view, our forces must continue to have the technological edge over any potential adversary. In order to modernize our forces, we are going to have to accept, in my judgment, a somewhat smaller force in the future. But there are encouraging indications that technology is going to allow a smaller force to have the same or even greater lethality and combat effectiveness as our forces have today. 
The recently completed quadrennial defense review begins to make some of the tradeoffs that we are going to need to make to be able to modernize our forces. In several important respects, this bill begins to implement the requested recommendations. For example, the bill reduces active duty personnel strength for the military services by 36,000 below the current levels and reduces Reserve component strength 16,000 below current levels. 
The bill supports a major Army initiative, which was recommended at the quadrennial defense review, by increasing funding by approximately $150 million for the Army's Force 21 initiative. Last April, I visited the Army's advanced war-fighting experiment at the National Training Center. I saw, firsthand, the tremendous potential of the advanced situational technologies the Army is developing in their Force 21 initiative. The QDR recommended speeding up the fielding of these technologies, and the committee bill supports this important effort. 
I may say that a number of our colleagues visited the center as well. I know the Senator from Indiana, for instance, also visited the National Training Center, and he is the chairman of our subcommittee. He was also very deeply impressed by the potential of these technologies, and he is primarily instrumental, I would say, for the increased resources that we are devoting to this initiative. I have been happy to support that effort. I believe very strongly in them. But I want to give credit to Senator Coats for the energies he has shown in this regard. 
In order to be able to afford the modernization program for the military services outlined in the quadrennial defense review, it is important that the Congress and the Defense Department carefully limit weapons acquisition programs to only the levels necessary to meet the future requirements of the military services. In this regard, I am pleased that our committee included a provision prohibiting future production of B-2 bombers beyond the 21 currently planned for the Air Force. We don't need and we can't afford more B-2's. 
Finally, Mr. President, in this area, we have heard from a number of Senators this year expressing concern over the levels of procurement funding for the National Guard and Reserve components. 
The committee bill authorizes a total of $653 million above the budget request to buy equipment for National Guard and Reserve units. But now I want to turn to several areas of concern that I have with this bill. 
First, on base closures: I am disappointed that the committee could not agree on a process for future base closures in the Department of Defense. Although there was strong support in the committee for more base closures, the amendment to authorize two additional base closure rounds--one in 1999 and one in 2001--failed on a 9 to 9 tie vote. I believe that the case for closing more military bases is clear and compelling. 
From 1989 to 1997 the Department of Defense reduced total active duty military end strength by 32 percent. That figure is going to grow to 36 percent by the year 2003, as a result of the quadrennial defense review. So we have cut the size of our forces by 36 percent as of the year 2003, and already by 32 percent. 
But even after the four base closure rounds, the domestic military base structure in the United States has been reduced by only 21 percent. And therein lies the problem. We have more structure than we need in our bases. So both the QDR, quadrennial defense review of the Department of Defense, and the national defense panel of outside citizens that we have selected to review the QDR division--both the QDR and that outside defense panel--have concluded that further reductions in the DOD base structure are essential to free up money that we need to modernize our forces. 
Because we have to make some very difficult choices here, one of the critical choices is whether or not we are going to continue to keep excess structure when we are shorting modernization funding. And on June 5 the Armed Services Committee received a letter signed by all six members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The chairman, the vice chairman, the four service chiefs all signed one letter. It is rather unusual. But they did it in this case because of the strength of their views. And they urged us in this letter to `strongly support further reductions in base structure proposed by the Secretary of Defense.' 
Mr. President, every dollar that we spend to keep open bases that we don't need is $1 that we can't spend on modernization programs that our military forces do need. And I know that closing bases is a painful process. I have been through it. We lost all three of our Strategic Air Command bases in Michigan. One of them that was closed recently was in the upper peninsula of Michigan which was the largest single employer in the upper peninsula in a rural area, and it was closed. We argued against it. We lost. So the largest employer in the upper peninsula of Michigan shut down. We are surviving. A lot of good people are putting their shoulder to the wheel and we are going to be able to pull through. Is there some short-term pain and stress? You bet. Is it essential that we go through this process to reduce excess structure? It is. 
Are there additional facilities in Michigan that might be addressed in future rounds of base closings? There are. And that has to make all of us worry. But we have really no choice. If we are serious about modernizing, about the need to modernize and to keep ahead of any potential adversary, and to make sure that our forces in the future have the best equipment that can possibly be developed and manufactured, we have to do what the Joint Chiefs have urged us to do in this 24-star letter; and that is to support further reductions in base closures which has closings which have been recommended by the Secretary of Defense. I don't see any other choice. The easy way is to not do it. But it is not the right thing to do, if we are going to maintain our qualitative technological edge. We just simply must continue to find a way to reduce our infrastructure costs. And, if that means that the next round of base closing we have to adjust it so that we don't run into the kind of argument that we have run into in the past round of base closings, if we have to put in the next round of base closing a provision that you can't privatize in place, for instance, without a specific recommendation to do that by BRAC, if that is what it is going to take, then so be it. But we have to continue down this road, if we are going to be true to the needs of our military. 
Secretary Cohen pointed out in his testimony on the quadrennial defense review that the choice is clear. We can maintain the current base structure and fail to meet our modernization goals, or we can reduce our base structure and achieve the savings that we need to pay for the modernization that we all agree is necessary. 
On the Air Force depot issue, there is no more contentious issue than this one. And I commend the Senators who permitted this process of bringing this bill to the floor to continue by removing the contentious provisions at this time. I commend them for it. In my view, the only way to resolve this issue is to have a fair competition, and determine the most cost-effective solution to redistribute the workload of these two depots, regardless of whether the result is privatization in place, privatization in some other location, or transfer to another Government depot. 
There are many that believe and I know that the White House politicized this one aspect of the base closure process when the DOD privatized in place the work of the two closing Air Force depots. But I think it would be just as bad for Congress to politicize the base closure process by attempting to legislate a particular outcome. I don't think we can legislate a particular outcome. 
I don't think we should. I think we should legislate a process which will guarantee that there be a full and fair competition. I tried that approach in committee. I didn't quite make it. But I think that is the best way to proceed. 
We have base-decision amendments on this bill, and, even if we do not, we are going to face this issue in conference because the House bill contains provisions that do address the issue. Ultimately we will have to reach a compromise I believe that is fair and equitable to all. 
On another subject, cooperative threat reduction programs: One of the most cost-effective and successful defense programs to reduce threats to our country and to enhance our national security is the cooperative threat reduction program that was started in 1991 by Senators Nunn and Lugar. The cooperative threat reduction program at the Department of Defense and its companion program at the Department of Energy have produced important results in reducing the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and their materials. 
In my view, the committee decision to reduce the budget request for these programs by $135 million was shortsighted. I would have preferred to see an increase in funding for these programs because they are a very cost-effective approach to the most serious national security threat that we face today. That is the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Of all the security threats that we face, that is probably the most serious one--weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists, or terrorist states. 
This is a very modest investment in terms of defense budget, and it can significantly reduce the threat of proliferation by securing materials wherever they are--in this case Russia and some of the other former Soviet Union states. That is a real investment in our own security with a huge payoff. 
It doesn't take much of this plutonium or enriched uranium to leak--to be transferred across the borders of these states to threaten us with massive destruction. About a hockey puck of plutonium can take care of one of our cities. That can be carried in one's pocket. That material literally can be carried in a pocket across a border. We need to secure that material; whatever it takes to secure it within reason. 
These are reasonable amounts of money. We are talking about a major investment in American security. 
So I think the decision to reduce the budget request for these programs, including security of nuclear material, was a mistake. And I know there is going to be a bipartisan effort to restore these funds for this important program. I hope that we will do so here on the floor. 
Mr. President, on another part of the bill, the committee authorized $345 million to begin incremental funding of the construction of the next Nimitz class nuclear aircraft carrier called CVN-77. It did so based on claims of cost savings by the shipbuilder. Those claims, it seems to me, can be made reasonably. Those are claims that have some foundation. 
Indeed, there was a report that we received. The Rand Corp. folks did a study on this issue that said that the savings which were advertised here claimed by the shipbuilder can be achieved. It is possible. But what we failed to do in committee is to assure that the advertised and claimed savings would be achieved. We didn't adopt the safeguards to ensure that the taxpayers actually received the savings advertised by the shipbuilder on which this very unusual action is based. 
We do not incrementally fund aircraft carriers. We do not say, `OK, we will put a couple hundred million dollars in this year, and a couple hundred million dollars in next year', and so forth, because it makes it very difficult for us when it comes to negotiating the contract to purchase the aircraft carrier to have any bargaining leverage. We have already incrementally funded, bought pieces of it, obligated funds for it, and we have lost our bargaining leverage when it comes to the price. So what we have done traditionally is authorized the whole thing at once in order to make sure that we get the best deal when it comes time to negotiate the price. 
The Defense Department's current future years' defense program includes a total of $5.2 billion for the construction of the next aircraft carrier with what is called `advanced procurement' in the year 2000, and the balance of $4.5 billion in the year 2002. But earlier this year the shipbuilder came forward with a proposal, as I said, to incrementally fund this carrier beginning in this year's budget--the one that is in front of us--and continuing each year through 2002. According to the shipbuilder, this alternative funding proposal would save us $600 million in the cost of building the CVN-77. And this claim has been repeated many times in the last 2 months in some very highly visible advertising in the media. 
As I said, the normal method of funding major defense procurement funding programs is to provide full funding in one lump sum in the year in which the program is started. 
There have been certain exceptions and limited long-lead items which are funded through advanced procurement. And the reason for it is the one that I have given, which has to do with avoiding buy-ins--the situation in which it becomes more difficult to control total program costs in future and future cost growth. 
But the Rand Corp. did that study I referred to, and it substantiated that savings were really possible here if we incrementally fund it as proposed by the shipbuilders, and the Navy's own analysis subsequently confirmed that this savings could be achieved. 
So I am willing to support incremental funding as one Senator, but I am willing to do it only if this incremental funding approach assures us that the Government is going to receive the savings from this approach that had been promised by the contractor. And it is doable. We can do this. And I will be offering an amendment--and I hope there will be bipartisan support for this amendment--that will attempt to assure that this $600 million in advertised savings is, in fact, achieved in the purchase of this aircraft carrier. And we began, I think, to do this in a way which allows us to get the savings but also to assure the savings. 
Mr. President, just one or two other items. Section 1039 of this bill prohibits the General Accounting Office from undertaking any self-initiated audits unless it can certify that it has completed all congressional requests. Since the General Accounting Office has hundreds of pending requests at any given time, this provision in effect is a total prohibition on any self-initiated work by the GAO. 
I hope that this provision will be deleted or modified because it could hamstring the GAO in its very important efforts to identify waste, fraud and abuse in Government programs. Already 80 percent of the GAO work is in response to the requests of committees and Members of the Congress. But some of the work that they do fulfills work that has been carried out by them in the waste, fraud and abuse area which they have self-initiated and which has been very, very important to the Congress in identifying waste, fraud and abuse--not just in the defense area, in any area. And this provision applies not just to defense. The provision in this defense bill applies Governmentwide. 
That is why the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, and the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Glenn, both wrote a letter requesting sequential referral of this bill to Governmental Affairs so that they could have a look at this provision which is Governmentwide and would restrict the GAO. Sequential referral was not approved because, under the rules, the parliamentary rules, apparently in order for there to be sequential referral, a bill must have many more provisions in it relating to that second committee than this one provision. It has to predominantly belong within the jurisdiction of a second committee, and this bill obviously does not. This is one of a few provisions which touches the Governmental Affairs jurisdiction. But I do hope that we will be able to find a way to either delete or to modify this provision as it will hamstring the efforts of the GAO in doing some very important work. 
Finally, Mr. President, section 363 of this bill gives the Secretary of Defense the unprecedented authority unilaterally to stop for 30 days certain administrative actions of other Federal agencies. The Secretary would have this authority without regard to the valid health or safety concerns that may have motivated other agencies in taking their action. This automatic stay could cover rules and orders intended to protect the environment and safeguard work safety or preserve private property and many other conceivable administrative actions and orders. This action exceeds the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. It creates the appearance of placing the Department of Defense above the law. For these reasons, I do not believe that it should have been included in the bill, and I hope we can find a way to correct it. 
Mr. President, I know there will be some vigorous debate on this bill, and I hope Senators will come to the floor and offer their amendments so that we can complete Senate action on the bill in a timely manner and in a fashion that the majority leader has announced, and then go to conference with the House. 
And, again, I want to commend my friend from South Carolina for his leadership on the committee and in making it possible for this bill to come to the floor. I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 858, the fiscal year 1998 intelligence authorization bill. The legislation comes to the floor having been reported out of the Select Committee on Intelligence earlier this month and approved, on referral, by the Armed Services Committee. As a member of both committees, I believe S. 858 is a responsible, bipartisan bill which reflects our mutual oversight concerns and policy priorities. While there may be some areas in which the two committees disagree, I want to praise Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby and Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey for their efforts in seeking a consensus with the Armed Services Committee on the funding and legislative provisions contained in the bill. 
Most notably, S. 858 reflects our shared concern that intelligence community activities must reflect the new, post-cold-war era threats and challenges to U.S. security. Additionally, there is strong agreement between the two committees and the administration that continued emphasis must be given to improving the collection and distribution of timely intelligence to the warfighter in the cockpit, in the tank, aboard ship, and in the command post. One of the overriding lessons learned from the Persian Gulf war was that high quality tactical intelligence, if provided to the warfighter in a prompt fashion can save American lives and carry the day on the field of battle. Improving this qualitative advantage enjoyed by our Armed Forces must remain a top priority in my view and I am pleased to see it reflected in S. 858. 
Also included in the intelligence authorization bill is a provision I sponsored asking that the Director of Central Intelligence examine the full range of threats to the United States from weapons of mass destruction, not just the threat from ballistic and cruise missile weapons, which formed the basis of the last intelligence estimate of this kind in 1995. The intelligence threat assessment required by S. 858 will be submitted to Congress annually beginning February 15 of next year and provide us with our first comprehensive understanding of the emerging `nontraditional' threat facing our Nation, including the ability of terrorist groups and hostile governments to produce and deliver nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons into the United States, the probability that such an attack would come from ballistic missile, cruise missile, or any other means of delivery, and the vulnerability of the United States to such an attack. One month after the completion of the intelligence community's threat estimate, the President is required to submit a report to Congress identifying how Federal funds are dedicated to defending against this full range of threats. Linking the probability of a certain type of attack using a weapon of mass destruction, such as a terrorist chemical attack versus a Russian ballistic missile attack, with the level of funds being spent to defend against such a threat will be extremely helpful, in my view, as the Senate debates national defense spending priorities in the upcoming years. 
In closing, I again want to commend the leadership of the Senate Intelligence Committee for its willingness to work with the Armed Services Committee on the numerous issues of mutual concern, and I look forward to continued cooperation between the two committees as we move into conference with the House of Representatives on our respective bills.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in saluting the 1997 Stanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings. After 42 years of frustration and near misses, on Saturday night a week ago the Red Wings completed a 4-0 sweep of the powerful Philadelphia Flyers and brought the most coveted trophy in professional sports back to the city known by hockey fans across North America as `Hockeytown.' 
My wife, Barbara, and I had one of the most thrilling experiences of our lives when we were able to attend the game. Our daughter, Erica, came within a whisker of coming to Detroit from New York but ended up glued to her TV instead, with our daughter, Laura, 800 miles away. With our daughter, Kate, watching in Ann Arbor, the family was together, electronically watching history in the making. The outpouring of positive emotion after the game was almost as memorable as the game itself! The long drought was finally over and Detroit's fans poured forth into the streets all across Michigan to whoop it up. 
The Detroit Red Wings are one of the most successful teams in hockey history. An `Original Six' franchise, today's team is rooted in the tradition of hockey legends like Sid Abel, Ted Lindsay, Terry Sawchuck, and the greatest player ever to lace up skates, Gordie Howe. Their numbers have been retired and hang on banners from the rafters of Joe Louis Arena, reminding today's players and fans of glory years past. 
The 1996-97 Red Wings won the Stanley Cup because of an organizationwide commitment to excellence. That commitment begins at the top with team owners Mike and Marian Ilitch, and is matched only by their dedication to the city of Detroit. When Mike and Marian purchased the team 15 years ago, the Wings regularly missed the playoffs and gave away a car at each home game to put fans in the seats. Their perseverance, dedication to winning and commitment to the city of Detroit have paid off with their Stanley Cup triumph. 
The Red Wings' tremendous victory was truly a team effort, but a few individuals deserve a special mention. Coach Scotty Bowman won his seventh Stanley Cup, and became the first coach in NHL history to win the cup with three teams. Mike Vernon, the Red Wings' veteran goalie, earned the Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs with his stellar netminding. But this victory may mean the most to Red Wings Captain Steve Yzerman, one of the classiest professional athletes one could ever meet. Steve was drafted 14 years ago and was named team captain 11 years ago, making him the longest serving captain with the same team in the NHL. He has carried his team, and the often weighty hopes of Red Wings fans, on his shoulders with dignity and grace. My congratulations go to Mike and Marian Ilitch, Scotty Bowman, Mike Vernon, Steve Yzerman, Jimmy Devellano; and players Doug Brown, Mathieu Dandenault, Kris Draper, Sergei Fedorov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Kevin Hodson, Tomas Holmstrom, Mike Knuble, Joey Kocur, Vladimir Konstantinov, Vyacheslav Kozlov, Martin LaPointe, Igor Larionov, Nicklas Lidstrom, Kirk Maltby, Darren McCarty, Larry Murphy, Chris Osgood, Jamie Pushor, Bob Rouse, Tomas Sandstrom, Brendan Shanahan, Tim Taylor and Aaron Ward. 
I would like to extend my congratulations as well to the Philadelphia Flyers for a well-played series. Their strength and power gave the Red Wings a tough battle. 
Last Friday, after a week of celebration which saw 1 million people fill Hart Plaza and Woodward Avenue for the Red Wings' victory parade, Hockeytown met with tragedy as three members of the team were involved in a limousine accident. Two of the Wings' famous `Russian Five,' Vladimir Konstantinov and Slava Fetisov, as well as the team's masseur, Sergei Mnatsakanov, were seriously injured. Today, Vladimir and Sergei are each in a coma with critical head injuries. Slava, thankfully, is listed in good condition with chest injuries. Vladimir, a finalist for the Norris Trophy as the National Hockey League's top defenseman, and Slava, a 39-year-old known to his teammates as `Papa Bear,' are fan favorites around the league. Hockey fans in the Detroit area and across North America are praying for the full recovery of all three men. 
Mr. President, the Detroit Red Wings showed people around the world what it takes to be a champion. I know my colleagues will join me in extending the congratulations of the entire U.S. Senate to the 1997 Stanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings and also send our hopes and prayers for the full recovery of all those injured last Friday night.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I visited Lebanon over the Memorial Day recess in order to assess the security situation there. A number of my Lebanese-American constituents have contacted me to request that the State Department's travel policy for Lebanon be changed, and I also decided to see first-hand the situation there. 
Pursuant to United States law, the Secretary of State may restrict the use of United States passports for the travel of U.S. citizens to countries with which the United States is at war, where armed hostilities are in progress, or where there is imminent danger to the health or the physical safety of United States travelers. The Secretary of State has exercised that authority in the case of Lebanon and consequently U.S. passports are not valid for travel to, in or through Lebanon unless special validation has been obtained. The passport restriction includes landing at the Beirut airport en route to another destination. 
Special validation is possible for professional reporters; representatives of the American Red Cross traveling pursuant to an officially-sponsored Red Cross mission; compelling humanitarian considerations such as a critical illness of an immediate family member; family reunification such as a situation where a spouse or minor child is residing in Lebanon, with and dependent on, a Lebanese spouse or parent for his or her support; or where the travel is found to be in the national interest. 
In view of the limited exceptions to the travel restriction, a number of Americans have resorted to the practice of acquiring a Lebanese visa on a piece of paper separate from their American passports so that they will not encounter any difficulty from U.S. authorities upon returning to the United States. I have been advised that forty to fifty thousand Americans travel to Lebanon by this means each year. In doing so, they may be violating U.S. law. Countless other Americans, despite their earnest desire to visit relatives or friends in Lebanon, await a change in U.S. policy. 
I traveled to Lebanon with the approval and support of the State Department. I arrived at the U.S. Embassy compound via U.S. Army helicopter from Cyprus in mid-afternoon on May 29th, spent the night on the embassy compound, and returned to Cyprus by the same means in mid-morning on May 30th. 
While in Lebanon, I had a busy schedule. I met at length with our Ambassador Richard Jones. I also met with Nasrallah Sfeir, 76th Maronite Patriarch of Antioch and all of the East; Mohamed Rashid Qabbani, Grand Mufti of the Republic; IMAM Mohamed Mahdi Shamseddine, President, Higher Islamic Shi'a Council; Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri; President Elias Hrawi; and General Emile Lahoud, Commander of the Lebanese Armed Force. In each instance, the meeting was held at the place where the religious figure or government official was located, requiring travel throughout the 
city of Beirut and its environs. Additionally, I met with a number of government officials, members of the Lebanese Parliament, and Lebanese businessmen at a dinner at the American Embassy hosted by Ambassador Jones. 
I made it a point to ask each individual with whom I met about the United States travel policy. I was advised that there are large numbers of Americans in Lebanon at all times and that they are safe. Frequent reference was made to the recent visit of the Pope to Lebanon. Finally, I was told that the U.S. travel policy was keeping relatives apart and was preventing needed U.S. private investment in Lebanon. General Lahoud pointed out that members of the Hizballah Party, which is the primary security concern of the United States, were elected to and participating in the Lebanese parliament and that there had not been an incident against an American in five years. 
Significantly, our representatives in Beirut favored a lifting of the travel restriction. 
Based upon my personal observations during my visit, it is clear to me that perceptions about the security situation in Lebanon are outdated. There is no substitute for an on-the-scene assessment. 
Later on the trip I visited Bosnia and I had an opportunity in Sarajevo to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. I urged her to send a team to Lebanon to assess the security situation there and was pleased when she advised me that she was doing so. I am confident that such an assessment will provide a sound basis for the revision of the current policy and I have written to Secretary Albright urging her to change the current U.S. policy. Senator Abraham has joined me in writing to Secretary Albright. 
While I strongly favor a lifting of the travel restriction, I realize that the situation in Lebanon is not normal. Accordingly, in our letter to Secretary Albright, we also urged that a travel warning for Lebanon be issued in lieu of the current travel restriction. In addition to citing the always possible Hizballah terrorist attacks, I believe that the travel warning should note that as long as foreign military forces are present in Lebanon, the situation there is not normalized.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Secretary of State bears a heavy responsibility when assessing the security situation in a country to determine if travel restrictions should be applied. The imposition of a travel restriction is rare, as it should be. For example, in the case of travel to Somalia, the State Department issued a travel warning on June 28, 1996, which is still in effect, that states that: 
The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Somalia. Sporadic fighting among local militias continues in parts of the country. Kidnappings and other threats to foreigners occur unpredictably in virtually all regions. There is no national government in Somalia to offer security or police protection for travelers. There is no U.S. diplomatic presence in Somalia to provide consular assistance to U.S. citizens. United Nations peacekeeping forces were withdrawn from Somalia in March 1995 and all U.S. citizens were advised to depart the country. 
In another example, the Department of State travel warning that was issued on September 2, 1996 regarding Iraq, states:

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join with so many of our colleagues today to honor the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Strom Thurmond achieved another of many historic milestones when he became the longest serving Senator in the history of this institution. 
Strom Thurmond had already served on the Armed Services Committee for 20 years when I came to the Senate and joined the committee in January 1979. I knew of him as a passionate and effective advocate for a strong national defense even before I joined the committee. In the 18 years I have served on that committee, I have come to appreciate even more his commitment to the welfare of the men and women who serve and who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces, as well as their families. 
It is my privilege now to serve as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee under the chairmanship of Strom Thurmond. Over the years, one of the hallmarks of the Armed Services Committee has been that we conduct our business with a minimum of partisanship. Our former colleague and chairman, Sam Nunn, was right when he said that there was not a single national security issue facing this country that has been or could be solved by one political party. That legacy of bipartisanship on the Armed Services Committee continues under Strom Thurmond's leadership. 
Mr. President, one of the reasons Senator Thurmond has been such an effective leader on national security issues is that all of his colleagues know--and the American people know--that he speaks from the heart and he speaks from personal experience. He served his country in uniform for 36 years. He was commissioned in the Army Reserve even before he began his career in politics. He served 36 years in the Reserves and on active duty before retiring as a major general in the Army Reserve. 
In June 1944, Lt. Col. Strom Thurmond landed behind German lines with the rest of the 82d Airborne Division as part of the D-day invasion. As I and so many others watched the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion 3 years ago, we gained an even greater appreciation for the lifetime of service to this Nation by someone all of us are proud to call a friend and a colleague. 
More than a half century after landing behind enemy lines on D-day, Senator Thurmond continues to carry out his responsibilities as a legislator with a skill and perseverance that are the envy of his colleagues. I recall a time several years ago when Strom Thurmond and I offered an amendment to reform lobbying fees. Our amendment prohibited lobbyists who were lobbying for contracts for their clients from getting a contingent fee. We felt it was wrong for lobbyists to be paid that way and we offered an amendment together. The manager of the bill objected to our amendment. What Senator Thurmond did was to hold back for a couple hours while he talked to all of our colleagues personally. He got 51 supporters for his amendment, and then came back to offer it. That kind of perseverance which we know in Senator Thurmond has paid off in many, many ways for this institution and for this Nation. We are proud to call him a friend and to recognize that kind of capability. 
The Democratic Party lost a Senator of great ability when Strom Thurmond joined the Republican Party in 1964. I just want him to know that we would welcome him back on this side of the aisle at any time, this century or next. 
Senator Thurmond cares about us as people. I cannot say how many times he has given me advice--and I know this is true of our colleagues--on exercise, on diet, and on other human conditions. I wish I had followed his advice more often. 
I will never forget the time early in my Senate career when Strom and I and a few of our Armed Services Committee colleagues were out visiting at a California air base. At about 6 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by people running below. They were talking to each other as they were running. I heard this happen on a few turns of the track and woke up and then would go back to 
sleep. A couple of hours later when I was at breakfast I said, `Who was that out here running at 6 o'clock in the morning?' I should have known the answer. It was Strom Thurmond. 
He has given us advice on how to try to achieve this kind of longevity. He gives us that advice because he cares about us. And I just want him to know that we care about him. We wish him well. It has been a real privilege to serve with him for 18 years, particularly as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and I am proud to call him a friend. 
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a time for Americans to stop and think about those who have given their lives for our Nation's freedom. 
This week, the Senate passed a resolution commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I was proud to be included as an original cosponsor of this important resolution. The resolution encourages Americans to remember the sacrifices of our Nation's veterans and extends the Senate's sympathies to those who suffered the loss of family and friends in Vietnam. Since its dedication 15 years ago, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has been a sanctuary where survivors and families have mourned, where soldiers have reflected on the past, and where youth have explored our history. 
Memorial Day serves as a strong reminder of the effects of war. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial contains the names of more than 58,000 men and women who lost their lives from 1957 to 1975 in the Vietnam combat area or who are still missing in action. No person is able to walk along the wall without being moved by its simple message of loss. 
Of the many names which mark `the wall,' 2,660 are from Michigan. One Michigan Vietnam veteran whose name is on the wall is Capt. James L. Huard of Dearborn, MI. Captain Huard disappeared on July 12, 1972 while flying his F-4 Phantom over North Vietnam. For nearly 25 years, Captain Huard was missing-in-action. In 1988, the Vietnamese government turned over what were believed to be the remains of a number of United States servicemen. After many years of forensics work, Huard's remains were identified and returned to his family on January 29, 1997. On May 1, Capt. James L. Huard was given an official burial at Arlington National Cemetery. 
In 1989, the Dearborn City Council passed a resolution which ordered the POW/MIA flag to fly above City Hall until `Huard is returned home.' On Memorial Day, the flag will be lowered as a final most appropriate and moving tribute to Captain Huard. 
I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Capt. James L. Huard and the many men and women who have given their lives in the service of our Nation.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the revenue provisions in the budget resolution which is before the Senate reflects the bipartisan budget agreement entered into by the President and the congressional leadership. I quote from the Budget Committee's report accompanying this resolution: 
The Bipartisan Agreement assumes the net tax cut shall be $85 billion over the next five years and not more than $250 billion over the next ten years, to provide tax relief to American families. Under the Agreement, revenues would continue to grow, from $1554.9 billion in 1997 to $1890.4 billion in 2002, an increase of $335.5 billion over the five year period. 
As always, the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate will determine the specific amounts and structure of the tax relief package. The tax-writing committees will be required to balance the interests and desires of many parties (while protecting the interests of taxpayers generally) in crafting the tax cut within the context of the goals adopted by the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. 
I also want to read those guidelines from the letter sent to the President on May 15, 1997, from the Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader: 
It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007. We believe these levels provide enough room for important reforms, including broad-based permanent capital gains tax reductions, significant death tax relief, $500 per child tax credit, and expansion of IRAs. 
In the course of drafting the legislation to implement the balanced budget plan, there are some additional areas that we want to be sure the committees of jurisdiction consider. Specifically, it was agreed that the package must include tax relief of roughly $35 billion over five years for post-secondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit. 
Would the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee agree that this agreement and this budget resolution leave great flexibility for the Congress to shape the tax reconciliation bill?

Does the Senator agree that within the parameters of an $85 billion net tax cut through the year 2002 and no more than $250 million over the next 10 years, including $35 billion in tax relief over 5 years for post-secondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit, there is significant flexibility in the size and the targeting of a permanent capital gains tax reduction and in the size and the specifics of death tax relief included in the package?

Mr. LEVIN. As I read the table summarizing the agreement, entitled `Long Range Summary, 1997-2007,' on page 77 of the committee print, there is an agreement regarding net tax figures for the years 1997 through 2002. The word `agreement' appears above the columns for those years. The word `projections' appears above the columns for the years 2003 through 2007. Am I correct then that the net tax cut figures for the years 2003 through 2007 are not agreements on specific numbers, but the numbers in those years are simply OMB projections?

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee. I ask these questions to reflect my concern that any tax bill produced pursuant to the budget agreement and this budget resolution not set in motion tax policies which will create large deficits in the next decade. Also, I strongly believe we must carefully study the effect of any tax provisions which we include in the revenue reconciliation legislation to assure that it is fair, and not weighted to benefit principally those who need it least.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the budget resolution which the Senate is now considering represents the next step forward in a process begun in 1993. It reflects a considerable bipartisan accomplishment of the congressional leadership and the President. While I don't agree with it in every specific, it represents the best opportunity to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002, in a way which protects Medicare, Medicaid, funding for education and environmental protection. 
In 1992, the deficit in the Federal budget was $290 billion which represented 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product. The most recent estimate of the deficit for fiscal year 1997 is $67 billion, approximately eight-tenths of one percent of the gross domestic product. 
Over the 5 years from 1993 to 1998, the deficit has been reduced by about 1 trillion dollars from the deficit for those 5 years projected at the time. This remarkable progress has come about in large part as a result of the deficit reduction package which President Clinton presented in 1993, and which this Senate passed, without a single Republican vote, by a margin of one vote, the Vice-President's. 
The economy has responded to the steady reduction of the deficit. The economy grew for the first quarter of 1997 at a 5.6 percent rate, with an inflation rate of 2.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 4.9 percent, the lowest in 24 years. This compares to an unemployment rate in 1992 of 7.5 percent. More than 12 million new jobs have been created since President Clinton took office. Now, this budget agreement, reflected in the budget resolution before us, holds the promise of bringing us even closer to finishing the job. 
This budget gets many of the nation's priorities right. It protects Medicare and Medicaid--while assuring the solvency of the Medicare trust fund for another decade--it includes an important new initiative for children's health insurance, assures necessary funding for the protection of our natural environment, and perhaps most importantly, it includes the largest increase in investment in the education of our children in over 30 years. The agreement includes the commitment to pass $35 billion of postsecondary education tax cuts and funding for the President's initiatives in child literacy, school technology, Head Start, and an increase in the maximum Pell Grant to $3,000. Overall, this represents a 13 percent increase over the five years of the budget, and a 36 percent increase in education and training from last year's budget resolution. 
Mr. President, the resolution before us also makes room in the budget for $250 billion in net tax cuts over the next 10 years, and $85 billion in net tax cuts over the next 5 years. This could provide an opportunity, within the confines of a budget which balances in 2002, to provide investment in our Nation's future growth and tax relief to middle income families. This will require, however, that the Congress show the discipline and the determination to shape the tax legislation which this budget resolution will make possible in such a way as to meet these objectives. 
Toward that end, providing they are part of a real package that gets us to a zero deficit by 2002, I intend to support the education tax cuts which the President has proposed, a $500-per-child tax credit adequate to provide tax relief to middle income families with children, and capital gains relief for homeowners. Also, I believe that, if consistent with the deficit reduction goals laid out in the resolution, that targeted capital gains relief for long-term investments and an incremental approach to estate tax relief should be used. 
We must be careful, as we stand on the threshold of a balanced budget, not to set in motion tax policies which will create large deficits in the next decade. For that reason, I hope that the tax-writing committees will consider tying tax reductions to actually accomplished milestones of deficit reduction. 
Second, we must carefully study the effect of any tax provisions which we include in the final tax reconciliation legislation to assure that it is fair, and not weighted to benefit those who need it least. Many of the capital gains and estate tax proposals which we have seen proposed over the last several years would clearly have mostly benefited the top 10% of income earners. 
The budget resolution before us leaves great flexibility to the tax-writing committees, and ultimately to the House and Senate to fashion an equitable tax bill that provides not only tax relief, but investment in our nation's future, particularly through education. Also, and very importantly, the resolution provides for the tax provisions to be considered separately in a reconciliation bill after the other elements of the balanced budget have been enacted. This will provide the Senate with the opportunity to reject a tax bill which is inconsistent with balancing the budget and keeping it balanced in the years beyond 2002, and/or a tax bill which does not focus its relief on middle-income families and investment in education. It will also provide the President with the opportunity to veto such legislation. While I hope that course will prove unnecessary, it does provide greater assurance that the budget agreement that we will soon ratify in this budget resolution will produce an outcome of which we can be truly proud. 
Mr. President, I want to commend all of those who worked to produce this bi-partisan budget resolution. It is with hope that we are finally approaching a balanced budget which protects the nation's priorities that I will support this resolution.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow we will welcome home a true American hero, Eastpointe, MI native, astronaut Jerry Linenger. Jerry is returning to Earth this weekend aboard the space shuttle Atlantis after a 5 month mission on the Russian space station, Mir. 
I am sure that Jerry expected his 5 months in space to provide him with innumerable opportunities and challenges, but the challenges he and his crewmates faced were way beyond expectations. They had to fix antifreeze fume leaks which threatened the space station's air supply. The oxygen-generating systems malfunctioned, forcing the crew to activate three backup oxygen canisters each day to provide them with the oxygen they needed to breathe. And, Jerry and his Russian fellow scientists had to extinguish the worst fire ever aboard an orbiting human spacecraft, an ordeal which captured the attention of millions of people in the United States, Russia and around the world. It seemed from this earthly vantage point that the 10 plagues of space travel were being visited on Mir--leaks, lack of oxygen, humidity, fire, temperature, excess CO2, loss of power, lack of supplies and replacement parts, claustrophobia, and separation from family. When the space shuttle Atlantis recently linked up with the Mir space station to deliver much needed repair parts and to pick him up, Jerry may have made the understatement of the year when he remarked to its crew members that it was `nice to see you.' 
While the drama played out in space, Jerry Linenger's professionalism came to the fore. He continued his work on the scientific experiments he was scheduled to complete, including experiments on materials which may be used in future spacecraft, and tests on how living in space affected his immune system. He also brought his experiences home to Earth by posting letters to his son, John, on NASA's World Wide Web page, as well as by participating in the Mir international amateur Radio experiment. Using this new technology, Jerry linked up with a fifth grade class in Charlevoix, MI. In one of his messages to his son, Jerry explained one facet of life in space: `When running on the treadmill, we sweat. From our skin, the moisture evaporates in order to cool our bodies (By the way--those doggies you are so fascinated with use their tongues, panting, to 'sweat' and regulate their temperature). The sweat evaporates into the air. This water, along with all the other humidity in the air is condensed on cold coils (just like the outside of your cold bottle getting wet on a hot, humid day) and collected. Biocide is added, the condensate boiled, and we use it to drink or rehydrate our freeze-dried foods. Delicious. 
We have all felt the joy which comes with returning home from a long trip, but there are few people alive who truly know the feeling Jerry Linenger will have after returning from 5 months orbiting the Earth. Jerry's wife, Kathryn, and young son, John, eagerly anticipate his return for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that Kathryn is due to give birth to their second child in early June. It appears that Jerry will make it home in time. 
I would like to express my deepest admiration for the accomplishments of Jerry Linenger. We can all benefit from his example of courage, perseverance and professionalism. Jerry has said that upon his return to Earth, he hopes to spend time with his family and dreams of `going up to Northern Michigan and finding an old timer that knows how to fish and doesn't like talking a lot . . . just sitting down by the stream and breathing fresh air in and the fresh water.' I, for one, hope he gets that chance. I know my colleagues join me in welcoming Jerry Linenger back to Earth, and in congratulating him on a mission heroically accomplished.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bruce and Christine Pesola, of Marquette, MI, whose restoration of the Landmark Inn Hotel has preserved one of the Upper Peninsula's architectural and historic treasures for a new generation. 
The Landmark Inn Hotel originally opened on January 8, 1930, and was known as the Hotel Northland. At that time, the Northland was the premier hotel in the Upper Peninsula. Throughout the years, the hotel has housed many notable people, including Amelia Earhart, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, and musical legends Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. 
When Bruce and Christine Pesola purchased the hotel in 1995, it had stood vacant for more than 12 years. While many people were calling for the demolition of the building, the Pesolas were dedicated to preserving this piece of history. Described by one local newspaper as a `squalid, vacant blemish on the city's skyline,' the rehabilitation of the Landmark Inn will contribute significantly to restoration efforts in downtown Marquette. As a longtime proponent of historic preservation, I was pleased to support the Pesolas in their efforts to secure the project's eligibility for historic preservation certification from the Department of the Interior, enabling the Pesolas to receive federal tax credits in return for their commitment to retaining the historic characteristics of the hotel. 
The renovation of the Landmark Inn Hotel stands as an example of the benefits of historic preservation. Not only will Marquette gain a quality hotel in the downtown area, the people of the city of Marquette and the State of Michigan will retain an important link to the past. I know my colleagues will join me in expressing congratulations and best wishes for future success to Bruce and Christine Pesola on the occasion of the grand opening of the Landmark Inn Hotel.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to add to the statement I offered last week when I introduced S. 758, the Lobbying Disclosure Technical Amendments Act of 1997. In my statement, I noted that a similar piece of legislation that Congressmen Charles Canady and Barney Frank sponsored last year and moved through the House of Representatives, was unable to gain passage in the Senate because of a provision that some Members of the Senate found problematic. I emphasized that the bill I have introduced omits that provision. 
Although that revision is, in my view, the key difference between the bill I have introduced and last year's version, I should also point out a second change. S. 758 omits a provision that would alter the language in those sections of the Lobbying Disclosure Act (the `LDA') requiring LDA registrants to identify certain foreign entities that have an interest in the outcome of their lobbying activities. As it stands now, the LDA provides that registrants need to identify foreign entities that have a direct interest in their lobbying. The provision in last year's House-passed bill and which is not included in S. 758 would have added the word `significant' to that phrase. Under that provision, registrants would have to disclose foreign subsidiaries only if they have a significant direct interest in the lobbying. 
In my view, changing direct interest to significant direct interest would be counterproductive, especially since the provision in question does not define what the word `significant' means in this context. At what point does a direct interest become a significant direct interest? If foreign entities have a direct interest in the lobbying of a registrant, but the registrant insists that interest is not significant, how can we judge that contention? In the absence of clear answers to those questions, I believe the provision I have omitted could weaken the LDA. By introducing an element of vagueness into the act's language, it could undercut the act's ability to fulfill the information-gathering function that we had in mind when we passed it. 
As I emphasized in my initial statement, my purpose in introducing this technical amendments bill is to make the LDA even more useful than it is now. I do not want to do anything to weaken the act, and S. 758 is shaped in accordance with that guiding principle.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, H.R. 1122 would seek to ban a particular medical procedure, the intact D&X procedure. I believe we cross a dangerous threshold when we seek to legislate which particular medical procedures may be used, and which may not be used, by physicians. Dedicated doctors and nurses, through official statements of their associations, urge us not to adopt H.R. 1122, and not to politicize this issue. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization representing 38,000 physicians whose lives are dedicated to bringing babies into the world and keeping them and their mothers safe, issued a policy statement on January 12, 1997, relative to the bill before us which states that: 
An intact D&X may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting specified medical practices, such as intact D&X, may outlaw techniques that are critical to the lives and health of American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous.

Mr. LEVIN. The president of the American Medical Women's Association, Inc., in a March 10, 1997, letter, wrote the following on behalf of more than 10,000 women physicians and medical students nationwide, 
I would like to register our strong opposition to . . . [S. 6], which seek(s) to outlaw intact D&E. . . .We do not believe that the federal government should dictate the decisions of physicians and feel that passage of this legislation would in effect prescribe the medical procedures to be used by physicians rather than allow physicians to use their medical judgment in determining the most appropriate treatment for their patients. The passage of this legislation would set a dangerous precedent--undermining the ability of physicians to make medical decisions. It is medical professionals, not the President or Congress, who should determine appropriate medical options.

Mr. LEVIN. The Executive Director of the American Nurses Association, wrote to me in November, 1995, and stated: 
It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care provider. ANA has long supported freedom of choice and equitable access of all women to basic health services, including services related to reproductive health. This legislation would impose a significant barrier to those principles. 
It is inappropriate for Congress to mandate a course of action for a woman who is already faced with an intensely personal and difficult decision. This procedure can mean the difference between life and death for a woman. 
The American Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization representing the nation's 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 constituent associations. ANA advances the nursing profession by fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the economic and general welfare of nurses in the workplace, projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and by lobbying the Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting nurses and the public.

Mr. LEVIN. I have other concerns with this bill as well. For example, while banning one abortion procedure, this bill leaves legal other abortion procedures which can be used, procedures which are just as destructive to the fetus but which could be less safe for the mother. 
The Supreme Court has held that States may not ban pre-viability abortions but may ban post-viability abortions except when necessary to protect a woman's life or health. The bill under consideration would ban certain pre-viability abortions, and it does not allow for an exception required by the Supreme Court to preserve a woman's health relative to post-viability abortions. 
Mr. President, in summary, the bill before us ignores the strong advice of the specialists and nurses acting officially through their associations. The bill before us violates Supreme Court opinions. The bill would risk the health of a mother while not preventing one abortion. We are usurping in this bill medical judgments relative to individual women, in perhaps the most dire and tragic circumstances they will ever face. This is not the way legislators should create crimes.

Hon. Trent Lott, Senate Majority Leader Washington, DC 
Dear Senator Lott: In light of the slight modifications being proposed to HR 1122, the `Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997,' we wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate our opposition to this legislation. Our statement on this issue is attached. 
Sincerely, 
Ralph W. Hale, MD, Executive Director. 
Exhibit 2 AMERICAN MEDICAL WOMEN'S

Hon. Rick Santorum, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Santorum: On behalf of the American Medical Women's Association (AMWA), I would like to reiterate our opposition to H.R. 1122, the so-called `Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997,' as amended. AMWA does not endorse legislation which interferes with medical decisionmaking, particularly when it fails to consider the health of the woman patient. 
Our opposition to this legislation is based on the following issues. First, we are gravely concerned that this legislation does not protect a women's physical and mental health, including future fertility, or consider other pertinent issues such as fetal abnormalities. Second, this legislation would further erode physician-patient autonomy forcing physicians to always avoid legislatively prohibited procedures in medical decisionmaking, including in emergency situations when physicians and patients must base their decisions on the best available information available to them. Third, medical care decisions must be left to the judgment of a woman and her physician without fear of civil action or criminal prosecution. We do not support the levying of civil and criminal penalties for care provided in the best interest of the women patient. 
AMWA remains committed to ensuring that physicians retain authority to make medical and surgical care decisions that are in the best interest of their patients given the information available to them. 
Sincerely, 
Debra R. Judelson, MD, President.

Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to reiterate the opposition of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1122, the `Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997', which is being considered by the Senate this week. This legislation would impose Federal criminal penalties and provide for civil actions against health care providers who perform certain late-term abortions. * * * * *

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Lobbying Disclosure Technical Amendments Act of 1997. Last year, Congressmen Charles Canady and Barney Frank sponsored a similar piece of legislation and moved it through the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, a last minute dispute over one of the provisions precluded the Senate from passing the bill and sending it to the President for signature. The bill I am introducing today contains all but one of the key elements of the bill passed by the House last year; the provision that was problematic to some Members of the Senate has been omitted. I hope that the Senate will act expeditiously to pass this revised bill, so that we can clear up the technical issues identified by our colleagues on the House side in the last Congress. 
Mr. President, just 2 years ago, Congress enacted the Lobbying Disclosure Act [LDA], the first substantive reform in the laws governing lobbying disclosure in 50 years. The LDA was designed to overhaul our lobbying disclosure statutes and plug the glaring loopholes in those laws. Lobbying of congressional staff is no longer exempt; lobbying of executive branch officials is no longer exempt; lobbying on nonlegislative issues is no longer exempt; and the much-abused primary purpose test has been eliminated. For the first time ever, 
all paid, professional lobbyists are required to disclose who is paying them how much to lobby Congress and the executive branch on what issues. 
At the same time, the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act made the lobbying disclosure laws more understandable and easier to comply with by providing clear, sensible disclosure rules; establishing sensible de minimis requirements; eliminating duplicative and overlapping disclosure requirements; replacing quarterly reports with semi-annual reports; authorizing the development of computer-filing systems; requiring a single registration by each organization whose employees lobby instead of separate registrations by each employee-lobbyist; requiring good-faith estimates of total, bottom-line lobbying expenditures; and allowing entities that are already required to account for lobbying expenditures under the Internal Revenue Code to use data collected for the IRS for disclosure purposes as well. Detailed guidance provided by the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives have also helped provide clear lines as to who is required to register and what must be disclosed. I would like to commend the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives for the tremendous job that they have done in developing guidance, communicating with the public, and handling huge quantities of new information, with almost no lead time to prepare. 
There is already substantial evidence that this reform is working. Preliminary reports indicate that the number of organizations and individuals registered under the new law in the first year was almost triple the number of organizations and individuals registered a year earlier, under the old law. Reporting of lobbying expenditures appears to have increased to an even greater degree and may now be as much as a billion dollars a year. The new lobbying disclosure forms not only contain more accurate information than the old forms, they also convey it in a manner that is far more readable and easier to understand. As a result, the public is getting a far more accurate picture than ever before of what issues are being lobbied, who is lobbying them, and how much is being spent. 
I remain disappointed that the Lobbying Disclosure Act does not cover paid efforts by professional lobbyists to stimulate grassroots lobbying--so-called astroturf lobbying--and I would like to see faster progress in the development of computer filing systems and automated data bases to make filing easier and lobbying information more accessible. But already, in just 1 year, we have made huge progress in shining the light of public disclosure on the lobbying industry. 
The legislation now before us would make minor adjustments to the LDA, to ensure that the law continues to operate as intended. In particular, the bill would: 
Clarify the definition of a `covered executive branch official' under the LDA; 
Clarify that any communication compelled by a federal contract, grant, loan, permit or license is not considered to be a lobbying contact; 
Clarify that the official representatives of international groups such as NATO and the United Nations are public officials who are not required to register as lobbyists; 
Clarify how estimates of lobbying income and expenditures may be made on the basis of the tax reporting system; 
Clarify that organizations lobbying on behalf of foreign commercial entities should register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, even if they engage in only de minimis lobbying; and 
Make a conforming change to the terminology of the Foreign Agents Registration Act which was inadvertently omitted in the LDA. 
Mr. President, the most significant provision of this bill addresses the coordination of IRS and LDA reporting requirements for companies and organizations that are required to report to the IRS in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code [IRC]. The IRC's definition of `lobbying' is different that the one contained in the LDA. 
The IRC's definition of lobbying encompasses the local, State and Federal levels. The LDA's definition is limited to the Federal level. 
The IRC's definition covers lobbying only on legislative issues. The LDA's definition includes non-legislative lobbying as well. 
Because Congress did not want to require entities that lobby to keep two sets of books on their lobbying activities, the Lobbying Disclosure Act permits entities that are subject to IRS lobbying requirements to use the IRS definitions in lieu of the LDA definitions in regard to several LDA reporting requirements: the dollar amounts spent on lobbying activities, whether there has been a contact that triggers reporting, and the 20-percent test for determining who is a lobbyist. As for the requirement to report who was lobbied and the issues that were the subject of the lobbying, the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House have interpreted the Lobbying Disclosure Act to require that reporting be done in accordance with the LDA definition of lobbying. 
The LDA provisions authorizing entities to use, for LDA purposes, the same information they submit to the IRS make sense, as far as they apply to the reporting of dollar amounts. However, the application of these provisions to other aspects of lobbying leads to confusing results--most notably in connection with the triggering contacts and calculating whether an individual has crossed the 20-percent line and therefore is required to register as a lobbyist. When registrants are allowed to use 
IRS definitions in these situations, they may be required to list their State and local government lobbyists--since the IRS definition includes State and local lobbying--but not all of their Federal Government lobbyists, since the IRS definition excludes lobbying Congress on nonlegislative matters. In other words, we get both too much information and too little. The intent of the Lobbying Disclosure Act is to provide a full picture of lobbying on the Federal level without being overly burdensome. That means we don't need to know about State and local lobbyists, but we do need to know about lobbying of Congress on legislative and nonlegislative matters. 
This bill would continue to allow registrants subject to the IRS lobbying requirements to apply the IRS definition of lobbying activities to the requirement under the LDA for reporting the amount of money spent on lobbying activities. At the same time, it would address the problem caused by applying IRS definitions for other purposes. In particular, the bill would: 
First, require the application of the LDA definition with respect to legislative branch lobbying for the determination of contacts, the application of the 20 percent test, and the reporting of who was lobbied and on what issues. 
Second, allow such registrants to use the IRS definition with respect to executive branch lobbying for these same reporting requirements. This approach would produce more useful information, while reducing the problem of tracking lobbying to two different definitions by allowing lobbyists to follow IRS definitions in regard to executive branch lobbying. 
Mr. President, when we passed the Lobbying Disclosure Act 2 years ago, we had a clear goal in mind: We wanted to get a full overview of Federal level lobbying. The bill I am introducing today is designed to ensure that the act achieves that goal in the most effective manner without imposing an undue burden on the registrants. The Lobbying Disclosure Act has already proved its worth. This technical amendments bill will, through a few commonsense corrections, make the LDA even more useful.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to reaffirm the Federal recognition of the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. This legislation will reestablish the government-to-government relations of the United States and the Burt Lake Band. This is the same legislation which I introduced last Congress and which was originally introduced in the 103d Congress by my friend and colleague, Senator Donald Riegle. 
Federal recognition for Burt Lake is vitally important for a variety of reasons. With this process completed the Band can move on to the tasks of improving the economic and social welfare of its people. More important however, passage of this legislation will clarify that the Burt Lake Band is a historically independent tribe. 
The Band is named after Burt Lake, a small inland lake about 20 miles south of the straits of Mackinac. The Band already had deep roots in the area when a surveyor named Burt inspected the area in 1840. During the 1800's, the Burt Lake Band was a signatory to several Federal treaties, including the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit. These treaties were enacted for the purpose of securing territory for settlement and development. 
During the mid-1800's, the Federal Government turned over to the State of Michigan annuity moneys on the Band's behalf in order to purchase land. This land was later lost by the Band through tax sales, although trust land is nontaxable. The Band was subsequently evicted from their village. In 1911, the Federal Government brought a claim on behalf of Burt Lake against the State of Michigan. The autonomous existence of the Band at this stage is clear. 
Although the Band has never had its Federal status legally terminated, the Bureau of Indian Affairs since the 1930's has not accorded the Band that status nor treated the Band as a federally recognized tribe. The Burt Lake Band, as well as the other tribes located in Michigan's lower peninsula were improperly denied the right to reorganize under the terms of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 even though they were deemed eligible to do so by the Indian Service at that time.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride and pleasure that I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to President Clinton's proclamation designating May 11-18, 1997, as Jewish Heritage Week. 
Jewish Heritage Week was initiated in 1976 by the Jewish Community Relations Council to celebrate the significant contributions Jewish people have made to American history and culture. It is observed every spring, during the season in which Jewish people commemorate Passover, Yom Hashoah (Holocaust Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel Independence Day). In my home State of Michigan, a number of displays celebrating the week are on display in libraries in Oakland County on the theme `These Jewish Americans Have Made This Country and the World a Better Place.' The achievements of notable Jewish-Americans are highlighted, such as Dr. Jonas Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine, Nathan Straus, who introduced pasteurized milk in America, movie legends Samuel Goldwyn and Steven Spielberg, Nobel prize winners Henry Kissinger and Saul Bellow, and musical giants George Gershwin and Irving Berlin, among many others. 
I would like to recognize the efforts of the artists and organizers of these exhibits, who have helped to bring the spirit of Jewish Heritage Week to Michigan. They include Ann Barnett, Maynard Feldman, Howard Fridson, Julian Lefkowitz, Helen Naimark, and Sara Schiff. 
In his proclamation last year, the President eloquently stated that `Jewish-Americans have infused our Nation with a powerful faith, a commitment to family and community, and a devotion to scholarship and self-improvement. We can draw strength and inspiration from the enduring lessons of Judaism and it is entirely fitting that we honor the great traditions of its followers.' I hope my colleagues will join me and the millions of others who are celebrating the achievements of Jewish-Americans during Jewish Heritage Week.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware. 
First, let me congratulate the Senators from North Carolina and Delaware, the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, for working together so speedily and quickly to bring this treaty to the floor. It is a real feat. It is difficult to do this in this length of time. The kind of bipartisan cooperation that this takes really, I think, reflects great honor on this body. 
There is one condition that I have some difficulty with that I want to address some remarks to this afternoon, and that is condition 9, which is now part of the resolution before the Senate. 
Condition 9 requires the President to submit to the Senate for its advice and consent the memorandum of understanding concerning successor states to the ABM Treaty. In my view, this condition is probably unconstitutional but certainly unwise. As a general rule, a condition on a resolution of ratification is a stipulation which the President must accept before proceeding to ratification of a treaty. And if the President finds the condition unacceptable, he generally has but one choice, which is to refuse to ratify the treaty. There is, however, a generally recognized exception: If the condition is inconsistent with or invades the President's constitutional powers, in which case the condition would be ineffective and of no consequence. The restatement of foreign relations law puts the matter this way: 
The Senate has not made a practice of attaching conditions unrelated to the treaty before it. If the Senate were to do so and were to attach a condition invading the President's constitutional powers, for example, his power of appointment, the condition would be ineffective. The President would then have to decide whether he could assume that the Senate would have given its consent without the condition. 
In this matter before us, condition 9 has no relation to the CFE flank agreement. The condition, therefore, on that ground is improper. It seeks to invade the President's constitutional powers to recognize states and to implement treaties, and thus is probably unconstitutional. 
When the Senate deals with the important issue of advice and consent to a treaty, I think it should limit itself to the treaty before it. When we go beyond that, it seems to me we do not bring honor on this institution, when we try to force the hand of the President in areas beyond the immediate treaty that is being considered. 
In a very ironic twist, condition 9 could imperil the continued viability of the treaty that we are ratifying because if the ABM Treaty, when it is multilateralized, needs to come back for ratification, the same principle would apply to other treaties, of which we have dozens. The same principle, if it applies to ABM, would apply to CFE, the treaty before us. 
Is this treaty binding on those other states, those other successor states of the Soviet Union without coming back to the Senate? INF, START I, probably dozens of treaties with the former Soviet Union which have been multilateralized, which have been accepted by the successor states, which we now, I hope, consider binding on those States and on us, even though they have not been brought back to the Senate for ratification, if the logic of condition 9 is correct, it would undermine the viability, the efficacy of those other treaties that we had with the former Soviet Union. It would call into question treaties that I do not believe this body wants to call into question. 
The reason that it does that is that condition 9 requires the President to submit to the Senate for its advice and consent his recognition of the Soviet Union successor states to the ABM Treaty. It does provide an opportunity for opponents of the ABM Treaty to try to defeat that memorandum of understanding as it relates to the successor states. But in doing so, it jeopardizes the continuing viability of the acceptance by those successor states of their obligations under the ABM Treaty and, in terms of the point I am making, their obligations under a number of other treaties which have been signed by the former Soviet Union. 
This outcome could undermine the reductions of former Soviet nuclear weapons that our military has testified are so clearly in our national security interests. Opponents of having successor states other than Russia appear to worry about the potential difficulty of negotiating changes or amendments to the ABM Treaty in order to permit deployment of a national missile defense system in the future. Their notion appears to be that while it may be straightforward for us to negotiate required changes with Russia, it will somehow be more difficult to get the other three successor states to agree to any changes. And according to that view, rather than to give each of the other three states a potential veto over changes to the ABM Treaty, it would be better to prevent those successor states from ever joining the ABM Treaty as a party. 
That is what this condition is all about, but it is misguided from a number of perspectives. First, the notion that Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakstan would obstruct any changes to the ABM Treaty but that somehow Russia would be an easier negotiating partner flies in the face of experience. In the negotiations at the Standing Consultative Commission, it is Russia that has been the most challenging negotiating partner, while Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus have been more amenable to American proposals. 
Furthermore, as the administration has pointed out on many occasions, if the United States determines that there is the threat that requires us to deploy a national missile defense system that would conflict with the ABM Treaty, they would seek to negotiate changes with our treaty partners to permit such a deployment. We would seek to adapt the treaty to our security requirements. But if the Russians would not agree to our proposed changes, then the administration would consider whether to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, as is our right under the treaty's provisions relating to our supreme national interests. That is the prudent approach and the one that best serves our security. 
Let me just give one other example of the implication of this condition. In 1995, the United States recognized Ukraine as a successor to the former Soviet Union for 35 nonarmed control treaties that we previously had with the U.S.S.R. 
We did this without a Senate vote. So now we presumably want the Ukraine to be bound by 35 treaties previously negotiated. But there is no Senate vote ratifying that treaty with Ukraine. 
In a diplomatic note from the United States Embassy to the Government of Ukraine dated May 10, 1995, the United States listed the 35 agreements that have continued in force with Ukraine and they include such treaties as the incidents at sea agreement of 1972 with its protocol, which our good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, negotiated when he was Secretary of the Navy. They included the prevention of dangerous military activities agreement of 1989, which is designed to prevent an accident or mistake from erupting into hostilities. These are extremely important agreements and we should not put those agreements in limbo, or in doubt, by setting this precedent relative to the ABM Treaty.

Mr. LEVIN. If the logic of condition 9 were extended to Ukraine, all those 35 treaties would be in limbo until we ratified the succession of the treaties. And this list of treaties is just one case of the 12 successor states to the former Soviet Union. Condition 9 could cast into doubt the effect of all of those treaties for all of those states. 
I think the aim here, while it is aimed at ABM, does not hit ABM because our ABM Treaty is not touched by this condition. Our treaty relative to ABM, with Russia, is not affected by condition 9. Condition 9 does not refer to Russia. It is the other states that it refers to. So our ABM Treaty with Russia is not affected. It is all the other treaties which are undermined, with all the other successor states. It is the arms control treaties and the nonarms control treaties which are put in jeopardy, left in limbo by the logic of this condition. So, while the aim is at the ABM Treaty, it misses that and, instead, hits treaties that I believe this body wants to be binding on the successor states to the Soviet Union. 
What about the treaty before us, the CFE Treaty? Does this have to be ratified with each of the successor states to the Soviet Union? If so, we are putting this very treaty in limbo. This very CFE Treaty which we are ratifying, by the logic of condition 9, is left in limbo as to the other successor states, because there is no ratification of this treaty relative to the other states. 
Mr. President, I fail to understand the logic of the supporters of condition 9 that appears to say that Russia is a successor state to the former Soviet Union but the other states of the former Soviet Union can only become successor states if the Senate ratifies that action. If the Senate must ratify the succession of one state, then logically it should ratify the succession of all. Thus this condition would cast into doubt the continuing validity of Russia's obligations under the numerous treaties that the United States had entered into with the Soviet Union but which were not submitted to the Senate for ratification subsequent to the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
And it could cast into similar doubt other treaties with other countries that have dissolved, such as former Czechoslovakia, or former Yugoslavia, where the Senate has not ratified the succession of states to those treaties. 
We should also consider the impact of condition 9 on other arms control agreements which successor states to the former Soviet Union have joined. Since we are considering the resolution of ratification for the CFE Flank Agreement, let us start with the underlying CFE Treaty. It was ratified by the Senate in November 1991, prior to the accession of successor states based on the Oslo document in June of 1992. In other words, it was after the Senate voted for ratification of the CFE Treaty that the former successor states agreed on the arrangement for joining the CFE Treaty. 
The precedent that condition 9 would set would, if followed in other cases, call into question whether those states are considered members of and bound by the CFE Treaty until the Senate votes on their succession to the treaty. 
There is also the case of the intermediate-range nuclear forces, or INF, Treaty signed between the United States and USSR. When the Soviet Union dissolved into 12 successor states, 6 of those states had INF facilities on their soil while the other 6 did not. All twelve are successors to the INF Treaty, with six having obligations related to their INF facilities and the other six having the obligation not to have such facilities or INF missiles. 
The logic of condition 9 would suggest that the successor states are not parties to, or bound by, the INF Treaty unless and until the Senate provides its advice and consent to their accession. I cannot imagine any Member of the Senate wanting to cast doubt on the obligation of these states to comply with the INF Treaty, but that is what condition 9 does when its logic extended to other treaties. 
In a June 11, 1996, letter, then-Secretary of Defense William Perry explained the Defense Department's concerns with a proposed provision of law that was essentially the same as condition 9: 
. . . this section runs counter to the successful U.S. policy of involving within the framework of strategic stability all states which emerged from the former Soviet Union with nuclear weapons on their territory. Moreover, Russia, Belarus, Kazakstan, and Ukraine perceive a clear link between their participation in the START and INF Treaties and the ABM Treaty. Casting doubt on their ability to be equal partners in the ABM Treaty could poison our overall relationship with these states and needlessly jeopardize their compliance with their denuclearization obligations under START I. 
The logic of condition 9, when extended to other treaties, could well lead the successor states to the former Soviet Union to reconsider whether they are bound by these treaties as well as the ABM Treaty. Such a move would be decidedly against our security interests. 
I should point out, Mr. President, that the Congress itself urged the President to discuss ABM Treaty issues `with Russia and other successor states of the former Soviet Union' in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. At that time there was no question that there were other successor states to the former Soviet Union with whom we would want to 
discuss possible changes to the ABM Treaty. Section 232(c) of that Act states: 
Congress urges the President to pursue immediate discussions with Russia and other successor states of the former Soviet Union, as appropriate, on the feasibility of, and mutual interest in, amendments to the ABM Treaty to permit-- 
clarification of the distinctions for the purposes for the purposes of the ABM Treaty between theater missile defenses and anti-ballistic missile defenses . . . 
I find it strange that the Senate, after urging the President to discuss the ABM Treaty with Russia and other successor states to the former Soviet Union on demarcation, now would call into question whether there are other successor states to the ABM Treaty without a Senate ratification. 
If a treaty must be submitted to the Senate for ratification of successors to the former Soviet Union, or other countries, before it is binding, then hundreds of our treaty commitments are in doubt. All of this is because opponents of the ABM Treaty are trying to maim or kill this one treaty. 
Additionally, we should consider the impact of accepting condition 9 on other parliaments in other nations that may take this signal as an invitation for them to reconsider their nation's treaty commitments. I find it ironic that on an act of treaty ratification the Senate is on the verge of creating a potential international treaty uncertainty. 
There is no need for the Senate to drag in the ABM Treaty issue on the CFE Flank Agreement resolution of ratification. The Senate will have ample opportunity to debate the ABM Treaty when the administration submits the ABM demarcation agreement to the Senate, as they have committed to do. But this is neither the time nor the vehicle to try to decide this issue. 
Furthermore, this issue of the memorandum of understanding on successor states to the ABM Treaty is already connected to Senate consideration on the demarcation agreement. The text of the demarcation agreement states that the MOU on successor states will not go into effect until the Agreed Statement on Demarcation goes into effect. So in effect, the MOU cannot take effect until the Senate votes on the demarcation agreement. Consequently there is no need for this condition and it should not be included in this resolution of ratification. 
Mr. President, thankfully, condition 9 is limited to the memorandum of understanding concerning successor states to the ABM Treaty. It is my fervent hope and expectation that the President will make clear in his signing statement for the CFE Flank Agreement that this extraordinary action is not a precedent. In that way he can limit the damage that could otherwise flow from this unwise condition. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that condition 5(f) dealing with potential violations of the CFE Treaty in the Caucasus region has been modified. I would have much preferred that it not make any reference to any particular country. 
More importantly, I am very concerned with the word `secessionist' in condition 5(f). The situation in this troubled area has a long and unfortunate history, and I am disturbed that this condition would seek to so characterize a conflict there.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in determining the distribution to the States of fiscal year 1996 highway trust fund money, a miscalculation resulted in some States getting obligation authority that was subsequently taken away or adjusted by the Treasury pursuant to ISTEA. The miscalculation also prevented another category of States from getting their full share according to ISTEA. These 10 States' shares could not be adjusted administratively. 
In the fiscal year 1996 supplemental appropriations bill before us, there are funds for both those categories of States. The former is provided $318 million and the latter $139 million. 
However, the committee has also added an additional category, $475 million for States that feel they need to be made whole or have their fiscal year 1997 obligation authority kept at the same level as it was in fiscal year 1996. The reason that these States' fiscal year 1997 obligation authority level changed from fiscal year 1997 was the 90 percent of payments equity adjustment that is part of ISTEA. This equity adjustment reduced the amount available to donee States and increased the amount available to donor States in fiscal year 1997. 
The hard fought agreement that resulted in ISTEA in 1991 was an incremental improvement for the donor States. The 90 percent of payments equity adjustment was an important component of that guaranteed increase in our return. Now, some States want to rewrite ISTEA through this appropriations bill, so they can be made whole, and perpetuate the unfairness that has existed for decades. The donor States are the ones that should be made whole, rather than continuing to transfer over $1 billion annually to the donee States. We should reject this effort to overturn the last year of ISTEA. 
The fair way to settle this matter is to support the Warner amendment. Provide the $139 million to the States that actually lost obligation authority as a result of the Treasury miscalculation, and distribute the remaining funds according to the existing rules for fiscal year 1997. Though the ISTEA formula for distributing those dollars is still unfair to the donor States, it is marginally better than what is provided under this bill.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we should be signaling two things relative to Bosnia, in my judgment. The first is what this resolution would signal, which is that it is our intent to have our ground combat forces out of Bosnia by June of next year. It is important that we send that signal; it is important that we send that signal clearly. But it is also important that we do an additional thing, and that is that we let our European allies and the world know that in the event that there is a need for a follow-on force after June of 1998, that it is the Europeans who must provide that follow-on force and it is not our intention to participate with ground troops in that follow-on force. 
Will a follow-on force be necessary? I think it will be. I have visited Bosnia. I have spent a lot of time there. In my judgment, there is no way that millions of refugees can be repatriated to their homes, that war criminals can be captured and tried by June of next year. If there is no follow-on force in Bosnia, the likelihood is that the progress which has been made will disintegrate and will evaporate, and then what we have done in Bosnia will have been to no avail. 
We have accomplished some very important things in Bosnia, and we should try, if we can, to protect them, but--and here I agree with the Senator from Wisconsin--we should carry out our mission, which ends in June of 1998, signal to our allies clearly and tell them in advance that it is our intention that our ground combat forces will be out of there in June of 1998, but that we would expect that they would show some leadership under a new component of NATO, called the European Security and Defense Identity, to provide the follow-on forces which might be needed after June of 1998. 
Can we do both of those at one time? Can we say that it is our intention that our own forces on the ground leave by June of 1998 but that we expect there is a need or a likely need for a follow-on force and we would be supportive of that force--without having our own troops on the ground--through logistics and intelligence and other means of supporting a European follow-on force as part of NATO? Can we signal both of those things at once? I believe we can. I believe we should. I believe this resolution does not do that, and that is the difficulty with this resolution. 
Because of the nature of postcloture that we are in, it is restricted in language to what it says, which, as the Senator from Alaska points out, really has no meaning whatsoever since none of these funds will be spent, in any event, after October 1 of 1997. They cannot be and are not going to be. 
So in one sense this resolution has no legislative meaning whatsoever, through no fault of my friend from Wisconsin, by the way. He had no choice. In order to be germane in a post-cloture situation, he had to phrase it this way. 
But the signal that he wishes to send is an important signal, one that I happen to want to join him in sending, providing it can be sent with a second signal which is so critical that we send, which is that a new initiative inside of NATO be utilized for any follow-on force, and we are willing to support that or at least are open to supporting that European initiative inside of NATO. 
I want to spend just a couple of moments on that initiative. It is not well known. It is an important initiative. The Europeans have asked for additional leadership in NATO for many, many years. 
Finally, at the June 1996 Berlin North Atlantic Council ministerial meeting, there was a new initiative adopted, as part of NATO. It is called the European Security and Defense Identity initiative [ESDI]. What it does, it permits the European NATO nations--these are our allies in NATO--with NATO consent, to carry out operations under the political control and strategic direction of the Western European Union, using NATO assets and NATO capabilities. 
So using NATO assets and capabilities under the strategic direction of the Western European Union, a European initiative is being put in place as we speak. 
What NATO has agreed to do is to identify the types of what are called separable but not separate capabilities, assets, headquarters, and command positions that would be required to command and conduct these Western European Union-led operations and which could be made available, subject to unanimous consent agreement in the North Atlantic Council. 
In addition, NATO agreed to develop appropriate multinational European command arrangements within NATO to command and conduct the Western European Union-led operations. 
And, finally, in support of these arrangements, NATO agreed to conduct, at the request of and in coordination with the Western European Union, military planning and exercises for illustrative missions which were identified by the Western European Union. Included in those missions are humanitarian assistance, conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement operations. All from peacekeeping to peace enforcement are included in the missions which are now being organized. 
The ability of our European allies to work together so professionally in Bosnia, with French and British commanders responsible for two of the three multinational division sectors and with the overall American commander having a multinational staff, convinces me that there is no reason to question the ability of a European-led follow-on force to succeed in Bosnia. There is no reason, either, why the Partnership for Peace nations should not be included as they have been in Bosnia in both IFOR and SFOR. 
So we have a mechanism now which is being planned to provide, or which could provide, to be more accurate, the follow-on force to be sure that peace does not unravel in the European neighborhood. The United States should remain involved with logistics, intelligence, and other support activities. But under this resolution there is no provision for that. 
This resolution, because of the way it had to be phrased, ends up saying that none of these funds can be obligated or expended for the activities of armed forces relating to Bosnia ground deployment. 
Well, should we not consider at least a provision of intelligence support, logistics support, other support activities for a European follow-on force? I think we ought to. 
During the Armed Services Committee hearing in February on the defense budget, Secretary Cohen responded to my questions by stating the following: 
I would agree with you that following our departure in June of 1998, I believe there has to be some sort of force in Bosnia. I do not think there is any possibility of ending so many decades, if not centuries, of ethnic conflict in a matter of two or three years. 
Secretary Cohen continued: 
So I think some international type of a force will be necessary. I agree with you that the ESDI, the so-called European Security and Defense Identity, is something that is very worthwhile to pursue. 
And he added: 
I think it is something we should pursue and make it very clear we are leaving and that something will have to replace it, and hopefully it will be something along the lines of the ESDI. 
That is a double message, not a single message. 
The amendment before us, regrettably, has the first of those two messages only and is not able to cover the second part of that message. That is the difficulty with the pending resolution, in my judgment. 
General Shalikashvili, who was there with Secretary Cohen, said the following: 
Following our departure in June 1998, it is very possible that a follow-on force will be required. I think a European force under the WEU is certainly an appropriate candidate for that. 
So he, too, reached the same kind of conclusion. 
So, Mr. President, I think that we should not at this time state in resolution form or any other form that we will not be willing to play a supporting role in Bosnia after June 1998. Because, after this operation is, hopefully, turned over to our NATO allies, assuming it continues at all, which I think is likely then acting under the Western European Union, they, I believe, will need this kind of support--not our combat forces on the ground--but those other kinds of support. And that is the complexity which is not reflected in this resolution. 
Finally, it is my intent during the consideration of the defense authorization bill to be offering language along the lines that I have just described. I hope that at that time we can have the kind of full debate on the future of our forces in Bosnia that this issue really requires. 
During the authorization bill, that debate can take into consideration both the need, in my judgment, to make the clear statement to our allies in Europe that it is our intent to be out of there in June 1998, but can also outline what we would be willing to do should they determine to stay on after June of 1998 in Bosnia. And while it is complex, it is essential. While it has two points to the message, both points are, nonetheless, essential. 
So I think, because this resolution is too narrow in its scope and sends only one of two messages and it is essential that both be sent simultaneously, that it would be a mistake for us to adopt this resolution at this time in this form. But I would look forward to my friend from Wisconsin working with us in the Armed Services Committee to design a resolution which does contain the message that he has in his amendment but also the second part of that message as well. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, next week Dr. Paul Kaminski will step down after an extraordinary 3-year tenure as Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. In this short period of time, Dr. Kaminski and his acquisition team at the Pentagon have made dramatic steps to turn our procurement culture around, making it more flexible, more creative, and smarter. 
Under Dr. Kaminski's leadership, the Department of Defense has successfully implemented three major pieces of acquisition reform legislation: Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Federal Acquisition Reform Act, and the Information Technology Management Reform Act. Those of us who worked hard to enact this legislation appreciate the energy that Dr. Kaminski and others have dedicated to putting it into practice. 
But the turnaround in the procurement culture has required far more than the implementation of new laws. Dr. Kaminski and his team have placed the Department of Defense at the forefront of acquisition reform by doing the hard work to revise and simplify thousands of military specifications, to implement streamlined management practices through integrated process teams and the single process initiative, and to make acquisition reform work where the rubber meets the road in tens of thousands of individual contracts awarded every year. 
Under Dr. Kaminski's leadership, the Department of Defense has substantially reduced acquisition lead times, reduced the layers of redtape that have often burdened the acquisition system, accelerated the process of incorporating emerging commercial technologies into weapons systems, and simplified the small purchases through the use of the IMPAC credit card. Most impressive of all, Dr. Kaminski has achieved all of this while skillfully managing a steep reduction in the size of the acquisition work force--the career professionals who have borne the brunt of implementing the new acquisition system. 
The Congress and the Nation owe Dr. Kaminski a debt of gratitude for his selfless service to the interests of the taxpayer and the national defense. I know my colleagues join me in wishing Paul all the best in the future.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the Kiwanis Club of Warren, MI, for its 40 years of service to the Warren community. 
In 1957, a group of concerned businesspeople, professionals, and citizens formed the Kiwanis Club of Warren to help meet the needs in their community which were not being addressed by government or charities. Since its beginning, the Warren Kiwanis has provided numerous services to people in need, including persons with disabilities, senior citizens, and people requiring medical care. The Warren Kiwanis donated a bus to the Salvation Army, funded a fitness trail at a local park for disabled people, and have helped to pay for thousands of operations, utility bills, and ramps for people with disabilities. 
The recent Presidents' Summit on Volunteerism drew the Nation's attention to the importance of giving back to our communities. The people of Warren, like those in so many communities throughout the country, are truly fortunate to dedicated Kiwanis Club members as their neighbors. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing congratulations and gratitude to the Kiwanis Club of Warren for their 40 years of good works.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of a remarkable group from my home State of Michigan. A team of students from Pontiac Central High School and engineers from Delphi Interior and Lighting Systems won two national awards at the prestigious FIRST [For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology] competition held April 10-12 in Orlando, FL. 
The Central/Delphi team received the tournament trophy as a finalist in the robotics competition, and the team also won the competition's highest honor, the Chairman's Award, given to the most comprehensive school-corporate partnership program among the 155 competitors. As Chairman's Award winners, the team will be honored by President Clinton at a Rose Garden reception. 
The Central/Delphi FIRST team helps to open young minds to science, mathematics, and technology. Pontiac Central students also have an opportunity to work at Delphi during the summer, which helps them continue learning outside of school and gain valuable on-the-job training. The innovative CADET program, an extension of Central/Delphi FIRST, uses unique activities to promote the fun of math, science and technology to students at seven elementary and junior high schools. As the presenter of the Chairman's Award said, `The judges believe that this team has turned many children on to science and math. Through their strong partnership, FIRST became the avenue for an entire school of talented students to reach personal success.' 
The success of the Central/Delphi team and the FIRST program in general is a powerful example of what educators and corporations can do to improve opportunities for our young men and women. I commend Delphi Interior and Lighting for their commitment to education. I am proud of the talented students who achieved so much at this prestigious competition. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the young men and women of Pontiac Central High School and the employees of Delphi Interior and Lighting for their achievements at the sixth annual FIRST competition.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, May 2, we will dedicate a memorial on the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park to one of America's greatest Presidents, a towering figure in the history of the 20th century, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
A memorial to FDR was first proposed in the Congress as early as 1946. The FDR Memorial Commission was finally established, by law, in 1955. It has taken 42 years to complete this effort. I am proud to have served on the Memorial Commission. Tomorrow, will be a great day for Americans, a day to look back and remember FDR, his enormous contribution to all of our lives and the contribution of the generation of Americans who struggled through the depression and valiantly defeated fascism; a day to admire the beauty and to be inspired by the art of this great new addition to our capital city's memorials; and a day to contemplate America's future and the contribution that this memorial will make to the understanding that future generations will have of one of the most critical eras of our history. 
This memorial is a expression of what America is all about. It is what America can do to overcome challenges of depression and war. Roosevelt imbued hope and he instilled optimism in a people who were down and out in a depression and then attacked when we were down, by Japan at Pearl Harbor. 
Franklin Roosevelt was an inspirational leader because of his optimism in the face of the long odds our Nation faced. He was our voice. He reflected our hopes. He continues to inspire us today because he showed what we can do when we pull together as a people. And, this new memorial will help to keep FDR's legacy inspiring Americans for the centuries ahead. 
Roosevelt saw the positive role of Government in the economy, pulling us out of the depression and in times of a world war, when we had to pull together. But he was also willing to experiment. He was not somebody who would hang onto a program if it wasn't working. He believed that Government programs could make a positive difference. And they did for millions. But he also believed that if Government programs were not working that we should either make them work or drop them. This is a model we would do well to keep in mind in the weeks, and the years ahead as Congress grapples with the difficult problems of balancing the needs of people, and the role of Government in addressing those needs with the demands of fiscal responsibility. 
The memorial will also honor the memory and contributions of the First Lady who as the eyes and ears of the President traveled hundreds of thousands of miles visiting Americans in every walk of life. 
Mr. President, I want to mention a few of my own memories of F.D.R. During the Roosevelt years, I was a young boy, but I can clearly remember the strength of his voice in those fireside chats. And I remember the conversation around the family's dinner table about what a great leader he was. 
I remember scouting the streets for discarded empty cigarette packs. This was something kids did. We stripped off the tin foil linings and brought them to school where they were rolled together to create large balls of the metal, which could be recycled for the war effort. This gave us an enormous sense of being a part of the effort and of responding to Roosevelt's call for participation. 
And, I remember his dog, Fala. Especially for a young boy Fala was a big part of the Roosevelt persona. That's why, when I noted the fact that his dog, which meant so much to him and to the Nation, which was such a symbol of his warmth and humanity, was left out of the monument, I suggested Fala be represented in the memorial and the commission agreed. So, tomorrow as the statues of Franklin and of Eleanor are unveiled, a little statue of Fala, recognizing his historic role, will also be there as well, helping to connect FDR to future generations of visitors, especially our kids and grandkids. 
Mr. President, now I would like to honor the memory of this great American President by reading some of the anecdotes and sentiments of people from Michigan, where he is well remembered by seniors and veterans, and even by many who know him only from film and audio tape, but remembered with reverence and often with at least one tear in the eye. 
I have asked my constituents in Michigan to send to me some of their remembrances of FDR. I have received many moving and inspiring stories. I want to share some of those with my colleagues in the Senate today.  
Michigan Remembers F.D.R. 
Back in the 1920's, my father Alfred Angeli and a number of his friends came over to this country to escape the Fascism and Communism in Italy. They found a new life here in America and they adored Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They had great respect for him for the job he did in creating jobs and putting everybody back to work. 
My father and about eight of his friends were very serious in their respect for FDR, and honored him by naming their hunting camp 'Campobello'. It was a very sad day when the great man died. * * * My parents, who are now gone, would be very proud to know they are taking part in this tribute to Mr. Roosevelt: Mike Angeli, Marquette, Michigan. 
About ten years ago, I appeared before the county board to obtain approval for a grant to fund a senior citizens feeding program. The chairman of the board got very upset calling me something like `a big spending-liberal-government interferer * * * (like FDR)'. I told him I'm not old enough to have served with President Roosevelt, but that he is an idol of mine and that I was extremely honored to have been put in the same category: Ron Calery, Chippewa-Mackinac-Luce Community, Action Agency Director, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. 
When FDR ran, the stock market had crashed and times were tough. There were no jobs and no money. Hoover ran on a platform of `a chicken in every pot', but people wanted a job. Roosevelt won in a landslide, after he said he would put people back to work. He did just that. 
Everyone had bills, and few people had the money to pay them. So a situation was created where people could work off their bills. If you had to go to the hospital while on welfare, you worked the bill off with the city by sweeping streets or picking up trash or cleaning the parks. Each time you worked, you would reduce your bill. Though there were years we didn't have two nickels to rub together, we survived: Arthur Carron, Bark River, Michigan. 
FDR literally transformed the country from a feeling of overwhelming despair to hope and confidence. When Roosevelt was elected I was approaching my 16th birthday. On the west side of Detroit in a neighborhood of autoworkers practically everyone was jobless. The giant Ford Rouge plant was working at 25 percent of capacity. Other auto companies and all of the auto supplier companies were in a similar situation. My father and the fathers of all my boyhood friends were unemployed. Men who were really willing and anxious to work. There was a feeling of desperation and hopelessness. Most important of all they lost their sense of dignity when they could not provide for their families. Roosevelt, through the various governmental programs, gave these men hope and a sense of well being they had not experienced for some time: Doug Fraser, Professor of Labor Studies, Wayne State U., Former President of U.A.W., Northville, Michigan. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, `A man's mind stretched by a new idea, will never return to its former dimension.' I was one of those fortunate unemployed young men who joined with over three million other destitute kids and signed up with the Civilian Conservation Corps. 
It seems that FDR scratched out his C.C.C. idea on a restaurant napkin. This vision was an unprecedented gamble in bringing a bankrupt nation back on its feet. I was one of those three million who was lifted from the depths of despair, each given a chance to earn self-respect, dignity and self-esteem. How does a nation measure a dimension such as that? Just consider the families that these men represented, grateful for the monthly $25.00 and the succor it supplied. 
I can testify to that. Sixty-four years ago when men's spirits were tested by want and deprivation, it seems like only yesterday that I walked into that welfare office. I was not afraid of the hunger, but the indignity it caused. I felt not a pain in my stomach, but an ache in my heart. . .I was sworn into the C.C.C. Now, I was accepted, now I could say, `Hello to tomorrow'. I became a member of an idea whose time had come. Roosevelt's tree army: Rev. Bill Fraser, First V.P. National Assoc. of C.C.C. Alumni, Grayling, Michigan. 
My mother named me Franklin Delano Garrison in his honor. From the time I was a small child I took a great pride in being named for someone who was a hero to everyone I knew, even though at first I wasn't really sure why. Then I came to understand that my family was eating only because the New Deal was providing some food assistance, and my father was working only because the Works Progress Administration was providing jobs. I came to see for myself the hardships that the Depression had brought to the old, the hungry and the deserted--and to realize that one man had led the nation in providing not only sustenance but also hope where both had been lost: Franklin Delano Garrison, President, Michigan State AFL-CIO, Lansing, Michigan. 
I am very happy that President Roosevelt is finally having a memorial dedicated in his honor. I am 83 years old and lived through the Depression, and know how bad times were. Before the election of President Roosevelt, I worked on welfare for $2.00 a day for an eight hour shift. 
With President Roosevelt's election times got better. With the New Deal of the WPA, I got $22.00 a week for a four day six hour shift. I will always be grateful to President Roosevelt for social security, unemployment benefits and being able to unionize for better wages and benefits and to protect jobs. President Roosevelt will always be my idol: Rudy Gregorich, Painesdale, Michigan. 
We members of the Eighth Armored Division had been on the march, without a break, around the clock, for days--sometimes unopposed, in other places, held up by the familiar and bitter last-ditch Nazi resistance. 
At last, late one morning, a halt was signaled. We dropped--dirty, hungry, and almost unconscious--and slept, some in the ditches along the road, others stretched out on the rear decks of their tanks, others where they sat in tank turrets, in half tracks, or on truck seats. 
Then a startling message started down the line from the lead vehicle, which had a short-wave radio. Men, as they heard it, shook the next man awake and passed it on: President Roosevelt was dead. 
In a sense, President Roosevelt was a soldier in that fight--just like us. And like us, this good man was exhausted. He was a casualty of the war. But he had the satisfaction of knowing that he left the field with the battle well in hand: Jack R. Hendrickson, Ph.D., Birmingham, Michigan. 
The year may have been 1932, or 1934, and my mother a widow of some 60 years had been left well-provided for by my father at his death in 1931. But the Great Depression struck the USA and its economy was stagnant, mired down, seemingly unable to extricate itself from the doldrums it found itself caught in . . . 
It was a time of calamity, of no one knowing quite what to do. Mother had never experienced this type of emergency in her long life. There was little or no relief in sight. Radio broadcasts were discouraging and gave no hint of the end of the Depression in sight. My sister, married with three little ones, recalls walking three or more miles to obtain government free food and carrying it home, walking as she had come. 
The one light on the horizon in the midst of this gloom was the radio program when President Delano Roosevelt, elected a few months previously, would address the people in his famous fireside chats. His voice soothing, deep-textured, commanding confidence as he spoke words of optimism were most welcome by the bewildered public. `We have nothing to fear, except fear itself,' he said on one momentous occasion. How the people clung to his words bearing hope that this President of the United States instilled over the air. As someone noted sixty years later, FDR could not raise himself from a chair, but by moral strength was able to lift a great nation out of the Depression in the Thirties! All America hung onto his words, hung on to the confidence he instilled, in their government, in their country, awaiting with patience for the clouds of Depression to lift!--Dr. Marie Heyda, O.P., Grand Rapids Dominicans, Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
My younger sister was in the wars and had the honor of meeting President Roosevelt at his summer home. 
I feel that FDR was one of the greatest presidents that ever lived. Even though he was so educated, he still was for the average person. He did so much for the people while in office: Kathryn V. Holden, Saginaw, Michigan. 
* * * 1940. I was pregnant * * * and Newman, my husband, was working for Labor's Nonpartisan League in the office of the Philadelphia Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, 2000 South Street. 
Since I was not working and had no child care needs, I was a volunteer in the office, handing out literature at rallies and some house to house visiting in North Philly, in the Kensington area and a bit in South Philly. 
Our work culminated in a huge rally for the President in the stadium, shortly before the election. It was raining and my husband and friends did not think I should go. But I did, and it was the most impressive, exciting and largest rally I ever participated in. 
My labor came early, and daughter Sharon was born at St. Luke's Hospital November 3, the election was the next day * * * Since I had made no plans for an absentee ballot and there was no way I could get one of those days, I missed my opportunity to vote for the third term of FDR. The only time in my life I have failed to vote in an election either primary or general: Mildred Jeffrey, Detroit, Michigan. 
When the 73rd Congress opened * * * FDR bombarded Congress with bills to stimulate the economy. During his first month in office, he used his authority * * * to establish the Public Works Administration which helped my father while laid off from the railroad for about a year: Leonard Klemm, Saginaw, Michigan. 
President Roosevelt really left a great impact upon our country. He came into office at the time of the Great Depression and did much to relieve the suffering of the people and to restore confidence in our banking system and the Government in general. He won great respect through his fireside chats, radio connection and as the first President to address the nation on national television: B.L. Little, Saginaw, Michigan. 
I had only one personal encounter with President Roosevelt, but it is one I can recall quite vividly even today. * * * FDR had been campaigning for reelection that day in New England, but the end of the day had brought him to New York. By chance we saw his motorcade, which couldn't have been more than two or three cars. 
He rode in an open car, and I can still see him waving his hat and smiling as he passed by. He was an inspiration to me then and he continues to inspire me today: William G. Milliken, Former Michigan Governor, Traverse City, Michigan. 
I became aware that President Roosevelt was planning to recruit thousands of youths between ages 18 and 25 to serve in forestry camps throughout the nation to perform tasks, such as planting trees, building roads, erosion control, fighting forest fires, miles of fire trails and telephone lines strung, and other conservation related work. 
I had just turned 18 when I heard about the program, and at the time was a barber's apprentice in Cascade, Michigan * * * The Civilian Conservation Corps sounded like the answer to my situation, and I immediately made myself available. * * * 
After leaving the C.C.C. camps, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy * * * While assigned to the Sick Officer's Ward, I was attendant to then Secretary of the Navy, Claude Swanson. During that time President Roosevelt visited Swanson twice * * * This was a great honor for me to have the opportunity to stand close to the President of the United States. 
* * * Following a military career, I became involved in organizing a civilian conservation corps alumni group here in Grand Rapids, Michigan. * * * with the support of the C.C.C. Alumni veterans, was able to convince Governor Blanchard, and the state legislature, to establish a Michigan Civilian Conservation Corps patterned after Roosevelt's depression era C.C.C. program: Frank Munger, Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
My uncle, Billy Rogers, living in Chicago, was one of the many. No job, no money and dependent on the small income of his mother gave him little hope for the future. Thank God for the C.C.C.! They took him in--fed and clothed him, taught him the value of manual labor and gave him a sense of pride. Friendships made in camp endured for many years. 
Diligent work and a cheerful attitude earned him the most coveted job in camp: truck driver! After completing his enrollment, he returned to Chicago. Due to his experience, he was eligible to join the Teamsters Union and continued working as an over-the-road truck driver until he retired. All this due to the vision and persistence of one man--F.D.R.!--William Oberschmidt, Saginaw, Michigan. 
* * * on April 12, 1945. I was 13 years old at the time and I remember the nuns grieving at school and how sad everyone felt. It's about all anyone talked about or what you heard on the radio. 
I don't think I understood the full impact of what Roosevelt had accomplished until I was stationed in the Pacific during the Korean War. I spent time on many of the Pacific Islands where the war took place and it made me realize what he had done to guide us through the second World War * * *--Jack Salter, Royal Oak, Michigan. 
As a public official, I have given a lot of thought to the question of leadership. What is leadership and how does it manifest itself in public life? Although the answer to that question is far from clear or simple, it seems to be embodied in the memory of the person I consider our nation's greatest president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
My father was one of the millions who found themselves out of work after the Crash of 1929. He directly benefited from President Roosevelt's policies, taking part in the Civilian Conservation Corps. That program helped my dad get back on his feet, giving him, along with millions of others, hope and purpose at a time when both seemed in short supply. 
Years later, facing another crisis--World War II--President Roosevelt came to my hometown, Warren, to visit the tank plant that was then producing Sherman Tanks by the thousands. Moved by the sacrifice, commitment and ingenuity of the people of southeast Michigan working to ensure that Naziism was defeated, he dubbed that plant the `Arsenal of Democracy.' 
Now we in Warren are trying to follow his example, as we work to transform the recently abandoned tank plant into a new kind of arsenal: an arsenal for economic growth. As I go to work each day, I frequently ask myself what President Roosevelt would have done with today's issues. Looking at the future of his Arsenal for Democracy, I believe that FDR would be pleased: Mark A. Steenbergh, Mayor, City of Warren, Warren, Michigan. 
My father subscribed to the Chicago Tribune during the depression since it was the cheapest paper in town at two cents a copy. The Tribune had cartoonist by the name of `Orr'. His cartoon appeared on the front page of the Tribune and more often than not, his work of art was a slam against President Roosevelt. As it turned out, the subscription was a bad deal for my father, because my mother, being a staunch Democrat and a supporter of FDR, would wait for the mailman and promptly put the paper in the stove: James F. Sodergren, Marquette County Treasurer, Ishpeming, Michigan. 
I was a high school teacher during the Great Depression. According to my memory, the American people had great faith and believed that our President would do what was best for the `common good.' We listened carefully and with pride to his fireside chats. * * * 
And today, as we drive over miles of paved roads in northern Michigan, we marvel at the lines of majestic evergreens --so beautiful in summer and effective snow-barriers in winter! I relate with pride the work of the C.C.C., that group of younger men who earned their livelihood at that time by beautifying and preserving Michigan's natural environment. Roosevelt's foresight has kept Michigan a wonderful state!--Sister Agnes Thiel, O.P., Grand Rapids Dominicans, Grand Rapids, Michigan.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two notable religious leaders from my home State of Michigan, Rabbi Irwin Groner and Adam Cardinal Maida. Rabbi Groner and Cardinal Maida are the recipients of the 1997 Dove Award, sponsored by the Ecumenical Institute for Jewish-Christian Studies. 
The Dove Award was created in 1994 to recognize Christian and Jewish religious leaders who work to promote closer relationships between the two communities. I have worked closely with both men throughout my career, and have been grateful for their advice, guidance, and friendship. 
Rabbi Groner leads Congregation Shaarey Zedek in Southfield, MI. An internationally recognized spiritual leader, Rabbi Groner serves as the president of the Michigan Board of rabbis and is a member of the board of governors of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit and the Rabbinic Cabinet of the United Jewish Appeal. His writings on spiritual and social issues are published monthly in the Jewish News and appear regularly in periodicals of the Conservative Jewish Movement. From 1990 to 1992, Rabbi Groner served as the president of the Rabbinical Assembly, an international association of 1200 conservative rabbis. He was the first clergyman to be named to the Judicial Tenure Commission of Michigan. 
Adam Cardinal Maida arrived in Detroit in 1990 as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit. In 1990, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. Cardinal Maida has put commitment to youth into action by joining Baptist, Episcopalian, and Lutheran leaders in creating cornerstone schools, which offer interdenominational educational programs to children in Detroit. Cardinal Maida has continually attempted to break down the walls which exist in our society, emphasizing the importance of voluntarism, reaching out to Detroit's Hispanic community and working with political leaders to craft solutions to a number of social problems. 
In 1992, Rabbi Groner, Cardinal Maida, and Episcopal Bishop R. Stewart Wood founded the Religious Leaders Forum, which encourages Christian, Jewish, and Muslim leaders to share their views on issues of concern. Activities like this have not only provided Rabbi Groner and Cardinal Maida with opportunities to work together, but they have cemented a personal friendship as well. Together, they are building bridges for people of the Christian and Jewish faiths to cross. 
It is a real honor to recognize the achievements of these remarkable men. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Rabbi Irwin Groner and Adam Cardinal Maida as they receive the 1997 Dove Award from the Ecumenical Institute.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 82d anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Each year we remember and honor the victims and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to have in our midst. 
Approximately 1.5 million Armenians were killed under the Turkish Ottoman Empire during a 28-year period which lasted from 1894 to 1921. April 24, 1915, serves as a marking point for the government orchestrated carnage that took place. On this date, over 5,000 Armenians were systematically hunted down and killed in Constantinople, including some 600 Armenian political and intellectual leaders. 
History records that the world stood by, although it knew. Our Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, telegraphed the following message to the American Secretary of State on June 16, 1915: `Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress under the pretext of reprisal against rebellion.' 
Not only did the world stand by while atrocities took place, but it also refused to learn the awful lessons that were taught during this period. One leader who did acknowledge the Armenian genocide was Winston Churchill, who wrote the following in 1929: 
In 1915, the Turkish Government began and carried out the infamous general massacre and deportation of Armenians in Asia Minor . . . the clearance of the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, could be. There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons. 
But, for the most part, nations did not learn from history. The world looked away and genocidal horrors revisited the planet. 
Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the Armenian people will not be in vain. That is surely the highest tribute we can pay to the Armenian victims and a way in which the horror and brutality of their deaths can be given redeeming meaning. I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the Armenian genocide.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable educator from my home State of Michigan, R. Paul Nelson. Mr. Nelson, the president of Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, MI, is retiring after 28 years of service to the Aquinas College community. 
Paul Nelson joined Aquinas College in 1969, where he was responsible for advising and retaining students. In 1975, Mr. Nelson became dean for continuing education, where he implemented innovative programming in adult education. He helped to create Aquinas' Graduate Management Program, which is now the largest masters degree program in western Michigan. 
In 1984, Mr. Nelson became vice-president for student development, and he established a model career development program which used both field experience and internships to help students explore and begin to attain their career goals. 
In 1990, Paul Nelson was named president of Aquinas College by the board of trustees. In his 7 years at the helm of this vibrant institution, Mr. Nelson brought to life his vision of an Aquinas College which serves as a `faith and values-centered learning community committed to educating the whole person for a life and career of service.' 
Mr. Nelson has been an accessible leader whose remarkable ability to remember the name of any student he met on campus is well known. His dedication to educating people of all ages and promoting lifelong learning should be a model for all who seek a career in higher education. I have no doubt that his career will be an inspiration for future educators, students and administrators at Aquinas College. 
Mr. President, I am honored by the opportunity to recognize the achievements of R. Paul Nelson, and hope my colleagues will join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to him on the occasion of his retirement as president of Aquinas College.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it isn't always that our top military officials so strongly and jointly agree that an arms control treaty is in our national security interest. But in the case of the chemical weapons treaty before the Senate today, that strong support has been expressed over and over and over again. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shalikashvili, speaking on behalf of the Chiefs of each of the services and the combatant commanders, urged the Senate to ratify this treaty because it would make it less likely that our troops will face chemical weapons. Their position is not based on politics or public opinion polls; it is based on their military judgment. 
The acting head of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, has said that this treaty will give us additional tools to inspect for chemical weapons that we otherwise would not have. 
The United States, under former President Bush, led the way to the negotiation of this treaty. It would represent a tragic blow to American leadership were the Senate to reject a treaty negotiated and supported by three Presidents. If we don't lead the way, if and when the day comes that we must act militarily to eliminate a country's chemical weapons, the credibility of and support for, that effort will be undermined by our lack of clean hands and our refusal to ratify a treaty that makes it less likely those weapons will be created to begin with. 
The CWC destroys stockpiles that could threaten our troops; it significantly improves our intelligence capabilities, and it creates new international sanctions to punish those states that remain outside of the treaty. If we fail to ratify the convention, we will imperil our leadership in the entire area of nonproliferation, perhaps the most vital security issue of the post-cold-war era. 
Relative to condition 29 that is before us, there is a motion to strike this condition that has been made by the Senator from Indiana. It is based on many grounds. But the first ground that he points out, which seems to me is the foremost ground even before we get to the details of this condition, is that this condition is a killer condition. If this condition stays in this resolution, it kills this ratification resolution because it makes it conditional on somebody else ratifying. 
Do we want to make our ratification conditional upon these other events? Do we want to give Russia the power to decide our participation in the leadership of this crucial treaty? The President has said--I am here quoting him--`This is precisely backwards. The best way to secure Russian ratification is to ratify the treaty ourselves. Failure to do so will not only give hard-liners in Russia an excuse to hold out but also to hold onto their chemical weapons.' 
Do we want Russia to ratify? Clearly we do. General Shalikashvili, who has so strongly supported the ratification of this treaty, has testified before us in the Armed Services Committee as follows: `The most significant advantage derived from the convention is the potential elimination of chemical weapons by state parties.' He went on to say, `Eventual destruction of approximately 40,000 tons of declared Russian chemical weapons will significantly reduce the global chemical threat.' 
That is why General Shalikashvili has said, among other reasons, that the ratification of this treaty will make it less likely that our troops would ever face chemical weapons because the largest declared stockpile by Russia must be destroyed under this treaty. General Shalikashvili, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, speaking for each of the chiefs and our combatant commanders, says that destruction of 40,000 tons of declared chemical weapons by Russia is the most significant advantage to this treaty. 
What does our ratification have to do with Russian ratification? I would suggest here that we listen to a number of voices. But one of them is a Russian voice--a Russian scientist who blew the whistle actually on the Soviet Union chemical weapons program. His name is Vil Myrzyanov. He is a high-level Russian scientist. This is what he said about the relationship in a letter that he wrote to Senator Lugar. `Senate ratification of the convention is crucial to securing action on the treaty in Moscow.' 
Our ratification, he is telling us--this is an inside voice--is critical to getting the Duma to ratify this treaty. And getting the Duma to ratify this treaty is, in the eyes of General Shalikashvili, the single most important advantage of the treaty because then 40,000 declared tons of chemical agents, the largest stockpile in the world, will be destroyed and less available for leakage, less available to any potential sale or disposition to others adversely or inadvertently. 
So our leadership is important to a safer world. This is a treaty that we helped to draft, negotiated, and now it is before us to ratify. But our leadership is also important to ratification of this treaty inside of Russia. 
The decision of whether the United States ratifies this convention is for this body, the United States Senate to decide--not the Russian Duma. We should strike this killer condition. 
The purpose of both the Bilateral Destruction Agreement and the Wyoming MOU was to help make progress towards achieving a CWC. 
Now that we have the CWC complete, the BDA and the Wyoming MOU are less relevant. We can enter the CWC without the BDA being implemented. 
The BDA does not go as far as the CWC. BDA would permit both sides to keep 5,000 tons of chemical agent. The BDA does not permit challenge inspections. 
The CWC requires complete destruction of all chemical weapons, and provides for challenge inspections to any facility suspected of a violating suspected of violating the CWC. 
If the CWC is ratified by the United States--which this killer condition would prohibit--and by Russia--it is entirely possible that the United States and Russia can finish negotiations on the BDA and let it enter into force. 
If the United States does not ratify this convention, there is little chance Russia will ratify it and there is no chance for this BDA ever entering into force. 
If we want Russia to ratify the CWC--and surely we must--then we should ratify the CWC--which, in turn requires us to strike this condition.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe it is crucial to American leadership and to the security of our men and women in the Armed Forces and, indeed, to all of us in America, that the Senate provide its advice and consent to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention so that the United States can join it as an original party. 
The security of our men and women in the Armed Forces who someday may face the threat of chemicals, the security of our people who constantly face the threat of terrorists and terrorist states that try to get their hands on chemical weapons, all demand that the Senate join as an original party to this convention and ratify this treaty. To ratify it and to make it real, we have to do so without accepting any of the killer amendments that would render this ratification vote useless. 
I say this, and I reached this conclusion as a member of the Armed Services Committee who has listened to our military leaders testify before us, who has read the testimony of these leaders who have said that the ratification of this convention is unequivocally in our national security interest because it will reduce the risk of our military forces encountering chemical weapons on a future battlefield. 
In 1985, President Reagan signed a law which has resulted in our unilaterally destroying our stockpile of chemical weapons. This process will be completed in 2004. The destruction of our chemical weapons will take place, whether or not the United States ratifies the convention. We are destroying our chemical weapons. We are doing so because we decided they are no longer militarily useful and they are too expensive to maintain and we have all the capability we need to deter attack and to respond to attack. So that President Reagan, in 1985, proposed and the Congress accepted his proposal that we destroy our chemical weapons. What this convention will do will be to require other nations to do what we are already doing, and that is going to reduce the risk of chemical attacks against our troops and our Nation. 
General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, has had a great deal to say about this treaty. This is what he wrote on April 8. He said that: 
The ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention by as many nations as possible is in the best interests of the Armed Forces of the United States. The combination [he wrote] of the nonproliferation and disarmament aspects of the convention greatly reduces the likelihood that U.S. forces may encounter chemical weapons in a regional conflict. The protection of the young men and women in our forces, should they have to go in harm's way in the future, is strengthened, not diminished, by the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Then he went on to say: 
We do not need chemical weapons to provide an effective deterrent or to deliver an effective response. 
When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, every member--every single member of the Joint Chiefs, and every combatant commander have reached the same conclusion, that the ratification of this treaty is in our national security interests and will reduce the likelihood of our men and women ever facing chemicals in combat, it seems to me we should listen. When they tell us that we are already unilaterally 
destroying our stockpile of chemical weapons and that what we are doing by joining this convention is being in a position where we will be able to help reduce the risk that others will obtain chemical weapons, we should listen. And when they tell us that they know that this is not perfectly verifiable but that this will reduce the chances that chemical weapons will fall in hands of terrorist states or terrorist organizations or individuals--when our top military leaders tell us that, we should listen. 
They have acknowledged what everyone has acknowledged. There is no way to perfectly verify a chemical weapons convention. But what they have also told us is that following their analysis of this treaty, that because of the intense inspection regime which is provided for here, that we will be able to reduce the risk that any militarily significant amount of chemicals will fall into the hands of an opponent or a future opponent. It is not a matter of perfection, they tell us. It is a matter of improving our current position. That sounds like a security bargain to them and it ought to sound like a security bargain to us. Our senior military leaders have a unique perspective on what makes our military stronger or more secure. And they have agreed. They have agreed that this treaty is good for our security. All the Chiefs of Staff, as I have said, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant commanders have urged that we ratify this treaty. 
This is the way General Shalikashvili made that point. He said, `I fully support early ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and I reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant commanders.' 
The previous Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Powell, spoke very forcefully on this issue just last week. He was addressing the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on April 17 during a hearing on gulf war illness, but he said this relative to the convention on chemical weapons: 
I think one of the greatest things we can do over the next 2 weeks is to pass the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. This is a good treaty. It serves our national interest. That is why it was negotiated beginning in Ronald Reagan's term, and I helped participate [The `I,' here, being Colin Powell]--I helped participate in those negotiations as National Security Adviser, and that is why we signed it in the administration of President Bush. And I participated in the development of the treaty during those days as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I supported the treaty then and I support it now. 
Then General Powell went on to say the following: 
There are some uncertainties associated with the treaty and there are some criticisms of the treaty. I think those criticisms can be answered and dealt with. But we should not overlook the simple fact that, with the treaty, the United States joins over 160 nations in saying to the world that chemical weapons will not be used, will not be made, will not be developed, will not be produced, and we will not share the technology associated with chemical weapons with other nations who are inclined to use them inside or outside the confines of this treaty. 
Then he went on to say the following: 
Not to participate in this treaty, for us to reject the treaty that we designed, we signed, for us to reject that treaty now because there are rogue states outside that treaty is the equivalent of saying we should not have joined NATO because Russia was not a part of NATO. It's exactly because there are these rogue states that we should join with an alliance of over 160 nations to make a clear international statement that these are rogue nations. 
And he concludes: 
Not signing the treaty does not make them no longer rogue nations. So I think this is a fine treaty and it is one of the things the Senate can do to start to get a better handle on the use of these weapons of mass destruction and especially chemical weapons.

Mr. LEVIN. Now, Secretary Cohen, our former colleague Bill Cohen, has testified before the Armed Services Committee on this subject. He has filed some lengthy testimony supporting the Chemical Weapons Convention. To summarize what he said, and here again I am quoting:  
The Chemical Weapons Convention is both a disarmament and nonproliferation treaty. It is very much in our national security interest because it establishes an international mandate for the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, because it prohibits the development, retention, storage, preparations for use, and use of chemical weapons, because it increases the probability of detecting militarily significant violations of the CWC. 
And, here he said that: 
While no treaty is 100 percent verifiable, the Chemical Weapons Convention contains complementary and overlapping declaration and inspection requirements which increase the probability of detecting militarily significant violations of the convention. While detecting illicit production of small quantities of chemical weapons will be extremely difficult, it is easier to detect large-scale production, filling and stockpiling of chemical weapons over time through declaration, routine inspections, factfinding, consultation and challenge inspection mechanisms. The verification regime should prove effective in providing information on significant chemical weapons programs that would not otherwise be available. 
In conclusion, there has been reference to a classified session tomorrow, which will be held relative to advice from the intelligence community. 
Relative to this point, I will only say that the Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, has said, `The more tools we have at our disposal, the better off we feel we are in our business.' And he said that as part of an acknowledgment that we can never guarantee that a power that signs up to this agreement will not cheat. `No regime is foolproof, particularly with regard to these dual-use capabilities. Nothing is going to guarantee success but,' George Tenet concluded, `the more tools we have at our disposal, the better off we are in our business.' 
I also hope that our colleagues will come to that classified session tomorrow. I am very confident that they will conclude, as I have concluded after listening to the intelligence community, that it is very much in our interest, from an intelligence perspective, that we have these tools in our tool kit, and that these additional verification and inspection capabilities are very, very much in our Nation's interest. 
This treaty will enter into force on April 29 whether or not we ratify, but our ratification will make a big difference in the effect the treaty has on us and on our leadership in the world. Is it perfect? No, nothing in life is. Is it an improvement to our present position in terms of inspection of other countries? Surely it is, and we should listen to that top uniformed military official, General Shalikashvili, when he tells us our troops are safer, because if we ratify this convention, it is less likely--not certain--but less likely that they will ever face chemical weapons in combat. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and if my good friend from Rhode Island is ready, I will be happy to yield him 7 minutes. If there is nobody on the other side, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable organization in my home State of Michigan, the Association of Chinese Americans, Inc. The ACA, which promotes the presence of and provides services to Chinese Americans in the Greater Detroit area, is celebrating its 25th anniversary on April 26, 1997. 
In 1972, Michigan residents of Chinese descent formed the Association of Chinese Americans with the motto `Embracing the hopes and dreams of Chinese in the United States.' The ACA became the first chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, a national group which helps Chinese-Americans preserve and promote their cultural heritage in the United States. 
Many people in metropolitan Detroit have benefited from the ACA's activities, which includes physical and mental health services and legal counseling for people in need. The ACA also sponsors social and educational activities for Chinese-American youth, such as dance troupes, camping trips, and college scholarships. 
The ACA plays an important role in preserving and promoting elements of Chinese culture in the United States, helping to keep Chinese art, language, and traditions alive within the Chinese-American community. One of America's great strengths is its diversity, and the ACA helps to remind us all of the valuable additions Chinese-Americans have made to American culture. 
The ACA has encouraged Chinese-Americans to participate in the electoral process, and has helped give Chinese-Americans a strong voice in our political system. Members of the ACA frequently share their opinions, insights, and knowledge of issues which affect the Chinese-American community with elected officials at all levels of government. 
The Association of Chinese-Americans has been effective in furthering the hopes and dreams of Chinese-Americans. I am proud to have such a vibrant and important organization in Michigan, and I invite my colleagues to join me in offering congratulations to the men and women of the ACA on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to make my colleagues aware of an important anniversary in the history of health care in Michigan. Precisely 100 years ago today, osteopathic physicians became licensed to practice medicine in Michigan. 
Michigan was the fourth State to legalize the practice of osteopathy and, according to the Michigan Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, today has the largest number of osteopathic practitioners in the Nation. For the past 100 years, osteopathic physicians have served the people of Michigan by developing therapeutic and diagnostic methods of treating disease to accompany traditional medical procedures. 
The philosophy of osteopathy was first articulated by Dr. Andrew Taylor Still, a physician from the State of Missouri. Dr. Still's teachings guide today's osteopathic physicians as they integrate standard medical practices with the body's natural systems for regulating and healing itself, especially the largest of these, the musculoskeletal system. 
People from every corner of Michigan have benefited from the care of osteopathic physicians, who can be found in disciplines ranging from family practice to surgery. We are truly grateful for the commitment to quality care made by these doctors--the members of the Michigan Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, the Michigan Osteopathic Hospital Association, the Michigan Women's Osteopathic Auxiliary, the Michigan Osteopathic Medical Assistance Association, and the Michigan Osteopathic Guild Association. 
I know my colleagues join me in offering best wishes and congratulations to the osteopathic physicians of Michigan, who have served the community with dedication and compassion for the past 100 years.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate is an unusual piece of legislation. It comes to the Senate in an expedited fashion rarely witnessed in this body. The so-called Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act has been presented as something of an alternative to or substitute for the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
In contrast, though, to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which has taken 3 1/2 years and counting to reach the Senate floor, S. 495 comes to us a mere 3 1/2 weeks following its introduction. The substitute amendment to S. 495 that the Senate is now considering--all 64 pages of bill language--was made available to Senators just a few hours ago. So it is so new, the substitute, that copies of the amendment are just practically warm to the touch. 
The CWC has undergone a thorough and rigorous evaluation in the Senate since its submission in November 1993, the subject of 17 hearings, dozens of witnesses, 1,500 pages of testimony, questions and answers, letters, reports, and other documentation. 
By contrast, the bill before us, S. 495, arrives fresh and green, never having been reported out of committee, never having been the subject of a single congressional hearing. 
This is not the way the Senate should consider important legislation, particularly given the gravity of the subject matter contained in this bill. S. 495 changes existing American law with respect to domestic law enforcement, criminal penalties, international sanctions, and export controls. 
From what I can determine in these few hours, many of the changes contained in S. 495 would weaken existing law. 
Also, S. 495 conditions United States assistance to Russia for the safeguarding and destruction of its vast chemical and biological weapon stockpile of 40,000 tons. These changes and others contained in S. 495 significantly alter American domestic and foreign policy, and as such should be carefully studied by the Judiciary Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and the Foreign Relations Committee at a minimum before the Senate acts on it. But that has not happened. 
The timing of this bill as a prelude to considering the Chemical Weapons Convention leaves the unmistakable impression that proponents of S. 495, or some of them, see it as an alternative or substitute to the treaty. It is nothing of the kind. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention has been signed by 161 nations and ratified by 72. It is a global treaty that bans an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. It prohibits the production, acquisition, stockpiling, transfer, and use of chemical weapons. The treaty, negotiated and signed under Republican administrations and strongly supported by our military leaders and battlefield commanders, is the product of American leadership in combating the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The CWC joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as the triumvirate of multinational nonproliferation treaties that strengthen U.S. national security while at the same time enhancing global stability. 
The bill, S. 495, falls well short of what U.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons Convention can deliver. It does not have the depth, the scope and the boldness of the CWC. More importantly, if this bill is passed as an alternative to the CWC, it would undermine our efforts to deprive aggressor nations and terrorist organizations of the use of chemical weapons. 
The CWC makes illegal the development, production, or possession of chemical weapons by signatory states. S. 495 applies only to the United States. Furthermore, S. 495 would require sanctions against countries only if they use chemical weapons, punishment already existing in U.S. law. Nations that produce, possess, or transfer chemical weapons would not be affected by S. 495. 
The CWC requires that signatory states begin destruction of their chemical weapons within 1 year of the treaty's entry into force and complete that destruction in 10 years, a commitment the United States has already made independently of the CWC. By contrast, S. 495 does not require the destruction of a single chemical bomb or warhead. 
The CWC, our Chemical Weapons Convention that will come before us next week, creates a verification regime to provide for on-site inspection of signatory nations to ensure compliance with the prohibitions created in the treaty. S. 495 concerns itself with punishing individuals and/or nations after chemical weapons are used and lives are lost, not with the abolition of the insidious weapons prior to their use. 
Countries that are not signatories to the CWC are isolated from the world community and prohibited from buying certain dual-use chemicals from member states that could be fashioned into weapons of mass destruction, in the process hampering the economic potential of their domestic industries, chemical and otherwise. S. 495 does nothing to leverage nonsignatory nations to forswear the production and possession of chemical weapons, thereby leaving open the door for the spread of these destabilizing weapons. 
Those are some of the major shortcomings of S. 495 as an alternative to Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and its implementation legislation.

Mr. LEVIN. There are a number of policy flaws in S. 495 which I want to highlight in the few minutes remaining, Mr. President. Specifically, this bill would substantially weaken current criminal provisions in at least five significant areas. This bill weakens existing criminal law in at least five areas, from even a cursory view. 
First, new provisions in title I of the bill would expressly authorize ownership, production, sale or use of chemical and biological weapons for a broad array of purposes described as exempted conduct. The FBI has expressed concern about this new exemption in law, stating if this approach is taken, `the legitimate purpose allowed must be specifically defined and narrowly tailored' to avoid rendering the prohibitions toothless. 
But, unfortunately, section 229(b) defines the term `exempted conduct' to include:

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Fenton A.J. Phillips Library as it celebrates the 10th anniversary of operations in its current building. The history of the library dates back to 1906, when local industrialist A.J. Phillips bequeathed his old office building to the community for use as a library. Since then, the library has experienced many changes, but it has never stopped serving the residents of Fenton. In order to properly celebrate this achievement, the city of Fenton and the Fenton Library Board is holding a gala event which will include some of Neil Simon's hilarious sketches. These will be presented by the actors of the Readers Theatre at the library. Mayor Patricia Lockwood has proclaimed April 17, `Pride in the Fenton A.J. Phillips Library Day.' 
The Fenton Library is one of 18 libraries in the Genesee County Library System. It serves over 10,000 residents of Fenton, Fenton Township, and Tyrone Township. It contains over 55,000 volumes and offers online services to the community. It provides CD's, videos, and books on tape. The library also offers special programs for adults and children, and complete reference services. In 1988, the library was awarded the Michigan Municipal League's Municipal Achievement Award Honorable Mention for its outstanding work. 
I recently visited the Fenton A.J. Phillips Library and saw the positive influence it has on the local community. In this era when institutions are being asked to do more with less, it is heartening to see this library continue to provide quality service to the public. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring the Fenton A.J. Phillips Library on its 10th Anniversary.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, during the consideration of the annual defense budget in each of the last several years, the Armed Services Committee has asked each of the military services to provide a list of unfunded priorities--that is, programs that were not included in the defense budget request submitted to the Congress. For obvious and very understandable reasons, the military services have responded to these requests with a great deal of enthusiasm. 
Again this year, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, asked each of the military service chiefs to indicate to the committee how they would allocate up to $3.0 billion in additional funds above the fiscal year 1998 budget request. Last month each of the four service chiefs provided the committee with a list of $3.0 billion for specific programs not funded in the budget request. 
Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee needs to hear the priorities of the military services--but we also have a responsibility to view these priorities in a broader context. The so-called unfunded priority lists submitted to the committee reflect only individual service priorities. They do not necessarily reflect the joint service priorities of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the warfighting commanders in chief. 
General Shalikashvili made this point earlier this year to the committee when he said during our February 12 hearing in reference to these unfunded priority lists: 
I would put in as strong a plea as I can that you then ask what the overall prioritization is within the joint context, because we are talking of a joint fight. And so to understand why one system should be put forward versus another, you really ought to see what the joint priority on it is, and how that particular system, in the eyes of the joint warfighter, then contributes to the overall fight. Obviously then you will make a judgment. But I would ask that you do not look at service lists without putting it in the context of a joint view on the importance of that item or the other. 
Mr. President, one of the driving forces behind the Armed Services Committee's work on the landmark Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act 10 years ago--which our former colleague and now Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen played a key role in--was the need to enhance the joint perspective within the Defense Department. I agree very strongly 
with General Shalikashvili's view that the Armed Services Committee--and the Senate--should have the benefit of the joint perspective before we take any action on any of the items on the military services' unfunded priority lists. We have a responsibility to ensure that the programs we fund make the greatest possible contribution to the joint warfighting capability of our Armed Forces. 
For this reason, when the committee received the four unfunded priority lists from the military service chiefs last month totaling $12.0 billion, I sent all four lists over to Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili and asked two questions. 
First, I asked which of the specific programs on the military services unfunded priority lists, if any, were programs for which funds are not included in the Defense Department's current Future Years Defense Program. 
Second, I asked for Secretary Cohen's and General Shalikashvili's views on the individual programs on the services' lists from a joint warfighting perspective, and whether there were any programs not included in these lists that in their view had a higher priority from the joint perspective.

Mr. LEVIN. Secretary Cohen indicates in his letter that while the military services' unfunded priority lists `provide useful ways that the Defense Department could apply additional funds, the President's budget already provided for the Department's essential priorities.' With the exception of four specific items, Secretary Cohen also noted that the items on the services' lists are included in the fiscal year 1998-fiscal year 2003 Future Years Defense Program. 
General Shalikashvili's response to my letter outlines his views on the most important programs on the services' lists from a joint warfighting perspective. General Shalikashvili's joint list totals about $4.0 billion, or about one-third of the total $12 billion on the four lists that the service chiefs submitted. His list includes three command, control, communications and intelligence programs that were not on the services' original list. Unfortunately, General Shalikashvili does not indicate relative priorities within the programs on his joint list, but I intend to pursue this question further. 
Mr. President, I think Secretary Cohen's and General Shalikashvili's personal involvement in this issue of unfunded priority lists represents an important step forward in what some people have called the wish list process in the last several years--a process that in my view had gotten a little out of hand. It is still too early to tell how relevant these various lists will be this year. The outcome of the budget discussions between Congress and the administration is unclear. I don't believe we should or need to increase the fiscal year 1998 defense budget this year. If Congress does decide to make adjustments to the fiscal year 1998 budget, I think we are much better off with a $4.0 billion joint list than with four $3.0 billion lists that have not had the benefit of a joint review. 
I want to thank Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili for their cooperation in this effort. 
Exhibit 1 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC, March 18, 1997. 
Hon. William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense. 
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, USA, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Department of Defense, Washington, DC. 
Dear Secretary Cohen and General Shalikashvili: At the request of the Committee, each of the Chiefs of the military services has provided the Committee with a list of their program priorities in the event that Congress decides to provide additional funding to the Defense Department for fiscal year 1998 above the President's budget request. I have enclosed a copy of each of these four lists. 
I would appreciate your response to two issues concerning these lists which were raised during your testimony before the Committee on February 12, 1997. 
First, please indicate which programs, if any, on these lists are programs for which funds are not included in the Department's current Future Years Defense Program. 
Second, during the Committee's February 12 hearing, you requested that we look at the prioritization of these programs within the joint context. Accordingly, please indicate your views on the priority of the individual programs on these lists from the joint warfighting perspective. You should also indicate whether there are any programs not included on these lists that have a higher priority from the joint perspective. 
I would appreciate your response to these questions by April 1, 1997. Thank you for your assistance in this important matter. 
Sincerely, 
Carl Levin, Ranking Minority Member.   
The Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC, April 10, 1997. 
Hon. Carl Levin, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Dear Carl: I welcomed your letter of March 18, 1997, to General Shali and me because it gives me the opportunity to provide my perspective on the Service unfunded priority lists. While the lists provide useful ways the Department could apply additional funds, the President's budget already provided for the Department's essential priorities. Moreover, the vast majority of the items on the lists of unfunded Service priorities are included in the FY 1998-FY 2003 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). I believe that it is hard to call something a priority if it does not appear in the Department's budget plans anywhere in the next 5 years. Therefore, the Services used inclusion in the FYDP as a key selection criterion in building the lists of unfunded FY 1998 priorities. This also allows the Department to reduce future expenditures to the extent budgeted program completions are accelerated by additions to the FY 1998 budget. 
There has been instances where changes after preparation of the FYDP justify including a few items on the unfunded priorities lists that are not in the FYDP. The enclosed table identifies those items and provides a brief explanation of why the items are included in the lists even though they are not in the FYDP. 
I believe the enclosed table responds to your first question. Your second question asked for our views on the priority of the individual programs on the lists from a joint warfighting perspective. I believe that General Shali is best suited to answer your second question, and he will respond separately. 
Thank you again for the opportunity to confirm that the vast majority of the items on the Service unfunded priorities lists are in the FYDP. 
Sincerely, Bill Cohen.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from North Dakota. His eloquent voice is indeed critical to the ratification of this convention. 
It is long overdue, Mr. President, that the Senate take up the Chemical Weapons Convention and that we promptly provide our advice and our consent to its ratification so that the United States can join the convention as an original party. 
I will focus just for a few moments this morning on the military issues and the military implications as they relate to the Chemical Weapons Convention from my perspective as the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. 
Under the 1985 treaty which was signed by President Reagan, we are already unilaterally destroying our stockpile of unitary chemical weapons. We are doing this without a treaty, without being required to do so, because of our own decision as to their limited military usefulness. This process is scheduled to be completed by the year 2004. This is a point which Secretary Cohen makes very, very effectively. 
This is not an issue of saying we will give up our chemical weapons if the other guys do the same thing. We are already unilaterally destroying our chemical weapons. The question now is whether we will join a convention where other countries are going 
to do what we are already doing unilaterally. So the destruction of our chemical weapons will take place whether or not the Senate ratifies this convention. It will require other nations to do what we are already doing and will reduce the risk of chemical attacks against our troops and our country in the process. 
This convention will enter into force on April 29, with or without the United States being a party. So the question before the Senate is not whether the Chemical Weapons Convention is a perfect treaty. It is whether or not we want the United States to have a role in overseeing and implementing this convention so that it greatly enhances our security. Our military and our civilian defense leadership give a resounding yes to the question of whether or not the United States should ratify this convention. 
First, here is the testimony of General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Foreign Relations Committee, last March 28, 1996. This is what General Shalikashvili said: 
From a military perspective, the Chemical Weapons Convention is clearly in our national interest. The Convention's advantages outweigh its shortcomings. The United States and all other CW capable state parties incur the same obligation to destroy their chemical weapon stockpile. While less than perfect, the verification regime allows for intrusive inspections while protecting national security concerns. The nonproliferation aspects of the convention will retard the spread of chemical weapons and, in so doing, reduce the probability that U.S. forces may encounter chemical weapons in a regional conflict. Finally, while foregoing the ability to retaliate in kind, the U.S. military retains the wherewithal to deter and defend against a chemical weapons attack. I strongly support this convention and respectfully request your consent to ratification. 
General Shalikashvili told this to the Foreign Relations Committee a year ago. 
Then he said in another point in his testimony to the Armed Services Committee last month that all of the chiefs of staff and the commanders in chief of our combatant commanders support the Chemical Weapons Convention. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee, `I fully support early ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and in that respect I reflect the views of the Joint Chiefs and the combatant commanders.' 
Now, this is really quite an important point, I believe, for the U.S. Senate. We have the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs, we have all of the Chiefs, all of our combatant commanders urging us to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention because our troops will be safer with the convention in effect than if it is not in effect. That ought to count heavily with the U.S. Senate. It is not always true that you have that kind of a unified position on the part of our uniformed military. It is not always true that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs can say that all of the Chiefs, all of the combatant commanders, agree that a certain course of action ought to be taken in the U.S. Senate. But it is true in this case. 
As I mentioned, Secretary Cohen, when he was still the Secretary-designate for his current position, testified as follows, before the Armed Services Committee, when asked whether or not he supports the ratification of the convention prior to the April 29 deadline, and this, basically, is his answer: 
Yes. The CWC, as both a disarmament and a nonproliferation treaty, is very much in our national security interest because it: 
No. 1, establishes an international mandate for the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles; 
No. 2, prohibits the development, retention, storage, preparations for use, and use of chemical weapons; 
No. 3, increases the probability of detecting militarily significant violations of the CWC; and 
No. 4, hinders the development of clandestine CW stockpiles.

Mr. LEVIN. Secretary Cohen concluded by saying the following: 
I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention and the goal of U.S. ratification of the convention by April 29, 1997 . . . U.S. ratification of the Convention prior to this date will ensure that the U.S. receives one of the 41 seats on the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international organization that will oversee CWC implementation. Early ratification will also ensure that U.S. citizens will fill key positions within the OPCW and act as inspectors for the Organization. Direct U.S. involvement and leadership will ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the OPCW during the critical early stages of the Convention's implementation. The U.S., upon ratification and implementation of the CWC, will also receive CW-related information from other state parties. As a state party and a member of the Executive Council, the U.S. will be in the best position to assure the effective implementation of the Convention's verification provisions. 
Now, that is our former colleague, Bill Cohen. It is an exceptionally clear and cogent statement of why the CWC is in our international interest. Defense Secretary Perry before him, said the following before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on March 28, 1996: 
In conclusion, the Department of Defense considers the Chemical Weapons Convention a well-balanced treaty that, in conjunction with our other efforts against CW proliferation, a robust chemical protection program and maintenance of a range of nonchemical response capabilities, will serve the best interests of the United States and the world community. The Department of Defense strongly supports the Convention. I respectfully request that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification this spring. 
Mr. President, our military, today, enjoys a high level of protection against chemical weapons. The treaty specifically permits that level of protection and any additional level of protection to continue. We spend about $500 million a year on chemical and biological defenses. The Senate should help assure that our forces maintain an effective capability to defend themselves. We plan on doing just that in the budget that we will be submitting to the Senate. 
But by not ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention, we would be giving other nations an excuse for delaying or rejecting ratification, while taking the pressure off of pariah states to join the treaty.

<DOCNO>105-levin-mi-4-19970416</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one paragraph from that letter says the following: 
On its own, the CWC cannot guarantee complete security against chemical weapons. We must continue to support robust defense capabilities, and remain willing to respond--through the CWC or by unilateral action--to violators of the Convention. Our focus is not on the treaty's limitations, but instead on its many strengths. The CWC destroys stockpiles that could threaten our troops; it significantly improves our intelligence capabilities, and it creates new international sanctions to punish those states who remain outside of the treaty. For these reasons, we strongly support the CWC. 
Former Secretary of State, Jim Baker, spoke out very strongly in support of the CWC the other day and said: 
If we fail to ratify the convention, we will imperil our leadership in the entire area of nonproliferation, perhaps the most vital security issue of the post-cold war era. 
Mr. President, before we have a chance to vote on the CWC, we will be voting on a bill introduced by Senator Kyl, S. 495. It is a 70-page bill that effects our efforts relative to chemical and biological weapons. The contrast between the lack of analysis of that bill, the contrast between the absence of hearings on that bill and the thoroughness with which the Chemical Weapons Convention has been analyzed, is enormous. We have had about 18 hearings on the Chemical Weapons Convention. We have had dozens of briefings for Senators and our staffs. We have had 1,500 pages of information on the CWC, which has been provided to the Senate by the administration: 300 pages of testimony; 500 pages of answers to letters and reports; 400 pages of answers to questions for the record; 300 pages of other documentation. That is what we have had in the 3 1/2 years that the Chemical Weapons Convention has been before us. The bill introduced by Senator Kyl has been in front of us for a few weeks. 
So we have had the convention before us for 3 1/2 years, with 18 hearings, hundreds of pages of documents, answers, et cetera, a thorough and complete and exhaustive analysis of this convention. It is long, long overdue that it come before the Senate. Hopefully, we are going to ratify it and not be deterred from ratification in any way by a bill recently introduced, just a few weeks ago, with 70 pages of complicated text relative to the same subject, but which doesn't affect anybody else's weapons, only our own. 
Mr. President, I want, again, to thank the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership in this area. It is important to this Nation's position and posture in the world as a leader that a convention that was designed by us, negotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush, supported by them, a bipartisan convention, be finally brought before the Senate for debate and ratification. 
I thank the Chair and my friend from North Dakota for yielding me some time.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to comment on the independent counsel decision of the Attorney General. 
The Attorney General's obligation is to follow the law. It is not to respond to political pressure from whatever source. 
Now, over the last weekend, there were some extraordinary attempts made by a number of House Republican leaders to literally scare the Attorney General into doing what they wanted. Both Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Armey said Sunday, in effect, that if the Attorney General did not seek an independent counsel, it is because she caved in to administration pressure. 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-levin-mi-2-19970415</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, those comments by the Speaker and the majority leader of the House constitute an attempt at political intimidation and coercion. Their message to the Attorney General was that if she doesn't seek the appointment of an independent counsel, she would run the risk of being brought before a congressional committee and that she would be investigated, she would be put under oath, as though she, somehow or other, is violating her oath. 
The statements by the Republican leaders in the House fly in the face of the very purpose of our independent counsel law. Now, this is a statute that we passed, on a bipartisan basis, to take politics out of criminal investigations of high-level officials. But the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the House worked mighty hard to put politics right back into the law. Their threats to the Attorney General--and that is exactly what they were--to make her do what they want were inappropriate, and they jeopardize the very law that they are demanding she invoke. 
She is required and was required to follow the law, wherever it leads her, despite the clumsy efforts at political intimidation of the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the House. Their comments and their efforts to intimidate and coerce her to reach a conclusion that they believe is the right conclusion are inappropriate; they undermine a very important law, and they put that law's usefulness into jeopardy. 
There are thresholds in the independent counsel law. The Attorney General has gone through, very carefully, in her letter to the Congress why it is she does not at this time seek the appointment of an independent counsel. She has gone through the evidence that she has and has indicated why the thresholds in the statute have not been met. She has done so carefully and professionally. 
I urge every Member of this body to read the Attorney General's letter to Senator Hatch before they join any partisan effort to attempt to undermine the purpose of the law and to partisanize it. 
Now, Senator Cohen and I worked mighty hard to reauthorize this law. We did it more than once. We did it because it holds out the hope that serious allegations against high-level officials can be dealt with on a nonpartisan basis. That hope is being dashed by the kind of excessive comments that the Speaker of the House and majority leader of the House engaged in last weekend when they engaged in threats and coercion, attempting to politically intimidate the Attorney General of the United States. She has not shown a reluctance to use the independent counsel statute when the threshold has been met. She is following the law to the best of her conscience and ability. She has done a professional job. I commend her for following the law and the public integrity section recommendation in her Department, rather than bowing to political pressure. I emphasize that she has not, and I believe will not, bow to political pressure from whatever source or whatever direction.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the past several years, the Wall Street Journal has published a special pullout section of the newspaper with a number of articles on executive pay. Last year's headline read, `The Great Divide: CEO Pay Keeps Soaring Leaving Everybody Else Further and Further Behind.' Last week, Business Week magazine featured this cover story on its 47th annual pay survey: `Executive Pay: It's Out of Control.' 
Both publications analyze the pay of top executives at approximately 350 U.S. major corporations. Their analysis shows that the pay of the chief executive officers continues to outpace inflation, other workers' pay, the pay of CEO's in other countries, and company profits. 
According to Business Week, for CEO's of the leading 350 companies studied, their average total compensation rose 54 percent last year to about $5.7 million, which came on top of 1995 CEO pay increases of 30 percent. So in 1995 we had the CEO's increasing their pay by 30 percent, last year increases of 54 percent. Blue-collar employees received a 3 percent raise in 1996, and white-collar workers fared only slightly better with a 3.2 percent raise. 
So in 1996 the pay of the top executives was 209 times the pay of the factory employee, which is a huge increase. The ratio of executive pay to factory workers' pay in the United States was already two to three times more than the pay ratio in any other country. Suddenly, now we see this going up to a ratio of 209 times the pay of the average factory worker. The last time we had statistics, the ratio of executive pay to factory worker pay was 20 times in Japan and 25 times in Germany. Those statistics are a few years old but we do not think they have changed that much. 
These statistics, the 3.2 percent pay increase that went to the white collar workers and the 3 percent increase in wages and benefits that went to America's blue collar workers, represent a growing problem in America, and represent a gap that is growing. The question is now what? Is this gap going to continue? That is a question more for the market than for government. 
There is something that government is currently doing that can change this, and that is right now we permit stock options, which represent the biggest portion of corporate pay, to be taken as a tax deduction for income tax purposes, although it is not shown as an expense on the company's books. There is no other form of executive compensation for which this is true. Every other form of executive compensation, of compensation for anybody, is shown as an expense on the company's books when it is taken as a deduction on income tax. 
There is no double standard for any form of compensation in our country, in our Tax Code, except for stock options. If a corporate executive gets stock, that is an expense on the company's books. It is a tax deduction on their income taxes. If there is a bonus based on performance, that is an expense on the company's books, and it is a tax deduction. But when it comes to stock options, the Tax Code right now permits there to be a tax deduction for the company when that stock option is exercised. However, the company does not show that stock option as an expense on its own books. It is a stealth exception. It is a double standard. We should end it. 
That is why, today, Senator McCain and I are introducing legislation to end this corporate tax loophole that is fueling the increases in executive pay and is fueling those increases with taxpayer dollars. Again, this loophole allows companies to deduct from their income taxes these multimillion dollar pay expenses that never show up on the company office books as an expense. 
A just completed survey of CEO pay at 55 major Fortune 500 corporations by a leading executive compensation publication called Executive Compensation Reports, found that in 1996 stock options averaged about 45 percent of total executive pay. That is up from 40 percent just 1 year ago, and stock options provided more money 
to the 55 CEO's studied than their base salary or their annual bonus. In fact, for 1996, salary accounted for only 22 percent of CEO compensation while stock options accounted for 45 percent. 
These stock options enable a CEO typically to buy company shares at a set price for a period of time, which is usually 10 years. Since stock prices generally rise over time, stock options have become the most lucrative source of executive pay. 
Now, again, I do not think anyone is suggesting government ought to determine how much executives get paid. We should not. Stockholders and boards of directors should set that. But we should determine whether or not we want to allow our Tax Code to contain this loophole any longer, where this one form of executive compensation and only this form of compensation is dealt with by a double standard. We permit the company to get the tax deduction when it comes to filing their income tax return, but we do not require the company to show that same expense as an expense on their books, thereby hiding the cost to the company of the stock option cost but still getting a tax deduction. 
Now, say, a corporate executive exercises stock options to purchase company stock and makes a profit of $10 million. The company can claim the full $10 million as a business expense and deduct it from the company's tax bill. But when it comes to showing that expense on their books, on their annual report, it is not an expense. It is a footnote, not required to be shown as an expense like other forms of compensation, but rather hidden in a footnote. 
This is not an accounting issue. The accounting authorities, the experts, have decided how this should be handled as an accounting matter. This is now a tax loophole issue. The question is whether or not we, on tax day, want to continue a loophole for executives--because that is who we are talking about in approximately 98 percent of the cases. In perhaps 1 or 2 percent of the cases these stock option plans are broadly based and help average employees, and we would not include that in our bill. But in maybe 98 percent of the cases, these are narrowly based stock option plans only going to the top officials of companies. 
This bill would end the double standard. It gives a choice. If you want to take it as an expense for tax purposes, deduct this as compensation for tax purposes, that is fine, no restriction. But then you have to show it on your books as an expense also. You do not want to show it on your books as an expense? That is your choice, but then we will not let you take it as an expense on your income taxes and have the rest of the taxpayers of the United States foot the bill. 
Stock option pay is either a company expense or it is not. It either lowers company earnings or it does not. Something is clearly out of whack when in the tax law a company can say one thing at tax time and something else to investors at the annual meeting. 
This bill that I am introducing with Senator McCain today would end the double standard that allows corporations to treat stock option pay one way on the tax form and the opposite way on the company's books. 
I want to emphasize that this bill does not prohibit stock options. It doesn't put a cap on them. It doesn't limit them in any way. It just says, if you want to claim stock option pay as an expense at tax time, you have to treat it as an expense the rest of the year as well. 
In summary, the bill would not prohibit stock options. It would not put a cap on them or limit them in any way. It just says, if a company wants to claim stock option pay as an expense at tax time, it has to treat it as an expense the rest of the year as well. Period. 
The bill provides one exception to ensure that closing the stock option tax loophole doesn't affect the pay of average workers. 
Right now, stock option pay is overwhelmingly executive pay. In 1994, the most extensive stock option review to date, covering 6,000 publicly traded U.S. companies, found that only 1 percent of the companies issued stock options to anyone other than management and 97 percent of the stock options issued went to 15 or fewer individuals per company. 
Nevertheless, there are a few companies that issue stock options to all employees and do not disproportionately favor top executives. Our bill would allow companies that provide broad-based plans to continue to claim existing stock option tax benefits, even if they exclude stock option pay expenses from their books. Like FASB, we would encourage but not require these companies to treat these expenses consistently. By making this limited exception, we would ensure that average worker pay would not be affected by closing the stock option loophole. We might even encourage a few more companies to share stock option benefits with average workers. 
The bottom line is that the bill that Senator McCain and I are introducing today is not intended to stop the use of stock options. Our bill is aimed only at stopping the manipulation of stock option expenses by those companies that are trying to have it both ways--claiming stock option pay as an expense at tax time, but not when reporting company earnings to Wall Street and the public. It is aimed at ending a stealth tax benefit that is fueling the wage gap, favoring one group of companies over another, and feeding public cynicism about the fairness of the Federal Tax Code. 
It would also curtail an expensive tax loophole. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating the corporate stock option loophole would save taxpayers $373 million over 7 years and $933 million--almost $1 billion--over 10 years. In this era of fiscal austerity, that's money worth saving.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend, the Honorable Alma Stallworth, a truly dedicated public official who recently retired after 18 years of serving the people of northwest Detroit in the Michigan House of Representatives. Representative Stallworth is being honored at a retirement celebration hosted by the Black Caucus Foundation of Michigan and the Black Child Development Institute Metro-Detroit Affiliate. 
Throughout her 18-year career in the Michigan House, Alma Stallworth was widely recognized as a champion of women, children, and minorities. She fought to expand prenatal coverage for pregnant women, increase Michigan's child immunization rate and provide parenting education to teenagers with children. She was an active member of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, as well as a successful fundraiser for the United Negro College Fund, raising more than $1 million over the past 11 years. 
Representative Stallworth was also a leader on issues related to public utilities. She served as chair of the Public Utilities Committee in the Michigan House of Representatives, and was a vice-chair of the Telecommunication and Banking Committee in the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Alma Stallworth's legislative leadership will be missed, but I am confident that she will continue to serve as a champion for those people who often lack a voice in the political process. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Alma on her illustrious career and in wishing her well in her future endeavors.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at page 11, lines 2-5 of the manager's substitute amendment, section 101(g) provides that `subject to subsection (f), nothing in this act shall be construed to subject the United States to financial liability for the Secretary's failure to meet any deadline for the acceptance or emplacement of spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste.' Is it the manager's intention that this language prevent contract holders from recovering damages or other financial relief from the Government on account of DOE's failure to comply with the 1998 deadline established in section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982?

Mr. LEVIN. If a deadline were imposed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, as reflected by the substitute amendment, as well as by the Nuclear Waste Policy of 1982 or the contracts executed thereunder, is it the manager's intention that section 101(g) would proscribe financial liability for failure to meet the deadline to the extent it is imposed by the 1982 act? For instance, if DOE were to fail to commence the acceptance and emplacement of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste by November 30, 1999 or thereafter, would the amendment proscribe a court from imposing financial liability on DOE if a court ruled that DOE's inaction constituted a failure to comply with the deadline established in section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and the contracts?

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, during the recent congressional recess I visited the U.S. Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, CA, with Army Chief of Staff Gen. Dennis Reimer. The purpose of my visit was to observe the culmination of the Army's brigade-size Task Force XXI warfighting experiment. I want to take a few moments today to describe this important and far-reaching exercise for my colleagues. 
The Army's National Training Center is probably the best training center for mechanized ground combat forces in the world. Army brigades rotate through the NTC to test their skills in a 2-week exercise against the NTC's vaunted opposing force, or OPFOR--the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, currently commanded by Col. Guy Swan. This opposing force uses equipment and tactics similar to those used by the military forces of the former Warsaw Pact. Many in the Army consider this force to be the best-trained brigade-size force of any army in the world. 
The exercise I observed with General Reimer was part of the Army's Task Force XXI advanced warfighting experiment. It involved the so-called experimental force of the 1st Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division, Mechanized--the EXFOR--commanded by Col. Tom Goedkoop. This was a long anticipated exercise, Mr. President, because it was the first brigade-level test of a range of digital technology capabilities designed to bring the power of information warfare to ground combat forces. 
The goal of the Army's Task Force XXI advanced warfighting experiment is to increase the combat power of Army divisions and to make them more versatile, more deployable and more agile across a broad range of missions. Some people have even compared the 2-week exercise at the National Training Center with the historic Louisiana maneuvers of the 1930's which established the structure and warfighting doctrine of our World War II Army. 
The Army began this experiment with digitization with the decision over a year ago to use the 4th Infantry Division, Mechanized, stationed at Fort Hood as a testbed for this technology. The Army established a factory-like operation at Fort Hood to modify over 900 vehicles into over 180 different configurations. The EXFOR was equipped with 87 different digital systems--over 5,000 individual pieces of equipment in total. This digital equipment included unmanned aerial vehicles, a networked computer system, global positioning satellite receivers, position reporting transmitters, digital radios, and the most advanced night vision and thermal imaging equipment. 
This equipment was developed and designed to dramatically improve the situational awareness capability of the experimental force. Situational awareness refers to the ability to determine and track the location of all forces on the battlefield at a given time. It is the ability to answer the three questions--Where am I? Where are my buddies? Where is the enemy?--which are critical to success on the modern battlefield. Each vehicle in the EXFOR brigade was outfitted with a computer terminal that gave the members of the brigade unprecedented and real-time friendly situational awareness from the individual infantry fighting vehicles and tanks all the way up to division level, as well as unprecedented intelligence on enemy, or OPFOR, operations. 
The digital equipment also provided the EXFOR with integrated and automated mission planning, mission execution, and command and control capabilities never before available to any army in the world. For intelligence information, commanders down to battalion level could access all levels of support, including national satellite systems, overhead reconnaissance aircraft like the U-2, the SR-71, and JSTARS, the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. 
During my visit to the NTC, I observed the combat battalions of the experimental force in a deep attack against the opposing force. I watched as the EXFOR conducted breach operations against the OPFOR's formidable obstacle system as the OPFOR fought to defend its battle position. While this specific engagement turned out to be a tactical draw, there were many instances where the technology available to the experimental force demonstrated the potential for greatly enhanced capabilities in the Army of the future. 
Before a combat operation the commander generally conducts what is called the intelligence preparation of the battlefield. In the case of offensive operations, the commander and his staff compare a doctrinal template of the way they expect the enemy to array his forces in the defense to that dictated by the actual terrain in the area of operations. The resultant situational template allows the commander to target his reconnaissance effort against the suspected enemy defensive positions to confirm or deny the accuracy of the template. He then adjusts his scheme of firing and maneuvering to effectively attack and destroy the enemy in his confirmed positions. 
Today, Army units rely principally on their integral aerial and ground scouts with their current optical, thermal, or radar systems to conduct this reconnaissance. Very often scouts are destroyed before reaching their positions, or are unable to send back accurate or timely spot reports for any number of reasons. In that case a commander is forced to attack against an unconfirmed or incomplete situational template of the enemy 
defense, or is forced to change his scheme of maneuver at the last minute--a particularly difficult and dangerous endeavor. 
With its enhanced situational awareness capability, the EXFOR was able to conduct the intelligence preparation of the battlefield much quicker and with greater accuracy than normal Army brigades. The situational template was developed and transmitted digitally to all echelons of command. The commander used all reconnaissance assets, including national satellite systems, overhead aircraft, UAV reconnaissance, and the Joint Surveillance Target Attack System, as well as his integral aerial and ground scouts who were equipped with enhanced sights and other surveillance equipment. OPFOR positions were detected and transmitted digitally to all of the EXFOR vehicle computer systems to update the situational template. With such accurate and timely intelligence the commander was able to quickly change the scheme of fires and maneuver for his attack with ample time and information for subordinate commanders to plan and react effectively. 
During the EXFOR attack the OPFOR employed an artillery delivered minefield across the EXFOR's avenue of approach in an attempt to confuse and slow the EXFOR attack. With its superior situational awareness provided by its digital systems, the EXFOR was able to transmit the locations of the minefield quickly and accurately to follow-on attacking battalions. These battalions were able to avoid the minefield and resort to an alternate route of attack. Likewise, superior situational awareness permitted those battalions, in the dead of night, to rapidly traverse the more difficult terrain of the alternate route and surprise an OPFOR unaccustomed to such a rapid response on the part of a training unit. 
During this attack highly accurate situational awareness permitted rapid and effective EXFOR response in other situations as well. In the battle I observed, the EXFOR placed very accurate counter-battery radar coverage zones around its units that needed priority protection. This proved critical when the EXFOR combat engineers were breaching the obstacles in front of the OPFOR defensive position and came under OPFOR mortar attack. The counter-battery radars detected the first incoming rounds and alerted EXFOR artillery, which immediately responded with counter-battery fires that destroyed the OPFOR mortars before they could fire another round against the engineers. 
During the later stages of the battle I visited the brigade and divisional tactical operations centers and saw the soldiers and officers of the EXFOR using the digital equipment in the most realistic combat environment the Army can simulate short of actual war. I observed the unmanned aerial vehicle--or UAV--being flown from a van attached to the brigade tactical operations center under the direction of one of the brigade 
operations officers, providing the brigade with real-time intelligence and tremendous targeting information. The commander of the OPFOR brigade later told me that he had to devote significantly more resources to protecting his own forces in this exercise compared to others. He said that all of his soldiers, for example, spent a lot of time during the 2-week exercise looking up in the sky and watching for the EXFOR's UAV's. 
Madam President, an important aspect of the Army's effort to incorporate digital technology into its divisions is the unprecedented cooperation between the Army and the contractor community. This cooperation extended to the exercise at the National Training Center. During my visit I toured what the Army calls the Central Technical Support Facility, a facility jointly manned by Army personnel and contractor personnel. The Army established this unique organization to act as an enabler for rapid integration of software and hardware systems through interaction of soldiers, contractors, and program managers. Any problems identified by the soldier-users of the tactical internet and digital systems were immediately dealt with by hardware and software engineers at the Central Technical Support Facility. In some cases, their solutions resulted in design changes which were immediately incorporated into the experiment, shaving months or years off the normal time-lines for the testing and acquisition process. Senior Army officials believe this concept is a prototype which holds great potential for changing the way users and contractors interact in the future. I share the Army's interest in further development of this arrangement. 
I have inevitably been asked who won the 2-week exercise--was it the EXFOR with its new technology, or was it the OPFOR who lacked the newer technology but had a tremendous home-field advantage with its intimate knowledge of the terrain and long experience of fighting together? The answer to that question is not nearly as important as the answer to the question of how effective were the various new technologies used by the EXFOR. 
The answer to both will have to wait for the results of the comprehensive after-action review that is being conducted by the Army. My own discussions during my visit left me with the overall impression that this digitization technology can be a tremendously powerful tool for the Army. UAV's--unmanned aerial vehicles--were a great force multiplier, as were the latest generation night vision equipment and the situational awareness technology. The Apache Longbow helicopter, the new Javelin antitank weapon and the Paladin howitzer were all combat systems available to the EXFOR which gave them a clear advantage over the OPFOR, and these systems were made even more effective by UAV's and other systems that provided real-time targeting data. 
In some significant instances, the NTC exercise did not reflect the full potential of some new technologies that are 
already reaching the deployed forces. For example, the M1A2 tank is in such short supply at this time that the Army is fielding this system only with the early deploying combat forces. The EXFOR was using M1A1 tanks with internally mounted computer terminals to provide situational awareness. Although these internally mounted terminals are a great help, they are not a long-term solution and do not adequately represent the target acquisition and situational awareness capability of the embedded information warfare systems fielded with the M1A2. 
The technologies that the Army is testing under their advanced warfighting experiments are not without bugs and problems. Some echelons of command, for example, were reluctant to rely on the real-time situational awareness reported digitally over the EXFOR's tactical internet and preferred instead to rely on traditional acetate maps and voice communications. With much of the technology still in development, this reliance on traditional methods of command and control was understandable, and some backup capability to the tactical internet will need to be retained in the future. In general, though, much of the technology that I saw on display during the exercise can be incorporated into systems that will significantly improve the survivability and lethality of our Army combat forces. The commander of the OPFOR brigade acknowledged that his brigade had been tested more than usual by the EXFOR brigade. He also said that he would not like to fight the EXFOR brigade after they had a year to train with their new equipment. 
There is an old saying that knowledge is power. The advanced warfighting experiment at the National Training Center demonstrated that knowledge is also military power--particularly the knowledge of the battlefield that comes from the tremendous situational awareness available through the digital technology of information warfare. No amount of technology is going to change the basic requirement for Army combat forces to be able to close with and destroy the enemy. But the information dominance that the Army is developing through the Force XXI effort can be a tremendous force multiplier. 
Earlier this year General Shalikashvili told the Armed Services Committee that the Defense Department will have to change the way it does business. `Where possible,' General Shalikashvili stated, `we will also have to trim personnel end strength especially where technological changes such as improved weapons systems afford us the possibility to consider fewer and smaller units.' The technology of information warfare tested at the National Training Center last month is a good example of technology that may in fact allow a smaller force to have the same or even greater lethality and combat effectiveness as the forces we have today. 
Madam President, I want to congratulate General Reimer, the 
Army Chief of Staff and his predecessor Gen. Gordon Sullivan; Gen. William Hartzog, the commander of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command; and Maj. Gen. Paul Kern, the commander of the 4th Infantry Division for their vision and determination to make information technology a force multiplier for the Army of the future. I also want to congratulate the thousands of soldiers, Department of the Army civilians, and civilian contractors responsible for their contributions to this important effort. 
The job, however, is not complete. There are a number of challenges that must be addressed before the decision is made to expand this technology throughout the Army, including questions of cost; the integration of new technology into existing systems; the impact of this technology on the Army's organizational structure and doctrine, and on the tactics, techniques and procedures to execute this doctrine; the impact on the training base; and the impact on personnel systems, including leader development. 
Madam President, the Armed Services Committee will look closely at the results and lessons learned from the advanced warfighting experiment in the coming weeks and months. I look forward to working with the Army and with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to bring the best of this experiment to the rest of the Army in a timely manner.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Attorney General, today, will apparently respond to the request of a majority of the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that she seek the appointment of an independent counsel in the investigation into campaign finance irregularities of the 1996 campaign. In deciding how to respond, the Attorney General's duty is to follow the law, not to respond to political pressure. 
But over the weekend, extraordinary attempts were made by several House Republican leaders to literally scare the Attorney General into doing what they want, not necessarily what the law requires.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr President, I would like to make my colleagues aware of an important event taking place in my home city of Detroit, Michigan--the opening of the new Museum of African American History. The Museum is unique in its size, scope and mission. 
Located in Detroit's Cultural Center, the 120,000 square foot Museum of African American History is the largest museum in the nation dedicated to documenting and celebrating the African American experience. It is led by Kimberley Camp, who was the first African American gallery director in the history of the Smithsonian Institute. Under Dr. Camp's leadership, the Museum is poised to become a destination for tourists and researchers from around the country. 
The Museum was designed by prominent Detroit architects Howard Sims and Harold Varner, of Sims-Varner and Associates, Inc. Using contemporary building materials, Mr. Sims and Mr. Varner created a building thoroughly American in design, but with significant accents which evoke African culture and traditions. Two Detroit artists, Richard Bennett and Hubert Massey, created some of the most striking of these accents. Mr. Bennett's massive African-style masks adorn the facade above the bronze front doors, which he also created. Mr. Massey's terrazzo tile mosaic, `Genealogy,' is interwoven with the floor in the rotunda. Crowning the rotunda is a glass and steel dome, the largest dome in southeastern Michigan. 
The central display in the Museum will be the core exhibition, `Of the people: An African American experience.' This exhibition will use historical artifacts, audio recordings, documents, and three-dimensional displays to take visitors through the totality of the African American experience, from the first slave ships through the present day. Displays will also put into context the importance of African traditions in historical and modern American culture. Two additional galleries will be used for new and changing exhibits. 
The men and women of the new Museum of African American History are committed to creating an institution which is truly a partner in the community. To that end, the Museum will offer a lecture series, after-school programs for Detroit children, weekend workshops for children and adults and theatrical arts programs. 
The Museum never would have been built without the leadership of Mayors Coleman Young and Dennis Archer, and without the financial support of the residents of Detroit and the corporate community. All of them came together and pledged their support for what will be the finest institution of its kind in the country. 
At the Museum's grand opening on April 12, the United States Postal Service will unveil the winning design for the first stamp celebrating Kwanzaa. The Kwanzaa stamp, which has been designed by the internationally acclaimed artist Synthia Saint James, will highlight the importance of African traditions in the lives of so many Americans. Ms. Saint James is an accomplished author, poet, and award-winning illustrator of books for children and adults. She has previously been commissioned to create works of art for organizations like UNICEF, Dance Africa and the Girl Scouts of America. 
Mr. President, it is important that we recognize the contributions African Americans have made to our nation's cultural heritage. People of all races will learn and be touched by their experience at Detroit's Museum of African American History. On the occasion of the Museum's grand opening, I know my colleagues join me in congratulating the men and women who helped make this remarkable institution a reality.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from West Virginia. The Senator from West Virginia is the plaintiff in a historic lawsuit. This lawsuit has now taken the first step. Senator Moynihan and I, Senator Hatfield, and a number of House Members are co-plaintiffs, and proudly so, with Senator Byrd. We are kind of the `et al.' Robert Byrd, et al. It is a position that we are proud to be in. 
This lawsuit, we should be clear, tests a particular version of the line-item veto that is in that bill. What the court held, and what our lawyers argued, and what we feel passionately is that once the President of the United States affixes his signature to a bill, that is the law of the land. Four magic words: `Law of the land.' When that becomes the law of the land, it cannot be repealed unilaterally by the President or by us. It must be repealed according to the Constitution. That is the fundamental, bedrock, black letter constitutional law, which the court affirmed today. It is pleasing to us that the court did so. 
I want to thank our colleagues for making it possible for us to have an expedited process in the courts. Whichever side of this dispute we were on, we agreed that we ought to resolve it promptly. The bill provided that there be an early resolution in court. I think all of our colleagues are to be thanked for making that possible. 
The sword of Damocles is there, as the Senator from New York mentioned. It still hangs here until there is a final resolution, if there is going to be an appeal to the Supreme Court. We hope now that the Constitution will prevail. We think it is clear that the courts are the right people to give the final interpretation of that Constitution. Justice Marshall's vision and holding prevails today, in that a court has now ruled on the constitutionality of a law. Presumably, that will go to the Supreme Court. We hope for a prompt resolution. 
We are very gratified that what we believe is so fundamental in this country has now been reaffirmed by the district court that took the first look at this law. That principle, again, is that once that moment comes when a Presidential pen is affixed to a bill, that bill binds all of us, every one of us, be it the President or any other citizen of this land, and that bill cannot be changed. The law cannot be changed by the unilateral act of either the President or the Congress, but must be repealed as laws are adopted, with the involvement of both the President and the Congress, as required by the Constitution. 
Again, my thanks to Senator Byrd for the leadership he has shown in protecting the Constitution of the United States. I know Senator Moynihan expressed this, and Senator Hatfield, if he were here, would say the same, that we are very, very gratified to be on the same side of a very critical lawsuit with our good friend from West Virginia.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend Geraldine DeFant, a visionary leader, who recently passed away. In her 79 years, she worked tirelessly to help others, especially her fellow citizens of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Her accomplishments have established her as a legend among Upper Peninsula labor, political, and social leaders. She came to Marquette County in 1949 to organize the employees of the H.W. Gossard factory in Ishpeming for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. She guided the women employees of the factory through a landmark strike that energized the local labor movement and was the first strike in the Upper Peninsula at a plant with primarily women workers. The organization of this plant had wage implications for union plants throughout the Nation. In addition to organizing the union at this plant, she established a kitchen and strike fund for them and classes on labor history. This was only the beginning of her efforts to improve the lives of workers and their families in the area. 
Geri was also a longtime activist in the Democratic party, serving as district chair, and coordinating campaigns from the local to the national levels. One of her proudest achievements was serving as Upper Peninsula Representative for U.S. Senator Phil Hart, who was renowned as the `conscience of the Senate.' She continued her service in Senator Don Riegle's U.P. office. From 1982 to 1991 she served on the Marquette County Board of Commissioners where she fought for economic development, mental health and services for seniors. She served on the Michigan Women's Commission for 6 years, during which time she pioneered legislation that allowed the Friend of the Court's office to garnish wages for child support. Most of our Nation now has similar legislation. 
Geri was a founder and longtime board member of the Marquette Women's Center. She continued her interest in and support of labor issues and was inducted into the U.P. Labor Hall of Fame this past September for her many efforts. She was deeply committed to equality and justice. Geri was also a friend, mentor, and role-model to countless people over the years. 
Geri's family was always very important to her and a source of joy and pride. She was married to Probate Judge Michael DeFant from 1952 until his death. They had three children, David, Dan, and Miriam, who survive her. Her warmth, humor, and dedication will be greatly missed by those of us who had the privilege to know Geri. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exceptional woman.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a constituent, a friend, a leader, and a great American. Jack Thompson recently retired from the Monroe Auto Equipment Co. in Michigan after a long and legendary career that is the embodiment of the American dream. 
Jack started working at Ford Motor Co. in 1957. He later rose from the factory floor to lead a billion-dollar automotive supply company. Along the way, Jack demonstrated what it is to be not only a great leader, but a great human being. Jack's respect for the people working the floor drove his manufacturing philosophy throughout his career. His experiences gave him a lifelong respect and admiration for these workers, who are the keystone of success for any company. 
Jack never measured success by a better title, a bigger office, or higher profits. Jack's success was measured by the success of his workers, whom he continuously cheered on and challenged. He has always been his workers biggest champion. A telling example of Jack's leadership qualities came in 1986 when Jack received the Monroe Management Club's first Manager of the Year Award. Voted by Jack's subordinates, peers, and superiors, the award recognized his excellence in not only what he accomplished, but also how he accomplished it. 
Twenty years ago, Jack put together a 10-point operating philosophy that he used and taught others. The first point on that list says a lot about how Jack approached business and life. It simply said, `be completely honest.' That's just one of the qualities that have made Jack a shining example to his workers, friends, and neighbors. 
I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Jack Thompson on his outstanding career.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr President, I would like to make my colleagues aware of an important event taking place in my home city of Detroit, MI--the opening of the new Museum of African-American History. The museum is unique in its size, scope and mission. 
Located in Detroit's Cultural Center, the 120,000 square foot Museum of African-American History is the largest museum in the Nation dedicated to documenting and celebrating the African-American experience. It is led by Kimberley Camp, who was the first African-American gallery director in the history of the Smithsonian Institute. Under Dr. Camp's leadership, the museum is poised to become a destination for tourists and researchers from around the country. The Detroit News recently reported that, `Camp wants every visitor's experience to be personal. Some may be moved by the reality of slave sleeping quarters and pieces of a slave ship. Others may be enchanted by an exhibit on quilting, an African-American tradition. Still others may appreciate an Africa exhibit that opens in June, exploring the continent's diversity.' 
The museum was designed by prominent Detroit architects Howard Sims and Harold Varner, of Sims-Varner and Associates, Inc. Using contemporary building materials, Mr. Sims and Mr. Varner created a building thoroughly American in design, but with significant accents which evoke African culture and traditions. Two Detroit artists, Richard Bennett and Hubert Massey, created the most striking of these accents. Mr. Bennett's massive African-style masks adorn the facade above the bronze front doors, which he also created. Mr. Massey's terrazzo tile mosaic, `Genealogy,' is interwoven with the floor in the rotunda. Crowning the rotunda is a glass and steel dome, the largest dome in southeastern Michigan. 
The central display in the museum will be the core exhibition, `Of the people: An African-American experience.' This exhibition will use historical artifacts, audio recordings, documents, and three-dimensional displays to take visitors through the totality of the African-American experience, from the first slave ships through the present day. Displays will also put into context the importance of African traditions in historical and modern American culture. Two additional galleries will be used for new and changing exhibits. 
The men and women of the new Museum of African-American History are committed to creating an institution which is truly a partner in the community. To that end, the museum will offer a lecture series, after-school programs for Detroit children, weekend workshops for children and adults and theatrical arts programs. 
The Museum never would have been built without the leadership of two remarkable mayors, Coleman Young and Dennis Archer, and without the financial support of the residents of Detroit and the corporate community. All of them came together and pledged their support for what will be the finest institution of its kind in the country. 
At the museum's grand opening on April 12, the U.S. Postal Service will unveil the winning design for the first stamp celebrating Kwanzaa. The Kwanzaa stamp, which has been designed by the internationally acclaimed artist Synthia Saint James, will highlight the importance of African traditions in the lives of so many Americans. Ms. Saint James is an accomplished author, poet, and award-winning illustrator of books for children and adults. She has previously been commissioned to create works of art for organizations like UNICEF, Dance Africa and the Girl Scouts of America. 
Mr. President, it is important that we recognize the incredible contributions African-Americans have made to our nation's cultural heritage. People of all races will learn and be touched by their experience at Detroit's Museum of African-American History. On the occasion of the museum's grand opening, I know my colleagues join me in congratulating the men and women who helped make this remarkable institution a reality.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of Arlyne Bochnek, who is retiring from her position as regional director of the central region United Synagogue Youth. In her 9-year career with central region USY, Mrs. Bochnek has provided leadership and guidance to numerous young people in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. 
Mrs. Bochnek has been deeply devoted to her organization and the teenagers who make up its membership. She planned activities that encouraged young people to put their religious faith into action by giving back to their communities. Under her direction, teenagers throughout the Midwest have painted inner-city churches, volunteered at schools for the blind and homes for the elderly, and spent days cleaning up the environment. In addition, central region USY raises money to support charities in the United States, Europe, and Israel. This year, with Mrs. Bochnek's guidance, the teenagers of central region USY expect to raise $17,000. 
Arlyne Bochnek has been a powerful, positive influence in the lives of so many young people over the past 9 years. Her commitment to improving our communities and helping young people recognize the importance of voluntarism should serve as an inspiration to us all. I know my colleagues join me in expressing my appreciation and gratitude to Arlyne Bochnek on the occasion of her retirement from central region United Synagogue Youth.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have the honor of paying tribute to a great civic and religious leader and a dear friend, Rev. Dr. Edgar Leo Vann, Jr. On April 13, 1997, Reverend Vann will be celebrating his 20th anniversary as pastor of the Second Ebeneezer Baptist Church in Detroit, MI. 
Reverend Vann has been a longtime champion of civil rights and social justice. He serves on the executive boards of numerous Michigan civic organizations, including the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, the Detroit Empowerment Zone Corp., the Michigan Commission of Human Rights, and the Detroit Urban League. 
As a member of the National Baptist Convention USA and the President of the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity, Reverend Vann is widely recognized as a religious leader. He currently ministers to more than 2,000 people at two consecutive Sunday services. Under his leadership, the Second Ebeneezer Baptist Church maintains more than 50 active ministries. 
One of Reverend Vann's most noted achievements in recent years was the purchase of a new home for his congregation. The new sanctuary was purchased in 1993 and, after extensive renovations, held its grand opening less than one year later. 
A religious and civic leader, Rev. Dr. Edgar L. Vann, Jr. has been an integral part of the Detroit community for many years and will continue to play an important role in the years ahead. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Reverend Vann on his 20 years as pastor of the Second Ebeneezer Baptist Church, and in wishing him well as he continues at the helm of this important Detroit institution.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will be voting on two resolutions later this morning. The first resolution, that of the majority leader, is a clearly partisan document, for a number of reasons which I will get into in a moment. The second resolution, which Senator Leahy and I have introduced, intends to carry out the spirit and the purpose of the independent counsel law without prejudging the Attorney General review and, unlike the first resolution of the majority leader, the alternative resolution includes allegations against Members of Congress. The majority leader's resolution, the first resolution we will be voting on, does not in its final clause, its action clause, make reference to congressional campaigns, but only to the Presidential campaign. 
The second resolution avoids prejudging the Attorney General's review, urges that the review be carried out without any political favoritism or any political pressure, and, perhaps most important, includes in that review Members of Congress and allegations against Members of Congress. 
The first resolution is a partisan document for a number of reasons. First, it mentions Democratic problems exclusively. Second, it omits what it should include, which is a review of activities of Members of Congress. And, third, it includes what it should omit, which is a prejudgment of the process of the law that it seeks to invoke. 
The independent counsel law provides that the Attorney General, upon receipt of certain specific information from a credible source against certain groups, including Members of Congress, shall take certain actions. It doesn't prejudge that action. The independent counsel law doesn't say that the Attorney General, in the absence of specific information from a credible source, will seek an independent counsel. It is only when those first two steps are taken where she determines that there is specific information from a credible source that then the independent counsel law says she shall seek or, in the case of Members of Congress or other than the specific covered officials, she may seek an independent counsel. 
The purpose of this law, in which I have been so deeply involved with Senator Cohen as my Republican counterpart in now three reauthorizations, the purpose of this law is to get an independent investigation of top Government officials at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue free from the taint of politics. That is the purpose of this law, to try to remove the allegations which swirl too often in election campaigns, or otherwise, that could involve criminal activities, to remove the consideration of those allegations against certain individuals and groups from partisan politics. 
The independent counsel law, as I said, covers really three 
groups. First, there are covered officials--the President, Vice President, Cabinet officials, a few named others. Where there is specific information from a credible source that a crime may have been committed by one of these covered officials, then the Attorney General, if she finds those things have occurred, she must seek an independent counsel. 
The second group is other persons where she might have a conflict of interest. 
And the third group is Members of Congress, where, in the case the first steps have been taken and there is specific information from a credible source, then she may, if she determines it is in the public interest, seek an independent counsel. It is that third group which is omitted from the majority leader's resolution. 
The law specifically provides for certain congressional participation through the Judiciary Committee. This is very important as the Supreme Court, in upholding this law in the case of Morrison versus Olson, made special reference to the fact that the involvement of the Congress was limited because the Supreme Court ruled under the separation of powers doctrine that the Congress could not control the independent counsel process. And so the Supreme Court, in the Morrison case, pointed out that the involvement of Congress was limited to members of the Judiciary Committee writing a letter to the Attorney General which, in turn, would trigger a report from her within 30 days. That is what the independent counsel law provides. 
This resolution goes way beyond that, because it would put the Senate on record, albeit in a nonbinding way, nonetheless the full Senate on record, which is far different than a letter from members of the Judiciary Committee. 
I have indicated the partisan nature of the first resolution that we are going to be voting on. Let me just give a few examples of allegations made against Members of Congress or others than those that would be covered by this resolution, particularly in the area of tax-exempt organizations. 
Just 2 months ago, the specially appointed investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee released a unanimous bipartisan report relative to Speaker Gingrich. 
Here is what that bipartisan report found. This is a quote:  
The subcommittee found that in regard to two projects, Mr. Gingrich engaged in activity involving 501(c)(3) organizations that was substantially motivated by partisan, political goals. 
The subcommittee also found--these are the words of the subcommittee--that `it was clear that Mr. Gingrich intended'--I emphasize the word `intended'--`that the [American Opportunities Workshop] and Renewing American Civilization Projects'--those are the 501(c)(3)'s--`have substantial partisan, political purposes.' 
The subcommittee said--this is a bipartisan report--that `In addition, he was aware that political activities in the context of 501(c)(3) organizations were problematic.' 
Mr. President, it is illegal for 501(c)(3) organizations to participate in partisan activities. It violates the law. Yet, you have here a bipartisan subcommittee of the House that finds that Mr. Gingrich, in regard to two projects, engaged in activity that was motivated by partisan goals and that he intended--he intended--that those projects--I am using their words-- `have substantial partisan, political purposes' and `he was aware that political activities in the context of 501(c)(3) organizations were problematic.' 
You talk about specific information from a credible source. Pretty specific, pretty credible, bipartisan subcommittee of the House of Representatives, part of the ethics committee. And yet, in the first resolution that we will be voting on, no suggestion to the Attorney General that she review the possibility that the public interest requires her to seek an independent counsel relative to Members of Congress. Only the Presidential election is in the `action' clause in the resolution before us. No reference to anything but Democratic activities in the `whereas' clause. 
There are other tax exempts that should be considered by the Attorney General as provided for by the independent counsel--$4.5 million went from the Republican National Committee to a tax-exempt group called Americans for Tax Reform. 
According to the Washington Post, 20 million pieces of mail were sent out by that organization, millions of phone calls in 150 congressional districts. They even put on television ads in States, and in one State against a colleague of ours, attacking him for not showing up for work. `That is wrong,' said the television ad. This is by an organization that is not supposed to engage in partisan activity, putting on television ads attacking somebody who is running for Congress, for the Senate, in this case. 
A group using the same offices as Americans for Tax Reform, also a tax-exempt group, puts on an ad on television saying the following: `When Clinton was running, he promised a middle-class tax cut. Then he raised my taxes. He was just lying to get elected. This year he'll lie some more . . .' 
That is a tax-exempt group that is not supposed to be putting on partisan ads, but the resolution of the majority leader does not provide that the Attorney General will look into that kind of activity by tax exempts; only Democrats are mentioned and only the Presidential election is mentioned.

Mr. LEVIN. When the Senator says it was never intended that the independent counsel go after a Member of Congress, I must yield myself 2 minutes to answer that. 
The law specifically provides that when the Attorney General determines it would be in the public interest, that indeed she `may seek'--I am quoting the law--`an independent counsel for or relating to Members of Congress.' 
It is very specific in the law. And I just used the exact words, reading. Members of Congress are included in this law. Indeed, it was the current majority in this body that insisted that Members of Congress be included in the law and wanted to make it mandatory, and now they are left out of the resolution of the majority leader. 
The ultimate resolution was to make it discretionary where the Attorney General found it in the public interest to do so. But the majority in this body had determined that Members of Congress be included. They were included, left discretionary, but it is very precise. 
If I can disagree with my dear friend, it is very precise that Members of the Congress are included in the independent counsel law when it is determined by the Attorney General it would be in the public interest. 
I will use 1 more minute. 
The pressure that the Senator from Utah talks about, which he presumes comes from the White House--if it does--is wrong. We should not compound any such alleged pressure if, in fact, it exists by putting pressure on her by this legislative body. Pressure from any source is wrong. If the White House pressures her, it is wrong. 
By the way, she has shown tremendous independence, tremendous independence when it comes to the selection of a decision to seek an independent counsel. This Attorney General has shown no reluctance to seek the appointment of independent counsel. 
So if there is pressure, there should not be pressure from any source, White House or Congress. That is exactly why this first resolution, it seems to me, runs so counter to the spirit of the independent counsel law, because it does explicitly put pressure on her. It jumps to a conclusion as to what she should find at the end of a process. We should not do it. If anybody else is doing it, they should not do it. We should not do it.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the iron men of our judicial system, Judge Fred J. Borchard, who has served the State of Michigan for over 50 years. Judge Borchard's tenure marks the longest term of service of any Michigan judge in history. 
Judge Borchard put himself through the University of Michigan and its law school by working various full time jobs. His law practice was postponed while he served his country as a forward gun observer in the Pacific theater during World War II. In 1947, he was elected municipal judge and in 1954, he was elected Probate Judge. 
In 1958, Gov. G. Mennen Williams appointed Judge Borchard to the Saginaw circuit bench, where he served until his retirement in 1989. Since then, he has continued to serve Michigan by filling in for judges away on vacations and conferences. 
Judge Borchard's love of law has kept him fully engaged during his long service on the bench. His court was known for its courteous and efficient atmosphere where citizens could settle their disputes. He wholeheartedly believes in the ability of our legal system to make a positive difference in our lives. It is these traits that have made Judge Borchard a favorite among his colleagues, constituents and contemporaries. Judge Borchard has been a leader in his community as well. He has served in the University of Michigan Club, Germania of Saginaw, and the Kiwanis Club of Saginaw. He has served on the Board of Directors of both St. Luke's Hospital and the Saginaw County Chamber of Commerce. He has also shown his commitment to serving others through the work he has done with his church. 
Judge Borchard was married to the late Helen Fay Honeywell for almost 50 years, and they had four children Fred, Barb, Jim, and Sara. They have carried on Judge Borchard's ideals of service to the public in their own lives. Judge Borchard has been married to Dorothy Denton for the past 5 years. 
I know my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring Judge Fred J. Borchard for his 50 historic years of service to the State of Michigan's judicial system.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is only one reason the Senate is being asked by the majority leader's resolution to intervene in the independent counsel process which is being considered by the Attorney General. The reason is partisan politics, pure and simple. It is regrettable for many reasons, particularly following last week's determination by the full Senate to support a broad and fair and evenhanded investigation by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee into campaign finance practices in the 1996 election--Presidential and congressional, House and Senate, Republican and Democratic. In doing that last week, we recognized as a body that abuses in campaign fundraising are not in the exclusive domain of either political party, or either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. We confirm the view, as stated in the Governmental Affairs Committee report, in support of funding a broad scope investigation that: 
The committee intends to investigate allegations of improper activities by all, Republicans, Democrats, or other political partisans. It will investigate specific activities, not the political party against which the allegations are made. 
But now, in a partisan attempt to reestablish the focus of the press and the public on just the Democratic National Committee and just the Clinton-Gore campaign, the majority leadership brings this resolution to the floor. The very wording of the resolution reveals its partisan objective. Nothing in the resolution mentions activities in connection with the Republican National Committee, or the fundraising activities of Members of Congress. The resolution mentions possible Democratic problems exclusively and calls upon the Attorney General to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate only allegations against Democrats. It is an unbalanced, partisan piece of work, and I expect it will receive the unbalanced partisan vote that it deserves. 
But in addition to the reversal that it reflects of the Senate's unified position on a broad, bipartisan investigation into campaign finance reform, it does damage to the very law that it is seeking to invoke. For the past 18 years I have served as either chairman or ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee with jurisdiction over the independent counsel law. I have been actively involved in three authorizations of this important statute. And having experienced and studied the history of this law, it is apparent to me that this resolution runs directly counter to the fundamental purpose of the independent counsel law. 
The independent counsel law was enacted in the aftermath of Watergate. The Watergate Committee recommended, and Congress agreed, that we needed an established process by which criminal investigations of our top Government officials could be conducted in an independent manner free from any taint of favoritism or politics. This was necessary, we decided, in order to maintain the public's confidence in one of the basic principles of our democracy--that this is a country that follows the rule of law. We established a process whereby the Attorney General would follow certain established procedures in reviewing allegations of criminal wrongdoing by top Government officials and decide at certain stages whether to ask a special court to appoint a person from the private sector to take over the investigation and conduct it independently from the chain of command at the Department of Justice. We wanted the public to have confidence that investigations into alleged criminal conduct by top Government officials were no less aggressive--and I might add no more aggressive--than any such investigation of the average citizen. We particularly wanted to take any suggestion of partisanship out of the investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking process. 
So here is what we did. We established the requirement that if the Attorney General receives specific information from a credible source that a crime, other than a class B or C misdemeanor, has been committed by certain enumerated top Government officials, the Attorney General has to conduct a threshold inquiry lasting no more than 30 days, to determine if the allegation is frivolous or legitimate. The top officials who trigger this so-called mandatory provision of the act are the President and Vice President, the Cabinet Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of the executive branch departments, plus very top White House officials who are paid a salary at least as high as Cabinet Secretaries or Deputy Secretaries, and in addition the chairman and treasurer or other top officials of the President's campaign committee. 
If, after that threshold inquiry, the Attorney General determines that there is specific information from a credible source that a crime may have been committed, the Attorney General must then conduct a preliminary investigation lasting no more than 90 days in which she gathers evidence to determine whether further investigation is warranted. If, after the conclusion of the 90-day period, the Attorney General determines that further investigation is warranted with respect to a covered official, then she must seek the appointment of an independent counsel. The Attorney General is required by law to seek such appointment from a special court made up of three article III judges appointed for 2-year terms by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. 
The independent counsel law also has a provision that gives the Attorney General the discretion--and I repeat the discretion--to seek an independent counsel where there is a criminal allegation against a noncovered official and the Attorney General determines that the Department of Justice has a political, personal, or financial conflict of interest with respect to the investigation. 
There must still be specific information from a credible source that a crime may have been committed and a preliminary investigation to determine whether further investigation is warranted. Use of this provision is contemplated where the Attorney General or top Justice Department employees may have been personally involved in the matters under investigation or where the Attorney General has an unusually close personal relationship with the subject of the investigation. 
A third provision of the independent counsel law provides that the Attorney General may seek the appointment of an independent counsel relative to allegations against Members of Congress. The independent counsel law provides that if the Attorney General receives specific information from a credible source that a crime may have been committed by a Member of Congress, she can determine whether the continued investigation of that allegation should be conducted by the Department of Justice or whether it is in the public interest that the investigation be conducted by an independent counsel. Like the conflict of interest provision, this is a discretionary authority, but it is one the Attorney General has available to her in matters involving Members of Congress. 
In crafting the independent counsel law, Congress contemplated a role for Congress with respect to the appointment of an independent counsel in a specific case. We included a provision that is tailored to the purposes of the law. The independent counsel law explicitly provides that the appropriate avenue for congressional comment on the appointment of an independent counsel is through action of the Judiciary Committee. The law provides that either a majority of the majority party or a majority of the minority party may request the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel acting in the Judiciary Committee. Upon receipt of such a letter, the law provides that the Attorney General must respond in writing to the authors of the letter explaining `whether the Attorney General has begun or will begin a preliminary investigation' under the independent counsel law setting forth `the reasons for the Attorney General's decision regarding such preliminary investigation as it relates to each of the matters with respect to which the congressional request is made. If there is such a preliminary investigation, the report shall include the date on which the preliminary investigation began or will begin.' 
The Attorney General is not obligated to trigger the statute when she receives such a letter. She is not required to initiate a threshold inquiry or conduct a preliminary investigation. She is only required to respond within 30 days, as I have indicated before. That is the process that we provided in the independent counsel law for Congress to express an opinion in triggering the statute. 
Now, why did we adopt that procedure specifically in the statute? We wanted to provide an opportunity for congressional expression in a moderate way. We did not say the Senate or the House could trigger the required report by resolution, thereby raising the stakes and increasing the level of possible partisan bickering. We provided for members of the Judiciary Committee to make the request to the Attorney General, and we required of her only that she respond in writing to the letter in a 30-day period in the manner indicated. So we channeled congressional concerns about the appointment of an independent counsel into a low-key, limited process to keep partisan politics at bay. 
We also established this limited process because central to this law is the constitutional requirement that the Attorney General control the triggering of the statute. Congress as a whole is constitutionally prohibited from forcing the Attorney General to seek an independent counsel. In fact, when the constitutional challenge to the independent counsel law was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of Morrison versus Olson, the Supreme Court based its finding of constitutionality for the law upon the fundamental principle followed in the statute that the Attorney General has full authority to exercise her discretion free of congressional control. 
The Supreme Court said the following in Morrison versus Olson:  
We observe first that this case does not involve an attempt by Congress to increase its powers at the expense of the executive branch . . . Indeed, with the exception of the power of impeachment--which applies to all officers of the United States--Congress retained for itself no powers of control or supervision over an independent counsel. The act does empower certain members of Congress to request the Attorney General to apply for the appointment of an independent counsel, but the Attorney General has no duty to comply with the request, although he must respond within a certain time limit . . . Other than that, Congress' role under the Act is limited to receiving reports or other information and oversight of the independent counsel's activities, functions that we have recognized generally as being incidental to the legislative function of Congress. 
The resolution before us would tend to undermine that basic principle of this law. It also does undermine the nonpartisan spirit which has been so important to this law's operation. This law has been reauthorized in this Chamber at the 
instigation, I believe, at least on the last three occasions, of then Senator Bill Cohen, Republican from Maine, and myself. We always did it on a bipartisan basis. We always told each other it was critical to this law's functioning that it be implemented carefully as written and not be undermined by bipartisan efforts to use it to its advantage in this most political body. 
That is why as an alternative to the majority leader's resolution I have introduced, with Senator Leahy, a resolution which simply urges the Attorney General to follow the law as it is written, to do her job with respect to all three of her powers to invoke the statute: The mandatory coverage of covered officials in the executive branch, the conflict of interest provision, and the Members of Congress provision. And it asks her to consider all allegations involving Federal elections, Democratic and Republican, Congress and the President, and to do so free of any political considerations. 
The majority leader's resolution is problematic both for what it leaves out and what it includes. It leaves out any reference to allegations against Members of Congress and the Republican Party, and it includes conclusory language with respect to the allegations against the White House and the Democratic Party. The resolution leaps to judgment and purports to make the very judgments about possible criminality which the statute and the Constitution reserve for the Attorney General. 
The majority leader's resolution very clearly leaves out the same group which some in this body tried to leave out of the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation, allegations against Members of Congress. 
Let us just look at some of the activity that the majority leader's resolution would rather the Attorney General ignore that is not referenced in this resolution at all. 
A few months ago, when the 105th Congress first got underway, the media was filled with articles about Speaker Newt Gingrich and his misuse of alleged tax-exempt organizations to further partisan political ends. 
On January 17, 1997, a specially-appointed investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee released a unanimous bipartisan report which presented the following conclusions: 
The subcommittee found that in regard to two projects, Mr. Gingrich engaged in activity involving 501(c)(3) organizations that was substantially motivated by partisan political goals. The subcommittee also found that Mr. Gingrich provided the committee with material information about one of those projects that was inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable. 
The two projects referred to, a television course called `American Opportunities Workshop,' and a college course called `Renewing American Civilization,' were largely paid for with tax-exempt donations to two tax-exempt groups, the American Lincoln Opportunity Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation. 
The House bipartisan report notes that tax-exempt groups are not allowed to engage in partisan political activities. It states that even Mr. Gingrich's tax counsel, `said that he would not have recommended the use of 501(c)(3) organizations to sponsor the course because the combination of politics and 501(c)(3) organizations is an `explosive mix,' almost certain to draw the attention of the IRS.' 
The unanimous bipartisan report of the House ethics investigative subcommittee went on to make the following notable findings:  
Based on the evidence, it was clear that Mr. Gingrich intended that the [American Opportunities Workshop] and renewing American civilization projects have substantial partisan political purposes. 
This is a bipartisan finding, that Mr. Gingrich `intended' that those two projects have `substantial partisan political purposes.' And the subcommittee went on: 
In addition, he was aware that political activities in the context of 501(c)(3) organizations were problematic. Prior to embarking on these projects, [the committee wrote] Mr. Gingrich had been involved with another organization that had direct experience with the private benefit prohibition in a political context, the American Campaign Academy. In a 1989 tax court opinion [the subcommittee continued] issued less than a year before Mr. Gingrich set the [American Opportunities Workshop] projects into motion, the academy was denied its exemption under 501(c)(3) because, although educational, it conferred an impermissible private benefit on Republican candidates and entities. Close associates of Mr. Gingrich were principals in the American Campaign Academy. Mr. Gingrich taught at the academy, and Mr. Gingrich had been briefed at the time on the tax controversy surrounding the academy. 
And the investigative subcommittee over in the House continued: 
Taking into account Mr. Gingrich's background, experience, and sophistication with respect to tax-exempt organizations, and his status as a Member of Congress obligated to maintain high ethical standards, the Subcommittee concluded that Mr. Gingrich should have known to seek appropriate legal advice. . . . Had he sought and followed such advice . . . 501(c)(3) organizations would not have been used to sponsor Mr. Gingrich's [American Opportunities Workshop] and Renewing American Civilization projects. 
Now, that unanimous, bipartisan report was issued 2 months ago. It raises, directly, explicitly, serious questions about the deliberate and illegal misuse of tax-exempt organizations by a prominent Member of Congress, and false statements to Congress. The House Ethics Committee report found that Speaker Gingrich intentionally used two tax-exempt organizations for partisan political purposes, even after having been specifically denied tax-exempt status for another organization in 1989 because of the partisan nature of that organization's work. How revealing it is that the resolution before us, of the majority leader, does not mention one word of that entire matter--not a word. 
And even leaving aside the issue of Mr. Gingrich, given the campaign season just behind us, it is also revealing that the resolution before us makes no mention in any way of the tax-exempt organizations that played so prominent a role in the 1996 election. Congress made a decision many years ago that we wanted to give a break to charities and civic organizations devoted to working for public purposes, but we didn't want to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize partisan political activities by these organizations. Blatant violations of the legal limits on partisan political activity appear to have taken place during the 1996 election cycle by a number of tax-exempt organizations. Let us just look at two examples. 
In the last months of the 1996 election cycle, the Republican National Committee transferred $4.6 million to Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that is exempt from paying taxes. Grover Norquist, the president of tax-exempt Americans for Tax Reform, was quoted in one Washington Post article as stating that in the last weeks before the 1996 election, his organization sent out 20 million pieces of mail and paid for millions of phone calls in 150 congressional districts. Much of this last-minute activity was made possible by the Republican National Committee's $4.6 million contribution. That is according to the article. 
An Associated Press article that came out in October of 1996 quoted Mr. Norquist as saying that his group was sending out a last-minute, $3 million mailing to reinforce Republican antitax messages and that `two-thirds of the money came from the GOP.' 
Mr. Norquist indicated in the Washington Post article that his group didn't pay for televised political ads, but there is evidence to the contrary. An ad broadcast in the New Jersey Senate campaign states that it was paid for by the tax-exempt Americans for Tax Reform. The ad directly attacks the Democratic candidate for missing votes. Here is a sample: 
Taxpayers pay liberal Bob Torricelli $133,000 a year, but he doesn't show up for work. That's wrong. 
That ad was broadcast in the final weeks of the campaign. It presumably cost a great deal of money to air and may have been paid for with those RNC funds. 
Americans for Tax Reform also sponsored what was designated facetiously as a special award for Members of Congress, in the last weeks of the 1996 campaign. The award was called the `Enemy of the Taxpayer' award, and it was given to 34 Members of Congress, none of whom were Republicans. The press release issued by Americans for Tax Reform contained a quotes from Mr. Norquist, directly attacking the Democratic Party. 
That is not all. A group called Women for Tax Reform, operating out of the same office as Americans for Tax Reform, was created in late August 1996, to launch a national television advertising campaign. It announced its first two ads, both of which consisted of a woman directly attacking President Clinton. One included the following statement: 
When Clinton was running, he promised a middle-class tax cut. Then he raised my taxes. He was just lying to get elected. This year, he'll lie some more. 
The activity that I have just described, TV ads, direct mail, phone calls, and Enemy of the Taxpayer awards, are as partisan as anything I have seen in my years in politics. These activities were directed at Federal candidates, they were timed to happen in the last weeks before the Federal elections, and they were apparently paid for by millions of dollars in contributions given to the tax-exempt Americans for Tax Reform, including millions from the RNC. 
The president of Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist, is routinely described by the Washington Times as a GOP strategist. In 1995, he published a book called `Rock the House' celebrating the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, for which Speaker Newt Gingrich provided the introduction. The quotes inside the cover of his own book reveal much about the man running this tax-exempt organization. 
Rush Limbaugh states, `Grover Norquist is perhaps the most influential and important person you've never heard of in the GOP today.' 
Haley Barbour, RNC chairman, writes, `Rock the House' is a true insider's account of the Republican revolution of 1994.' 
Paul Gigot, a Wall Street Journal columnist and television commentator portrays Mr. Norquist as `one of the main power brokers in the new Republican majority.' 
Mr. Norquist is described by these persons--each of whom he chose to feature in quotations designed to promote his book--as a Republican insider and power broker. That isn't exactly the profile one would expect for what is supposed to be a nonpartisan, tax exempt group. 
So, what are the possible violations? What are the possible violations of criminal law? The list might include: Knowing and willful violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act and false statements to the IRS in violation of 26 United States Code 7206 or 18 United States Code 1001. 
Let me describe another tax-exempt group. This one has not been around for very long. It is called Citizens for Reform. It incorporated in Virginia in May 1996, was granted tax-exempt status in June 1996. Its articles of incorporation state that the group's purpose is: 
. . . to serve the public interest and to promote the social welfare by fostering and developing greater public participation, on a nonpartisan basis, in the national debate concerning the size, scope, growth and responsibility of government and of the impact of government on the community, the private sector, and citizens in all walks of life. 
This group stated that it expected to conduct conferences, seminars, public events, research, and studies. In its application for tax-exempt status, which is, by law, a publicly available document, the group states that it does not have any membership dues, contributions or gifts in 1996, and projects raising only $1,000 in revenue in 1997 and another $1,000 in 1998. 
This group, Citizens for Reform, stated that it had no plans to spend `any money attempting to influence' any elections. Within months of its creation, this tax-exempt group, however, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on television and radio ads targeting Federal candidates, and brimming with the intensely partisan type of campaign rhetoric. Ads paid for by this group appear in California, Montana, New York, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania. The group now, apparently, admits spending $2 million in the 5 months before election day. 
One TV ad specifically targeted a Democratic candidate for Congress in Montana, Bill Yellowtail. Here is an excerpt from this ad:  
He preaches family values, but he takes a swing at his wife. Yellowtail's explanation: he only slapped her once but her nose was not broken. 
That is supposed to be nonpartisan activity? 
Another TV ad directly targeting a Democratic Congressman, Cal Dooley in California. Here is a sample: 
Cal Dooley said no to increased money for drug enforcement. Instead, Dooley gave your money to radical lawyers who represented drug dealers. 
How is that for another nonpartisan ad?

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and my good friend from Vermont. 
The majority leader's resolution omits what it should include, which is the Attorney General's review of activities of Members of Congress, and it includes what it should omit, by prejudging the very investigation by the Attorney General that it seeks. It thereby does a disservice to the Nation, which is awaiting an objective and fair review, and it undermines the independent counsel law which is dependent upon a nonpolitical application free from partisan pressure. 
An alternative resolution that I and Senator Leahy will be offering will urge the Attorney General to make a thorough and fair review of the allegations, free from political pressure, to reach whatever conclusion is appropriate as to the persons covered by the statute, as to persons not covered by the statute where there might be a conflict of interest, and as to Members of Congress where the public interest indicates that an 
independent counsel might be the proper course for her to pursue. 
This alternative resolution we will be offering embodies the spirit of the independent counsel law. It permits the process invoked by the Judiciary Committee a few days ago to proceed without interference by this body. That letter was sent by Republican members of the Judiciary Committee to the Attorney General asking her to appoint an independent counsel. The law requires her to answer that request within 30 days. We should not prejudge that process that the law provides for, and we should not prejudge the Attorney General's answer. We should stand by the process which was established in the independent counsel law and not give in to this partisan effort. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder, while my good friend from Virginia is on the floor, if he would comment on a statement which he made yesterday and which the Senator from New Jersey made reference to indirectly, and that is the question as to whether or not the word `illegal' is broader than the word `criminal.' 
Yesterday, the good chairman of the Rules Committee said the following, and I am wondering if the Senator from New Jersey might also listen to this, because it gets to the very critical point which was raised by his comments. The chairman of the Rules Committee said yesterday that the Rules Committee gave `the Governmental Affairs Committee a scope of the investigation and illegal,' he said, `illegal is a very broad scope.' He added, `It goes beyond. And I will at a later time today put in the Record the definitions of illegal.' 
But this is now the key sentence from my good friend from Virginia: `But it goes beyond just criminal assertions of allegations of criminal violations. It goes beyond that.' 
That is at the bottom of page 2057. 
The chairman of the Rules Committee is assuring the Senate that the definition of `illegal' goes beyond `criminal,' and that is in keeping with, I think, a common understanding of the word `illegal.' 
I don't know whether the chairman put the definitions of `illegal' into the Record. We were unable to find them. 
So my first question of the chairman of the Rules Committee would be whether or not those definitions have now been put into the Record.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the question that I put to the 
Senator from Virginia is very important in terms of the future of this investigation, and his answer reasserting today what he said yesterday, which is that the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee will go beyond criminal assertions and goes to civil violations of law as well as criminal violations of law, will help clarify a very important question for the committee down the road. I thank him for that. 
It leaves open a huge question as to whether we ought to be able to look into improper practices, corrupt practices that are not technically violations of law, but nonetheless it is helpful, and I want to thank my friend from Virginia for that. I want to get to this question next.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that response, and I also point out that response comes from the chairman of the Rules Committee, who is a sponsor of the pending resolution. This Senate, I think, has a right to traditionally place great stock in the sponsors' interpretation of his own resolution. That is precisely what I believe the Senate will be doing when we vote, because even though we differ as to whether or not the scope should get to practices which should be made illegal, practices which are offensive, or practices which violate what the public wants us to be doing, nonetheless the fact that the chairman of the Rules Committee is asserting to the Senate that the word illegal in his judgment and his intention as the drafter of this resolution goes to both--goes to any violation of law, not just a criminal violation, is a very important statement for the Senate and for the future of this investigation. 
Following that statement, I ask my good friend from Virginia the following: That under his interpretation, therefore, would the Governmental Affairs Committee be able to investigate violations of the Federal Elections Campaign Act?

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what we have here is, I believe, the first time that the U.S. Senate is going to remove from a committee of jurisdiction its right to investigate something that has been within its jurisdiction traditionally, as has corruption and improper practices. They have been looked into by the Governmental Affairs Committee over the decades. They are specifically referred, in Senate Resolution 54, to the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
I don't think there is any doubt in anybody's mind--and I will ask the question again--that the Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction to investigate improper practices. Now, that doesn't mean the Rules Committee doesn't have jurisdiction to legislate. It does. But it means that the committee of jurisdiction--this is one of the great investigatory committees of this body, traditionally, which has looked into illegal practices, and legal practices which should be made illegal--is being taken off the case, is being told that what is within its jurisdiction cannot be investigated, even though the unanimous vote of the Governmental Affairs Committee was to investigate improper practices. 
There is no doubt, I don't think, in anybody's mind that we have that jurisdiction, which is the reason why this amendment is before us, which is to remove the jurisdiction of the committee into improper and corrupt practices with respect to the 1996 Federal elections. That is what we will be voting on today--whether or not the U.S. Senate wants to take that power away from a committee that has jurisdiction to look into and investigate improper and corrupt practices. It is unprecedented. 
Now, does the Rules Committee have legislative jurisdiction? Yes. But the Governmental Affairs Committee has investigative jurisdiction. I don't think anybody doubts that we have investigative jurisdiction, should we seek to exercise it and look into improper and corrupt practices. I haven't heard anybody allege that. As a matter of fact, the reason the amendment is pending before us is to remove that jurisdiction from us when it comes to campaign finance reform. I wonder if the Senator from Ohio would yield 3 additional minutes to me.

Mr. LEVIN. This is an unprecedented removal of jurisdiction from a Senate committee that is seeking to exercise what is within 
its jurisdiction by Senate rule, by Senate resolution--Senate Resolution 54--which specifically refers to improper and corrupt practices, and by precedent. 
Now, why are we doing this? Why is the majority about to tell a committee that has jurisdiction to investigate that it may not do so? The answer is, the fear that there will be momentum given to campaign finance reform. That is the issue. It is that fear that so terrorizes, apparently, some in the majority of this body that if there is an investigation carried out by the Governmental Affairs Committee, which it now has jurisdiction to carry out, it will somehow or other give momentum to something which, apparently, a majority of the majority does not want. 
But this is unprecedented, and we are skating now out on a pond which this Senate, I don't believe, has done before. I have heard my good friend from Virginia say, `Well, there is no legislative authority in Governmental Affairs in the area of campaign finance reform.' That's true. But we have investigative authority. There is no authority in the Governmental Affairs Committee to get involved in recommending changes in the criminal law. We don't have jurisdiction to legislate in the area of the criminal law, generally. That is in the area of the Judiciary Committee. Yet, we are left with the jurisdiction here to investigate illegal activities, even though we don't have legislative jurisdiction, for the most part, in the area of criminal law. 
Where is the logic here? We are told you can't legislate in the area of campaign finance reform. Therefore, we are not going to let you investigate, even though you otherwise would have jurisdiction to do so.

<DOCNO>105-levin-mi-28-19970311</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, then if I could conclude, let me reiterate what I said as I think it is still accurate. If we adopt this resolution today, we will be removing from the Governmental Affairs Committee a jurisdiction which it now has to investigate corrupt practices, improper practices, practices which should be made illegal, practices which we could investigate within the Senate Resolution 54 jurisdiction of our committee--the current jurisdiction of our committee would allow us to look at improper practices, but what the pending resolution tells us, if it is adopted and becomes the final expression of this body's will, what the pending resolution tells us is Governmental Affairs, with this special fund which we are providing you to look into the 1996 election, you may not do what you otherwise can. You may not look into improper practices with this fund, although you could normally look into improper practices with the funds that we provide to you. 
Now, why the difference? Why are we told when it comes to look at the 1996 election that we cannot exercise the same jurisdiction, look into the same type of practices, corrupt, improper practices that have an odor, why are we being told we cannot do that with the funds that are given to us specially to look into the 1996 election? 
The answer is very obvious. The answer is that there is a fear on the part of a majority of the majority that such an investigation will get into the area of soft money, which is legal--part of it we believe is illegal, but most of it is probably legal. And so we are being told that with this sum of money being given specially to look at the 1996 election, we cannot look at what is legal in the area of soft money, even though it has an odor to it, even though its purpose is to evade the current law, even though it allows corporations to give millions of dollars to campaigns when the clear purpose of current law is that corporations not give money to candidates in elections. 
That is the purpose of the pending amendment from the Rules Committee. We should have no doubt about what its purpose is. It is to restrict the investigation so that the Governmental Affairs Committee cannot do with this money that is given to us to look into the 1996 elections, cannot do what we have traditionally done with all other funds given to the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is to look into improper practices or unethical practices or practices which should be made illegal. 
We are told that with this funding that we are being given to look into the 1996 election, that we cannot do what we could do with the funds that were given to us under Senate Resolution 54, and which have traditionally been part of the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
I am going to close by reading this resolution language again because it is so important. Senate Resolution 54 is what gives the Governmental Affairs Committee its mandate. It is now the law. It is what is in place. It is what we are operating under in Governmental Affairs. And Senate Resolution 54 says, on page 16 and 17 that:  
The committee, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof, is authorized to * * * investigate--* * * corruption * * * unethical practices * * * and any and all such improper practices between Government personnel and corporations, individuals, companies, or persons affiliated therewith, doing business with the Government* * *. 
That authority given to us in Senate Resolution 54 to look into corruption and unethical practices and improper practices, we will not be allowed to exercise when it comes to the use of this special fund that is given to us for the purpose of looking into the 1996 elections. 
The argument technically is: But you don't have legislative authority in campaign finance reform. That is true. We don't have legislative authority to amend the criminal laws either, but we are allowed to look into illegal practices. There is utterly no logic in this. 
The argument which was used to restrict this funding to illegal practices was: Governmental Affairs doesn't have legislative authority--which is true--to legislate in the area of campaign finance reform. But we do not have legislative authority to legislate relative to illegal practices either, but we are allowed, in fact we are restricted, in terms of our investigation, to the area of illegal practices. So the logic for this restriction is not there. What is there, and I think a number of Members of the majority have been very open about this, is that they do not want us to give any momentum to the reform movement in the area of campaign finance. And the fear is there, that if the Governmental Affairs Committee investigates within the area of its traditional jurisdiction, improper practices, unethical practices, and corruption as we have in Senate Resolution 54--if we do that, the fear is that we will somehow or other give a boost to campaign finance reform. And to that I say: Amen, it is long overdue. 
And what is unprecedented, unprecedented, is the restriction of a fund to prevent a committee from looking into an area which it has traditionally looked into. That is what is unprecedented. It is something which the public, I believe, will totally disagree with. I believe this institution will regret doing it, because it sets a precedent for this institution which is not a wise precedent. And I do not think it will withstand the scrutiny, either of the public or of the media. 
What we are left with will be this. If this resolution passes in the form that it is now in from the Rules Committee, or something like it, we will then be limited to illegal, which I am happy to hear, at least in the opinion of the chairman of the Rules Committee, includes both civil as well as criminal illegality. And I presume we will do the best that we can with that. But we all ought to realize that what is off the table, 
as far as this investigation is concerned, by Governmental Affairs Committee--what has been removed, taken away from us, restricted, is the bright light of day into what is currently legal but which should be, at least arguably, made illegal. 
I thank the Chair and I also thank my friend from Virginia. As always, he has shown great courtesy in terms of attempting to respond to inquiries on the floor, and to helping this institution work its way through some very difficult issues. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank him for that. Soft money is most of the money that is out there. It is the unregulated money. It is the millions. 
As it turns out, under the current definition, if I could just ask my good friend to yield for 1 more minute, under the current definition by the Attorney General and Boyden Gray--who was the counsel for President Bush, they both agree on this--I cannot use my phone, even a cell phone, at my own expense in my office, to solicit a contribution to my campaign for $100. I cannot do that, even using my own cell phone in my office. But I can use my Government phone to solicit $1 million for the Democratic National Committee, right from my office. That is the current state of the law. That is the soft money `exception,' which is really the rule, because it is most of the money which is now received. 
But to answer my friend's question, I was very careful saying what is off the table, as far as the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation is concerned, if this resolution is adopted in its current form, will be the investigation into what is currently legal in the area of soft money, independent expenditures. I did not comment on what the Rules Committee might or might not do, and that is going to be in the good judgment of the Rules Committee and its chairman and ranking member.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have been able to make significant progress this afternoon on this resolution. Adding back the term `improper' has brought this investigation, basically, back to where members of the Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously intended it to be. We returned to a broader investigation: both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, both parties. It is only through this kind of a bipartisan investigation will this investigation, indeed, bear fruit. It is a positive conclusion to what was turning out to be an unfortunate development in the history of the Senate in its power to investigate. 
On the other hand, on the procedures questions, I was going to offer an amendment to attempt to establish procedures for how we conduct this investigation on a bipartisan basis. Based on the progress that we made in restoring the breadth of the investigation, and based on private conversations that we have had with Senator Thompson and Senators Glenn, Daschle, Lott and others, I became sufficiently optimistic about the conduct of this investigation that I was able to waive my right to offer an amendment as others have waived their rights to offer amendments relative to this resolution. 
I have looked at 10 prior resolutions, which initiated major congressional investigations, and in all 10 cases, bipartisan procedures were adopted either in the resolution creating the investigation or by the committee shortly thereafter. So I would like to engage the chairman of the committee, the distinguished chairman, in a colloquy and ask a few questions about procedures. One of them is a general question. 
I am wondering whether or not my friend, the chairman, would agree that one of the first orders of business for the committee following approval of this resolution would be to attempt to establish procedures, bipartisan procedures, for the conduct of the investigation?

Mr. LEVIN. The chairman, in his conversation with Senator Dorgan, addressed one very important issue and did so in a way which was very reassuring to the minority, and that was relative to the calling of a committee meeting relative to a request to issue a subpoena on the part of the minority in the event that the committee chair does not think that subpoena should issue, and I will not go further into that subject other than to say I welcome the chairman's assurance on that. 
Finally, on a related subject, we have had some problem relative to subpoenas because we haven't had the sufficient consultation in advance of a decision to issue them and the presentation of those subpoenas to the minority. I think the chairman has addressed this issue, too, in a way which is satisfactory when he said, I believe, a few moments ago that he looks forward to a process where we would work together preparing a subpoena list. I assume from that comment that that would be in advance of the formal presentation of subpoenas, which trigger that 72-hour rule. I think when that is done, we are going to find ourselves agreeing on a lot more of these subpoenas than would otherwise be the case.

It is something with today's action that I think we not only have basically adopted the committee's original scope and resolved the funding issue and an end date, but we also, I think, made some progress in terms of taking the next step toward adopting some bipartisan procedures. All of that is going to help this committee have a thorough bipartisan investigation which covers, again, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, both parties, soft money and independent expenditures and illegalities and whatever else the committee in its good conscience feels is appropriate for investigation because it is either improper or illegal. I thank the Chair.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have the honor of paying tribute to my friend, Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, who will be recognized by the Hartford Optimists Club of Detroit as 1997 Optimist of the Year. Mayor Archer is being honored for his efforts to `optimistically build a renaissance in Detroit for the 21st century.' 
Since he was elected mayor in 1993, Dennis Archer's energy and efforts have infused the people of Detroit with a new spirit of hope. While Detroit faces many challenges, Mayor Archer's work is convincing people from Michigan to Washington, DC that Detroit is in the midst of a great comeback. 
Mayor Archer has worked to build partnerships with community and civic groups, businesses, and the State and Federal Governments. These partnerships have led to success in creating jobs, improving public safety, and raising the standard of living for many of Detroit's residents. In fact, Detroit's unemployment rate has been cut in half since Mayor Archer took office. 
Under Mayor Archer's stewardship, residential and business development is moving forward at a dynamic pace. In November, taxpayers approved a plan to build new baseball and football stadiums in the city. Twenty-five new residential developments are under construction, as are new retail developments. General Motors recently decided to keep its world headquarters in Detroit, purchasing and moving to the Renaissance Center. And Detroit's empowerment zone leads those in all other cities in job creation. 
Dennis Archer has always had confidence in the city of Detroit and in its people, and the results of his first 3 years are proving his optimism to be well-founded. While no one expects Detroit's problems to be solved overnight, the city's progress under the Mayor's leadership is undeniable. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, who truly deserves to be honored as 1997 Optimist of the Year.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Father William T. Cunningham, who will be recognized by the Hartford Optimist Club of Detroit as 1997 Optimist of the Year. Father Cunningham is being honored for his efforts to `optimistically build a renaissance in Detroit for the 21st century.' 
A longtime advocate of social justice and racial equality, Father Cunningham is one of the most respected and admired people in Michigan. In 1968, he and cofounder Eleanor Josaitis began a civil and human rights organization in Detroit called Focus:HOPE. Focus:HOPE provides a unique combination of programs which seek to improve race relations, deliver food to 86,000 low-income women, children and elderly each month, and provide advanced technology training for low-income young men and women. Father Cunningham and Focus:HOPE have changed the lives of thousands of people throughout metropolitan Detroit by bringing to life the proverb `Give a person a fish and you feed him for a day; teach him to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.' 
Father Cunningham's commitment to the people of Detroit has never wavered. I have been proud to be with President Clinton, Gen. Colin Powell, Ron Brown and many others on tours of Focus:HOPE. While each of these dignitaries has walked away impressed by the size and scope of Focus:HOPE's mission, they have been equally inspired by the spiritual nature of Focus:HOPE and by the man whose vision and hard work have made Focus:HOPE the success it is today. 
Today, Mr. President, Father Cunningham's optimism is in full public view as he fights a battle against cancer. His determination to continue his legendary career serving the people of Detroit is as strong as ever. Father Cunningham's faith and courage is an inspiration to all who witness it. 
Father William Cunningham is an American treasure. I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating Father Cunningham as he receives the `1997 Optimist of the Year' award, and in wishing him good health and continued success in the years ahead.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is imperative that the public 
have a full picture of the questionable campaign fundraising practices which have risen to the surface in such quantity. These practices are not the sole domain of one party. Both parties raise money in comparable ways. Republican practices as well as Democratic practices must be investigated and made public. Otherwise, there is going to be no confidence and no credibility in this investigation. Unless we have an investigation into fundraising abuses by both parties, the committee's investigation--and here I am talking about the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation--will turn into a partisan squabble. 
Both Democratic and Republican activities at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue must be investigated, and then let the chips fall where they may. There must be a full and thorough investigation into the campaign finance practices of the last election, and to the extent practices of earlier elections shed light on current practices or set the context for our consideration of current practices, the Governmental Affairs Committee should include and voted to include those election cycles in our investigation as well. Whatever we do in this investigation will also hopefully contribute to the enactment of campaign finance reform. 
With those goals in mind, the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee met and together unanimously decided on language relative to the scope of this investigation. Members on both sides of the aisle were satisfied with the result and with the sense of accomplishment that we felt. Senator Glenn said just before the vote on the scope resolution: 
I think we have made really a lot of progress in this regard. . . . I think this sets down in language what we had talked about, what you, Senator Thompson had indicated you were for, what we were for. 
And Senator Lieberman described it as `an extraordinarily positive piece of work.' 
That agreed-upon scope in the Governmental Affairs Committee was not an expansion of Chairman Thompson's statement of scope which he made on the Senate floor on January 28 when he announced his plans for the committee's investigation. It was the embodiment, for all practical purposes, of what Senator Thompson had described in his floor statement. Senator Thompson said at that time: 
The investigation that we are now undertaking is neither a criminal investigation nor a seminar on campaign finance reform, although it involves elements of both. 
And continuing, Senator Thompson said: 
Based on the information before us at this time, it is an inquiry into illegal and improper campaign finance activity in the 1996 Presidential campaign and related activities. . . . Now certainly our work will include any improper activities by Republicans, Democrats or other political partisans. . . . We are investigating activities here, not political parties. 
We had a disagreement over how much the investigation would cost, but we did not have a disagreement over what the scope should be. We had a disagreement over the length of the investigation. Democrats on the committee thought we should have a goal for an end date so that we could responsibly, and in a reasonable amount of time, report to the Senate on our findings and conclusions. We thought, looking back at previous investigations, that a year would be appropriate. The congressional investigation into Watergate lasted just over a year. And we thought an end date as well as the funding could always be adjusted if the public interest warranted an extension depending upon the state of the evidence at the time the agreed-upon end date was reached. 
We had also hoped for, and actually expected, progress on working out bipartisan procedures for the conduct of the investigation. The committee directed the staff to work on an agreement on procedures to ensure that there was bipartisan access to witnesses, documents and depositions. 
So that's where we were after the last Governmental Affairs 
Committee meeting. We had a unanimously agreed-upon scope resolution, progress on bipartisan procedures, and differences over money and length of time. How did we get to where we are today? Well, this whole thing took a dramatic detour to, and then a dramatic detour in, the Rules Committee. 
Republican members of the Rules Committee decided to narrow the unanimously adopted scope of the committee investigation. Initially, some of the Rules Committee wanted to leave Congress out of the investigation altogether. But they soon realized that that would not pass muster with the media or with the American people. So they concocted a formulation, something that made them look like they were covering Congress but, in effect, leaving out the most sensitive areas to Members: soft money and independent expenditures. Republicans raised much more soft money than Democrats, and outspent Democrats 10 to 1 in independent expenditures. 
The Rules Committee majority no doubt thought that if they could get the Senate to strike the word `improper' from the Governmental Affairs Committee jurisdiction and leave the scope covering only illegal activity, then they could deflect or avoid the possible resulting pressure to pass campaign finance reform. I have no doubt that that was the goal of many members of the Rules Committee--to deflect or avoid pressure to pass campaign finance reform. 
That pressure would come from the bipartisan investigation in the Governmental Affairs Committee not only into what is illegal but into what should be illegal, what is improper, to what has an odor about it, to what is excessive. That is what the Governmental Affairs Committee, on a bipartisan basis, wanted to look at. Not just as to what was illegal technically but as to what we should consider as a legislative body to make illegal. 
Now, the Rules Committee decided to put in language about referring allegations of illegal conduct against Members to the Ethics Committee and referred the issue of soft money and independent expenditures, and those are the 800-pound gorillas of campaign finance in the 1990's. Soft money, independent expenditures currently--the legal portion of those activities--were referred to the Rules Committee. But it is the Rules Committee whose majority does not want the Governmental Affairs Committee to have a full-blown investigation in the first place. 
Now, that is where we are. The Rules Committee is proposing to this Senate that a unanimously agreed upon resolution of a standing committee of this body to investigate improper activity should not be permitted. Now, I do not know whether this has been done before in the history of this body where you have a committee with jurisdiction which votes unanimously on an investigation, which is then denied that investigation by the Rules Committee. Perhaps it has happened before, I do not know. I have asked the Democratic staff on the Rules Committee if they know of any precedent for this. They do not know of any. 
We are not talking about reducing the funding. Here we are talking about limiting the scope of an investigation within the jurisdiction of a standing committee of this body, unanimously voted upon by that standing committee. Now, anybody who has been following this sad story will see through it because I do not think, again--and I will make this challenge to my dear friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, and he is my dear friend; I will make this challenge to him, because we should know whether or not the Rules Committee has ever in this way limited the scope of an investigation unanimously voted on by a standing committee of this body. 
We are not talking about limiting the money. We are talking about saying you may not investigate improper activity. That is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee. There is no doubt that the Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction to look into improper activities of the kind laid out in our full-scope resolution. 
By the way, I have no doubt that the Rules Committee has jurisdiction to do what it has decided it wants to do, as well, that that jurisdiction is not exclusive. The Governmental Affairs Committee has the jurisdiction. There is nothing improper about its jurisdiction. For the Rules Committee to tell a standing committee of this body you may not look into improper activity within your jurisdiction, I believe, is unprecedented. If it has a precedent, then it seems to me this body ought to hear about it from the Rules Committee. 
Again, to make clear what we are not talking about, we are not talking about reducing the funding, and we are not talking about the question of whether the Rules Committee has jurisdiction, as well, because clearly they have both jurisdiction to reduce the funds and to take up an issue themselves. What we are talking about is something that is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee and unanimously adopted by the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
Now, in setting aside the Governmental Affairs Committee resolution, the Rules Committee and the resolution before the Senate struck the very key word `improper.' Here is what the unanimously passed resolution of the Governmental Affairs Committee said:  
The [committee] shall conduct a Special Investigation into illegal or improper fundraising and spending practices in the 1996 Federal election campaigns. . . 
Here is what the Rules Committee substitute says: 
The additional funds authorized by this section are for the sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal activities in connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns.' 
The key word missing from the Rules Committee substitute is the word `improper.' 
What they are restricting us to investigate on the Governmental Affairs Committee is illegal activities. We are barred from using these special funds--and I emphasize it is these special funds which are at issue--from investigating improper activities. If the Rules Committee version of this resolution passes, and I hope it will not, the Senate would go on record as affirmatively denying an investigative committee of the Senate from investigating improper campaign activities. I think that is a precedent which this body should reject on a bipartisan basis because it puts us in the exact wrong direction in terms of what this Nation wants us to do, which is to both look at illegal as well as improper practices. 
Now, some people say, what about the illegal practices which have been alleged. My answer to that is we ought to look at it even though that is usually left to prosecutorial bodies and courts. We ought to look at illegal activities. We should not shy away from that--illegal activities by whomever. But we surely should look as well at improper activities, which activities, at least arguably, should be made illegal. 
We are also doing something else in addition to restricting us from looking at the soft underbelly of campaign financing, which is soft money, we are also risking the very investigation of the Governmental Affairs Committee, because the legislative purpose, which is to change the laws, is being put into question by the restriction of the Rules Committee. If we could only look at illegal activity, things already illegal, and we cannot look at things which arguably should be made illegal, then the question of legislative purpose arises. That is what the courts have ruled must exist before subpoenas can be enforced.

<DOCNO>105-levin-mi-8-19970310</DOCNO>

Mr. LEVIN. The collective wisdom of the Governmental Affairs Committee, unanimously adopted, is that we should look at both illegal and improper activities. I do not think there is a slightest doubt that both of those are within the investigative jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee. And nothing my friend from Virginia here today says anything to the contrary. Both illegal and improper activities are within the investigative jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee. And here we have a Rules Committee on a partisan vote saying to a committee of jurisdiction that has jurisdiction to investigate both illegal and improper activity: `Sorry. This additional funding can only be used on what is already illegal. You may not investigate activities which maybe should be made illegal.' I believe that is unprecedented. I am not saying the Rules Committee cannot do that. I am saying it is unprecedented. I believe it is unwise for the Rules Committee to do that institutionally. More importantly, I believe that the Nation requires an investigation of both illegal and improper, and that is what with the bipartisan unanimous vote of the Governmental Affairs Committee was. 
It is to me just the wrong message to send to the country that we are not going to let the investigative body look into improper activities, particularly involving soft money; independent expenditures which are now for the most part legal, not totally because there are some questions of illegality. But there are some. Most of the soft money is probably legal. Most of the independent expenditures are probably legal. But much of it deserves scrutiny and investigation. 
What the Rules Committee has done is to deny--in a unanimous vote by the Governmental Affairs Committee--use of these additional funds to both look at improper and illegal activity. And I just hope the Senate as a whole will not set this precedent.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have the distinct honor of paying tribute to the Gleaners Community Food Bank of Greater Detroit, which this year celebrates its 20th year of providing food to needy people in southeastern Michigan. 
On March 12, 1997, the Gleaners annual Women's Power Breakfast will bring together more than 200 of southeast Michigan's civic, professional, and corporate leaders to help lead the fight against hunger. The power breakfast was created 4 years ago by Gleaners board member Dulcie Rosenfeld and is led this year by honorary co-chairs Michelle Engler and Judge Trudy Archer, and by breakfast co-chairs Irma Elder, Barbara Levin, Helen Love, and Amanda Van Dusen. Knowing the considerable talent and commitment of these women, I have no doubt that breakfast participants will meet their challenge of raising money and awareness to help Gleaners find solutions to hunger in southeastern Michigan. 
Gleaners Community Food Bank was founded in 1977 with a mission of bringing together food, resources, and manpower into a single collection, storage, and distribution center to help feed southeastern Michigan's hungry. Since its creation, Gleaners has collected surplus food from the region's farmers, food distributors and processors, supermarkets, grocery stores, and individuals. Each year, this vital organization collects, stores, and distributes more than 12 million pounds of food to more than 200 agencies, including soup kitchens, church pantries, and shelters for homeless or battered women. 
Since its inception, Gleaners has been able to rely on the generosity of the people of southeastern Michigan. Each Saturday, approximately 100 volunteers from church groups, schools, unions, and corporations come together to assemble food packs for distribution to various agencies. Food drives, fundraising events, corporate donations, foundation grants, and donations from individuals contribute greatly to Gleaners success. 
Hunger is faced by people of all ages, races, and socio-economic levels in communities throughout our Nation. I am proud to have such a dedicated and successful organization leading the fight against this problem in my home State. We should all take inspiration from the example we see here and recommit our efforts to eradicate hunger in this country and around the world.

Mr. LEVIN. I just ask if the Senator will yield 1 minute, and then I will yield the floor and come back for the remainder of my 8 minutes. But while Senator Dorgan is on the floor, I just wanted to comment for a few seconds. I just wanted to compliment Senator Dorgan for his comments. His speech is a free trade speech. We all have to listen carefully to what he said. That 50-percent tariff on American beef going to Tokyo--it is absurd that we tolerate it. 
In NAFTA, we permit, for 25 years, Mexico making it a crime to sell an American used car in Mexico. That is part of NAFTA. NAFTA, for 10 years, restricts American-assembled automobiles from going into Mexico. So, what the Senator from North Dakota is pleading with us to do, is to insist that we have as much access for our manufactured goods and our agricultural products to other countries as they do to our country. I commend him on his remarks and I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments this afternoon to set the record straight on an important point concerning the use of FBI background investigations in the consideration of the executive branch nominees by the Senate. 
A number of inaccurate comments have been made about the handling of FBI files in connection with the pending nomination of Tony Lake to be Director of Central Intelligence. Some Senators are calling for access to the complete files which the FBI used to prepare the summaries that were provided to the White House and the Congress. The Senators cite former Senator Tower's nomination to be Secretary of Defense as a precedent for requesting those so-called complete files. 
For example, a February 17, 1997, letter to the majority leader, signed by 16 Senators, only three of whom were Members of the Senate at the time the Tower nomination was considered, and none of whom were then members of the Armed Services Committee, states the following: 
As you know, when former U.S. Senator John Tower was nominated for Secretary of Defense, his complete FBI file was placed in a secure room of the Capitol for Members of the Senate to read and evaluate. Given the clear precedent and the critical nature of the position of Director of Central Intelligence, this is the procedure which we believe should be followed in the case of Mr. Lake. 
The fact is, Mr. President, that neither the Armed Services Committee nor the full Senate ever had access to the raw investigative files used by the FBI to compile its summary of the background investigation of Senator Tower. The Armed Services Committee and all Senators had access only to the FBI summary of its investigation of Senator Tower to be Secretary of Defense. 
I understand that the summary of the FBI's background investigation of Tony Lake has already been provided to the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, just as the summary of the FBI's background investigation of Senator Tower was provided in the Armed Services Committee in 1989. 
A little background is useful here on the process of FBI background investigations of executive branch nominees. Prior to the submission of a nomination to the Senate, the FBI conducts a background investigation of the nominee for the purpose of providing the President with information about the suitability of a prospective nominee. The report of the investigation is submitted to the counsel to the President who is responsible for preparing appropriate advice to the President. 
The FBI background material provided to the Armed Services Committee in connection with nominations includes only the FBI summary of its interviews. If the committee determines that additional information is necessary, a request for this information is made of the White House. If necessary, the FBI investigates further, and additional summaries are provided to the committee. The underlying investigative materials are not submitted to the committee, and they never have been. I repeat that. The underlying investigative materials, the so-called raw investigative materials, are not submitted to the Armed Services Committee and they never have been, including in the case of Senator Tower when his nomination was before us to be Secretary of Defense. 
The standard practice before the Armed Services Committee has been that the summary of the FBI investigation is read only by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee or their Senator-designee from the members of the committee. These summaries can be extraordinarily personal and confidential, and, for that reason, the executive branch is not allowed staff access generally to those FBI summaries.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
So then I observe, Mr. President, that the quote which I just shared with this body is from the agreement, and every single item on that inventory is a summary document. 
Two additional FBI summaries were added to the seven listed in the original agreement before the Senate finally voted on the Tower nomination a month later. These FBI summaries, which were eventually placed in S-407 for review by all Senators, were the only FBI materials received by the Armed Services Committee. 
As Senator Nunn stated on the Senate floor when he opened the debate on the Tower nomination--and this probably is the most succinct place where Senator Nunn stated this on the Senate floor-- 
What we have in S-407 is the summary of interviews the FBI conducted. They prepare the summary. We do not see nor do we have the underlying interviews. 
That is stated about as succinctly and directly as you can by the then-chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
So, in short, the committee did not have access to any raw investigative files or interview transcripts, nor did the 
Senate. What we had were the nine chapters of the FBI summary of its investigation. 
Following the committee's action on the Tower nomination, Senators Mitchell and Dole reached an agreement with the Bush administration that all Senators would have access to the same FBI summary of the background investigation of Senator Tower that was made available to the members of the Armed Services Committee. In other words, after the Armed Services Committee voted, then the agreement between Senators Mitchell and Dole was that the full Senate would have access to those same summaries that the committee Senators had access to. 
So the fact is, Mr. President, that in considering the nomination of Senator Tower to be Secretary of Defense, the Armed Services Committee--and eventually all Senators--had access to the FBI summary of its background investigation of Senator Tower, no more and no less. We did not have access to any of the raw investigative material that the FBI used to prepare those summaries. 
Mr. President, the Senate has had the nomination of Tony Lake to be Director of Central Intelligence for 2 months. And some Senators have questions about Mr. Lake's suitability for the position. Those questions should be raised with the nominee in the hearing next week so that he can respond, and Senators can then reach their own judgments about his suitability for this important position. 
But we should not act on any misunderstanding as to what the precedents are relative to raw investigatory materials. And in dealing with the Lake nomination, which I am glad to see is now scheduled for a hearing, I think it is important that Senators realize that the precedents here relative to executive nominees are such that we do not have access to those materials because they contain so much rumor, so much inaccurate information that we rely on the FBI to go through all that raw material and give us the summary reports that then we rely on, and then if we need or desire additional information, we make that request of the FBI and of the Justice Department. 
There is a larger issue at stake here also, Mr. President, and that is the growing intrusiveness of the nomination and confirmation process. Make no mistake about it: if the executive branch agrees to provide raw FBI files to the Intelligence Committee, a new precedent will be set for future nominations to executive branch positions. The FBI summaries contain the most personal, private, and sensitive details of an individual's life. Some of these details have no bearing on an individual's suitability for office. 
As Mr. Gray stated in his February 14, 1989, letter to the Armed Services Committee, even the material included in the summary of an FBI background investigation is so sensitive that their disclosure could jeopardize `the privacy interests of [the nominee] and others, the confidentiality of FBI sources, the FBI's ability to conduct background investigations, and our ability to recruit qualified candidates for positions of governmental service.' 
It is already difficult to convince talented people to serve in government. If people realize that every rumor or allegation that the FBI dredges up or that every off-hand comment or statement that someone says about a nominee in an interview is subject to being read by 100 Senators and selected staff--and possible leaks to the media--it will be even harder to get the kind of people all of us want to serve in confirmed positions in the executive branch.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering a constitutional amendment which some claim will lead to a balanced Federal budget. The Senate debated and defeated this amendment in the last Congress. It has been reported once again by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and has received the careful and thorough deliberation by the Senate which it deserves. 
Except in unusual circumstances, balancing the budget is the responsible thing to do. That is why I have repeatedly supported balanced budgets. And, we have made significant progress in the past 4 years. We have reduced the Federal deficit for 4 years in a row, cutting the deficit by more than half from $290 billion in fiscal year 1992 to $107 billion in fiscal year 1996, from 4.7 percent of the GDP in 1992 to 1.4 percent in fiscal year 1996, the lowest in more than 20 years. In fact, for the first time in years, the real possibility of agreement to balance the budget in the next 5 years looms before us. 
At the outset, let's be clear about one thing. The proposed constitutional amendment doesn't balance the budget. It tells a future Congress to pass legislation to balance the budget. Unless that future Congress agrees on legislation, the amendment will not be implemented. Why not try to pass the implementation language now before the vote on the constitutional amendment so everybody could see how it would work and if it would work? Again, without that implementation legislation, we're left with a feel good gimmick which would allow Members of Congress to claim that the deficit will be cured without actually taking the tough steps necessary to do the job. It takes Congress off the hook for 5 years or more. And then, Mr. President, there is no hook. As the distinguished past president of the American Economic Association, Professor Robert Eisner, put it in his excellent article January 22 in the Wall Street Journal, the amendment `might as well assert that the waves of the Atlantic Ocean shall not cross a certain line'. In other words, the language kicks in in 2002, or later, and then there might be no kick. 
As we have seen in the most recent Congress, the debate arises not over whether to balance the budget, but rather how to reach that balance. The issues which make agreement difficult grow out of differences in priorities. The President, in his budget last year and again this year, has shown a path to a balanced budget which also provides for adequate funding for education, environmental protection, Medicare, Medicaid, and other essential Government functions. Many of the proponents of this constitutional amendment support a large tax break, paid for by larger reductions in Medicare than the President proposes. It is in hammering out these priorities that the difficult decisions arise. The constitutional amendment before us does nothing to advance that process. In fact, since implementing legislation will not be required for 5 years at the earliest, it may indeed provide the excuse to delay those tough decisions. 
We are told that if Congress is required by the Constitution to pass a law to implement a balanced budget, surely Congress will pass such a law. Well in 1979, 18 years ago, we passed a law that said, `Congress shall balance the Federal budget.' That law, Public Law 96-5, was the law of the land. Although the Senate passed that provision by a 96 to 2 vote and the President signed it into law, it did not happen. Saying we must balance the budget will not make it happen; unless and until we do the hard work of budgeting, it's all just a dodge, and worse, because it encourages people to say we are cured before we've taken the medicine. 
Mr. President, the plain truth is whether we pass a balanced budget amendment or not, it will still take a majority of the votes of the Members of each House to make the tough choices needed to cut spending or raise taxes. Unless and until we make those choices or adopt some process to implement the constitutional amendment, in the absence of a congressional majority agreement on how to balance the budget, we will not have a balanced budget. 
Every Member of this body knows that we will not get to a balanced budget without tough decisions. Adopting a constitutional amendment saying some future Congress must make the tough decisions and balance the budget not only isn't a substitute for our acting or adopting an enforcement mechanism, it will delay those actions because people might think we have acted. 
If we are going to get to a balanced budget by 2002, there is a real, practical need to adopt the enforcement mechanism now. We all remember that, back in 1985, we passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, requiring a balanced budget by 1991. Two years later, we modified that requirement to call for a balanced budget by 1993. Well, 1991 and 1993 have come and gone, and we still don't have a balanced budget. The reason is simple: the Congress never laid out an enforceable mechanism of how we were going to get there. Like the balanced budget amendment, Gramm-Rudman laid out the targets without enough provisions for how they were to be achieved. 
Without any enforceable blueprint, we found ourselves pushed up against deadlines we could not meet. We got to the deadline and found ourselves confronted with a dropping stock market and the prospect of sudden budget cuts that could throw the country into a deep recession. We made the only choice we could, protecting the Nation and the economy at the cost of not meeting the budget targets. 
The current congressional majority appears committed to marching down this same road again. The constitutional amendment before us, like the Gramm-Rudman law, would require us to achieve a balanced budget in a fixed period of time. It doesn't say how we are supposed to get there and stay there. 
If this Congress fails to face up to the obligation of laying out a detailed enforceable plan to reach and maintain a balanced budget as required by the amendment, why should we expect future Congresses to be any more responsible? If we duck the task of outlining the enforceable mechanism and/or the cuts that will get us to a balanced budget by 2002, and keep us at balance thereafter, we can only expect that the next Congress, and the next one after that, will follow the same course. If we don't do the hard work this year, we can't expect somebody else to do it for us next year. 
If we pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget amendment without an enforcement mechanism, we are going to face the same kind of choices we faced with the Gramm-Rudman law. If we don't have the will now to plot our course to reach and maintain a balanced budget, we will get to 2002 and find that we have to either abandon the goal with the increase in cynicism which would accompany it, or risk undermining the national defense or pushing the economy into a deep recession. 
There is a way to avoid that fate. We can lay out an honest plan and an enforceable mechanism, telling the American people how we intend to achieve and keep a balanced budget. That would be the honest approach, the approach that the American public would respect. 
Even the Wall Street Journal editorial on February 4 stated,  
The notion of amending the Constitution to outlaw budget deficits is silly on any number of counts. Politically it's empty symbolism. Legally it clutters the Constitution with dubious prose * * * The concept embodied in the proposed amendment measures nothing useful; it is at best a distraction, and at worst spreads confusion that will make the right things harder to do, not easier. 
The proposed amendment is full of loopholes and ambiguities, all usable when 2002 arrives. For example: First, the implementation of the amendment depends on economic estimates that can be made overly optimistic if that is what is necessary to project a balanced budget. We have seen enough rosy scenarios in the budgets of both Republican and Democratic administrations to know how this game is likely to be played. For example, in 1981, our estimates were off by $58 billion. In 1982, our estimates were off by $73 billion. In 1983, our estimates were off by $91 billion, and on and on. In 1991, they were off by $119 billion--$119 billion in one year. You talk about a loophole. This one is big enough to drive a $119 billion deficit through. That's bigger than our current deficit. 
Second, the amendment requires a balanced budget in each fiscal year. Throughout the 1980's Congress and the President artificially lowered the reported deficit and met Gramm-Rudman targets by delaying spending a few days thereby pushing it from one fiscal year to another. Under the proposed amendment, we can expect similar budgetary shell games. 
Third, States with balanced budget requirements have frequently avoided them by creating independent or quasi-public agencies and placing their expenditures off-budget. We did much the same thing in the 1980's with the costs of the savings and loan bail-out. Because the amendment does not define key terms such as receipts and outlays, it is certain to lead to similar manipulations. 
Fourth, the deficit could be artificially reduced by selling off valuable public assets, such as public lands. This approach might enable the Federal Government to report a smaller deficit for a few years, but would have no impact at all on the structural gap between revenues and outlays. 
There are numerous technical problems with the amendment. It does not tell us what an outlay is, what a receipt is, or how the Congress will monitor and regulate the precise levels of outlays and receipts. But, perhaps most importantly, it does not tell us what will happen if outlays in fact exceed receipts. 
What would happen if the amendment were ratified, and, by the end of a fiscal year, outlays were to exceed revenues, a clear violation of the amendment. What would happen? Could the courts step in and enforce the amendment? 
According to the authors of the resolution, there would be no remedy, unless provided by future legislation. As Senator Hatch explained on March 7, 
1986, `[T]here is no question that Congress would have to pass implementing legislation to make it effective. In that sense, it is not self-executing. . . . It would be the obligation of Cong-ress . . . [to] enact legislation that would cause this to come about.' 
The unenforceability of the amendment should not be a problem, the authors tell us, because future Congresses would be bound to respect the provisions of the amendment and the will of the voters and to comply with it in good faith by enacting suitable implementing legislation. 
But this argument has two flaws. First, the amendment, if ratified, wouldn't take effect until 2002 at the earliest. This Congress wouldn't be bound by the provisions of the amendment. The next Congress wouldn't be bound. The Congress after that wouldn't be bound. In fact, no Congress would be bound by the terms of the amendment to enact implementing legislation until 2002 at the earliest, and by then it would be too late to take the actions necessary to comply. 
Second, the legislation required to implement this amendment will be extremely complex, and, even if everyone acted in good faith, there still might be no agreement. Over the last decade, we have enacted into law some 50 single-spaced pages of procedures, governing the congressional budget process and attempting to rein in uncontrolled budget deficits. These provisions set timetables for the congressional budget process. They provide the rules for debate for budget matters. They spell out points of order that may be raised to keep the budget under control. They establish the role of the Congressional Budget Office. They provide controls on legislation providing spending authority and rules for legislation providing entitlement authority. They limit the use of off-budget agencies, programs and activities. They establish regulations for the sequestrations and procedures for the rescission of appropriated funds. 
Similarly detailed legislation would be required to implement and enforce the balanced budget amendment. To give just one example of the complex issues that would have to be addressed by such legislation, the resolution before us would require that outlays may not exceed receipts. However, Congress does not legislate either outlays or receipts. The appropriations and revenue measures that we enact lead to outlays and receipts, but do not dictate the exact levels of outlays or receipts in any given year. 
So Congress would have to establish new mechanisms to control outlays and receipts. This raises many difficult questions, on which reasonable people could disagree. Let me read from a colloquy between myself and Senator Simon about some of these questions: 
Senator LEVIN. How would the monitoring of the flow of receipts and outlays be done to determine whether the budget for any fiscal year is on the track of being balanced? Would this require implementing legislation? 
Senator SIMON. There would have to be monitoring and future legislation would have to take care of the implementation of that monitoring. 
Senator LEVIN. What exactly is the definition of receipts and outlays? Specifically, would the receipts and outlays of Bonneville Power Administration be receipts and outlays of the United States pursuant to this constitutional amendment? Would the answer to these questions require implementing legislation? 
Senator SIMON. Implementing legislation will be needed on some of these peripheral questions, but the intent is clear. 
Senator LEVIN. In an instance in which the OMB and the CBO disagree with each other on what a level of outlays is, how will the dispute be resolved so that it can be determined whether or not outlays exceed receipts? 
Senator SIMON. Future legislation will have to take care of this. 
Senator LEVIN. Who will determine the level of receipts and whether a revenue bill is `a bill to increase revenues?' . . . . My question is, what happens if the revenue estimators in the Treasury Department say the bill is revenue neutral, and the Joint Committee on Taxation say the bill will result in a net increase in revenues? Whose estimate will prevail? How will the dispute be resolved? 
Senator SIMON. Future legislation will have to take care of this. 
Senator LEVIN. At what point will it be determined that outlays will in fact exceed revenues and that actions such as a tax increase, spending cuts, or tapping into a rainy day fund will be required? August 1? September 15? Who will make that determination? 
Senator SIMON. There will have to be regular monitoring and future legislation will work out the details. 
Mr. President, these are difficult questions, on which reasonable people could disagree. The assumption of the authors that future Members of Congress will try, in good faith, to comply with the amendment does not mean that a majority of Members of each House of Congress will agree on the many issues involved or on whether to require sequestration of funds if outlays are determined to exceed revenues, or that they will agree on whether to exempt the national defense or Social Security payments from such sequestration. 
And what if the future Congress to which we leave these questions can't agree? Would dozens of unelected judges assert jurisdiction and order spending cuts or tax increases? When the Senate during the 104th Congress considered this constitutional amendment, we adopted by a 92 to 8 vote an amendment offered by Senator Nunn which added language to section 6 making it clear that `the judicial power of the United States shall not extend to any case or controversy arising under this article except as may be specifically authorized by legislation. . .' This safeguard has been omitted from the version of the constitutional amendment which is before us today. 
Since implementation legislation is the essential need, why not pass it now? In the 104th Congress, I offered an amendment, defeated on a 62 to 38 vote, which would have required us to pass the legislation, not pass the buck. It provided that the constitutional amendment would be submitted to the States for ratification only upon enactment of legislation specifying the means for implementing and enforcing the provisions of the constitutional amendment. 
There are two advantages to this approach. First, it places the responsibility on this Congress instead of leaving it to a future Congress, by delaying the sending of the amendment to the States until we act. Second, the States would be informed how the enforcement mechanism would work so they could consider that in their ratification deliberations. Since it has become clear that the majority is unwilling to amend its language in any way and is defeating all efforts to improve it, I have decided not to offer my amendment again this year. 
I am also concerned that the proposed amendment would permit future Congresses to use Social Security funds for balancing the budget. I believe that we have a special obligation to protect the Social Security trust fund, and that we should not rob that fund to balance the budget. The Social Security system is a contract which we have made with our senior citizens. We should not allow a circumstance in which even unintended effects of a constitutional amendment like the one before us could lead to the failure or inability to meet our obligations under Social Security. The proponents will claim that this would never happen because the constituencies supporting that program are politically strong. But, the Constitution is permanent. Political circumstance is subject to change. We should not enshrine in the Constitution the use of Social Security funds for any purpose other than Social Security. 
As the President stated in his letter of January 28, 1997:  
* * * [T]he constitutional amendment to balance the budget could pose grave risks to the Social Security system. In the event of an impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be waived nor met, disbursement of Social Security checks could cease or unelected judges could reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. 
I am also deeply concerned about the supermajority requirement in section 2 of the amendment. This would require 60 percent of the whole number of each House in order to raise the debt ceiling. As we learned in the last Congress, this represents a grave risk to the ability of the Federal Government to meet its obligations. In 1995 and 1996, we saw a determined minority, especially in the House of Representatives plan and carry out an effort to hold the President hostage by refusing to agree to lift the debt ceiling unless he accepted all of the details of their budget proposal. The strategy was rejected by the American people, in part because a vote to increase the debt ceiling is simply a vote to pay the bills we owe: it is simply a vote to honor the obligations that the Federal Government has already incurred. Reasonable people may differ on whether we should limit future obligations and by how much, but I hope nobody in this body believes that we should not honor the obligations we have already incurred. 
As Secretary of the Treasury Rubin put it in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee: 
The possibility of default should never be on the table. Our creditworthiness is an invaluable national asset that should not be subject to question. Default on payment of our debt would undermine our credibility with respect to meeting financial commitments, and that in turn would have adverse effects for decades to come, especially when our reputation is most important, that is, when the national economy is not healthy. Moreover, a failure to pay interest on our debt could raise the cost of borrowing not only for Government, but for private borrowers from companies to homeowners making payments on an adjustable mortgage. 
Just a year ago we witnessed Secretary Rubin forced to use every innovative move within his authority to avoid just such a default while incredibly the Chairman of the House Rules Committee was calling for his impeachment for doing so. 
The one road we should never take to a balanced budget is the failure to pay our lawful debts. But, this amendment would make permanent in the Constitution a shift of power to a minority in either House of Congress over the issue of whether we pay our bills for our lawful debts. 
Some opponents who have addressed this amendment have emphasized the danger of putting a rigid straightjacket in the Constitution which could deepen an economic emergency. Indeed, more than a thousand distinguished economists, including eleven Nobel laureates have expressed their opposition to such a constitutional amendment for this reason. Some opponents have emphasized the danger of the inclusion of Social Security and the unwise requirement of a supermajority in order to permit the United States to pay its debts. Others have argued, as The Wall Street Journal has, that this amendment is an empty gimmick. While it is true that not all of these flaws can be true at the same time, it is also true that whether it is a dangerous straight jacket, or a dodge which won't work, it's a mistake either way. 
Mr. President, if we want to achieve a balanced budget, there is one way to do it. Don't push the problem off onto future Congresses with a balanced budget amendment that doesn't even become effective until 2002 at the earliest. Keep doing the hard work as we have started. Set out a plan with real spending targets, real budget cuts laid out on a program-by-program and year-by-year basis, and real enforcement mechanisms. I believe we are on verge of a plan to reach a balanced budget in 5 years in this Congress. We have lowered the deficit for 4 consecutive years, cutting it by more than half. Let's not be delayed or diverted. Let's do the hard work. At best, this amendment is merely irrelevant to balancing the budget. At worst, it threatens damage to the economy, the Social Security system, and the confidence of the American people in their Government. Either way it's a mistake.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue of great importance to our national security: the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
This convention, which is commonly known as the CWC, has been a high priority for the past three administrations, and is a perfect example of a bipartisan foreign and security policy issue. It was negotiated beginning under President Reagan, it was signed under President Bush, and the Clinton administration is now seeking Senate advice and consent to its ratification. 
The United States has always taken the lead on negotiating the CWC, and we should soon have before us an opportunity to improve the security of our Nation and of the world by ratifying this convention. Some 160 countries have already signed the CWC, and more than 65 have ratified it--including all our major NATO allies and China. It will enter into force on April 29 of this year, whether or not we ratify it. But our ratification will make a big difference in the effect the treaty has on us and on the effectiveness of the treaty worldwide. 
Mr. President, let me summarize what the Chemical Weapons Convention will do: it will drastically reduce the stockpiles of chemical weapons; require the destruction of chemical weapon production facilities; provide for the most intrusive verification procedures ever negotiated--including challenge on-site inspections; improve our intelligence of foreign chemical weapon activities; require domestic laws that will permit nations to investigate and prosecute chemical weapon activities; and, perhaps most importantly, make it much more difficult for rogue nations or terrorists to make or acquire chemical weapons. 
As the Defense Department leadership and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified on numerous occasions over several years: this convention is in our national security interest, and we should ratify it as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, on January 22 the Senate Armed Services Committee held a nomination hearing for our former colleague, Senator Bill Cohen, to be the Secretary of Defense. That afternoon the Senate voted unanimously to confirm him by a vote of 99-0. He is now the new Secretary of Defense, and I am looking forward to working with him on the many important and challenging national security issues that will come before the Armed Services Committee and before the Senate. 
I want to share with my colleagues the comments of then Secretary-designate Cohen about the CWC, because it is important that we consider the views of the President's chief defense adviser. 
At his nomination hearing, Senator Cohen made three important points about the CWC. 
First, he told the Committee `whether we ratify it or not, we are engaged in the unilateral disarmament of chemical weapons. We are eliminating all our stocks of chemical weapons, and they will be completely gone by the year 2004. That was initiated under the administration of Ronald Reagan. So, whether we sign it or not, we are getting rid of ours.' 
Second, he told us that whether we sign it or not, the convention will go into effect. Given that fact, it makes sense for us to ratify the treaty and to take part in making the rules by which it will be implemented, as well as having our own inspectors on the inspection teams. 
Third, he told the Committee that the American chemical industry stands to lose up to $600 million in sales if we do not ratify because of sanctions which were intended for rogue nations but which will apply to our industry and prevent it from selling precursor chemicals to signatory nations. 
Secretary-designate Cohen concluded that it is in our national interest to ratify the CWC because we are already getting rid of our chemical weapons, and by ratifying we can help assure that other countries which ratify the CWC will get rid of theirs. Those are three points I hope our colleagues will keep in mind as the 
Senate considers the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Prior to his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services Committee, Secretary-designate Cohen had an opportunity to provide a more comprehensive explanation of his support for the CWC. I would like to share those views with our colleagues because they clearly enumerate why the CWC is in our national security interests. 
Here is the committee's question and Senator Cohen's answer:  
Question. The President has made ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention a very high priority for early Senate action. The Convention will enter into force on April 29, 1997, and ratification must occur prior to that date for the U.S. to be an original party. 
Do you agree that ratification of the CWC is very much in our national security interest and do you support the goal of ratification prior to the April 29 deadline? 
Answer. Yes. The CWC, as both a disarmament and nonproliferation treaty, is very much in our national security interests because it establishes an international mandate for the destruction of chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles. Congress has mandated that the Army, as executive agent for CW destruction, eliminate its unitary CW, which constitute the bulk of its CW stockpile, by 31 December 2004. That destruction process is well under way at the CW destruction facilities at Johnston Atoll and Tooele, UT. The CWC mandates that state parties destroy, under a strict verification regime, their entire CW stockpiles within 10 years after the Convention enters into force (April 2007). Given that the U.S. does not need CW for its security, and given that we are currently legally committed to eliminating unilaterally the vast majority of our CW stockpile, common sense suggests that it would be preferable to secure a commitment from other nations to do the same; prohibits the development, retention, storage, preparations for use, and use of CW. These expansive prohibitions establish a broadly accepted international norm that will form a basis for international action against those states parties that violate the CWC. Unlike the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which only bans the use of CW in war, the CWC: includes a verification regime; restricts the export of certain dual-use CW precursor chemicals to non-state parties; prohibits assisting other states, organizations, or personnel in acquiring CW; and requires state parties to implement legislation prohibiting its citizens and organizations from engaging in activities prohibited by the Convention. The CWC also contains mechanisms for recommending multilateral sanctions, including recourse to the UN Security Council; increases the probability of detecting militarily significant violations of the CWC. While no treaty is 100% verifiable, the CWC contains complementary and overlapping declaration and inspection requirements. These requirements increase the probability of detecting militarily significant violations of the Convention. While detecting illicit production of small quantities of CW will be extremely difficult, it is easier to detect large scale production, filling and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Over time, through declaration, routine inspections, fact-finding, consultation, and challenge inspection mechanisms, the CWC's verification regime should prove effective in providing information on significant CW programs that would not otherwise be available; hinders the development of clandestine CW stockpiles. Through systematic on-site verification, routine declarations and trade restrictions, the Convention makes it more difficult for would-be proliferators to acquire, from CWC state parties precursor chemicals required for developing chemical weapons. The mutually supportive trade restrictions and verification provisions of the Convention increase the transparency of CW-relevant activities. These provisions will provide the U.S. with otherwise unavailable information that will facilitate U.S. detection and monitoring of illicit CW activities. 
I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention and the goal of U.S. ratification of the Convention by 29 April 1997, and I understand that the Department of Defense shares that view. U.S. ratification of the CWC prior to this date will ensure that the U.S. receives one of the 41 seats on the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international organization that will oversee CWC implementation. Early ratification will also ensure that U.S. citizens will fill key positions within the OPCW and act as inspectors for the Organization. Direct U.S. involvement and leadership will ensure the efficacy and efficiency of the OPCW during the critical early stages of the Convention's implementation. The U.S., upon ratification and implementation of the CWC, will also receive CW-related information from other state parties. As a state party and a member of the Executive Council, the U.S. will be in the best position to assure the effective implementation of the Convention's verification provisions. 
Mr. President, this is a very strong and persuasive statement of support for the Chemical Weapons Convention. I urge my colleagues to consider Secretary Cohen's views. We should take up the CWC for advice and consent to ratification without delay.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Akaka, Helms, and Robb, would implement the recommendation of the National Performance Review that we should `require [Federal Prison Industries] to compete commercially for federal agencies' business' instead of having a legally protected monopoly. Our bill would ensure that the taxpayers get the best possible value for their Federal procurement dollars. If a Federal agency could get a better product at a lower price from the private sector, it would be permitted to do so--and the taxpayers would get the savings. 
Mr. President, many in both Government and industry believe that FPI products are frequently overpriced, inferior in quality, or both. For example, I understand that the Veterans Administration has sought repeal of FPI's mandatory preference on several occasions, on the grounds that FPI pricing for textiles, furniture, and other products are routinely higher than identical items purchased from commercial sources. Most recently, VA officials estimated that the repeal of the preference would save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency alone, making that money available for veterans services. 
Similarly, the Deputy Commander of the Defense Logistics Agency, wrote in a May 3, 1996, letter to Members of the House that FPI has had a 42 percent delinquency rate in its clothing and textile deliveries, compared to a 6 percent rate for commercial industry. For this record of poor performance, FPI has charged prices that were an average of 13 percent higher than commercial prices. 
On July 30, 1996, the master chief petty officer of the Navy testified before the House National Security Committee that the FPI monopoly on Government furniture contracts has undermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for its sailors. Master Chief Petty Officer John Hagan stated, and I quote:  
In order to efficiently use our scarce resources, we need congressional assistance in changing the Title 18 statute that requires all the Services to obtain a waiver for each and every furniture order not placed with the Federal Prison Industry/UNICOR. * * * Speaking frankly, the FPI/UNICOR product is inferior, costs more, and takes longer to procure. UNICOR has, in my opinion, exploited their special status instead of making changes which would make them more efficient and competitive. The Navy and other Services need your support to change the law and have FPI compete with GSA furniture manufacturers. Without this change, we will not be serving Sailors or taxpayers in the most effective and efficient way. 
In the last Congress this bill was supported by the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Business and Industrial Furniture Manufacturers' Association, the American Apparel Manufacturers' Association, the Industrial Fabrics Association International, and the Competition in Contracting Act Coalition. It has also received support from hundreds of small businesses from Michigan and around the country that have seen FPI take jobs away from their businesses and give them to FPI with a guaranteed purchase--regardless of price and quality. 
We all want to do what we can to ensure that we make constructive work available for Federal prisoners, but the way we are doing it is wrong. As one small businessman in the furniture industry put it in emotional testimony at a House hearing last year: 
Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran who was twice wounded fighting for our country and give that work to criminals who have trampled on honest citizens' rights, therefore effectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's business which the Veteran's Administration suggested he enter? 
At the end of the last Congress, I received a letter indicating the Administration's agreement that the process by which Federal agencies purchase products from Federal Prison Industries needs to be reformed. That letter states: 
The Administration favors reform of Federal Prison Industries to improve its customer service, pricing, and delivery while not endangering its work program for Federal inmates. * * * The Administration will present reform proposals for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in the next session of Congress. 
With this letter, the administration has promised to join us in a serious reevaluation of the process by which Federal Prison Industries sells its products to other Federal agencies. The heart of that process is, of course, FPI's mandatory source status. The administration has made a commitment to work with us on reforming the Federal Prison Industries procurement process in this Congress, and I intend to hold the administration to that commitment. 
Mr. President, our bill would not require FPI to close any of its facilities, force FPI to eliminate any jobs for Federal prisoners, or undermine FPI's ability to ensure that inmates are productively occupied. It would simply require FPI to compete for Federal contracts on the same terms as all other Federal contractors. That is simple 
justice to the hard-working citizens in the private sector, with whom FPI would be required to compete. 
Mr. President, I am a supporter of the idea of putting Federal inmates to work. A strong prison work program not only reduces inmate idleness and prison disruption, but can also help build a work ethic, provide job skills, and enable prisoners to return to productive society upon their release. 
However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a manner that does not unfairly eliminate the jobs of hard-working citizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be able to achieve this result only if it diversifies its product lines and avoids the temptation to build its work force by continuing to displace private sector jobs in its traditional lines of work. We need to have jobs for prisoners, but it is unfair and wasteful to allow FPI to designate whose jobs it will take, and when it will take them. Competition will be better for FPI, better for the taxpayer, and better for working men and women around the country. 
I had hoped to get a vote on this bill last year, but the parliamentary situation at the end of the Congress made that impossible. However, this issue is not going to go away. The issue is too important to the taxpayers, and too important to the many small businesses adversely affected by unfair competition from Federal Prison Industries, to be ignored. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make reform of the Federal Prison Industries procurement process a reality in this Congress.

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Utah. 
Mr. President, I support the Dodd amendment because it would simplify the national security exception to the balanced budget amendment before us, and it would do so in a common-sense way that I would think both supporters and opponents of the balanced budget amendment should be able to support. 
As currently drafted, the balanced budget amendment before us would limit the national security exception to cases in which the United States is already `engaged in military conflict.' This language would seriously limit our defense options by precluding the use of the exception to prepare for imminent military conflict. 
The way the amendment before us is written, our troops must actually be engaged in battle in order for the exception to apply. The Dodd amendment addresses this problem by extending the waiver authority to any case in which the United States `faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security, as declared by a joint resolution of Congress,' even if we are not yet engaged in military conflict. 
Former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry opposed the balanced budget amendment largely because, in his words, of `the total lack of flexibility we would have in dealing with contingencies.' 
Here is what Secretary Perry said: 
Even if threats to America's global interests were increasing or our forces deteriorating, the BBA could lead to deep defense cuts. . . . 
The fact that these consequences could be avoided with three-fifths approval of each house of Congress is no safeguard. Preservation of an adequate defense posture would become dependent on exceptional political efforts. . . . Even when a three-fifths majority minus one in either house believed that BBA cuts were unjustified, the minority view would prevail. Not exactly ideal for the world's most powerful democracy and best hope for future peace and stability.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, those two votes, which determined whether we would build those ships, had a huge effect on the outcome of this war. There is no reason, if we are serious about protecting our national security, why we should require that we actually be engaged in a conflict. If a joint resolution of the Congress says that conflict is imminent, which it was in 1938 and 1939 and 1940, surely that ought to be enough to allow us to act by majority vote in order to save this country. 
Finally, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, the same kind of issues could have been raised during the gulf war that were raised by Dr. Schlesinger relative to World War II. 
If I still have time left, I want to finish with one other point that the Dodd amendment corrects. How much time does this Senator have remaining?

Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. 
The Dodd amendment addresses a second problem with the text of the balanced budget amendment. The joint resolution, as currently drafted, requires that the United States be engaged in military conflict which `causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared' by Congress. 
That word `and' in the current language creates two requirements: First, that there be a declaration by Congress and, second, that there be an imminent and serious threat to national security. In other words, the word `and,' creates a second requirement--the actual existence of a threat--which opens this up to judicial review and creates a real problem which is corrected by the Dodd amendment. 
The last thing that we need at a time when our Nation faces an imminent and serious threat is to place in question the legitimacy of Federal spending to meet that threat. When our national security is at stake, we cannot afford to wait for the courts to give a stamp of approval to emergency spending programs. The Dodd amendment would address this problem by making it clear that a congressional declaration that an imminent and serious threat to the national security would alone be sufficient to trigger the exception. 
Mr. President, most of us hopefully want to bring the budget back into balance, but we must achieve that goal without undermining our ability to defend our vital national interests in the face of imminent threats or danger. Regardless whether we support the balanced budget amendment or oppose it, I would hope that we could all support the Dodd amendment and ensure that we have the flexibility we need to protect our national security where we face an imminent and serious threat. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

I was disappointed that Congress did not enact this waiver last session as the Wellness Plan is the prototype for the type of health maintenance organization into which many Medicare beneficiaries will want to enroll. It is my hope that the Senate will act expeditiously on this legislation so that Michigan Medicare beneficiaries may have the opportunity to enroll in this well-established, quality plan.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am honored today to pay tribute to the city of Hamtramck, MI, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year. The people of Hamtramck call their city a `Touch of Europe in America,' and indeed it is truly a unique community. Hamtramck is a city within a city, whose boundaries on all sides are with the city of Detroit. Yet Hamtramck maintains its own identity, an identity rooted in its diversity. 
The history of Hamtramck predates its incorporation as a city by more than 100 years. It is named for Col. John Francis Hamtramck, who served as the first American commander of Fort Detroit after it was surrendered by Great Britain in 1796. Originally a township larger in size than the present-day city of Detroit, Hamtramck was organized as a village in 1901. 
The village of Hamtramck began with 500 people but changed dramatically with the birth of the automobile industry. A Dodge Bros. auto plant was established in 1914, attracting skilled and unskilled workers from around the Nation and the world. Between 1910 and 1920, Hamtramck boasted the greatest population growth of any community in the United States, going from 3,589 to 46,615 residents in a single decade. 
While Hamtramck was originally settled by the same French colonists who had settled Detroit, and later farmed by German immigrants, the automobile industry attracted huge numbers of Polish workers. Since 1910, Hamtramck's Polish population has grown so rapidly that today, 80 percent of its residents stem from first, second, or third generation Polish origin. 
Many of the remainder of Hamtramck's residents are from Central and Eastern Europe. Having received the warm and generous hospitality of Michiganite themselves, in 1946 the Polish-American residents of Hamtramck began welcoming displaced people from Central Europe and the Balkans. More recently, Hamtramck has seen a substantial number of Ukrainians join the community. All of these groups have maintained their cultural heritage and identity, while embracing the ideals and Government of their new country. 
On any street or in any restaurant in Hamtramck, one can hear any of 25 different languages being spoken, which is especially impressive in a city of slightly more than 2 square miles. Hamtramck is renowned for the best Polish food outside Poland, and the hospitality to match, as President Clinton discovered on a trip to Michigan in 1996 where he thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Polish Village Cafe. 
Mr. President, Hamtramck's blend of cultures has produced a city which truly feels like a `Touch of Europe in America.' Under the steady leadership of Mayor Robert Kozaren, Hamtramck is prepared to enter the 21st century with a confidence rooted in the varied traditions and fervent unifying patriotism of its citizens. I commend the residents and leaders of Hamtramck for the community they have built, and am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the people of Hamtramck on the occasion of the city's 75th anniversary.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I recently returned from a trip to NATO headquarters, to the headquarters of the United States European command, in Stuttgart, and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island joined me for a trip to the former Yugoslavia. While in Bosnia we visited Sarajevo, Tuzla, Simin Han, Hajvazi, and Mostar. We also visited Zagreb in Croatia and Belgrade in Serbia. I want to share the impressions and conclusions that I gained during the course of this trip. 
The situation within Bosnia is relatively stable. The forces of the NATO-led Implementation Force that ended its deployment in December 1996, accomplished its mission of separating the forces of the former warring factions, overseeing the placing of heavy military equipment in cantonment areas, and generally creating an environment in which civilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement could be carried out. The NATO-led stabilization force, which is scheduled to remain in Bosnia for 18 months from December 1996, is essentially continuing the mission of keeping the peace and creating a secure environment. 
I was heartened that some institutions of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been formed. In our separate meetings with the three Presidents and two Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I was struck by their avowed intention of working together to implement the Dayton agreement. There will, of course, be problems and frustrations as they seek to work together, but I believe that these day-to-day problems can be overcome if the immediate and middle term challenges I am about to discuss can be satisfactorily addressed.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of State Representative Robert A. DeMars of Michigan's 25th District, who passed away on October 21, 1996 while campaigning for an 8th term in office. 
Robert DeMars was a teacher by profession. For 26 years, he taught in the Lincoln Park Public School system. He served as local president of the Michigan Education Association and as local president, State vice president and National vice president of the American Federation of Teachers. Robert also served Lincoln Park as mayor, councilman and treasurer. 
Robert DeMars was a proud veteran who served during World War II in the U.S. Navy's Submarine Service. Protecting and improving the status of veterans was a cause that was very close to Robert's heart. As a State Representative, he introduced legislation to provide special license plates for veterans of WW I, WW II, the Korean and Vietnam wars to honor their service to the Nation. He was the chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee from 1982 to 1994. 
Despite Robert's numerous professional accomplishments during his lifetime, he never lost touch with his constituents. His down-to-earth style was a large part of his political success. Robert was a member of several charitable organizations as well as a sponsor of Little League baseball teams. His passing is a dramatic loss to many different segments of the community. Robert is survived by his wife Deanie and their daughter Maeann. 
On February 8, 1997, a Robert DeMars Memorial Charity Ball will be held to honor Robert's legacy and to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. This is a fitting tribute to Robert DeMars's life of public service and one I believe he would wholeheartedly approve of. I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring the life of Robert A. DeMars.

In 1991, the Forum magazine began the African-American Pioneer Awards to `document, honor, and celebrate the little-known accomplishments of African-Americans from the Flint community and other parts of Michigan.' 
I am pleased to congratulate the following recipients of the 1997 African-American Pioneer Award: 
Mr. Darwin Davis, a successful businessman and senior vice president of the Equitable. In a 1988 issue of Black Enterprise, Mr. Davis was listed as one of America's 25 most important black executives. 
The Velvelettes, one of three Motown bands still performing with its original members. The group is comprised of Flint natives Norma Barbee-Fairhurst, Bertha Barbee-Fairhurst and Kalamazoo natives Mildred Gill-Arbor and Carolyn Gill-Street. 
Creative Expressions Dance Studio, founded in 1990, which operates under the city of Flint's Parks and Recreation Department. The studio specializes in tap and ballet and has had great success in national and local competitions. 
Mr. Mario J. Daniels, founding member of Mario J. Daniels & Associates, P.C., the first African-American certified public accounting firm in Flint-Genesee County. 
Mr. Michael Shumpert, president-CEO of WOWE radio station, the only African-American owned and operated FM radio station in the Flint-Saginaw communities. 
Mr. Gregory Jackson, currently the only African-American GM dealer in the Flint-Genesee County area. 
Dr. Charlie Roberts, the first African-American to be appointed vice president at Mott Community College. 
The Pioneer Awards recognize the great contributions African-Americans have made and are making in the community. I know my Senate colleagues will join me in honoring the achievements of these outstanding Americans.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in supporting the nomination of our former colleague, Senator Bill Cohen, to be Secretary of Defense. 
I want to commend President Clinton for his willingness to reach across party lines to select a creative and independent thinker like Senator Cohen to serve as his Secretary of Defense. With this appointment, the President has shown his commitment to a bipartisan foreign policy and a strong national defense. He has selected someone who has very strong feelings about the role of Congress in making national security and foreign policy, and on the need for close consultation between the President and Congress in this area. I hope that Congress will reciprocate by working closely and constructively with the President and his new Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. President, I come from a State that was represented in the Senate for 23 years by Senator Arthur Vandenberg, who perhaps more than any other Senator in history stands for bipartisanship in national security and foreign policy. 
I also sit on the Armed Services Committee where Senator Cohen, for 18 years, served with me and displayed to me over and over and over again, as he did to all of our colleagues during this period, his instinct to be a true American patriot--not a Republican, not a partisan, but a patriot when it comes to American security and foreign policy issues. I look forward to working with him in his new capacity to continue that tradition. 
Senator Cohen's experience in the Senate should serve him well as he moves on to his new position. In his capacity as a member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Cohen has been a leader in virtually every major national security debate in the Congress for the past two decades. He was a forceful advocate for improving the quality--and the quality of life--of the All Volunteer Force in the late 1970's. He played a key role in the Armed Services Committee in drafting and passing the landmark Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act in the mid-1980's, as well as the legislation that strengthened our Special Operations Forces. He has been an innovative thinker in the area of arms control, and he helped force a bipartisan compromise on antiballistic missile policy in the last Congress. 
Senator Cohen has also shown his ability to work in a constructive manner across party lines on the Governmental Affairs Committee, where he and I served on the same subcommittee for 18 years, alternating as chairman and ranking minority members. We worked together on all of the recent acquisition reform legislation, including the Competition in Contracting Act, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, and the Information Technology Management Reform Act. We cooperated on oversight hearings that led to significant savings in defense inventory, the purchase of commercial items, and DOD travel costs 
--everything from the purchase of commercial items--where we worked closely together to make sure we buy more commercial items, to DOD travel costs--where we worked to try to reduce the administrative costs associated with DOD. 
Outside the defense arena, we worked side-by-side on the Senate floor to enact the Independent Counsel Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, and the Lobbying Disclosure Act. 
The Department of Defense and the Nation are fortunate to have been served by a long line of capable and effective Secretaries of Defense. I look forward to working with Senator Cohen to help him continue that tradition of effective leadership, and I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share this view. 
Mr. President, at this morning's hearing of the Armed Services Committee, I shared with Senator Cohen my experience from a visit that I recently made to Bosnia with Senator Jack Reed, during which we met with our military personnel--the men and women of our Armed Forces serving there--and our leadership, as well as the governmental leadership inside Bosnia and Serbia. 
We met with the three Presidents and two Prime Ministers of Bosnia and Hercegovina, with General Crouch, the Stabilization Force or SFOR Commander, and the United States and French sector commanders and troops, the Dayton Agreement High Representative Carl Bildt, and United States Embassy personnel. 
As a result of these meetings, I have reached a conclusion, which I shared with Senator Cohen this morning, that two things are going to be true relative to Bosnia. One, that we are going to need some kind of an outside force at the end of the 18-month period which is currently the mission length in Bosnia. For a number of reasons, in my judgment, there is no way that the current so-called stabilization force can leave Bosnia at the end of 18 months with any other result but that the same situation will return to Bosnia as previously existed there. 
Conclusion No. 1: There will need to be some form of an outside armed force to help maintain the stabilized situation which we are now creating in Bosnia. 
But, No. 2, we should not have our ground forces in Bosnia at the end of 18 months. Europe should take a greater responsibility, and there is a new development inside of NATO which makes that a possibility. 
There is a new development inside of NATO which is very fortuitous, which makes it possible for Europe to take over the leadership of any follow-on force after 18 months. That fortuitous development is that NATO is developing a European security and defense identity within the alliance which will permit European NATO nations, with NATO consent, to carry out operations under the political control and strategic direction of the western European Union, using NATO assets and NATO capabilities. That European initiative inside of NATO is the appropriate follow-on force after this 18-month period is over, should a follow-on force be necessary. In my judgment, at least, it will be. 
I was pleased that Senator Cohen shared my view that U.S. combat forces should not remain on the ground in Bosnia for more than 18 more months, and that he shared my optimism that it was at least possible that this new European security and defense initiative would be the right follow-on force in Bosnia should an outside armed force continue to be necessary. 
Although Senator Cohen has served on the Armed Services Committee for the past 18 years, the committee carried out the same thorough review of this nomination that we do for all nominations that come before the committee. We carefully reviewed his financial disclosure and his responses to the standard committee questionnaire. In late December, the committee submitted an extensive set of policy questions to Senator Cohen. His written answers were made available to all committee members and are part of the committee's written record of this nomination. Earlier today, the committee conducted a lengthy hearing with the nominee and examined his views on the full range of national security issues facing the United States. 
Mr. President, based on the committee's review of this nomination, and based on my own experience working with Senator Cohen over the past 18 years, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.

Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this morning, there were three wonderful introductions of Senator Cohen to the Armed Services Committee. The Presiding Officer, Senator Snowe, and Senator McCain made really stirring introductions of our former colleague, Senator Cohen. Not only were they wonderful, but it is a wonderful fact, indeed, that the person who is presiding over the Senate at this moment when he will be confirmed--I am sure overwhelmingly if not unanimously--is not only someone who is the successor to Senator Cohen, but someone who has Senator Cohen still no doubt as a mentor and was, indeed, on Senator Cohen's staff where she served so brilliantly as a subcommittee staff director on a subcommittee that I also chaired and was ranking member. 
So I want to congratulate the Presiding Officer for being where she is at this moment. It must be a treat, indeed, for her to be sitting there.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I was saddened Saturday to learn of the loss of one of the great men that I have had the honor of serving with in the U.S. Senate, Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. 
Paul Tsongas and I arrived in this body at the same time almost exactly 18 years ago in 1979. By that time Paul had already distinguished himself in 4 years of service in the House of Representatives, including legislation creating the first urban national historical park in his beloved hometown of Lowell. This became the catalyst for a remarkable renaissance in that historical New England mill town. 
He arrived as the first Peace Corps veteran ever elected to the Senate. He valued highly his opportunity to serve in Ethiopia and spoke frequently of those 2 years as the formative years of his desire for public service. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he was a voice for human rights around the world, but particularly on the African continent. In his 1981 book, `The Road From Here,' Paul wrote, `[Human rights] are rooted in our culture and history, and we should champion them. Third World people need to have us honor this principle because if we don't, no one effectively will. And ultimately it is the moral and economic strength of America that will count, not just our military might.' 
Paul accomplished a great deal in a short time in the Senate, including the passage of the Alaska Lands Act of 1980 which more than doubled the size of the national park system and which President Carter called the most important conservation legislation of the century. 
However, he will be remembered best for his years after the Senate. He retired from the Senate in 1984 after learning that he had cancer, pledging to devote more time to his family. In the book, `Heading Home', about his decision to leave the Senate, he wrote: `On their deathbed, no one ever said, 'I wish I had spent more time with my business.'.' 
He overcame cancer undergoing a then-experimental medical procedure, and went on to become a Presidential candidate in 1992, and a founder of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization which has become a credible and widely-respected grassroots voice for fiscal responsibility in government. 
As the family and friends of Paul Tsongas mourn his death and celebrate his life, Barbara and I will have Niki and Paul's three daughters Ashley, Katina, and Molly in our thoughts and prayers. 
Mr. President, a member of my staff, Rich Arenberg, who served Paul Tsongas for more than 10 years as a staff member and friend wrote a few personal words which are most apt:  
Paul Tsongas was an uncommon man. He honored America with the purity of his honesty and candor. There was no private Paul Tsongas, no public Paul Tsongas. He gave totally and completely of himself. He said exactly what he believed. In an age of partisan vitriol, he spoke softly and without animus. Although his voice was cool, his beliefs were passionately and tenaciously held. He believed that rational people of good will could solve any problem, bridge any difference, and lead by the force of reason. Paul Tsongas loved his family more than anything on earth and he loved his country deeply. He saw little distinction between the two because he believed the greatest gift we can give to our children is a strong future for America.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this Congress faces no more important task in these first few months than passing legislation to reform the campaign finance system. We just witnessed the most expensive campaign in the history of our country. According to the Washington Post, both major political party committees raised over $880 million in 1995 and 1996. That is estimated to be a 73 percent increase since the last Presidential election cycle. 
The increase in `soft' money raised by the parties during that same period was threefold--a 300 percent increase in `soft' money raised by the parties. The Washington Post again estimates that `soft' money contributions for 1995 and 1996 for Democrats was about $122 million, `soft' money contributions for Republicans was about $141 million. For a system that was supposed to eliminate contributions from corporations and unions, we have seen corporations and unions contribute or spend millions of dollars to aid in the election or defeat of congressional and Presidential candidates. 
For a system that was supposed to cap contributions from individuals at no more than $25,000 a year to national political parties and individual campaigns combined, we have seen hundreds of contributions from individuals to both parties that equal or exceed $100,000. For a system that was supposed to require that campaign advertisements be paid for with money subject to the contribution restrictions of our campaign finance laws, we have seen probably hundreds of commercials, many of which had a significant impact on the outcome of elections in which they were run, hundreds of commercials paid for with unregulated, unrestricted, undisclosed, so-called `soft' money. 
For the vast majority of these ads, the public does not know the basic facts of who contributed to the payments for these ads or how much was spent to air them. For years, we have pretended that we actually have had somewhat meaningful restrictions on campaign contributions. But with this past election cycle, the facade has fallen and we are faced with the naked truth that this system is wide open. 
That is why I am joining with Senator Daschle today in sponsoring his proposal for campaign finance reform which would eliminate or rein in many of the worst loopholes in the current system including the raising and spending of unregulated or `soft' money, independent expenditures by national parties, and campaign ads which masquerade as so-called issue ads. 
Senator Daschle's bill is a comprehensive response to the problem and on balance it is an achievable and meaningful reform proposal. Senator Daschle has incorporated in his bill several provisions that I authored dealing with issue ads and independent expenditures by parties. The approach that my provision in this bill takes with respect to so-called issue ads is to redefine `express advocacy' to include any advertising broadcast on radio or television 90 days before a primary or general election which specifically mentions a candidate. 
The Supreme Court has tried to draw a bright line in defining `express advocacy' by applying it only to those ads which include certain magic phrases like `Vote for Mrs. X' or `Defeat Mr. Y.' Such a test though leaves out ads which target a specific candidate and do not use the magic words that deliver the same message--for example, an ad that says, `Write to candidate Z and let him know how you feel' about an issue, which the ad has just strongly advocated or attacked. 
Now, my approach would treat any broadcast ad, any broadcast ad that appears within 90 days of an election in which a candidate is explicitly mentioned as `express advocacy' and payable therefore out of regulated funds. The approach which my provision takes with respect to independent expenditures by a party is to require a party to choose between making coordinated expenditures on behalf of a candidate or making independent expenditures. A party would not be allowed to have it both ways. And that is because it is impossible, practically speaking, for a national party to be truly independent from a candidate if it is also engaged in coordinated expenditures on that candidate's behalf. To argue otherwise defies common sense. It is one way or the other. If there is a coordinated campaign on the candidate's behalf, it is kind of hard to argue that that same national party can engage in coordinated expenditures relative to that campaign. 
We should not delay the consideration of campaign finance reform legislation, but we can always find a reason not to do it. This year there is a new reason. I have heard the suggestion that we should put off consideration of campaign finance reform until the hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee on campaign finance irregularities are finished, but the argument for delay has been used in one form or another for many, many Congresses and our job now is to show the American people that we can do it and we can do it now. 
The typical sophisticated analysis of the likelihood of campaign finance reform is that any reform is virtually impossible. `It will not happen,' you hear among those so-called well-informed folks. `The gap simply cannot be bridged,' some people say. 
We witnessed the end of the cold war 5 years ago. No one ever thought that was going to end. If we can achieve the end of the nuclear arms race, we surely can achieve the end of the money race in the American campaign system. I think most of us--and I, surely--want to be part of that effort. I want to do whatever it takes to facilitate action now. That is why I will be introducing in the next few days a more limited form of campaign finance reform to address certain limited, specific, but extensive abuses. Then, if we come to loggerheads over a comprehensive approach with more limited bills being offered as backups, there will be no excuse to not tackle at least some of the more pressing problems. 
Let me take a minute, Mr. President, to show you how out of kilter this system has become. There's an article in today's Roll Call about the treatment of the Business Roundtable by the Republican Party. Now the Business Roundtable, which is an organization of the biggest and most influential corporations in America, doesn't need me or anybody else, probably, to stand up for it. I am sure it can handle itself quite adequately when it is picked on. But when you have the Republican Party calling in 24 CEO's of companies who are members of the Business Roundtable to begin the `process of behavior modification' according to the persons who spoke to Roll Call, you've got a serious problem. 
According to Roll Call,  
Still angry that big business failed to adequately bankroll their campaigns and counter the AFL-CIO's onslaught of attack ads last fall, the Republicans want the BRT (Business Roundtable) to purge Democrats from its staff of nine directors. 
`You have to fix the problem. You have to fix the Business Roundtable,' one Republican source said, according to Roll Call, `explaining that the GOP leadership is urging the prestigious organization of corporate bigwigs to purge its staff.' 
The article goes on. 
The lawmakers are also urging the CEOs of some 200 corporations that comprise the BRT to dump their Democratic lobbyists, hire Republicans, and significantly increase the percentage of PAC contributions that go to GOP candidates. 
Later on, the article says, 
If the Republicans can get the BRT to change its ways the payoff could be big. Just as Willie Sutton robbed banks because `that's where the money is,' the GOP Congressional leaders realize that BRT members could handily boost Republican election efforts if the BRT would agree to fund issue-advocacy campaigns in future elections. 
What a sad state of affairs, Mr. President. Congressional leaders, according to this article, are trying to pressure a private organization as to whom its members should employ to lobby their offices, the amount of support these corporations should give to their party activities and how they should spend their money to influence elections on issue ads. And it is all done with what seems to be a threat--a `do this or else' attitude. 
The Wall Street Journal, reporting on this CEO meeting, suggests that the threat is more explicit than implied. The Wall Street Journal of January 9, 1997, reported: 
Companies that want to have it both ways, vows one top GOP strategist, no longer will be involved in Republican decision-making `or invited to our cocktail parties.' 
And this action is not because the Business Roundtable did not contribute to Republican candidates. No, according to the Wall Street Journal, the BRT gave twice as much to Republicans as they did to Democrats--$25 million to Republicans and only $11 million to Democrats. It is not enough that the BRT members already give to Republicans, they `should give a bigger percentage to the Republicans' than they are now giving, according to Haley Barbour, the Republican Party Chairman. 
This is punishment, Mr. President, to be imposed on an organization by party and Congressional leaders. That is the message behind this action--no money, no access--and it looks awful. That is how far we have come in this scramble for campaign money, and that is why we have to make the effort now to get going on campaign finance reform.

Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I could not agree more with something Senator Daschle said earlier today, when he urged us to enact campaign finance reform within the first 100 days of this Congress. The public is looking at us with greater scrutiny in this area than they have ever looked before. We have been down this road before, and I have walked down this road with colleagues, often on a bipartisan basis. 
The likelihood is we cannot get anything done in this area unless we act on a bipartisan basis. But act we must. That is what the public is telling us, and I believe the mood they are in will hold us accountable if we fail that charge. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor AM 1450, Iron Mountain and Kingsford, Michigan's Information Station. On January 25, 1996, the station will celebrate 50 years of continuous broadcasting and community service. 
On April 4, 1946, the first organizational meeting of the Iron Mountain Kingsford Broadcasting Co. was held to license a new radio station for the area. William and Frank Russell, along with the Delta Broadcasting Co. and the Lake Superior Broadcasting Co., were the driving force behind this organizing group. The new radio station was to be a news station operated by the Iron Mountain News, the area's daily newspaper. 
Construction on the broadcast facility began on November 14, 1946 and on November 21, the new station was officially named WMIQ, with William Goodrich serving as its first general manager. On Saturday, January 25, 1947, WMIQ began broadcasting at 8:00 a.m. Governors Sigler of Michigan and Goodland of Wisconsin both wired the station to offer words of congratulation. 
During the past 50 years, programming has included national and local news coverage, the `Scandinavian Cheer Hour' broadcast from the Bethel Mission Covenant Church in Swedish, live musical performances, the WMIQ Playhouse and Sunday morning services from First Lutheran Church. WMIQ also has a long history of national and local sports coverage. 
WMIQ ownership changed hands in 1968 when Jim Klungness and Charles Henry purchased the radio station. WMIQ currently has sister stations WIMK-FM in Iron Mountain and WUPK-FM in Marquette. WMIQ has been very active in the community over the years by supporting the Caring House for domestic violence victims, the Can-A-Thon food drive, the March of Dimes and Easter Seals. 
WMIQ has been an integral part of the Iron Mountain and Kingsford communities for the past fifty years. Its great work keeping the public apprised of current events has earned WMIQ the title of Michigan's `Information Station.' I know my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating WMIQ for a half century of service to its broadcasting audience.
