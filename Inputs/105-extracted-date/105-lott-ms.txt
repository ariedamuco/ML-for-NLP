Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator DeWine and commend him for his dedicated effort in this area. He felt that a wrong had been committed and that people had suffered because of no mistake of their own. Something had to be done to right the wrong.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate unanimously confirmed the nominations of John A. Moran and Harold J. Creel, Jr. to serve as Federal Maritime Commissioners. John Moran will be replacing Joseph Scroggins on the Commission while Hal Creel will be serving a second term as Chairman of the FMC. I applaud the selection of these two highly qualified individuals for these important positions. 
John Moran brings more than a decade of congressional and legislative experience in maritime transportation and policy to the FMC. During his nine-year tenure as a staffer in the House and Senate, John focused on a number of important maritime issues, including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. His work on the 1990 amendments to the Shipping Act of 1984 and the 1991-1992 Advisory Commission on Conferences in Ocean Shipping (ACCOS) ensures that he is well prepared for his FMC assignment. The ACCOS process crystallized the concerns of stakeholders regarding the Shipping Act of 1984 and was a forerunner to S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. This experience will serve John well as he assumes the shared responsibility for implementing that Act. I have great confidence in John Moran's ability and integrity. 
Hal Creel has been the Chairman of the FMC for more than four years. During that time, the agency has gone from being characterized as `obsolete' to being hailed as a champion of free and open access to foreign trade markets. Hal deserves tremendous credit for this reversal of fortune. Through Hal's leadership, the FMC has punished unfair foreign shipping practices in Japan and is reviewing similar concerns regarding shipping practices in China and Brazil. Hal has also demonstrated the FMC's willingness to respond quickly to industry complaints regarding violations of the Shipping Act of 1984. More than 90% of all U.S. international trade is transported by ships. Maintaining a fair and open international ocean shipping system is vital to this nation's economy. Hal is clearly deserving of another term as Chairman of this crucial independent agency. 
Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to another FMC commissioner, Ming Hsu, for her long service to this agency. Ming Hsu supplies a wealth of experience in Asia-U.S. trade to the FMC. This has proven vital to addressing a number of ocean shipping concerns in this increasingly important trade lane. 
With the President expected to sign the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 in the coming days, I am confident that the Federal Maritime Commission, with Hal Creel, John Moran, Ming Hus, and Del Won, is more than ready to implement this landmark legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just briefly, I thank the distinguished President pro tempore for the job he has done and for his friendship and help. Truly, one of the most important accomplishments of this Congress was our armed services authorization bill, the Strom Thurmond authorization bill. It was a tough process, a long process, but we got it done largely because of his tenacity and the respect and reverence we all have for Senator Thurmond. And that led, of course, to the appropriations bill and its defense and military construction portions, and it contributed to the additional funds that were added in this omnibus appropriations bill for defense and intelligence for the future of our country. 
Thank you, Senator Thurmond, for all you did.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in this last day of the 105th Congress, I think it is appropriate that we take a little more time to express our appreciation and our admiration for our retiring Senators. I look down the list: Senator Bumpers of Arkansas; Senator Coats of Indiana; Senator Ford, the Democratic whip, of Kentucky; Senator Glenn, who will soon be taking another historic flight into space; and Senator Kempthorne, who I believe is also going to be taking flight into a new position of leadership and honor. This is a distinguished group of men who have been outstanding Senators, who have left their mark on this institution. I believe you could say in each case they have left the Senate a better place than it was when they came. 
Have we had our disagreements along the way? Sure, within parties and across party aisles. I have to take a moment to express my appreciation to each of these Senators. I especially want to thank Senator Ford for his cooperation in his position as whip. We worked together for a year and a half as the whip on our respective side of the aisle and we always had a very good relationship. Of course, I have already expressed my very close relationship for Senator Coats and for Senator Kempthorne. 
To all of these Senators, I want to extend my fondest farewell. 
As majority leader, I feel a responsibility to speak for all of us in bidding an official farewell to our five colleagues who are retiring this year. 
It was 1974 when Dale Bumpers left the governorship of Arkansas to take the Senate seat that had long been held by Senator Fulbright. There are several Senators in this Chamber today who, in 1974, were still in high school. 
Four terms in the Senate of the United States can be a very long time--but that span of nearly a quarter-century has not in the least diminished Senator Bumpers' enthusiasm for his issues and energy in advancing them. 
He has been a formidable debater, fighting for his causes with a tenacity and vigor that deserves the title of Razorback. 
It is a memorable experience to be on the receiving end of his opposition--whether the subject was the Space Station or, year after year, mining on public lands. 
Arkansas and Mississippi are neighbors, sharing many of the same problems. From personal experience, I know how Senator Bumpers has been an assiduous and effective advocate for his State and region. 
No one expects retirement from the Senate to mean inactivity for Senator Bumpers, whose convictions run too deep to be set aside with his formal legislative duties. 
All of us who know the sacrifices an entire family makes when a spouse or parent is in the Congress can rejoice for him, for Betty, and for their family, in the prospect of more time together in a well earned future. 
Senator Dan Coats and I have a bond in common which most Members of the Senate do not share. We both began our careers on Capitol Hill, not as Members, but as staffers. 
I worked for the venerable William Colmer of Mississippi, Chairman of the House Rules Committee, who left office in 1972 at the age of 82. Senator Coats worked for Dan Quayle, who came to Congress at the age of 27. 
Despite the differences in our situations back then, we both learned the congressional ropes from the bottom up. 
Which may be why we both have such respect for the twists and turns of the legislative process, not to mention an attentive ear to the views and concerns of our constituents. 
Now and then, a Senator becomes nationally known for his leadership on a major issue. Senator Coats has had several such issues. 
One was the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. Another was New Jersey's garbage, and whether it would be dumped along the banks of the Wabash. 
The garbage issue is still unresolved, but on other matters, his success has been the nation's profit. 
He has championed the American family, improved Head Start, kept child care free of government control, and helped prevent a federal takeover of health care. 
His crusade to give low-income families school choice has made him the most important education reformer since Horace Mann. His passionate defense of children before birth has been, to use an overworked phrase, a profile in courage. 
Senator Coats does have a secret vice. He is a baseball addict. On their honeymoon, he took Marcia to a Cubs game. And when he was a Member of the House, he missed the vote on flag-burning to keep a promise to his son to see the Cubs in the playoffs. 
To Dan, a commitment is a commitment. That is why he is national president of Big Brothers. And why, a few years ago, he kept a very important audience waiting for his arrival at a meeting here on the Hill. 
He had, en route, come across a homeless man, and spent a half-hour urging him to come with him to the Gospel Rescue Mission. 
Here in the Congress, we must always be in a hurry. But Senator Coats and his wife, Marcia, have known what is worth waiting for. 
They have been a blessing to our Senate family, and they will always remain a part of it. 
Senator Wendell Ford stands twelfth in seniority in the Senate, with the resignation of his predecessor, Senator Marlow Cook, giving him a six-day advantage over his departing colleague, Senator Bumpers. 
He came to Washington with a full decade of hands-on governmental experience in his native Kentucky. He had been a State senator, Lieutenant Governor, and Governor. With that background, he needed little time to make his mark in the Senate. 
In that regard, he reminds me of another Kentuckian who make a lasting mark on the Senate. 
Last month, I traveled to Ashland, the home of Henry Clay, to receive a medallion named after the man once known as Harry of the West. Senator Ford was a prior recipient of that award, and appropriately so. 
Henry Clay was a shrewd legislator, a tough bargainer, who did not suffer fools lightly. That description sounds familiar to anyone who has worked with Senator Ford. 
He can be a remarkably effective partisan. I can attest to that. There is a good reason why he has long been his party's second-in-command in the Senate. 
At the same time, he has maintained a personal autonomy that is the mark of a true Senator. He has been outspoken about his wish that his party follow the more moderate path to which he has long adhered. 
Senator Ford's influence has been enormous in areas like energy policy and commerce. Contemporary politics may be dependent upon quotable sound-bites and telegenic posturing, but he has held to an older and, in my opinion, a higher standard. 
One of the least sought-after responsibilities in the Senate is service on the Rules Committee. 
It can be a real headache. But it is crucial to the stature of the Senate. We all owe Senator Ford our personal gratitude for his long years of work on that Committee. 
His decisions there would not always have been my decisions; that is the nature of our system. But his work there has set a standard for meticulousness and gravity. 
All of us who treasure the traditions, the decorum, and the comity of the Senate will miss him. 
We wish him and Jean the happiness of finally being able to set their own hours, enjoy their grandchildren, and never again missing dinner at home because of a late-night session on the Senate floor. 
There are many ways to depart the Senate. Our colleague from Ohio, Senator John Glenn, will be leaving us in a unique fashion, renewing the mission to space which he helped to begin in 1962. 
In the weeks ahead, he will probably be the focus of more publicity, here and around the world, than the entire Senate has been all year long. 
It will be well deserved attention, and I know he accepts it, not for himself, but for America's space program. 
For decades now, he has been, not only its champion, but in a way, its embodiment. 
That is understandable, but to a certain extent, unfair. For his astronaut image tends to overshadow the accomplishments of a long legislative career. 
In particular, his work on the Armed Services Committee, the Commerce Committee, and our Special Committee on Aging has been a more far-reaching achievement than orbiting the earth. 
With the proper support and training, others might have done that, but Senator Glenn's accomplishments here in the Senate are not so easily replicated. 
This year's hit film, `Saving Private Ryan,' has had a tremendous impact on young audiences by bringing home to them the sacrifice and the suffering of those who fought America's wars. 
I think Senator Glenn has another lesson to teach them. For the man who will soon blast off from Cape Canaveral, as part of America's peaceful conquest of space--is the same Marine who, more than a half century ago, saw combat in World War II, and again in Korea. 
His mission may have changed, but courage and idealism endure. 
In a few days, along with Annie and the rest of his family, we will be cheering him again, as he again makes us proud of our country, proud of our space program, and proud to call him our friend and colleague. 
Senator Dirk Kempthorne came to us from Idaho only six years ago. He now returns amid the nearly universal expectation that he will be his State's next Governor. It will be a wise choice. 
None of us are surprised by his enormous popularity back home. We have come to know him, not just as a consummate politician, but as a thoughtful, decent, and caring man. 
This is a man who took the time to learn the names of the men and women who work here in the Capitol and in the Senate office buildings. 
In fact, his staff allots extra time for him to get to the Senate floor to vote because they know he will stop and talk to people on the way. 
During the memorial ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda for our two officers who lost their lives protecting this building, Senator Kempthorne noticed that the son of one of the officers, overwhelmed by emotion, suddenly left the room. 
Dirk followed him, and spent a half-hour alone with him, away from the cameras. The public doesn't see those things, but that's the kind of concern we expect from him. 
His willingness to share credit gave us our Unfunded Mandates Act and reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Law. And his eye for detail and pride in his own home State led to the transformation of that long, sterile corridor between the Capitol and the Dirksen and Hart office buildings. 
Now, as tourists ride the space-age mechanized subway, they enjoy the display of State flags and seals that form a patriotic parade. It delights the eye and lifts the spirit. 
If you've ever visited Idaho, known its people, and seen its scenic wonders, you don't have to wonder why he's leaving us early. 
You wonder, instead, why he ever left. 
Years ago, he explained his future this way: That he would know when it was time to leave the Senate when he stopped asking `why' and started saying `because.' 
We're going to miss him and Patricia, and no one needs to ask `why.' Even so, we know the Governor will be forceful spokesman on the Hill for all the governors. 
They could not have a better representative. The Senate could not have a better exemplar. We could not have a better friend. 
Mr. President, I would also like to pay tribute to two members of my Senate team who plan to leave us by the end of the year. 
As our Sergeant at Arms, Greg Casey holds one of the Senate's highest positions of trust and authority. It is an awesome job, overseeing the hundreds of employees who keep the Capitol in operation. 
There is also a ceremonial component to the position of Sergeant at Arms, and Greg has performed in that role admirably well. 
But behind the formalities lie enormous operational responsibilities. It is not a job for the weak of will. Greg's performance has set, for all future occupants of his office, a new standard of energy, efficiency, and spirit. 
By recognizing hard work and achievement at all levels, he has led the entire Capitol work force to become more professional, more modern, and more team-oriented. 
Before appointing him Sergeant at Arms, I had the benefit of his managerial skills as administrative officer to the Majority Leader. 
He helped me reassemble the office after Senator Dole moved on to other efforts. And before that, he had served for years as Chief of Staff to Senator Larry Craig of Idaho. 
That was a natural fit, for Greg is a classic Idahoan, like his State's two Senators, to whom he has been close since his college days. He is a doer, not a talker, and is undaunted by the challenges from which others shrink. He has done a great job for me, for the Senate, and for his country. 
One of his chief concerns has been the security of the Capitol. 
Even before the tragic events of last July, he had begun to enhance the safety of those who visit, and those who work in, this building. 
We thank Julia, his wife, and their little boy, Greg Jr., for their sacrifice of the family time that means so much to them. And we share their happiness that they will now have more time together. 
The second member of my team who will be leaving in the near future is Steve Seale, legal counsel to the Majority Leader. 
Steve came to Washington a little more than two years ago at my request--and gave up a seat in the Mississippi Senate to do so. Even more of a sacrifice was moving, with Miriam and their two little girls, Caitlin and Elise, from their home in Hattiesburg to the wilds of Northern Virginia. 
He has poured his heart into what can be a thankless task: guarding every line of the law, while telling those in authority what they cannot do. 
In official Washington today, no one needs to be reminded of how important those functions are. 
Steve has handled an array of judicial, legal, and constitutional issues for me; and I have not been alone in relying on his counsel. 
I have deeply appreciated his loyalty, but I have valued even more his willingness to put the law--in all its complexity and with all its restrictions and limitations--before all else, including the convenience of person or of party. 
Displayed on his desk is a hand-written note from his two daughters, which, with certain adjustments in spelling, reads like this: `Dear Dad, come home for hugs and kisses.' 
The Senate cannot beat that offer, and I do not begrudge Steve the opportunity to put family first. Indeed, many Members of Congress will envy him. 
There is a saying among persons who have been on my staff, all the way back to my early days in the House of Representatives. 
They say that, once you have worked for Lott, you always work for Lott. 
I take that as a compliment, and I'm taking this occasion to let Steve know that, in his case, it is going to apply for a long, long time. 
Mr. President, before we turn to other business, I should offer one final tribute. 
When the American people tune in to our televised proceedings, they often see, here beside me or elsewhere on the Senate floor, a lovely young woman, tall, blonde, and beautiful. Her name is Alison Carroll McSlarrow. 
What they cannot see is that she is smart, hard-working, savvy, dedicated, principled, caring, ingenious--a master of our legislative process, expert in our Senate rules, an astute advisor, and a persistent voice of conscience to do the right thing. 
She came to the Senate after teaching grade school. That experience both reflected and strengthened her interest in children. It helps to explain her opposition to the destructive policies that have for so long dominated federal education programs. 
As legislative assistant to Senator Dan Coats, as a Republican staffer in the Labor and Human Resources Committee--and as my chief floor assistant when I was the Majority Whip, she has had a major impact, not only on the processes we follow, but on the policies we have advanced. 
Indeed, her determination to protect the health care of the American family had a great deal to do with the defeat of the President's plan to bring that sector of the economy under government control. 
For the last two and a half years, she has been my deputy chief of staff. I have relied upon her for everything from vote counts to policy analysis, from parliamentary tactics to legislative strategy. 
In her office hangs a framed series of photographs, taken when she was seated next to me here. As I made some expansive gesture, I somehow knocked her in the head. 
Her composure never changed; mine did. She remained the consummate professional, doing her job above all else. 
Before the 106th Congress assembles in January, Alison and her husband, Kyle, Senator Coverdell's chief of staff, will have moved to Arizona, where he will be working for former Vice President Dan Quayle. It is hard to imagine my office without her. 
I will miss her expertise, of course, and the way she stands up to me more than anyone else on my staff. I will miss her good humor and her idealism. And the Senate will miss her more than I can say. 
She leaves with our gratitude, our admiration, and our love.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to recognize some of my own staff members. Alison Carroll McSlarrow has been my deputy Chief of Staff for the past couple of years. She has done a wonderful job. I have tried to talk her out of getting married and then out of moving to Arizona. But Kyle McSlarrow, who worked with me a while, and now works with Senator Coverdell, swept her off her feet and now off to Arizona. I will never quite get over what he has done to me. They are a great and wonderful couple. Alison has come to be one of my most trusted aides. She is so competent. I have always been able to rely on her. I will miss her tremendously. I wanted to have an expression of my appreciation in the Record for her. 
My counsel, Steve Seale, will be going downtown to work with a law firm, which will remain nameless for now. He is a close friend from my own State of Mississippi. He was a naval officer and he was a State Senator and had an outstanding law practice. He left that to come and work for me over the past 3 years. He has done an outstanding job. I wish him the very best in the future. 
Last but not least, I want to especially recognize our Sergeant at Arms, Gregg Casey. Gregg had worked for, of course, our policy chairman, Larry Craig. He did a great job with him as Chief of Staff. He is a very close friend of Dirk Kempthorne, the other Senator from Idaho. He came to my aid when I became majority leader to try to help me get my office organized, as I was putting 3 separate staffs into one. He has a real talent for organization and getting an office set up where it can be administered properly. I had another emergency on my hands. We had a need for a new Sergeant at Arms and he agreed to not go back with Senator Craig and go into this position of Sergeant at Arms. Over the past 2, 2 1/2 years, he has done a great job in my Senate office and as Sergeant at Arms. It has been difficult in many respects because there were problems that needed to be dealt with. He stepped up to the task. 
Of course, we had the very trying experience when we had two of our own security people here in the Capitol killed. That week, I'm sure, is one that has been indelibly marked in Gregg Casey's mind--the horror of it and all that went on. Actually, through it all, a family atmosphere came out of it, and everybody felt a closeness. He did a great job in the aftermath of that and provided real leadership. I know he is going to have many great opportunities in the future. I thank Gregg Casey for a job well done as Sergeant at Arms. This place is better because of the service he has given.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that there was an objection to the final passage of the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Act of 1998. This bipartisan consumer measure would have combated the growing and costly fraud of selling rebuilt salvage vehicles as undamaged used cars. This small, but important package would have saved consumers and automobile dealers more than $4 billion annually and would have kept millions of structurally unsafe vehicles off America's roads and highways. 
As my colleagues are aware, the practice of selling salvage vehicles without disclosing their damage history has become a serious national problem--aided by titling requirements that vary from state to state. A significant number of our colleagues in this chamber recognized that the status quo simply is not working. Something needed to be done to protect used car buyers and automobile dealers all across America from title washing. This Congress took action to quell this anti-consumer plague that has preyed on unsuspecting victims for far too long. Unfortunately, the Administration killed this much needed consumer protection measure. 
Mr. President, the House of Representatives, under the stewardship of Chairman Tom Bliley of the House Commerce Committee, and Congressman Rick White, the author of the House companion bill, passed most of the Senate's legislation on October 10 with bipartisan support. The House wisely chose to exclude a federal overlay system in addition to existing state branding procedures. This duplicative approach was strongly opposed by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators which represents the very people who would administer the provisions of any auto salvage legislation.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. The motor vehicle administrators, the real front line experts on this issue, carefully and thoughtfully outlined their practical concerns with the proposed federal overlay approach. 
First, the AAMVA letter noted that a federal overlay along with a separate state branding process undercuts the important objective of uniformity in the handling of salvage vehicles. 
Second, since participation in the federal standards is entirely voluntary for the states, the federal `overlay' approach serves no useful purpose. 
And, third, the letter pointed out that the federal overlay would create an unworkable, unmanageable system. 
The AAMVA also cautioned in its letter that `the burden of interpreting and maintaining two sets of standards could discourage states from even attempting to implement the federal provisions. For the states that do attempt to implement, it will cause a ripple effect of confusion and errors among states that do not implement.' In my view, these are compelling arguments against adopting the federal overlay approach that was added when the bill passed the Senate on October 2. 
Since the legislation was reported by the Senate Commerce Committee in November of last year, a large number of changes were made to the bill in an effort to address expressed concerns. Again, I would emphasize that the final title branding legislation included a number of significant changes to make the bill even more pro-consumer and to provide states with maximum flexibility. It closed the gaps that exist between conflicting state vehicle titling laws that allow dishonest rebuilders to perpetuate their fraudulent schemes without the need for a complicated, redundant, and burdensome federal overlay framework. 
The bipartisan compromise package included: 
A salvage threshold that was lowered from 80 percent to 75 percent. 
A provision that allows states to cover any vehicle, regardless of age. 
A provision that grants state Attorneys General the ability to sue on behalf of citizens who are victimized by rebuilt salvage fraud and recover monetary judgments for damages that citizens may have suffered. 
With respect to the bill's `prohibited acts,' the Senate bill replaced the House's `knowingly and willfully' standard with a `knowingly' standard. 
Two new prohibited acts, one related to making a flood disclosure and the other related to moving a vehicle or title in interstate commerce for the purpose of avoiding the bill's requirements. 
Flexibility for the states to provide additional disclosures to their citizens regarding the damage history of vehicles; synonyms of the defined terms that a conforming state could not use in connection with a vehicle were deleted. 
A provision that allows a state to establish a lesser percentage threshold for salvage vehicles if it so chooses. In other words, a state could set its threshold below the 75 percent level and still be in compliance with the provisions of the bill. Some consumer groups and some attorneys general advocated that states should be able to set their thresholds lower if they so desire. In the interest of compromise, we agreed to adopt that position. 
The package that I just outlined clearly indicates that the supporters of the legislation proceeded in good faith to reach a reasonable compromise for an effective bill. A number of changes were adopted a long the way in effort to protect used car consumers from title laundering. Equally important, the changes preserved the right of the states to determine what is in the best interests of their citizens. 
While I commend my colleagues in both chambers and from both sides of the aisle for passing versions of this important consumer protection legislation, I again want to express my regret that the Administration chose to oppose the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Act. 
Now, instead of improving the hodgepodge of state titling laws, the Administration allows unscrupulous auto rebuilders to launder car and truck titles so they bear no indication of a vehicle's damage history. Perpetuating a costly fraud. A $4 billion annual consumer swindle. 
Instead of endorsing this pro-disclosure measure and protecting Americans from title fraud, the Administration has allowed more wrecks on wheels to be put back on our roads and highways.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to express my personal disappointment that S. 2180, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, was not enacted into law by this Congress. 
The Lott-Daschle scrap recycling bill was cosponsored by 64 Senators and over 300 members of the House. It was strongly supported by the Administration, the environmental community and the scrap recycling industry. 
Mr. President, the odds for success don't get much better than this.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Internet Tax Freedom Act was included in the 1998 Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
Congress wants a limited moratorium, accompanied by a careful review of all Internet and electronic commerce tax issues. This will give Congress the opportunity to properly evaluate state and local government interstate taxation, federal taxation and trade treatment of the Internet and electronic commerce. By enacting this measure, Congress also declared that the Internet should be free of any new federal taxes during the moratorium. 
Mr. President, present federal law imposes no tax specifically on the Internet, including domain name registrations. However, with several of my colleagues, I have become aware of a pertinent U.S. Federal Court case, Thomas et al v. National Science Foundation et al. In this case, the Court recently declared that Section 8003--Ratification of Internet Fees--of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of FY98 did sanction what had been previously found by the Court to be an unconstitutional tax on domain name registrations. 
I want to take this opportunity to state for the record that Section 8003 was never intended by Congress to ratify a tax on the Internet, but only to address a fee for the Intellectual Infrastructure Fund. Let me be clear. Section 8003 was not an authorization of any tax, unconstitutional or otherwise. 
Mr. President, I am pleased this Congress rightly recognized the importance of the Internet and electronic commerce to America's economy, and the need to eliminate uncertainty and confusion surrounding Internet taxation policies. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

As our nation continues to seek ways to improve environmental quality and to reduce the need for imported energy, several new technologies run the risk of not being developed if Congress does not act to provide incentives to develop clean alternative fuels. 
These technologies provide two significant benefits to our nation. First, the use of alternative fuels reduces our reliance on foreign energy sources. Second, the technologies provide cleaner results for our environment. 
For these reasons, I want to assure my colleague from Montana that I will make a priority of addressing the need for tax incentives to produce clean alternative fuels.

 Mr. LOTT. I share the sentiments of my colleagues from Louisiana. I am frustrated over the Senate's inability to complete this legislation. Indeed, he and I have championed this bipartisan effort for some years now. I will resume our joint efforts early in the next Congress to secure final ratification of this critical Agreement. 
U.S. participation in the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement and the elimination of foreign subsidies is essential. U.S. commercial shipyards cannot successfully compete with the treasuries of other nations. Of course, our implementing legislation must also make it clear that our vital Jones Act interests and our national security prerogatives will never be compromised. 
The implementing legislation developed in this Congress represents a consensus product with input for many Senators who carefully weighted and balanced these important objectives of OECD. The legislation was reported by the Finance Committee on two separate occasions and by the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on yet another. It enjoys the strong support of both Chairman and vast majority of their Committees. 
Let me be clear: Navy ships are unequivocally exempted from coverage by this Agreement in fact this legislation gives unlimited authority of the Secretary of Defense to exempt from coverage of any other vessels deemed necessary for national security purposes. 
Similarly, extraordinary steps were taken to protect our Jones Act. That is why this legislation received the strong endorsement from the vast majority of the Jones Act shipbuilding and ship operating companies. 
On a final note, I hope our OECD Shipbuilding Agreement parties will take note of my intention and commitment to move this legislation early next before taking any action on their own which might forever compromise this historic opportunity to rationalize the global shipbuilding market.

I hope that will give us enough time to figure out what to do with this. 
Let me assure my colleagues that if it becomes clear that such a system will not be able to be implemented without adverse effects on our border communities, on trade, or on tourism, I will work with them on authorizing legislation to remedy any problems and will work with them to ensure that no appropriations go toward implementing any system that will not be acceptable to them and supported in their States.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the Greenwood Business and Professional Club of Greenwood, Mississippi, and the working women who comprise its membership. The club was established on November 20, 1931, and will be holding its annual Women of Achievement Banquet on Thursday, October 22, 1998. It is my privilege to note that my daughter, Tyler Lott, a working woman in her own right, will provide the banquet's keynote address. 
For nearly 67 years, the Greenwood Business and Professional Club has been a shining example of women helping women through countless programs and projects. More importantly, the members of this club are representative of working women across America who make invaluable sacrifices every day to strengthen the economy and fiber of our families, communities, states and nation. 
Working women are found in virtually every profession, trade and vocation, and constitute well over 62 million members of the United States workforce. In fact, women-owned businesses account for approximately one-third of domestic firms and employ over 13 million people. Moreover, we should always remember that, in addition to women working in traditional businesses, women may be found working in homes throughout America making significant contributions each day through their occupation as homemakers. 
As working women continue their service to America through professional, civic and cultural endeavors, it is fitting that we recognize their growing numbers, and congratulate these women who labor so tirelessly and effectively both inside and outside the home. Whether in business, industry, a profession, or as a homemaker, today's working women are vital role models for young women coast-to-coast who will help mold the future of this country. 
I am honored to have this opportunity to commend our nation's working women, and to extend my most sincere thanks to the members of the Greenwood Business and Professional Club for its 67 years of achievement and service.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President I would like to make a few brief comments about the IDeA program within this bill, a program that I think is imperative to our nation's biomedical research capability. I would also like to engage in a brief dialog with the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, on this important issue. 
The National Institutes of Health Institutional Development Award program--known as the IDeA program--builds additional research capacity and is an important part of our effort to better treat, cure and prevent disease by addressing the undue geographic concentration of research funds. IDeA works to increase our nation's biomedical research capability by broadening our country's research base. IDeA funds biomedical research in states that have not participated substantially in NIH research programs. 
Mr. President, many scientists are concerned about the extreme geographic concentration of NIH research funds. In Fiscal Year 1995, for example, the NIH made $9.3 billion in extramural awards. Mr. President, the 24 states that participate in the IDeA program received just 5.2 percent of those funds. Let me repeat: in FY95, the last year for which we have complete figures, the NIH awarded funds across this nation totaling $9.3 billion. But all the researchers in the 24 IDeA states combined received only $487 million of that. On the other hand, one state alone received nearly three times the total amount of those 24 states combined. The top 5 states received nearly one-half the NIH funds. 
Let me be clear, Mr. President, that the concern here is not one of a parochial nature. Nobody is saying that the NIH ought to distribute funding evenly by states. But at a time when we are seeing substantial increases in the NIH research budget, we need to increase the capacity of every region of the country--not just of a handful of states. 
IDeA has potential to be an important part of our efforts to build our biomedical research capacity, but it has not received the level of funding it needs to truly be effective. The FY99 NIH budget request was $14.76 billion. Of that amount--well over $14 billion--the NIH requested just $5.2 million for the IDeA program. The bill before us includes $10 million for IDeA, which is a start--but in my view not enough to accomplish the goal for which the program was intended. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Specter, for the support he has given IDeA thus far, but I believe we can and should do more next year. 
Mr. President, I would ask the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, if he would like to add anything to what I have said.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, negotiations are still ongoing with respect to the omnibus appropriations bill, but I think I can say that it is in its very final stages, and we should have a final conclusion before 2 o'clock so that all of the drafting can be carried out. I emphasize, though, there are a few minor issues that have not been finally cleared, and there are a couple of big issues that are still being debated about exactly what the effective date would be, for instance, with regard to the census issue. 
I think it is a very important issue. The census is in the Constitution. And the Constitution says that the census shall be taken by enumeration; that means count, head count. No amount of modern manipulation or technology can replace what the Constitution says. Twice Federal courts have ruled 3-0 that the census must be done by enumeration. 
But rather than fight this out on and on and on, I think the logical order to do business is, let the Supreme Court rule, which they will do in March, and then we will proceed from there. That issue has not been finally resolved, but it will be in the next couple of hours, and then every Senator and House Member will have an opportunity to ask questions, to look at the language. 
There are hundreds--thousands--of issues that are in this legislation. But the legislation will be available. There will be staff and Senators and Congressmen who have been involved, who can answer questions about things as varied as education and agriculture and defense and the drug war and missile defense. It is all in this bill. 
I must say that while there are some great disappointments on my part about what is not in the bill and some disappointments about some things that are in the bill, on balance this is going to be good for America. I had a question a moment ago about who is the winner and who is the loser. The only question should be: Is America the winner? Are our children going to be better off, safer? Will there be a greater effort to fight the scourge of drugs in our schools and in our society? The answer is yes. 
We will have a stronger defense. For the first time since 1985, we have stopped the free-fall in spending for the necessary readiness and equipment for our men and women in uniform. We added some $9 billion in this legislation for the drug war, for defense of our country, for intelligence, and for missile defense. 
We also agreed to $690 million for a greater effort in the drug area. We did agree to the President's request for more funds for education. A lot of time has been spent this year in the education area, and we have made some progress. We have a better higher education bill. We are going to have a stronger vocational education bill. And that is an area where I think we should put a lot more emphasis. 
We did improve on some of the programs connected to Head Start, and we are going to have more teachers in our schools in America, smaller class sizes. But the decision of how it is going to be done will be made at the local level in the individual school districts; it will not be dictated by and run by bureaucrats here in Washington, DC. So I think that was a significant achievement on both sides of the issue. 
I will not go down the list of all the areas in this bill, but when you look at them all and you consider what we have done and what this can lead to next year, I think it is progress, and I hope the Members will believe that they can support it. 
There will be time for Members to review its content. If a rollcall is requested, it is expected to occur at either 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, to accommodate the maximum number of Senators and give them time to review the language that is included in the final agreement. Certainly, we will make Members aware of any specific time for votes, if necessary. I will be consulting with Senator Daschle on that. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention and for their cooperation throughout the year. 
I do have a number of issues that we would like to do in terms of some tributes and resolutions on travel and other issues. So I would like to do that now.

Of course, I have said here, Dan Coats has been one of my closest friends for the past 20 years. I will miss him here but I will be with him in other areas. 
And, of course, John Glenn makes history once again flying off into space. And many Senators and their spouses will be there to see that event.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to add one note. I have never seen a more diligent Senator than Senator Thurmond has been in opening the Senate. He and Senator Byrd are living institutions. They have reverence for this institution. Many times, Senator Thurmond had been up late, had committee hearings, had been involved in moving the Thurmond bill, which was the armed services authorization bill, and had worked well into the night for a year. But when the Senate would open at 8:30, 9 o'clock, or 9:30, he was in the Chair and always very kind to our Chaplain. That exemplifies what the Senate should really be like. So I add my special appreciation to the President pro tempore. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. I thank the Chaplain again for his prayer. Over the past few days, as we have tried to negotiate in good faith, it has been so important we try to maintain respect for each other. Yesterday morning I had reached the point where I had lost that. But I referred to the Chaplain's book `One Quiet Moment,' and there was a passage in there, I believe from Proverbs, that said you must respect your fellow human beings. And I thought about that, and I thought from the unborn child in late term, they have a right to respect for human life, or a young man in Wyoming who is killed, for whatever horrible motives, they have a right to respect, and also for strong action against those who caused this problem. So the admonition to negotiate in good faith and have respect for each other has certainly been a source of strength to me during the last 48 hours.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- N O T I C E   If the 105th Congress adjourns sine die on or before October 16, 1998, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the 105th Congress will be published on October 28, 1998, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the case of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg), S.A., et al. versus Abdul Raouf Hasan Khalil, et al., pending in the District Court for the District of Columbia, is a civil action brought by court-appointed fiduciaries of the Bank of Credit and Commerce, International, known as BCCI, to recover on behalf of depositors and creditors of BCCI funds wrongfully diverted from the bank. 
Between 1988 and 1992, the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations of the Committee on Foreign Relations, under the leadership of Senator John Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, conducted a wide-ranging investigation into BCCI. As the Subcommittee described in its report to the Foreign Relations Committee, one of the individuals with whom the Subcommittee staff met during its investigations may have used his contacts with the Subcommittee to extort money from BCCI. The court-appointed fiduciaries are seeking to recover any such improperly diverted funds. As a part of that effort, the fiduciaries are seeking testimony from a former Subcommittee counsel, Jack Blum, about his contacts with the BCCI employee. 
Both Senator Kerry and the Committee believe that it is appropriate to authorize the testimony requested on this subject. This resolution would accordingly authorize Mr. Blum to testify about this subject and to be represented by the Senate Legal Counsel in connection with the testimony.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, despite the fact that the Senate passed S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998, it looks like next year will be the year for aviation. This is disappointing, since S. 2279 promised to bring much needed air service to underserved communities throughout the Nation--a promise that will be delayed. 
The first session of the 106th Congress should prove to be an important year for our Nation's air passengers. My top aviation policy priority remains to increase regional jet competition and flight service to smaller markets. Most Americans do not live in `Hub' cities and thus do not benefit from the range of choices and concentration of air service options. I look forward to working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and on the Commerce Committee to insure that rural and underserved communities receive adequate air transportation with improved flight service and more affordable airline tickets. 
Commerce Committee Chairman McCain has been a tremendous help. He understands the needs of underserved markets, and fully appreciates that adequate and affordable air service is a vital economic development issue for smaller cities. He too wants to improve the quality and quantity of flights originating from smaller airports. He gets it. I look forward to working with the chairman to build upon the principles set forth in the Ford Act. 
Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, chairman of the Subcomittee on Aviation, has provided pivotal guidance and has been instrumental in bringing focus to the many aspects of aviation. His inclusive and enthusiastic approach has engaged all who work with him. 
Additionally, Senator Bill Frist proved to be a great asset and a very effective advocate for the rural aviation community during this past session. His hard work brought small and underserved communities closer to receiving much needed public policy changes for flight service improvements. I look forward to looking with him in the next Congress to insure that small town America's aviation interests are met. 
Aviation policy always effects the management and administration of local airports. Mr. Dirk Vanderleest of the Jackson International Airport is one outstanding Mississippi airport director that counseled me on the needs of small and under served markets. His wisdom is cherished, and his efforts to push Mississippi's aviation priorities are appreciated. 
Mr. Gene Smith of the Golden Triangle Regional Airport in Columbus also counseled me on Mississippi's aviation needs. He served as a member of the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and distinguished himself as a supporter for regional jet air transportation. I hope the recommendations made by Mr. Smith and the other Commissioners are not overlooked in the next Congress. I look forward to his continued input in our Nation's future aviation policy discussions. 
Next year will be a watershed year for aviation policy. Quality air service for all Americans should be the focus of any aviation legislation. Quality air service is good for economic development, and it is good for Americans in the 21st Century.

Mr. LOTT. This afternoon, the Senate will begin a period of morning business. Following morning business, the Senate will consider any legislation that may be cleared by unanimous consent only. It is expected that the House will send over a 2-day continuing resolution that will keep the Government operating until midnight Wednesday. That will allow us to continue our negotiations on the omnibus appropriations bill. 
I can report that we have been meeting, of course on Sunday afternoon, and we have been meeting this morning, and we are back in sessions now between the House, the Senate and the administration. I think some progress is being made. It is, as most negotiations of this type, forward two, back one. A lot of the appropriations work has been done. We are now talking about language problems and also beginning to consider the supplemental appropriations final composition. 
As a reminder to all Members, it is hoped that the remaining legislation of the 105th Congress can be cleared by unanimous consent. However, if a rollcall vote is needed on the omnibus bill, all Members will be given ample notice in order to plan their schedules accordingly. It would appear to me at this time that there probably would not be--well, there will not be any recorded votes on any subject other than the omnibus bill, and that it may not occur until sometime Wednesday. We would look at the possibility of Wednesday morning, but it could be Wednesday afternoon. I think it will be a physical situation at that time, just physically getting the work done and allowing everybody to review it to make sure it is as we had agreed it would be. If there develops here in the next 3 or 4 hours the possibility that there could be a final vote Tuesday afternoon late, we will immediately notify all Members. But it appears that if a vote is required, it will probably be sometime during the day Wednesday, at least as things now stand. 
I thank my colleagues for their patience and their assistance.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take this time to recognize the important role and work of the Senate's Subcommittee on Communications this Congress and emphasize the challenges that lie ahead. 
The communications world encompasses so many areas that personally touch the lives of practically every person in America--from the telephone to the television to the computer. The ways we interact is a fitting reflection of the fast times in which we live and the constant evolution of technologies. Traditional systems are changing. Options are expanding. Companies continue to shift gears and take the necessary risks to bring fruition of the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act to the marketplace and to consumers. 
Enacting policies to encourage, and not hinder, such activity is Congress' challenge. Mr. President, I believe the members of this subcommittee are ready and willing to embrace that challenge. 
I want to express my sincere gratitude to my colleague and friend, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, for his yeoman's work as chairman of the subcommittee during the course of this Congress. His guidance has been instrumental in bringing focus to the many issues that merit attention. His inclusive and enthusiastic approach has engaged all who work with him, and I appreciate that. 
Mr. President, many contentious policy areas were considered by the subcommittee during the 105th, and consensus proved elusive. I am confident, though, that the stage has been set for several productive debates in the first session of the 106th--from Federal Communications Commission reauthorization, to international satellite privatization, to transition to digital, to competition issues, to Internet privacy and content. 
Speaking of the Internet, let me take this opportunity to mention my deep admiration for the contributions made by retiring Senator Dan Coats in this area. Although not a member of the Commerce Committee, he has tirelessly advocated against the Internet becoming a dirty book for our children, while responsibly taking into account first amendment concerns. I have the utmost respect for his efforts, and will truly miss his wisdom and his counsel. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the contributions of each of my subcommittee colleagues this Congress, and look forward to working with them next year in tackling some tough issues and ushering in a truly new era of communications.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one of our country's most important observances is National Bible Week sponsored by the National Bible Association. This year, as in the past, it will be observed by houses of worship and individuals of all faiths during the week in which Thanksgiving Day falls. That will be from Sunday, November 22 through Sunday, November 29. 
It is my great and underserved honor to be this year's congressional co-chair of that observance. In that capacity, I would like to recommend to all my colleagues, and to the American people, that, in this season of strife and division we look to National Bible Week as an opportunity to join together in prayerful reflection. 
The German poet Heinrich Heine called the Bible `that great medicine chest of humanity,' the greatest cure for the worst ills of mankind. And he observed how--during the great fire that destroyed the Second Temple of ancient Israel--the Jewish people rushed to save, not the gold and silver vessels of sacrifice, not the bejeweled breastplate of the High Priest, but their Scriptures. For the Word of God was the greatest treasure they had. 
It remains our greatest treasure today. The lessons it teaches, and the morality it commands, are the foundation on which a free people build self-government. In that sense, the Bible is the charter of our liberties. Daniel Webster put it this way: `If we abide by the principles taught by the Bible, our country will go on prospering.' 
That has never been a partisan sentiment, and neither should it be so today. Two great political rivals of the early twentieth century, both of whom achieved the Presidency and attained world leadership, agreed on this one point. 
Teddy Roosevelt said, `A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education.' And Woodrow Wilson, a university president at Princeton before reaching the White House, counselled, `When you have read the Bible, you will know it is the word of God, because you will have found in it the key to your own heart, your own happiness and your own duty.' 
Here in the Senate, as in the House of Representatives, there are several small Bible study groups. Members of all faiths regularly come together, away from the public spotlight, to learn from one another and seek inspiration from sacred Scripture. 
For my part, I find in those sessions both enlightenment and challenge. For any time we read the Bible with an open heart, we may find ourselves falling short, in some way, of the standard it sets for us and the promise it offers us. 
In that way, reading the Bible can be like a spiritual work-out. And if, in the process, we feel the spiritual equivalent of a few sore muscles, we can remember the saying, `No pain, no gain.' And the gain that Scripture offers lasts a lifetime--and even longer. 
For that reason, it is especially appropriate that Thanksgiving Day comes during National Bible Week, for the Bible itself is something for which we should give thanks, on that day and every day.

I know there is a possibility of that being available, and also nominations still continue to be a possibility, although all of that depends on how the negotiations go. We can't be tied up trying to work through nominations and conference reports while also being involved in negotiations on the omnibus bill. Senators will be advised of the voting situation as long as possible, hopefully 24 hours in advance of any recorded vote.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just say briefly, Mr. President, on the education issue, it is very difficult to deal with these negotiations fairly and honestly and productively when you have the President and the Democratic leadership coming out and bashing negotiators on issues like education. It also makes it difficult, when you have that happen, to be able to work with people with whom you disagree philosophically, although you try to work in good faith, but also it begins to diminish respect and trust. 
That is one of the biggest problems we have right now. It is so difficult to maintain a sufficient level of trust to be able to get your work done. I think most people who know me--Senators on both sides of the aisle--know that is very important to me. I strive to be trustworthy myself and to keep my word, and I find it very hard to work with people who I don't have that same feeling about. 
When it comes to education, I will stand aside to nobody, especially a bunch of people who went to private schools and then holler and scream about what ought to happen in public schools. I went to public schools from the first grade right through college. I went to Duck Hill Elementary and Grenada Elementary and Pascagoula Junior High School. My wife went to public schools. My children went to public schools. 
I believe and care about education and public schools. I worked for the University of Mississippi. My mother was a former schoolteacher. She taught school for 19 years. 
For the President to get up down there and demagog this issue about how he is not getting his principles in education is very hard for me to accept, Mr. President. What he wants is a Federal education program. He wants it dictated from Washington. He wants it run by Washington bureaucrats, and he wants it his way. 
I don't have faith in Washington bureaucrats. When the money comes to Washington and it trickles down through the Atlanta bureaucracy and trickles down to the Jackson bureaucracy, by the time it gets to the teachers and the kids, half of it is gone. 
And they are told, you must spend it this way or that way, when it may not be the way it is needed. 
I have faith in local school administrators, local teachers, parents, and, yes, the children, to make the decisions about what is needed for reading, what is needed in remedial math, what is needed to fight the drug problem. And so that is the basic difference for the American people. I ask you, who do you trust on education? The local officials, the local school officials, the parents, or Washington bureaucrats? That is the choice. 
President Clinton and his bureaucrats, the liberals in Washington, they want to run education and manipulate education from Washington, DC. The Republicans say we should return the money to the local level. If the schools want to use it for reading, fine. If they want to use it for extra teachers, great. If they want to use it for more school construction, that is their choice. If they want to use it for a drug-free school program, great; do that. 
That is the difference. Who do you trust? Local officials or national officials? Who do you trust on education? The son of a schoolteacher and people who went to public education, or pampered people who went to private schools and then stand on their mounts and look down their noses and tell us what ought to happen in public education? 
I have about had it on this issue, and I am sending a warning to the President of the United States: I am not going to tolerate a whole lot more demagoguery on this subject.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 12:30 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate can be expected to consider any legislative or Executive Calendar items cleared for action, although I don't expect any items to be cleared today. Votes are not anticipated during Saturday's session of the Senate, and it is expected that the Senate will not be in on Sunday, but we will be in Monday afternoon at a time we will discuss with the Democratic leadership. 
During Friday's session, the Senate passed a continuing resolution allowing Government to operate until midnight Monday. So it will be anticipated that by Monday afternoon, we will have agreement on an omnibus appropriations bill or we need to consider another short-term continuing resolution. 
Negotiations are ongoing at this time with regard to a number of issues, including the tax extender issue, a number of authorizations and appropriations issues, all of which could end up in the omnibus appropriations bill. Of course, there is a possibility on Monday, or at some point, some of the bills that are being discussed in connection with the omnibus appropriations bill might move separately. One example is the Treasury-Postal Service conference report. If we can get an agreement in the omnibus bill on some of the issues involved in that bill, that became controversial, if we get that worked out, we can move the bill freestanding, but all of that is in the process of being discussed right now. 
We will update our colleagues as progress is being made. I think that progress is occurring. A lot of negotiations are going on this morning and will continue throughout the afternoon. We have had meetings between the congressional leadership and the White House this morning. We expect to meet again at 5 o'clock this afternoon to get an assessment of where we are. We are getting Senators and House Members, Democrats and Republicans, involved in all those negotiations.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a civil action set for trial in the U.S. District Court for District of Idaho. This case arises out of a dispute between the plaintiff, a private corporation, and the Department of Education concerning the status of certain student loan guaranty reserve funds. Counsel for the plaintiff wishes to question a former member of Senator Craig's staff about her recollection of meetings with representatives from the Department of Education during a time period in which she served as a legislative aid to the Senator. 
This resolution would authorize testimony by the former staff member, and any other former or current employees of the Senate, except where a privilege should be asserted, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel. The resolution would also authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Craig and his employees in connection with this matter in order to protect the Senator's privileges.

But we worked on these things in a cooperative way, and he is entitled to take leader time. And we have assured each other that nobody is going to try to take advantage of this time.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will say at the beginning that I agree with Senator Daschle that this is something we should address and I believe we will address because there are some legitimate concerns and problems in this area that need to be dealt with. I am very hopeful we can do that next year. 
I want to thank Senator Nickles and our task force that worked on this issue. I want to thank Dr. Bill Frist, a Member of the Senate, who worked on this issue. I think it is great that we actually have a doctor involved that understands what happens in this area. 
I have told people, you can take your choice here of which bill is really the best bill--the one proposed by the Democratic side, led by Senator Kennedy, or the one proposed over on the Republican side led by Dr. Bill Frist. I think the choice is pretty clear. But thank you for your work. I do believe that we are going to address this next year. I believe we will do it in, hopefully, a responsible way and, eventually, it can be a bipartisan bill. 
This effort today was clearly a planned PR effort because we were able to accidentally come across some e-mail that indicated that this was in preparation for a big hoopla down at the White House. 
We have tried to get this issue up in a fair way--on June 18, three different times; on July 15, twice; on June 25, and on other occasions, I had offered a very fair process to bring this up. The Democratic proposal, sponsored by Senators Daschle, Kennedy, and others, would have been offered. Our alternative proposal, the Republican proposal, would have been offered. We could have debated them both, with three amendments on both sides. It could be small amendments or big amendments--that is up to either side--and we could have had the votes and been done with it, and sent it to conference with the House. We could have completed this in June or July. 
But, no, the Democrats objected. They didn't want to have the two bills head to head and amendments in order because they knew what the result would be. We had a good proposal; it was going to pass. By the way, we might actually have gotten something done. 
They don't want this issue to pass. They want a political issue. We could have done this in June or July, but they objected, saying, no, we must have 20 amendments on each side. Twenty amendments; forty amendments total--days. The whole plan was to try to find a way to have the Members have to cast repeated votes on an issue that would obfuscate the difference between the two bills in reality. 
So we have made an effort. We are ready to go. We would have been happy to do it in June or July. We are going to be looking for a way to do it next year. When the time comes, it won't be the Kennedy-Daschle bill. The American people don't want or need that. What we need is a fair bill. We need access. What we don't need is something that will lead to more costs and more lawsuits--hallelujah. 
Is this about the patients and the doctors and health care, or is this so my brother-in-law can file another lawsuit? I have the answer. The answer is that we ought to be worrying about the patients and the health care providers in America. We have a good bill. I am proud to have supported it and to have been willing to bring it up in a fair way. We will do it, I hope, early next year. 
I would be glad to yield to the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, who has done great work on this.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I know there is a lot of interest in trying to determine what the schedule will be for the balance of the day and perhaps even the weekend. 
It is obvious because of the feelings of the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, with regard to the Treasury and Postal Service appropriations conference report, that he does not intend to allow the Senate to have a vote on the conference report itself anytime soon. 
Therefore, as we approach the end of this session, we will probably have a vote, if we can get some accommodation here--I think we may--within a couple of hours, on or in relation to the bankruptcy bill. So we should expect another recorded vote in about 2 hours. We will need, hopefully, to get that locked in here in the next few minutes. The main point is we will have one more vote. 
Then, other than unanimous consent requests or voice votes, the only votes we would expect for the balance of this year would be on a continuing resolution, if necessary, and the omnibus appropriations bill. 
Now, I will need to confer further with Senator Daschle. We will certainly keep Members informed as to what the schedule may be. Negotiations are continuing with regard to all of the different issues that are pending on the omnibus appropriations bill. We expect to work this weekend. We hope we will have this completed to possibly vote on Monday. If that is not possible, we will let Members know as soon as some determination is made. For now, we will expect a vote in a couple of hours, and then we would go to the vote on the bankruptcy bill. That would be it as far as recorded votes for tonight.

They indicated that they understood it was just a physical problem in terms of getting final agreements and getting paperwork ready, and a short-term CR would be no problem from their viewpoint. I discussed that with you. We anticipate a CR that would take us until Monday at midnight. So there would be no question that we are still working, and there is no threat of a Government shutdown, while we continue to count on our appropriators to do their work, and we hope to get it completed this weekend.

Mr. LOTT. I have been working diligently to get some of the more controversial judges done. We did have a couple votes. I was trying to get Paez done today. The time is going to be consumed by reading the Treasury/Postal Service conference report and now the appearance of having to read the Bankruptcy Reform conference report. So that has been pushed aside. I tried to move three nominations last night. It was objected to. We are in the usual last days of the session where everybody is holding this one on the basis of that one. I think where we are is, over the next few days as we make progress, if we can get agreements on some things, then we will probably get agreements on all things. They are all interrelated. We will have to see how that plays out.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while our colleagues express their appreciation to our good friend from Indiana, I would like to just say a few words about him and spread those on the Record of the U.S. Senate. 
We are all losing some good friends in the Senate Chamber this year on both sides of the aisle, and we will have a chance over the next few hours to talk about each one of them. I want to say a few special words about my good friend, Dan Coats. 
Senator Dan Coats succeeded Senator Dan Quayle in the Senate. He was a Member of the House, and he worked as a staff member before that. I have actually known this distinguished Senator from Indiana going back about 20 years now, as a staff member, which I was, as a Congressman, and as a Senator. I have to say that I truly believe that no man or woman who serves in the Senate today has had a greater influence on my own life and on my own career than Dan Coats from Indiana. He was always there for me when I sought advice in the House. And every time I have sought elective office in the Senate, he was one of the nominators. I referred to him as my `rabbit's foot' because he always said just the right things. Whenever the going is the toughest, I know I can go to Dan and seek good advice, and it will come from him. He is a man that has his priorities in order--honesty, integrity, family, and also those special things a lot of people don't know about, such as his involvement in the Big Brothers Program. One of the things he enjoyed the most, which he didn't mention today, is that he served in the House for quite some time as the ranking member on the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. 
He enjoyed that assignment. I always wanted to eliminate all of the select committees. But for Dan and that committee, they did a great service for the families and the children of this country. 
Dan is the kind of guy also who will run late to a meeting with the archbishop and will stop and visit with a homeless man on the street to try to talk to him about his needs, and try to help him, try to get him to go to a shelter. He is really a good human being. 
He has been a valuable asset to the Senate when it came to our services, when it came to working with any of us who have problems here in the Senate. 
So I am going to dearly miss him as a personal friend, as a great Senator, a great family man. He and Marcia are great people. In fact, I was sitting on my patio a couple of weeks ago on Saturday, and I got to thinking about Dan Coats. I got melancholy, and I got tears in my eyes. I called him on a Saturday afternoon and said, `You can't leave. I can't go forward in the Senate without you.' I found out that he and Marcia had been playing tennis on a nice clay tennis court instead of being out campaigning in the backwoods somewhere. And, somehow or other, it seemed okay. 
He is leaving the Senate, but he is not leaving us. I have a feeling that he is going to have a real influence in many ways for the rest of his life, and he is going to stay close to all of us. 
So on a very personal basis on behalf of the Senate, I wish you God's grace in everything you do, Dan Coats. 
I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the White House recently announced that it would allow some relaxation of its encryption export controls to allow the sale of strong encryption products to companies in the finance, insurance, and health sectors and to certain companies engaged in electronic commerce. While the specific details have yet to be articulated in revised regulations, it appears that the Administration is finally heeding Congress' calls to modernize its export control regulations. While this action is a step in the right direction, I believe the Administration is still moving too slowly and incrementally. Even with these proposed changes, there are still a number of other businesses and consumers who will not be able to utilize strong American-made encryption products. Since export restrictions will remain in place, foreign suppliers will continue to develop and sell strong encryption products in the international marketplace without real competition from U.S. providers. Putting $60 billion and over 200,000 American jobs in jeopardy over the next few years. 
Unfortunately, the Administration continues to pursue an outmoded policy that supports the broad use of 56-bit encryption for the vast majority of computer users. As my colleagues are aware, the government-approved 56-bit Data Encryption Standard was recently cracked last July in just 56 hours. This is particularly alarming because it was accomplished using a single computer instead of the thousands that were linked together just a few months ago to achieve the same result in 39 days. 
Fortunately, this code-breaking effort was undertaken by contest participants as part of an international challenge instead of by hackers or thieves preying on a vulnerable, unsuspecting target. It is truly scary to see how easy it is for someone's medical, financial, or personal records to be accessed and read by unauthorized persons. Ironically, the decoded message read, `It's time for those 128-, 192-, and 256-bit keys.' 
This feat proves what many in Congress have been stating for some time, that 56-bit encryption can no longer protect individual or corporate computer files from unauthorized access. Yet, 56- bit encryption continues to be recognized as the government standard and U.S. companies can only sell advanced encryption software and hardware to a finite community abroad. Let us be clear; the Administration's export regime affects American citizens everywhere. Whether you communicate via the Internet, or work in the technology business, you are likely to be adversely affected by the Administration's current encryption policy. A policy that does not allow the sale of strong encryption to energy suppliers, telecommunication providers, the transportation industry, human rights organizations and the vast majority of legitimate and responsible business entities and consumers throughout the globe. Ultimately, this approach promotes the use and development of weak encryption. While I welcome the White House's recent announcement to relax some export controls, the Administration's proposal simply does not go far enough. 
Mr. President, it is encouraging that the Minority Leader has actively engaged himself on the encryption issue. In a floor speech last July, Senator Daschle agreed that America's encryption policy needs to strike a balance between privacy protections and national security and law enforcement interests. The Minority Leader recognizes that the development and use of strong encryption products promote international commerce and Internet use as well as ensure privacy and aid national security. Senator Daschle is also equally alarmed that, `maintaining existing encryption policies will cost the U.S. economy as much as $96 billion over the next 5 years . . .' I agree with Senator Daschle's comments that the Administration needs to articulate and advance an encryption agreement that is `good for consumers, good for business, and good for law enforcement and national security.' Similarly, we agree that it is time to move beyond endless discussion and debate and on to a balanced and complete solution. 
Mr. President, with every passing month, consumers across the globe turn to foreign suppliers for their advanced encryption needs. If a solution that reverses this trend is not found soon, then America's computer industry will fall so far behind its foreign competitors that U.S. suppliers will lose forever their technology market share to European, Asian, and other foreign manufacturers. Congress and the Administration cannot allow this happen. 
As Senator Daschle pointed out, the computer industry and privacy groups are serious about reaching a compromise on encryption. In May, for example, Americans for Computer Privacy (ACP), a technology policy group, submitted a seven-point proposal to the Administration which would provide U.S. manufactures the ability to sell the kind of encryption technology that is already widely available abroad. In July, an industry consortium announced the `Private Doorbells' proposal to assist law enforcement. This proposal was a reasonable attempt to find an alternative to the White House`s call for a national key escrow framework. Fortunately, the Administration finally appears to recognize that a third party key recovery system is technically unworkable and unnecessary. 
I believe Congress is still interested in modernizing the Nation's encryption policy based on current realities. As Senator Daschle observed, several cryptography bills have been offered during this session. Clearly though, they are not all created equal. Some of these legislative proposals would turn back the clock by putting controls on domestic encryption where no such controls currently exist. Others would completely sacrifice constitutional protections by allowing law enforcement to read personal computer files without a court order and without the target ever knowing their files had been accessed. There are also proposals that would require an expensive, technically unworkable key escrow system. Finally, some members advocate linking encryption with other technology issues which could in the end result in no legislation being passed at all. 
The encryption debate cannot be resolved by settling on a specific bit-length, giving particular industry sectors export relief while denying others the same, or by sanctioning one technical solution over another. Moreover, this debate will not be resolved by building secret backdoors, frontdoors or any doorways into encryption software. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working further with Senator Daschle, my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, the Administration, and the computer industry to help close the gaps that still exist. As the Minority Leader recognizes, this is not about politics or partisanship. This is an urgent matter that requires us all to work together to forge an appropriate solution. One that balances the needs of industry, consumers, and the law enforcement and intelligence communities. In the end, we must have a consensus solution that brings America encryption policy into the 21st Century.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning there will be 15 minutes remaining for debate on the religious freedom bill. At 9:45, under a previous order, the Senate will proceed to vote on the passage of the religious freedom bill. I commend Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Nickles and Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked on this. I am sure Senator Lieberman was involved, and others. I think this is a really fine accomplishment in the waning hours of this session of Congress. 
Following that vote, the Senate may consider any available appropriations conference reports--we have at least one that I believe could be taken up, that is the Treasury-Postal Service bill--and any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. It is anticipated that we will move at some point today to the nomination of Mr. Paez from California, to be a judge for the Ninth Circuit. There is opposition, significant opposition to that nomination, so there will have to be some debate and I am sure a vote. 
The Senate will also consider a continuing resolution or an omnibus appropriations bill, should they become available or when they become available. Members should expect, then, rollcall votes throughout today's session and into the evening. I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
I might just note, last night a lot of good work was done in the wrapup, including approval of the intelligence authorization conference report and the water resources bill. This is a very significant bill that is important to every State in the Nation. It had been tied up with various and sundry problems, but with a lot of hard work and a lot of cooperation, that bill was cleared. We hope, now, the House will take expeditious action and we can complete action on the water resources bill before we go out for the year. Also, we did the human resources reauthorization and the vocational education bill. When you couple higher education and vocational education, plus the Coverdell A+ bill that Congress passed, there has been a significant achievement this year in education. Even though the President vetoed the ability for people to save for their children's education, higher education and vocational education are two areas where we have completed our action and will be signed into law. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday evening the senior Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, reached 100 presiding hours in the 105th Congress for his 100 hours of service presiding over the Senate. He will be awarded the Golden Gavel. But there is an interesting point here. This is the fifth Golden Gavel that Senator Gorton has obtained in his years in the Senate--representing 500 hours presiding in the Senate Chamber. 
I think most Senators will acknowledge that he does an excellent job when he is the Presiding Officer. He is one we call on quite often on Friday afternoons or late at night. He is always willing to do it. And he dedicates each one of these Golden Gavels to one of his grandchildren. He has seven. This is the fifth one; so he has two more to go. 
This is an assignment that takes time and patience. I publicly thank Senator Gorton for achieving this and for the way that he is doing it for his grandchildren. 
I ask my colleagues to join in expressing our appreciation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the Senate's overwhelming passage today of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. This bill represents several months of thoughtful consideration and discussion among Members on both sides of the aisle to address the tax treatment of this emerging medium of commerce. 
Throughout history, innovations in technology have dramatically changed lifestyles. Today, it is the Internet changing lives, and unlike any other technology to date. It is connecting people all around the world in ways that no one at the Department of Defense ever conceived of when the network was created. It is a true testament to the fact that leadership and entrepreneurial drive is alive and well in America. 
This new tool of communication and information is also fast becoming one of the most important and vibrant marketplaces in decades. It holds great promise for businesses, both large and small, to offer their products and services for sale to a worldwide market. This is good news for everyone. It means new jobs, new opportunities and choices for consumers and retailers, and ultimately more revenue for state and local governments. 
Mr. President, by its very nature, the Internet does not respect the traditional boundaries of state borders or county lines used to define our tax policies today. With about 30,000 taxing jurisdictions all across America, a myriad of overlapping and burdensome taxes is a legitimate concern for consumers and businesses online. This issue needs to be explored and resolved. 
The Internet Tax Freedom Act is about the potential of technology. 
It is about taking a necessary and temporary time-out so that a Commission of government and industry representatives can thoroughly study electronic commerce and make sensible recommendations to Congress about a fair, uniform and consistent Internet tax structure. The moratorium will apply to discriminatory and multiple taxes as well as to taxes paid just to access the Internet. 
This legislation will treat Internet sales the same as any other type of remote sale. It will not favor the Internet or disadvantage others. 
Businesses and consumers using electronic commerce need and deserve some level of assurance and sense of uniformity about how they will be taxed. 
Mr. President, over the past several months, I personally heard from governors and groups across the nation who expressed serious concerns about the hindering effect on electronic commerce due to ambiguous and conflicting tax treatment. I also heard from others expressing concerns about raising revenue and providing services to their citizens. Both voiced support for passage of a balanced bill that would represent their views. Adequate time was allowed for the Senate to hear what they had to say, and their concerns are reflected in the amendments and in the final bill. 
Internet taxes, like many other issues faced in Congress, is not without controversy. The spirited exchange on the Senate floor during the past several days is evidence of that. I respect the differences that have been debated. I recognize the delicate balance in many of the views expressed, and appreciate the good faith efforts of my colleagues in working together to reach consensus. I know it was not easy. 
Passage of this legislation was made possible by the hard work of many people. 
First, I commend Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate's Commerce Committee, for his diligent leadership and commitment to tackle this complex and contentious issue. He has been steadfast throughout this process, and to him I say thank you. 
I also owe a debt of gratitude for the work and contributions of the Chairman of the Senate's Finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth. He provided a fresh perspective on the issue of electronic commerce. 
Clearly, the participation of several Members with diverse interests was integral in moving this bill forward. I am proud to see Senators from both sides of the aisle--Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Judd Gregg, Senator Tim Hutchinson, Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator Ron Wyden--all work together in a respectful manner to get the job done. 
Nothing is ever accomplished in the Senate without the dedicated efforts of staff. I want to take a moment to identify those who worked hard to prepare this legislation for consideration. From the Senate Commerce Committee: Mark Buse, Jim Drewry, Carol Grunberg, Paula Ford, Kevin Joseph, John Raidt, Mike Rawson, and Jessica Yoo. From the Finance Committee: Stan Fendley, Keith Hennessey, Jeffrey Kupfer, Brigitta Pari, Frank Polk, and Mark Prater. Other individuals participated on behalf of their Senators: Renee Bennett, Laureen Daly, Richard Glick, Hazen Marshall, Greg Rhode, Mitch Rose, Stan Sokul and Russell Sullivan. I thank them all for their efforts. 
Mr. President, the current power of the Internet and its future potential will advance America into the next millennium. Passage of the Internet Tax Freedom Act is a crucial step in recognizing the significance of the Internet in electronic commerce and what it will mean in the lives of every American consumer, to American businesses, and to America's economy.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, under a previous order, the Senate will begin 1 hour of final debate on the conference report to accompany the VA-HUD appropriations bill. At the expiration of debate time, at approximately 11 a.m., the Senate will vote on adoption of that conference report. Following that vote, the Senate may resume consideration of the Internet tax bill. I believe we are about ready to complete action on that. We have been saying that for a week, but I think that the opposition really is minimal. When we finally get to a vote, it is going to be overwhelming. I hope those obstructing and delaying the bill will give it up and let us get to the final passage of this important legislation before we leave. I understand there is one outstanding issue remaining on that legislation. Hopefully, it can be resolved by the managers early this afternoon. 
In addition to the Internet bill, the Senate may consider the intelligence reauthorization bill, the human services reauthorization bill, under a 30-minute time agreement, and, possibly, the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. The Senate may also begin consideration of the William Fletcher nomination under the previously agreed to 90-minute time agreement. 
At 5 p.m., under a previous order, the Senate is scheduled to resume consideration of H.R. 10, the financial services reform bill, unless another agreement is reached. I hope we can also come to some compromise agreement on that legislation so we can get it completed. It is very important domestically and, as a matter of fact, for our ability to compete in international markets. Members should expect rollcall votes throughout the day and into the evening. 
There are a number of meetings going on to resolve issues between the House and the Senate and the administration. I think a lot of good progress has been made in the last 24 hours. I felt like the dam sort of broke yesterday. We have the bankruptcy reform legislation conference report being finished now. The vocational education conference report was completed last night. That was the first time we had a vocational reauthorization in years, and certainly we need to focus on vocational education. 
That, coupled with the higher education bill that was signed into law 2 days ago, will begin to show that we are committed to working continuously to improve education for our children and for the families of this country in the future. 
We are in a position where we are about in final agreement on the WIPO bill, the intellectual property issue, and music licensing. 
A number of bills are coming to a conclusion. As soon as conference reports are available, particularly appropriations bills, they will be stuck right into the schedule, and hopefully a quick vote. We will then move with other conference reports. We hope to be able to move some Executive Calendar nominations. But that also will take a lot of cooperation. 
I thank the Senators for their assistance at this critical hour. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. So that everybody will relax, I understand when I make some remarks and schedule announcements we will go back in a quorum. Nobody is disadvantaged. Nothing is going to change. 
I have requested this time for two purposes. 
No. 1, to say that we do have a lot of work we need to do. One of the things I am considering doing here momentarily is going to a nomination so we will have time to work through and agree on a unanimous consent request. 
But the other thing is, I think right now we are seeing the worst of the Senate, the worst of the Senate on all sides. We have work to do. We have about 48 hours left. We have several bills that people want to get done, vocational education, religious persecution--a number of other bills that have been worked on all over this Capitol. Many of them will be overwhelmingly or unanimously supported. And here we are, now, locked in a procedure where neither side will agree to anything. I just don't think it is in the best tradition of the Senate. I realize the Senate always works at the pleasure of any one Senator, but I think we also work because we always seek consensus. 
I am for H.R. 10. I have been for that legislation from the beginning. I have given a lot of time to try to move it forward. I know there are people who have objections to it. As a matter of fact, some of the objections that they have, I agree with. It is not a perfect bill. But I think that we need to try to find a way to work through this, where we can continue to do business. I will do everything I can to make sure that neither side is disadvantaged. I have two of my very closest friends and colleagues that have major problems with this bill, but I am also very committed to dealing fairly with those who are for the bill. I want to try to continue to work to find a way to get it done. So I don't think it really serves either side to just shut us down here at 6:15, 2 days before we go out, and not allow us to get anything else done tonight. 
So, I am going to appeal to both sides to work with me, to try to find a way to get this business done that we can do, some nominations that are not controversial on either side, and the religious persecution bill, and vocational education--and without disadvantages to anybody. So I ask Senators on both sides to do that. I appeal to them. And I will help try to make this happen. 
But I want to go on the record saying that I think this spectacle that we are seeing right now is very unbecoming of the Senate, and rather than just steam about it, I thought I would say it publicly. I feel better now, Mr. President. 
Momentarily I will move to a nomination or I will ask for a unanimous consent agreement that will allow us to complete action on the religious persecution bill. But I must say to both sides, I will not let either side gridlock the Senate. I will not do it. I will use every tool at my disposal and I will also do everything publicly I can to make sure people understand who is not being cooperative in this effort. 
I observe the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. We do, because as I have assessed the situation, there are enough opportunities for cloture votes and delays that it would take us into next week. If you just look at the math, that is where it would go. You can go back and examine how we got in this position, and the answer is very simple: We have been trying to do other bills. 
The only way we are going to get H.R. 10 now is by concession and by consensus, which is quite often the way the Senate works. We are going to have to see if we can find a way for Democrats who have worked on this bill and Republicans who have worked on it, some who have problems with it on both sides, can come together. There is also a concern from Secretary Rubin about a provision in the bill. But I would like to get it done. But we are not going to get it done by cloture motions. Therefore, I have no problem with going over another day and continuing to work and hope that we can find a way to come to an agreement on this bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Pascagoulian and personal friend, Mr. Douglass Fontaine. Doug has devoted his life to an industry for which Mississippians are proud to be recognized--hospitality. 
A third generation hotelier, Doug grew up surrounded by the hotel industry. Both Doug's parents and grandparents managed the historic Allison's Wells Spa in Way, Mississippi. He too took his turn at managing Allison's Wells after returning from Germany, where he managed an R & R hotel. He then eventually relocated to Pascagoula, and for more than 35 years has owned La Font Inn. Doug has not only brought a friendly and welcoming smile to patrons, but a legacy for hotels around the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean. 
While being the only Mississippian to serve as President and Chairman of the Board of the American Hotel and Motel Association, Doug implemented his world renowed program `Quest for Quality.' This has not been Doug's only contribution to society. He has held many positions of leadership, including residing over such community service organizations as the Jackson County Heart Fund, Rotary Club, United Way of Jackson County, and many others. 
Doug has dedicated himself to economically develop his Gulf Coast community by working to establish the Mobile-Pascagoula Airport, Naval Station Pascagoula, the Sunplex Industrial Center, and again many others. He also chaired the committee to `Save the Homeport' from base closures for many years. Currently, Doug is serving on the Board of Directors of the Hancock Band, a position he has held for more than 27 years, and serves as a lifetime Director of the American Hotel and Motel Association. 
On October 23, 1998, the Mississippi Hotel and Motel Association will establish a Hotel and Restaurant Scholarship in his name. This great honor could not be bestowed upon a finer person. An opportunity for future members of the industry, this serves as a deserving tribute to Doug, his wife Lou, and their children and grandchildren. I am proud to congratulate this great Mississippian.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are working on a unanimous consent agreement now that we hope we can get approved, which would allow us to get to a conclusion and a final vote on the Internet tax freedom bill. I commend all who have been involved, including Senators McCain, Dorgan and Wyden. I believe we can actually get to a conclusion. There has been the possibility that it would be tangled up in other matters, but I think maybe we have an agreement that will allow us to complete that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a pro se civil case brought against the CIA and other defendants by a state prisoner. Last month, the plaintiff served a subpoena for documents upon Senator John F. Kerry, apparently because of the Senator's former role as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations of the Foreign Relations Committee. After Senator Kerry objected to the subpoena and advised the plaintiff that the documents he sought were privileged by the Speech or Debate Clause, the plaintiff filed a motion asking the court to compel Senator Kerry to produce the documents. Accordingly, this resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Kerry in connection with this subpoena and to respond to the motion to compel.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 14, 1998, by the District of Columbia and a group of approximately fifty residents of the District. The action seeks a declaratory judgment that residents of the District of Columbia have a constitutional right to vote in elections for Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and also asks the court to ensure that Congress fashion a remedy for this alleged deprivation of voting rights. The lead defendants are the Secretary of Commerce and the United States, who are being represented by the Department of Justice. 
The complaint also names as defendants the Secretary of the Senate, Gary Sisco, and the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, Greg Casey, as well as the Clerk and the Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives, because of their roles in paying and certifying the election of Members and in controlling access to the two Chambers. 
This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Secretary of the Senate and the Senate Sergeant at Arms in this matter to seek dismissal of the case against them. The Legal Counsel will argue that the Senate officers are not proper defendants in this matter.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is about to act on H.R. 4655, the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. I introduced companion legislation, S. 2525, last week with 7 co-sponsors. Last Friday, the House International Relations Committee marked up the legislation and made only minor, technical changes. On October 5, the House passed H.R. 4655 by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 360 to 38. That vote, and our vote in several moments, is a strong demonstration of Congressional support for a new policy toward Iraq--a policy that overtly seeks the replacement of Saddam Hussein's regime through military and political support for the Iraq opposition. 
The United States has many means at its disposal to support the liberation of Iraq. At the height of the Cold War, we support freedom fighters in Asia, Africa and Latin America willing to fight and die for a democratic future. We can and should do the same now in Iraq. 
The Clinton Administration regularly calls for bipartisanship in foreign policy. I support them when I can. Today, we see a clear example of a policy that has the broadest possible bipartisan support. I know the Administration understands the depth of our feeling on this issue. I think they are beginning to understand the strategic argument in favor of moving beyond containment to a policy of `rollback.' Containment is not sustainable. Pressure to lift sanctions on Iraq is increasing--despite Iraq's seven years of refusal to comply with the terms of the Gulf War cease-fire. Our interests in the Middle East cannot be protected with Saddam Hussien in power. Our legislation provides a roadmap to achieve our objective. 
This year, Congress has already provided $5 million to support the Iraqi political opposition. We provided $5 million to establish Radio Free Iraq. We will provide additional resources for political support in the FY 1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, including $3 million for the Iraqi National Congress. 
Enactment of this bill will go farther. It requires the President to designate at least one Iraqi opposition group to receive U.S. military assistance. It defines eligibility criteria such a group or groups must meet. Many of us have ideas on how the designation process should work. I have repeatedly stated that the Iraqi National Congress has been effective in the past and can be effective in the future. They represent the broadest possible base of the opposition. There are other groups that are currently active inside Iraq: the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The State Department seems to believe there are more than 70 opposition groups, many of which do not meet the criteria in H.R. 4655. Many barely even exist or have no political base. They should not be considered for support. We should also be very careful about considering designation of groups which do not share our values or which are simply creations of external forces or exile politics, such as the Iraqi Communist Party or the Iraqi National Accord. 
I appreciate the work we have been able to do with the Administration on this legislation. But we should be very clear about the designation process. We intend to exercise our oversight responsibility and authority as provided in section 4(d) and section 5(d). I do not think the Members of Congress, notified pursuant to law, will agree to any designation that we believe does not meet the criteria in section 5 of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. 
This is an important step. Observers should not misunderstand the Senate's action. Even though this legislation will pass without controversy on an unanimous voice vote, it is a major step forward in the final conclusion of the Persian Gulf war. In 1991, we and our allies shed blood to liberate Kuwait. Today, we are empowering Iraqis to liberate their own country.

This is a very important bill that work has been done on for a period of months, and it also is connected to the music licensing issue which has been worked out. It has been extremely tedious, working with all the interested parties, but they have been responsible, they have agreed, and I want to commend and thank all of those who worked with us and helped us reach agreement with music licensing, including the Restaurant Association, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the writers who have been involved in this music issue, including BMI and ASCAP and others. They have all given more than they wanted to, but I think we have come to a reasonable agreement. And then also, it is connected to the treaty with regard to intellectual property. 
So I will withhold at this time, but I hope Senators will not begin putting a hold on this very important legislation because of unrelated issues that we probably are going to get resolved in the next 2 days anyway.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my colleagues, Senators Landrieu and Murkowski, in introducing the Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act. 
Mr. President, since the inception of the oil and gas program on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), states and coastal communities have sought a greater share of the benefits from development. And why shouldn't they? These communities provide the infrastructure, public services, manpower and support industries necessary to sustain this development. 
Currently, the majority of OCS revenues are funneled into the Federal Treasury where they are used to pay for various federal programs and to reduce the deficit. While funding programs and reducing the deficit are certainly important, I believe that some percentage of the revenues should be reinvested in that which makes them possible. 
Our bill does that. The Reinvestment and Environmental Restoration Act diverts one-half of the OCS revenues from the Federal Treasury to coastal states and communities for a multitude of programs: air and water quality monitoring, wetlands protection, coastal restoration and shoreline protection, land acquisition, infrastructure, public service needs, state park and recreation programs and wildlife conservation. 
This bill allows states and communities to use these funds in whatever manner they deem appropriate. In Pascagoula, for example, authorities might choose to restore and secure the shoreline where years of sea traffic have taken their toll. Further north in Vancleave, they may choose instead to refurbish the roads and bridges that carry the heavy machinery coming and going from the coast. This bill provides a framework within which these localities can make the right decisions for their citizens and environment. 
Mr. President, I have been working on this issue for many, many years. As a coast dweller myself, I know the impact that the oil and gas industry can have on communities and the importance of reinvestment in these areas. This is not to say that the industry mistreats the states; on the contrary, they work very hard to comply with stringent environmental regulations and to take care of the community as best they can. The OCS Policy Committee said in 1993 that, despite the oil industry's best efforts, `OCS development still can affect community infrastructure, social services and the environment in ways that cause concerns among residents of the coastal states and communities.' 
I know that there is no way to totally eliminate this impact on coastal communities. I also know that, while the benefits of a healthy OCS program are felt nationally, the infrastructure, environmental and social costs are felt locally. Our bill would put money back into the communities that need it most. 
It would also put money back into the environmental resources of the area. Exploration for non-renewable resources and stewardship of coastal resources are not mutually exclusive, but must be carefully balanced for both to be sustained. It is important that our wetlands, fisheries and water resources are taken into consideration and afforded adequate protection. 
In addition to propping up the states and coastal communities, our bill also provides funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Over 30 years ago, Congress set up this fund to address the American public's desire for more parks and recreational facilities. This bill makes the program self-sufficient, providing secure funding from the OCS revenues. This is an investment in our future--our land, our resources and our recreational enjoyment. 
Mr. President, our bill makes yet another investment with these OCS revenues--an investment in fish and wildlife programs. With the inclusion of OCS revenues, the amount of money available for state programs would nearly double. This is money that can be used to increase populations and improve habitat for fish and wildlife. It could even be used for wildlife education programs. 
Mr. President, this bill was carefully crafted to strike a balance between the needs and interests of the oil and gas industry, the states, and the environmental and conservation groups. It's a good package that will benefit all Americans, not just those who live and work in coastal areas. It will benefit hunters and anglers. It will benefit bird watchers and campers. It will benefit all Americans who take solace in the fact that the oil industry is taking care of the communities that support it. 
I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues and look forward to advancing this important legislation in the 106th Congress.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action commenced in United States District Court for the District of Hawaii in July 1998. The action sought to appeal a 1993 court order in another case. The complaint named Senator Inouye as one of two defendants, apparently because of the plaintiff's dissatisfaction with Senator Inouye's casework assistance regarding certain state law violations that Hawaii harbors officials charged against the plaintiff. Shortly after the complaint was filed, and before either Senator Inouye or the other defendant had been served with the complaint, the district court dismissed the action sua sponte. The plaintiff has now appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit. 
This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Inouye in this matter to move the Ninth Circuit to affirm the judgment of the district court.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I want to talk to my colleagues about used cars. No, I don't want to sell one, I want to talk about how my colleagues have worked to protect every American who purchases a used car. 
Mr. President, the Title Branding Bill that I co-authored with Senator Ford passed this chamber by unanimous consent. This significant consumer protection legislation is long overdue. It will protect you and other consumers from unknowingly buying a severely damaged auto from dishonest rebuilders. 
Our bill will help eliminate the growing fraud of selling rebuilt vehicles that have been `totaled' and then sold to consumers who are never informed of the vehicle's damage history. This deceptive practice costs Americans nearly $4 billion annually. Today, Congress has helped solve this $4 billion problem. 
Mr. President, here is another statistic that scares me, and should also scare our colleagues. It is estimated that each year, one million cars are totaled, rebuilt, and put back on the roads. As you go home tonight try to imagine which car around you is one of the million put back this year. 
Clearly Senator Ford and I have addressed an issue that affects everyone--those who buy and drive used cars and those who share the roads with them. Remember, that's one million totaled cars per year that are structurally unsafe to drive. These previously totaled cars and trucks are put back on our roads here in DC, in my home state of Mississippi, and all across the nation. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that some states require disclosure on a vehicle's title to indicate its damage history, however, these requirements vary from state to state. As a result, unscrupulous re-builders can take advantage of the inconsistencies in state titling procedures to obtain what are known as `clean or washed' titles. Adopting a uniform federal standard will eliminate this problem by closing the loopholes. 
In 1992, Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to establish a taskforce to study the problems related to motor vehicle titling, and more importantly, the specific problems that have contributed to this serious consumer fraud. The taskforce included all stakeholders representing a wide array of interests. This diverse group provided specific recommendations that became the foundation upon which Senator Ford and I built S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act. Mr. President, our goal is simple and direct--to protect Americans on our roads with a uniform disclosure standard. 
Mr. President, contrary to what some people believe, our bill is not a federal mandate on the states. The bill does not restrict the ability of states to adopt higher `damage disclosure' requirements. Rather this bill provides the basic minimum federal standard while giving states the necessary flexibility to adopt more regulations if they so choose. 
As a result of our bipartisan effort, we have a bill that I firmly believe will benefit individuals, state motor vehicle administrators, automobile dealers, insurance companies and policy holders, consumer groups, salvage yards and many others involved in used car commerce. 
Our bill requires that if a salvage vehicle is rebuilt, it must have a theft inspection, as well as any required state safety inspection, and a branded title must be obtained before the vehicle is considered road-worthy. In addition, all rebuilt salvage vehicles must have a decal permanently affixed to the driver's door jamb, and its window, indicating that the vehicle has been rebuilt and specifying whether the vehicle has passed an approved safety inspection. 
In the future, a vehicle's title will disclose the damage history with a uniform minimum standard. A brand from one state will be carried forward to any new state in which the vehicle is registered. And, irreparably damaged vehicles' Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) will be tracked to help address automobile theft. I would also like to point out that while civil damages may be recovered by those who are victims of these fraudulent schemes, this bill will not prohibit currently permitted private rights of action. 
Mr. President, this legislation is a major step toward reducing motor vehicle titling fraud, improving consumer protection and disclosing valuable information to every American, their families and friends about a vehicle's damage history. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this bill has been crafted in a bipartisan fashion. I want to thank my Commerce Committee colleague from Kentucky, the Minority Whip, Senator Ford, for co-authoring this legislation with me. This bill is a fitting tribute to protect consumers as my friend retires from the Senate this year. 
I also greatly appreciate the support and cosponsorship of 57 of my colleagues in the Senate, including the distinguished Minority Leader, Senator Daschle. I also appreciate the efforts of Senator McCain for his stewardship as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Additionally, I want to thank Senator Hollings for his input and contributions to this legislative approach. I also want to commend my friend and colleague from Washington State, Senator Gorton, for his diligent work over the past several months to improve this bill. Senators Levin and Feinstein also deserve recognition for their efforts to provide states with maximum flexibility. 
Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate all of my colleagues for passing this important nonpartisan measure by unanimous consent. It is another example of how this Congress can put aside partisan differences and deliver significant legislation for the American people. 
In this particular case, it demonstrates that my colleagues are serious about protecting American consumers from fraud. By promoting the use of a uniform disclosure standard, Congress will help put dishonest rebuilders out of business, save consumers and automobile dealers as much as $4 billion annually, and keep 1 million totaled vehicles from being put back on the road each year. 
I would like to take a moment and recognize a few people who made this legislative effort successful. The first is Mr. Al East of East Ford in Jackson, Mississippi. Mr. East, a past president of the Mississippi National Automobile Dealers Association, identified the problem facing consumers and dealers in my home state and across the country 
As an automobile dealer himself, Mr. East knows first hand the tremendous cost that title washing has on the used car industry. Al East's dedication to his clients, his community and to American automobile industry, and his work on the Board of Directors for the National Automobile Dealers Association has positively effected this much needed legislation. 
I also want to recognize Ruddy Dossett, of Dossett Big Four in Tupelo, Mississippi for his testimony before the Commerce Committee. 
Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the Congressional staff who labored on the details. They include Clay Williams and Steven Apicella from my office, Lance Bultena, Jim Drewery and Moses Boyd from the Commerce Committee, David Regan from Senator Ford's office, and Jeanne Bumpus, from Senator Gorton's office. Each made a significant and tangible contribution to the bill. Each had the used car consumer in mind as they dotted the i's and the t's. 
As you are aware Mr. President, the House of Representatives took up a different companion bill last year that passed by an overwhelming majority. I call upon the House to complete the legislative process by working with the Senate's conferees and by ultimately passing this important automobile titling legislation. 
Mr. President, I am very proud that members from both sides of the aisle are continuing to fulfill the peoples' business. 
By passing this title branding bill today, the Senate has taken an important step toward removing structurally unsafe cars and trucks that would otherwise share the roads with our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. On behalf of all American motorists, I thank all my colleagues for voting in favor of this important pro-consumer, anti-fraud, anti-criminal legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, along with Senators Warner, Smith, and Kyl entered into a colloquy on the tritium provision in the pending National Defense Authorization Act Conference Committee Report. 
While I was not available to participate in that colloquy, I would like to make a few comments on this subject. 
First and foremost, the restoration of tritium production is absolutely critical. Without tritium, our entire nuclear deterrent would be left inoperable. Our nuclear warheads cannot function without replacement tritium. And time is wasting. 
For those who do not know, tritium is a radioactive gas that is an essential component of modern nuclear weapons. It decays at a rate of five-and-a-half percent per year, so it has to be continually replaced. We have not produced tritium in this country since 1988, when the reactors at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina were shut down. Since that time the Department of Energy has examined countless options and technologies, but has not yet selected a new source. We cannot afford to delay this program. The potential costs of delay are too great. 
The Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, had a difficult Defense Authorization conference with the House this year. Chairman Thurmond and the other members of the Committee negotiated over 570 legislative provisions and more than 1,000 funding differences with the House. The final result was a strong bipartisan bill. In fact, for the first time in many years, all the members of the conference, both Democrats and Republicans, signed the final conference report. 
Tritium was one of the most difficult issues that had to be addressed. The House and Senate bills had wildly differing provisions on this topic. In addition, there was a Presidential veto threat on one of the House tritium provisions. Chairman Thurmond, as always, put all other interests aside and delivered a compromise that put the national security interests of the U.S. ahead of all other interests. I am confident that his provision will keep the tritium program moving forward. 
However, there remain some disagreements as to the best method to produce tritium. It's not my place to comment on that today. I will say that under this conference agreement, Energy Secretary Richardson will be required to select his preferred technology in December of this year. I expect him to meet that requirement. 
I might also say to Secretary Richardson that the conference report requires him to submit along with the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request, a plan to implement whichever technology he selects in December. I expect him to identify the funding requirements, schedule, and legislation necessary to restore tritium production in time to meet Defense Department requirements. In order to be credible, his implementation plan must include adequate funding in fiscal year 2000 and beyond. 
This matter is too important to the national security of the United States to be undermined by deficient budget requests or lack of attention on the part of DOE. 
Furthermore, I put my colleagues on notice that I intend to be fully engaged in the debate when this matter comes before the Senate next year. Let me assure all interested parties that I intend to ensure that only one interest will dictate the outcome of that debate--the national security interests of the United States. The safety and security of the American people require all of us to ensure that there are no further unnecessary delays--for any reason.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this cloture vote, then, will occur on Monday. All Members will be notified as to the exact time of the vote when it becomes available. 
I want to say at this point, I certainly understand the concerns of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Alabama. I have talked to them several times, and I know that they still have concerns about what is in this bill. I am assuming they will be working with the chairman of the committee and other Senators that have concerns to work something out. I believe we are at a historic point with regard to financial services. That can be completed if everybody will work together in this week that we have left. 
I had delayed filing cloture earlier, including Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, because there were objections on both sides of the aisle about various and sundry things, but also I wanted to give everybody time to work through their problems. I really felt like that until we pushed this forward and had the cloture on a motion to proceed, the remaining problems were not going to be worked out. 
I, again, call upon Senators on both sides of the aisle and the chairman and the ranking member to work with the Senators that have concerns from both parties so that we can get this completed. 
This is the first time we will have had major financial services reform and modernization since 1932. We need to get it done. So I hope that can be accomplished. And I urge the Senators to keep working and keep me posted on the progress that is being made. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.

I understand there is only one amendment in order that may require a vote along with the passage. Therefore, additional votes are expected during today. 
We will try to work around scheduling conflicts. But I would expect a vote or two on this, and then for us to go to the Internet tax bill, hopefully, with votes on that. And we will also be voting, I presume, on the Internet tax bill tomorrow. And we cannot say right now, but I expect we will go beyond the normal hour of 9:30 or 10. We will work toward 12. And if we have to go beyond that, I would hope we would get cooperation because there is a meeting going on right now on the Internet tax matter with interested Senators from both sides of the aisle. We could complete that bill. And we should be prepared to stay as late as it takes to get that done. 
I urge the Senators that are involved in this, Senator Murkowski, Senator Feinstein, and others, if you can do it in less than 3 hours, there would be a lot of appreciation. If you can do it in an hour, hour and a half, we would appreciate it because we have a lot of work to do.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge today's passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. This action sets America's maritime industry on the right course. It increases competition for U.S. exporters by allowing America's exporters to compete on a level playing field with foreign entities. It has been fourteen years since Congress tackled comprehensive ocean shipping reform for the commercial sector. Since most of the world's commerce travels by sea, and the industry has changed so much during that period, additional reform is long since overdue. This legislation will update, revise, and improve upon the Shipping Act of 1984. It ensures fairness for U.S. carriers and shippers by modernizing America's ocean shipping regulatory system. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act represents true compromise. This legislative effort brought together many divergent interests--parties who often do not agree with one another. As my colleagues can attest to, achieving mutually beneficial reform was not an easy task. The process was difficult and sometimes arduous. It was, however, a necessary and important legislative journey for our nation's ocean shipping industry. In the end, all affected parties rolled-up their sleeves and worked hard to develop an equitable solution. The result is a consensus bill that received the solid backing of all industry segments including U.S. shippers, American and foreign ocean carriers, ports nation-wide, and U.S. labor. The 105th Congress' passage of this compromise measure represents a milestone in maritime policy. Everyone involved can be proud of this significant accomplishment. 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the many individuals from industry and labor who participated in this endeavor. I also want to congratulate the many Senators and staff who worked on this bill. I particularly want to express my gratitude to Senator McCain, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Gorton who worked diligently to deliver to the U.S. shipping industry and to all Americans real maritime reform. I also want to recognize the efforts of Chairman Shuster of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who spearheaded this reform effort in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 focuses on the needs of America's small, medium, and large shippers, carriers, U.S. ports, and on our nation's dock workers. It will ensure that the collective power of some industry elements will not be allowed to abuse other industry segments. The bill provides protection for small ports and small shippers through increased competition among shipping lines for export and import cargoes. It allows shipping lines and their customers to negotiate volume discount arrangements through the signing of confidential service contracts for transportation services without first obtaining the blessing of the shipping line conferences. This legislation gives shippers greater ability to shop around for the best rates and service from the carriers of their choice. Additionally, the bill continues current filing requirements for service contracts to provide continued FMC oversight of common carrier activities. 
This legislation will retain common carrier tariff publication and enforcement while eliminating the requirement to file tariffs with the government. Common carriers would be able to take advantage of available modern technology by using a World Wide Web home page or an electronic bulletin board to satisfy the tariff publication requirement. This just makes common sense. It reduces the cost of doing business while maintaining protections for small shippers. The wide availability of competitive price and service information will make for a better informed shipping consumer. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 does much to ensure that America's presence in the shipping industry is not subjected to unfair foreign rules or discriminatory practices. The FMC's enforcement actions taken against unfair port practices in Japan illustrates the essential and unique mission that this agency performs. Even more recently, issues concerning Brazil and China have come on their radar screen. This is a function that will continue, a mission that I wholeheartedly support. 
This legislation will significantly change the regulatory framework governing ocean transportation. It increases shipper and carrier flexibility and competitive options, ensures tariff accuracy and fairness, produces government efficiencies and provides genuine reform to protect American interests. These changes will strengthen the ability of common carriers to market their services and makes America's shippers more competitive. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 makes sense for American businesses and consumers alike. It will help sustain a strong and vibrant American maritime industry--fostering economic growth and enhancing our national security for years to come.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the end of the Cold War served to greatly reduce the threat of global instability, but the world is far from being a safe place today. Challenges to continued world peace--from increased terrorist activities to display of nuclear weapon capabilities by new countries--seem to occur weekly. To date, we have not had to face the dreaded combination of terrorists with nuclear arms, but that possibility must be considered as we evaluate new terrorist threats. 
Designs for crude nuclear weapons, potentially more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, are readily available today. The only hurdle for terrorists to overcome is acquisition of the plutonium or highly enriched uranium needed to build the weapon. 
Senator Pete Domenici, my colleague from New Mexico, has grappled with these issues for many years. He led the Senate's efforts through the U.S./Russian Agreement on Highly Enriched Uranium to secure 500 tons of this material from Russia, enough for perhaps 20,000 bombs. 
More recently, Senator Domenici has focused his attention on 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium that Russia has declared to be surplus; that's enough material for almost 10,000 nuclear weapons. He has led efforts to ensure that this surplus plutonium won't present us with a future threat. 
His trips to Russia, first last July with Senator Thompson and Senator Grams, and then more recently to the Moscow Summit, focus on this issue. Through those trips, Senator Domenici is well known to the leadership of the Russian weapon programs. His proposals for rapid progress on this surplus plutonium have been thoroughly studied throughout the world, from Japan to France. 
Senator Domenici discussed his proposals with President Clinton in late July and encouraged that plutonium disposition be a focus of this past Summit. The protocol on plutonium disposition at the Moscow Summit is an important first step, but it is only the first step. 
We have to go far beyond just signing the protocol to secure the benefits that it can provide--to ensure that the material is never rebuilt into weapons or found in the hands of terrorists or rogue states. Furthermore, the Senate needs to advise the Administration on the detailed agreements that will enable real progress. 
Today, I'm appointing a Senate Task Force on Plutonium Disposition to provide this input from the Senate to the Administration. I'm pleased that Senator Domenici has agreed to chair this task force, to continue his leadership on this vital topic. 
Also serving on the task force will be Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Senator Patty Murray of Washington. Each of these Members brings knowledge and concern that will be valuable in guiding the Senate on this issue. 
As agreements are finalized, the Senate may be called upon to approve programs or provide resources; we will depend on this task force to provide information for informed debates on these subjects. 
Disposition of the current 50 tons of Russian excess weapons-grade plutonium is an important national goal. We have a golden window of opportunity to rid the world of materials for thousands of nuclear weapons. We must seize this moment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation allowing the President to provide direct and overt military assistance to the Iraqi opposition. This is a bipartisan initiative. I am joined by Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator McCain of Arizona, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Helms of North Carolina, Senator Shelby of Alabama, Senator Brownback of Kansas, and Senator Kyl of Arizona. 
Today is the 55th day without weapons inspections in Iraq. For months, I have urged the Administration to fundamentally change its policy on Iraq. Monitoring the concealment of weapons of mass destruction is not enough. Our goal should be to remove the regime of Saddam Hussein from power. 
We should have no illusions. This will not be easy and it will not happen quickly. But it can happen. the U.S. has worked with Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein in the past. We can and should do so in the future. 
I have been working with a bipartisan group of Senators throughout much of the year to support a change in U.S. policy toward Iraq. In State Department Authorization Conference Report, $38 million is authorized for political and humanitarian support for the Iraqi opposition. 
In P.L. 105-174, Congress appropriated $5 million to support the political opposition and $5 million to establish Radio Free Iraq. 
In the Senate passed version of the Fiscal Year 1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, there is an additional $10 million for political support to the Iraq opposition. 
These steps have been important. But they are not enough. It is time to move beyond political support to direct military assistance. It is time to openly state our policy goal is the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from power. 
As long as Saddam Hussein remains in power, Iraq will pose a threat to stability in the Persian Gulf. As long as he remains in power, Iraq will pursue weapons of mass destruction programs. His record speaks for itself. 
The answer is not just `containment' or a US-led invasion. There are Iraqis willing to fight and die for the freedom of their country. There are significant portions of Iraq today which are not under the control of Saddam Hussein. 
Our goal should be to support Iraqi freedom fighters and expand the area under their control. 
I have discussed this approach with senior Administration officials. I have consulted with distinguished outside experts. I have raised this approach with heads of states and government officials from the region. I believe this approach can work.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of today's passage of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill. Today is a great day for rural America's air passengers. This legislation, now known as the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998, will bring much needed air service to underserved communities throughout the Nation. It will grant billions of dollars in Federal funds to our Nation's small airports for upgrades, through the Airport Improvements Program (AIP). 
Additionally, Senator McCain, chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, is to be commended for his superb leadership on this complex and contentious measure. Together with Senator Ford, their joint efforts moved this bill through the committee and to the Senate floor in such a manner that the amendment process went smoothly. 
It is only fitting that this must-pass legislation be named after such a worthy Senator. Wendell Ford has spent nearly 24 years as a Member of this body. For the last 10 years, I have enjoyed working with Senator Ford on a variety of issues within the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee. Through his leadership on this legislation, Senator Ford has proven himself as a champion of rural aviation issues. The Senate will certainly miss his guidance and insight. Likewise, the Senate will miss his wry, biting humor. 
Rural Americans are the biggest winners with the passage of the Ford Act. Citizens of underserved communities will no longer have to travel hundreds of miles and several hours to board a plane. This legislation gives incentives to domestic air carriers and its affiliates to reach out to these people and serve them conveniently near their homes. Many Americans will be able to travel a reasonable distance to gain access to our Nation's skies and, from there, anywhere they wish to go. 
Mr. President, I also applaud the hard work of Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. He added provisions to the Ford Act to expand small community air service. His dedicated efforts ensured that underserved cities like Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Bristol/Johnson City are now in a position to receive additional or expanded air service. 
The major policy changes in the Ford Act led to hard fought but honest disagreements. I have enormous respect for the efforts of Senators John Warner, Jim Inhofe, and Kay Bailey Hutchison as they diligently advocated for their constituents and their respective States. This honest debate is what makes it exciting to serve in the United States Senate. I was very pleased by the efforts of Senators Slade Gorton and Arlen Specter to address a very sensitive issue, while resolving it in a true Senate fashion--a consensus which will prove to be beneficial to both sides of the debate. 
Throughout the last 12 months, my home State of Mississippi has received Federal support from the AIP to make needed physical improvements. A portion of these funds went to the Bobby L. Chain Municipal Airport in Hattiesburg to rehabilitate their existing runway pavement and lights. Other funds were allocated to the Jackson International Airport to construct a new taxiway and apron. These enhancements are needed. And this bill will ensure that the AIP will continue uninterrupted. AIP's reauthorization within the Ford Act will allow Mississippi to continue to receive funds for essential enhancements for the upcoming year. I look forward to working with the airport authorities in my home State to make sure that the right improvements are made at the right airports. This is about safety and about economic growth. 
No legislative initiation is ever possible without the dedicated efforts of staff, and I want to take a moment to identify those who worked hard to prepare the Ford Act for consideration by the full Senate. 
From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation: Mark Buse; Ann Choiniere; Jim Drewry; Becky Kojm; John Raidt; Mike Reynolds; Ivan Schlager; Scott Verstandig; and Sam Whitehorn. 
The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senators: David Broome; Steve Browning; Jeanne Bumpus; Nat Grubbs; Brett Hale; Katrina Hardin; Dan Renberg; Pam Sellars; Ellen Stein; Ben Thompson; and Clay Williams. 
Mr. President, these individuals worked very hard on the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998 and the Senate owes them a debt of gratitude for their dedicated service to this legislation. 
Mr. President, our Nation's small communities are a step closer to receiving long-sought air service. Also, America's smaller, yet important air strips and airports will be enhanced. This is good for all Americans.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act. At long last, I think we are going to be able to complete action on this legislation and get it into conference and give us a good opportunity then to get this work completed by the session's end. 
It is expected that several amendments will be offered and debated this morning, with a stacked series of rollcall votes occurring at approximately 11:45 a.m. It looks like there will be two votes, probably, in that sequence, at 11:45. Those votes will hopefully include passage of bankruptcy legislation. Following disposition of that bill, the Senate may consider any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
At this time, I believe we will probably go to the Internet taxation bill. Although we have had discussions with the Democratic leadership, no further agreements have been reached on other bills. I wanted to put the managers of that legislation, Internet taxation, on notice that we may very well go to that, which would be shortly in the afternoon. 
From 10 until 11 o'clock, there will be a ceremony in the Rotunda where the Hon. Nelson Mandela will receive the Congressional Gold Medal. A number of Senators will be involved in that ceremony. We will continue to work on this bill, but we will defer votes until after that ceremony is over.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I do that, I want to yield myself such time as I may consume out of leader time. I will be very brief. 
Mr. President, when I became majority leader 2 and a half years ago, this issue was pending before the Senate and it had caused a lot of problems and some difficulties in trying to decide how to deal with it. After a period of weeks and months, we came to the conclusion that we did need a minimum wage increase at that point, but with a lot of small business tax provisions being included. And they helped to mitigate the effect on small business men and women and the jobs they create in particular. 
But we had a minimum wage increase the year before last. We had a minimum wage increase last year. This increase, in my opinion, would be bad for the economy, bad for business, and bad for job creation. 
I would like to just cite you two examples to think about. I have a son, first of all, who is a small businessman. And he employs people at the entry level, people who do not have high school educations--unwed mothers, people who are desperate to get a start, to get a job. And he gives them that opportunity. A lot of them go on to wind up being supervisors and owners of their own companies and create jobs. They live the American dream. 
But I had occasion to hear comments from one lady--I believe she was from Marietta, GA--named Harriet Cane. She owns a Sweet Life Restaurant, which she describes as a very small dessert and luncheon cafe. It seats 45 people. As a result of the last increase in the minimum wage, she reduced her 
staff from 16 to 10, by attrition primarily, raised prices modestly, and had to increase her own hours on the job to 16 a day. And here is her exact quote: 
I will tell you this, that if the next increase does go through, what will happen to my store. Bottom line: my doors will close. I've talked with my CPA. We've tried to be creative. We've tried to find a way to handle the increase in payroll that it would represent. As a little shop, I have no option. I just want the world and the communities to understand that this is a reality and not just rhetoric. 
Also, a very impressive statement was given on that occasion when I heard Harriet Cane by a gentleman from Texas named Jose Cuevas. Jose Cuevas came with no prepared statement, but he spoke from the heart. He and his wife, he said, have lived the American dream. He is a Hispanic restaurant owner in south Texas who is approximately 44 years old. And he and his wife, at the ages of 22 and 20, saved money and worked really hard so they could buy their first store. This is what he had to say: 
It became a dream. We now have four locations. We have $2.6 million worth of sales. We have seen a lot of people come through our door, and a lot of good people. They have all left something. They have all gone on to better things. I think of how this minimum wage will affect other people's dreams of owning their own companies, their own restaurants. I was fortunate enough that I and my wife worked side by side with two other employees until we earned a little bit more and could hire extra people. But at $6 or even $5.50 an hour, it will make it almost impossible. Our last raise in the minimum wage cost us $60,000 in labor costs. 
In conclusion he said, 
So I urge you to continue to fight the battle for us, because I believe it's true and right. America is built on small business owners, just like all of us that go out every day, work hard, and create jobs so that others could live the American dream like we have. 
Mr. President, I think this is the wrong action at the wrong time. The people who will be hurt the most are the people that well-intentioned Senators really want to help, because they will wind up not getting an increase in the minimum wage, they will wind up with no job. 
I urge the Senate to vote to table this amendment. I now move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act, with Senator Reed being recognized to offer an amendment under a 1-hour time agreement. Following that debate, Senator Kennedy will be recognized to offer an amendment regarding minimum wage under a 2-hour time agreement. 
At 12:30 p.m. the Senate will recess until 2:15 to allow the two party conferences to meet. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15 there will be 5 minutes for closing remarks on the Kennedy amendment prior to a vote on or in relation to the amendment. Following that vote, there will be up to four additional votes occurring in stacked sequence with minimal debate time between each vote. Those votes, in their respective order, will include the two Feingold amendments regarding attorney's fees and filing fees, the Reed amendment regarding underwriting standards, and the cloture vote on the child custody bill previously scheduled at 4:30. 
I am still hopeful that we can come to some agreement on amendments and time so that we can go to the child custody bill without further cloture votes. But failing that, we will go forward with that vote at 4:30. 
Further votes could occur into the evening as the Senate attempts to complete action on the bankruptcy bill. If we do not get to final passage tonight, then we expect that to be probably the first vote on Wednesday. 
As a reminder to Senators, second-degree amendments to the child custody bill must be filed by 3:30 p.m. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 2 p.m. I know there are Senators who wish to speak during that time. Senator Craig is here. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1301, which is the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act. 
As announced previously, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session out of respect for the Jewish holiday. Members are reminded that a cloture motion was filed on Friday to the committee substitute to the Child Custody Protection Act. Therefore, Members will have until 1 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments. The next rollcall vote will occur at approximately 2:20 p.m. tomorrow on or in relation to the Kennedy minimum wage amendment. 
Further votes are expected to be stacked following the minimum wage vote and then continue into the evening as the Senate attempts to complete action on the bankruptcy bill. All Members will be notified as to the time and number of votes during Tuesday's session as that information becomes available. 
Again, we will have a vote or votes, possibly as many as two or three, beginning at 2:20 p.m. and other votes in the afternoon, plus we will have, hopefully, final passage on bankruptcy reform and the cloture vote on child custody. Tuesday morning, we will announce the schedule for the remainder of the week as best we can determine it, but that takes a lot of cooperation from Members on both sides of the aisle. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are still consulting with both sides to see if we will be able to go forward this morning. It is Thursday morning and it seems to me this would be a good time to make some legislative progress on the people's business. We had great difficulty yesterday, trying to schedule votes around Senators' own interests which I thought, in many instances, were inappropriate. I urge my colleagues to not put their own conveniences over the interests of the people's business or their other 99 colleagues. 
Also, while there are obviously distractions and disagreements on what should be the business of the Senate, there are some things that we can do and should do. Unfortunately, yesterday we were not able to even go forward with debate because we could not get an agreement as to how to proceed on the issues. We have a unanimous consent agreement that we reached last Thursday that seemed to be fair and satisfactory to one and all on how to proceed on the bankruptcy reform legislation, including, at the insistence of the Senator from Massachusetts, a vote on a minimum wage. 
We agreed that we would have a vote as soon as we took up the bankruptcy bill, we would have 2 hours of debate on minimum wage and then a vote. The Senator indicated he had hoped we would do that in the morning, rather than late at night, and we have wanted to try to accommodate that. But when we said, OK, good, Thursday morning, we will start at 9:30, we will do the debate, have a vote at 11:30 on minimum wage, he indicated he didn't want to do that. 
So I don't know. I understand maybe he has a press conference at the White House, but he has to make a decision here. You know, are we going to go for press conferences, or are we going to go for the vote on something he says is very important to him, the minimum wage issue? I assume he will be here later and we will get something worked out as to how to proceed on that. In the meanwhile, I hope we can go ahead and go forward with bankruptcy, bankruptcy amendments. We have a list that we agreed to, amendments that are not subject to second-degree. 
There was a misunderstanding about one of them, and the sponsor of that amendment has very graciously agreed to not offer that amendment, Senator Hatch, on the intellectual properties issue. And there are some other controversial issues that we are going to work together on in a bipartisan way. 
So I hope we would try to make some progress on that. Senator Durbin is here, one of the sponsors of the bankruptcy reform bill. Senator Grassley is right here ready to go. So as soon as we can get a confirmation that we were able to get together on that, we will make that announcement to Members. 
I might say, we should expect votes on amendments throughout the day. And, from 2 to 6 this afternoon, we will have the debate on the partial-birth abortion ban veto override. And then we hope to come back to the bankruptcy after that, and then have a couple of votes tonight on amendments--one or two or three, whatever--that we can stack, so that Members will know when those votes would occur. 
Let me read here now the unanimous consent that we have worked out.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to S. 1301 under the provisions of the consent agreement of September 11. I further ask that at 2 p.m., the bill be laid aside and there be 4 hours for debate, equally divided, on the veto message to accompany the partial-birth abortion bill, with speakers alternating between the proponents and opponents. 
I further ask that at 6 p.m. the Senate resume consideration of S. 1301. 
Finally, I ask unanimous consent that at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, September 18, there be 1 hour for debate, equally divided, on the abortion veto message and a vote occur at 9:30 a.m. on the question: Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation getting this time agreed to. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor to the managers of the legislation, I do want to take just a moment of leader time to make a plea for Senators, once again, to consider very carefully how they will vote this afternoon on the partial-birth abortion ban issue. 
The vote will be close. We need 67 Senators to override that veto. I believe there is no more important issue that we will vote on this entire year. I don't see how any Senator can defend this procedure. 
I took the time while I was home, about a year ago, to talk to Dr. Julius Bosco, the OB/GYN who delivered both of my own children. Originally from Brooklyn, NY, he was in the Air Force as a doctor, came to Keesler Air Force Base, married a local girl, and we couldn't get rid of him--he stayed. He is a great doctor and a great man. I asked him, Dr. Bosco, are there any circumstances at any time, any justification for this procedure being used? And he said, `Never.' 
Three Senators hold the results of this veto override in their hands, and it will weigh on their conscience. I hope that the Senate will override this veto. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had earlier made a unanimous consent request to bring up the FAA issue, now known as the Wendell Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. This is a bill we really need to get done before we leave. If we don't get it cleared, cloture will take so much time, we may wind up not being able to complete this bill. 
It is important for airports, air passengers, the airline industry, the entire country. 
Again, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, proceed to the consideration of S. 2279, the National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. I further ask that during the pendency of S. 2279 only relevant amendments be in order to the bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate has been on this Interior bill now for 6 session days and has not really scratched the surface of the bill. This is the 11th appropriations bill that the Senate has considered in preparation for the end of the fiscal year, which is September 30. 
Members will recall last week we spent most of our time on the campaign finance reform issue. This week there have been farm amendments as well as other amendments that are unrelated to Interior that are waiting in the wings. It looks like it will be very hard to keep focused on the Interior appropriations bill itself and get it completed. And, of course, that will affect the next two appropriations bills.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, over the past three decades, concern for our environment and natural resources has grown--as has the desire to recycle and reuse. You may be surprised to learn that one major environmental statue actually creates an impediment to recycling. Superfund has created this impediment, although unintended by the law's authors. 
Because of the harm that is being done to the recycling effort by the unintended consequence of law, the distinguished Minority Leader, Mr. Daschle, and I introduced The Superfund Recycling Equity Act (S. 2180). This bill removes Superfund's recycling impediments and increases America's recycling rates. 
We had one and only one purpose in introducing the Superfund Recycling Equity Act--to remove from the liability loop those who collect and ship recyclables to a third party site. The bill is not intended to plow new Superfund ground, nor is it intended to revamp existing Superfund law. That task is appropriately left to comprehensive reform, a goal that I hope is achievable in the 106th Congress. 
While the bill proposes to amend Superfund, Mr. President, it is really a recycling bill. Recycling is not disposal and shipping for recycling is not arranging for disposal--it is a relatively simple clarification, but one that is necessary to maintain a successful recycling effort nationwide. Without this clarification, America will continue to fall short of its recycling goal.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, on this subject, this is a very important Federal Aviation Administration bill. It is critical and is must-pass legislation. I discussed it briefly with Senator Daschle and he indicates that he will work to see if we can clear any objections or holds that we might have on it. It involves billions of dollars in airport improvement grants, which cannot be distributed without the authorization bill that has been named the Wendell Ford bill, since he has been a member of the committee and has worked on this particular bill and its authorization for many years. It would provide funding for projects at nearly every airport in the Nation and for work that is really essential. I hope we can come to an agreement on this and get it up for consideration within the next 2 weeks so it won't get caught up and lost at the end of the session. So I will be talking further to Senator Daschle about this and any Senator that might have any problems. I know Senator McCain wishes to speak on this.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin debate in relation to the motion to proceed to S. 1981, the Truth in Employment Act, with the time between now and 1 p.m. equally divided between Senators Hutchinson and Kennedy or their designees. I see that Senator Hutchinson is on the floor and prepared to go forward and already has his charts on display here. I appreciate the work that he has done in this area. 
At 1 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. It is the majority leader's hope that the Interior bill will be finished the first part of this week. Last week there were other issues that were debated, that were attached to the Interior appropriations bill, and cloture votes that were also voted on. But I think this week it is important that we stay focused on the Interior appropriations bill, this afternoon and Tuesday and Wednesday, if necessary, to try to get it completed. That is an important part of us doing the people's business. 
Yes, there are a lot of distractions, but in the meantime the Senate must continue to go forward with the things that have to be done before we can go out at the end of this session so that our Members can go home and be with their constituents. So the Interior bill will be our principal focus this week. Senators who have amendments are encouraged to come to the floor. Don't keep shoving them off and saying, `I will offer them later,' `I will offer them Tuesday,' `I will offer them Wednesday.' You will wind up being here at 10 o'clock Wednesday night having to offer and debate your amendments. I hope that Senators will come forward and offer amendments if they have them. 
At 5 p.m., under a previous order, the Senate will resume debate in relation to the Truth in Employment Act until 5:30. At that time the Senate will proceed to a vote on cloture on a motion to proceed to the employment bill. 
Also at that time there could be a vote or votes on or in relation to amendments on the Interior appropriations bill. We do not have that locked in yet, but we would like to get some work done, and there is a likelihood that there will be a second vote following the vote that is already scheduled at 5:30. Further votes could occur, as I said, during this evening. And Members should expect that we will have to go into the evening almost every night this week. 
In addition, on Friday we did get a unanimous consent agreement with regard to how we would bring up and debate and vote on the bankruptcy reform bill. I thank Senators on both sides for working late into the night Thursday night and during the morning Friday, that allowed us to craft this unanimous consent agreement. We will bring that up the first opportunity we have--certainly only after consultation with the Democratic leader. But if we could finish the Interior bill at a reasonable time Wednesday, we could very well go to the bankruptcy bill either Wednesday night or Thursday, but it will depend on how things go between now and then. 
Also, I understand that the Banking Committee did report out, by a wide margin, the Financial Services Act last week. I had indicated to the chairman, Chairman D'Amato, that if they reported it out on a broad bipartisan vote, we would look for an opportunity to have a vote on that also. I don't know if that would come before next week or even the next week, but bankruptcy reform and the Financial Services Act would be two very large accomplishments, if we could get these done before we go out at the end of the session. 
So, again, I hope Senators will be prepared to work hard, offer their amendments, let us have our votes, and let us make some progress so we can show the American people, despite the distractions, we are doing our work. 
I yield the floor.

I think it is important that we start on it quickly, in a bipartisan way. I am going to be working on that early next week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 11 a.m. on Monday, September 14. I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Monday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided for debate relating to the motion to proceed to S. 1981, the Truth In Employment Act, with the time divided between Senator Hutchinson and Senator Kennedy or his designee. 
I further ask consent that at 1 p.m. the Senate resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. And I want to emphasize at this point that it would be my intent, the early part of next week, to be on the Interior appropriations bill Monday afternoon, Tuesday, Wednesday--until we complete action. I know there have been other issues that have necessarily been offered this week on the Interior bill, and cloture votes, but I think next week it is important that we do get a focus on the Interior appropriations and complete action on that so that we can go to the remaining two appropriations bills. 
I further ask consent that at 5 p.m. there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided, again related to S. 1981, with the vote occurring on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1981 at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.

Mr. LOTT. I believe in the past, if I might respond to the Senator, that perhaps there had been a longer explanation as to what was included. Perhaps that is the way the Senator from West Virginia did it when he was majority leader. I think probably I may have caused this by indicating or asking if we couldn't do that in a little shorter phraseology. But I will go back and take a look at the best way to say that, so that Members' rights are protected and so that they will understand what is being asked for there.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, certainly I will review that again. I remembered, when we made a modification in the language--and I do have it before me here--on February 10, 1997, I did point out what the intent was here, the phrase `the routine requests through the morning hour' are deemed to include the approval of the Journal to date, the waiving of resolutions coming over under the rule, the waiving of the call of the calendar, and the expiration of the morning hour. 
Because I was aware that this was a change and a shortening of that. But we will take another look at it. We always certainly respect Senator Byrd's suggestions and requests, and we will do so.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on Monday, the Senate will debate the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1981, the truth in employment legislation. 
In addition, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill, a very important bill for our country and one I hope we can move through the regular process and get into conference so an agreement can be worked out. It is hoped Members will make themselves available Monday afternoon if they intend to offer amendments to this very important bill. I am hoping, I believe maybe there is one very important amendment that can be offered Monday afternoon. I hate to point it out, but I think we have one that could take a good bit of time, and we could have a vote on it late in the afternoon on Monday. 
All Senators should be on notice that the first rollcall vote will occur on Monday beginning at 5:30, and that vote will be on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to the truth in employment bill. Additional rollcall votes are possible following the 5:30 vote hopefully relating to possible amendments to the Interior appropriations bill. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say, first, that this agreement has been worked out. I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators with regard to bankruptcy, and I think it is fair and everybody is comfortable with it. 
I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled today be vitiated. 
I further ask that the following amendments be the only second-degree amendments in order, and following the conclusion of the listed amendments the Senate proceed immediately to a vote on the committee substitute, as amended, and the Senate then proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 3150, and all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 1301 be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without further action or debate. 
I further ask that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint the following conferees on the part of the Senate. And they are Senators Hatch, Grassley, Sessions, Leahy, and Durbin. 
I further ask that the Senate proceed to S. 1301, under the agreement, at a time to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader. 
I further ask that during the consideration of S. 1301, but not before Tuesday, September 15, the majority leader be recognized to lay aside the pending business and proceed to S. 1301 and Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer his second-degree amendment relative to the minimum wage and there be 2 hours equally divided prior to the motion to table and no further amendments be in order to the motion to table. 
I further ask that if the amendment is not tabled, this agreement be null and void.

Mr. LOTT. I have not been involved in the debate over the last 2 days, but I want to say that we have had this debate and we have had this vote again because Senator McCain felt it was important that it be considered further, especially in view of the House vote. But we have had that debate and we have had the vote, and the vote is the same. Nothing has changed. There is no consensus. 
I still maintain that before we start changing the laws we ought to try to find out who broke the laws, how did they break the laws, why did they break the laws. We now have not one, not two, but three 90-day preliminary investigations of whether or not to go forward with the independent counsel on whether the President, the Vice President, and a Deputy Chief of Staff were involved in 1996 campaign violations. 
It seems to me it would be wise to see what is going to happen there, find out what happened. I still don't understand why, if people broke the law, there are those who say, `Oh, geez, what we need to do is change the law.' 
Do we have some areas where we are going to have to take a look at the campaign laws as far as contributions, and where money can be raised, or how, what kind of money on Federal property? Yes, we are going to have to take a look at that, and I am going to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle who really want to have something done that is balanced and fair. 
This is not the solution. This is not the time. Here we are 60 days before an election, 30 days before the end of the session. We are trying to do the Interior appropriations bill. We spent 2 days on campaign finance reform, and now we have threats that it is going to continue. I have been patient. I have tried to be cooperative. I appreciate the cooperation I have received. I do think now the time is right for us to move on to Interior, bankruptcy reform, and child custody, very important issues that need to be addressed. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the subject of the bankruptcy bill. The managers of the legislation will be here momentarily. 
I should note that we did call this issue up last Thursday, I believe it was, but we had difficulty in getting to the substance because the Senator from Massachusetts did not want us to get to the substance. He had an amendment he wanted to talk about. 
But Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin did make some small statements at the end of the day on Thursday. I thought it was appropriate that we go back to the bankruptcy bill and that they be able to come to the floor and lay out the outline of this legislation and begin to get Members' attention focused on the bankruptcy bill itself. 
Before I go to my own discussion about the importance of this bill, I want to report to the Senate that we did just have a bicameral majority leadership meeting, House and Senate leaders sitting down, talking about the people's business. We met for an hour. And while there are many in this city who are talking about the Starr report and how it is to be dealt with and how can it be done in a fair and bipartisan way, we met for an hour and we talked only about those issues that we need to address in the Congress this year. 
We talked about the appropriations bills, and it is important that we get them through the process. We have now had 11 appropriations bills pass the House, 10 pass the Senate. We are trying desperately to get the 11th appropriations bill to begin to move here in the Senate; that is the Interior appropriations bill. So we will only have left in the Senate after Interior, the D.C. appropriations bill, and the Labor, HHS, Education, and other agencies and departments' appropriations bills--only two. I have urged the appropriators on both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Capitol, to work expeditiously. If we have issues that we just cannot agree on between the two bodies or between the Congress and the White House, set them aside. The important thing is to get the job done. 
We also then talked about the importance of preserving Social Security, but allowing the people to get some of their hard-earned taxes back. Absolutely, before we leave this year, we should pass legislation to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. We should allow for the self-employed deduction. The American people don't really realize it, although I am sure they feel the pinch, the American people are being taxed now at the highest levels in years and years and years. They need some relief. Some of the money that is coming up here now, going into the surplus, certainly should go back to the people. 
The administration cannot come up here and say: We want all this extra spending for what we consider emergencies, and that will not count against Social Security, but, by the way, if you allow for some tax cuts for the people who earned it in the first place, oh, by the way, you are taking that out of Social Security. That kind of argument, I don't believe, in this atmosphere, is going to sell this year. 
But we talked about the fair way to do tax cuts. We talked about what we might want to do next year in terms of more tax cuts, across-the-board rate cuts next year, and how we can begin to make progress in preserving Social Security. 
We also talked about the importance of keeping our commitment on the balanced budget last year, sticking to the caps. Yes, there may be some real emergencies we will have to address, but other than that, we need to stick to the caps we agreed to. We gave our word 1 year ago, and we ought to stick to it. 
Then we talked about other issues. Higher education--we have a conference committee meeting this week. Hopefully, they will complete agreement on the conference report on higher education this week--certainly within the next few days--so that our children will have access to the colleges--community colleges and universities all across this country. We will get that done. 
Mr. President, we talked about the importance of this bankruptcy reform. That brings me to this particular issue. This legislation is long overdue. We have a system now in America which encourages people to take bankruptcy and get out of their debts. We have a system that does not take into consideration that small businessman or woman, that furniture store that is run by the husband and the wife. They are trying to make ends meet. They are selling furniture on credit, and people who are supposedly buying that furniture are declaring bankruptcy or just walking away from what they owe and getting out of their debts. We need reform. This is bipartisan. It came out of the committee of jurisdiction by a wide margin. 
I know Senator Durbin, Senator Daschle, Senator Grassley on this side, Senator Hatch--a number of Senators have worked on this legislation. We need to get it done. We are this close to having it go down because Senator Kennedy wants to offer the minimum wage increase to bankruptcy reform. It is not related to bankruptcy reform, but he insists on it being added to this bill. 
It is curious to me, why this bill? It could be to any other bill. Oh, no; he wants this one. I suspect it is because he knows that this is a bill that the leadership on both sides would really like to have. But he is willing to take down this very important legislation to be able to offer his minimum wage increase, even though we have had minimum wage increases the last 2 years in a row and I have had store owners, restaurant owners, self-employed individuals who have little small businesses who have come to me and said: 
OK, we made it the last time, but we are at the limit. We have had to let people go so we can make a living. We are working more hours. But if we have to go through two more, or three more, minimum wage increases, we are going to go out of business. At a minimum, we are going to have to lay people off. 
But here is my attitude. If Senator Kennedy will be reasonable and will agree to a time limit, he can offer his amendment and we will have a vote. But then I think we ought to be able to go on to the bankruptcy bill itself and complete the work with a reasonable time limit and amendments on that. 
Some folks say you always want to limit amendments. If you limit a bill to 15 amendments, that is not what I would call a big limit. And I am not saying 15, but something reasonable so we can get bankruptcy done, so we can come back to Interior appropriations, let the Senator from Wisconsin come back again, you know, have something to say, have another vote on Interior appropriations involving campaign finance reform. But at what point are we going to say, `OK, we played our games'? You have had your votes. We have had our votes on campaign finance reform. We have had votes on bankruptcy reform. We have had votes on national missile defense. We have had all these other votes. But at some point we have to say, `OK, we have dealt with it, we made our point, and we are going to move on the people's business,' 
whether it is the Interior appropriations bill or the next appropriations bill. I understand the plan on the D.C. appropriations bill is to offer a whole series of nonrelevant amendments on that bill. 
When does it end? If we can come to some reasonable agreement on time--Senator Daschle and I talked last night; Senator Durbin and I talked this morning, Senator Grassley. I said, let's work out something on bankruptcy so that everybody gets a fair shot but we can get this bill done. 
I will yield to the Senator if he has a question or comment.

In fact, some of the amendments that I would offer you would likely wind up being filibustered. You would. I have a long list of really interesting amendments that I don't think you would particularly like, but I like them a whole lot. So here is my point.

Mr. LOTT. Poison pill. These are not poison pills. They are very legitimate amendments. But here is the point: You acknowledge that at some point you have to have 60 votes. We went through this last year. It derailed the highway bill. We didn't get 60 votes. It came back this year, in an effort to be fair, to see if something had changed. We had votes. It got 52 votes. Then the argument was made, `Well, gee, the House voted on a different bill, by the way, and things maybe have changed.' We voted again. Things haven't changed. 
How many times do we have to go through that exercise? The day will come when maybe really we can work in a bipartisan way on a bill that is fair to all concerned and we will maybe be able to bring it to a conclusion. I won't say that day won't come. I think it will, actually. The question is, When will that be and what will it be? And I am going to work on that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, I appreciate your courtesy. You have always been courteous. You have always been very reasonable in the way you have approached everything around here. Maybe the day will come when we will be able to sit down and agree on something. I don't see it at this point. I think the timing is wrong. After all, 2000 is still 2 years off. You have 1999. We will see where we can wind up. 
For now, I want to focus our attention on the bankruptcy bill itself. I see that Senator Daschle is here. I noted in his absence that we have Senators on both sides now trying to work out an agreement. I hope we can make some progress on that this afternoon or tonight and that we will go forward with the substance. I understand Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin will be coming over to, in effect, do their opening statements which they didn't really get to do last Thursday night. We will let them begin the bankruptcy bill while we see if we can work something out. 
For Senators who may not be aware of it, I said last night while we filed cloture, it is my hope that we can work out an agreement, and we can vitiate that cloture vote tomorrow. But we do need to get something worked out so we won't have to go to cloture, because I think if we do have another cloture vote and it doesn't prevail, we really have to go on. I can't stand up here and say we need to go to Interior appropriations and then stay on bankruptcy beyond a reasonable period of time. But I think it is possible, because I know there is a lot of support on both sides of the aisle. 
With that, Mr. President, I just want to say I will be working with Senator Daschle to see if we can work this out, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might just respond briefly, obviously, Senators are entitled to offer amendments, and then other Senators are entitled to offer second-degree amendments. The Senator knows very well that cloture votes and filibusters are an important part of this institution. You may not like it, depending on which end you are on on that subject, whether you are on the receiving end, but it is there and it is an honored and a time-preserved process we use around here. 
Also, the Senate sometimes works on an issue for years--years--before you get a consensus. I worked on telecommunications for 10 years. This year, and we got very little credit for it, but this year we passed the Workplace Development Act, a consolidation of job training programs. We worked on it for 3 years. We failed at the end of the last Congress to pull it out. We finally got it done, sent it over to the President, and because everything else was going on, it didn't even receive any notice. Sometimes consensus takes time. 
Also, I have watched the Senate over a period of years on a number of issues, sometimes when Republicans were pushing them; sometimes when Democrats were pushing them. You reach a point where you say, `I made my point for now; I'll be back, but now we are going to go on and do our business.' 
We have 19 days left, assuming we are going to try to go out October 9, 19 days left in this session. 
We still have important work to do, including a lot of bills on the issues that we agree on in a bipartisan way, and with only 19 days to accomplish them. 
The Senator has his rights, but as majority leader and in the leadership we have to try to find a way to have those votes, but then to move on. So I am sure you understand. I understand where you might have to come from, and I hope you will understand what I would have to do under those conditions to try to keep the focus. 
But the next 19 days are not going to be easy under the best of conditions. The Senate is expected to show decorum and restraint and dignity, and I know we are going to do that. We also have to reach out across the aisle and say, `Can we find a way to work through these bills?' 
I think the people will be watching us. We have to do a little preening. You have to make your positions clear, we have to make our positions clear, and then at some point we have to come together. We will not necessarily agree at the beginning on what the solution is to agriculture in America. But it is very important in South Dakota and in Ohio and Mississippi and all over this country. But at some point we are going to come together because this is a problem, a real problem, and we can find a solution. 
So I hope that is the way that we will proceed. Make your points, on both sides of the issue--on both sides of the aisle--and then let us sit down and see if we can find a way to come to an agreement to do the best we can. It may not be all we want to do, or it may be too much in some cases, but I am prepared to work in that vein. And I am hoping, again, in spite of all the other distractions, that we can keep our attention focused. And I will try to help to do that. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Let me say, Mr. President, I indicated to the Senator from Massachusetts that I think we have an agreement worked out in a fair way to handle his amendment with regard to minimum wage, but we are still having to work to see if we can get something agreed to on the bankruptcy reform bill. I understand that may take some considerable time yet, but Senator Grassley is working on it, as well as Senator Durbin and others who have been in contact with the White House. 
I think a good-faith effort is underway. If it can be worked out in 3 hours, that would be magnificent. We would have the vote on Senator Kennedy's amendment and we could go to the bankruptcy issue and have votes and get this issue completed. If we can't get the agreement worked out on bankruptcy reform, then we would have a cloture vote tomorrow as is scheduled, 
and we would go on to other issues. I am sure Senator Kennedy will then offer his amendment on something else. That is where we are now. Everybody is working in good faith. We will hope for the best.

And it will take a period of days to get through the process we have to go on, on nuclear waste. But that is not intended to take the place of either the tobacco bill or the Department of Defense authorization bill. It will be double tracking as we go forward.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had a good deal of discussion about how to proceed tomorrow with regard to campaign finance reform, and I think we have something worked out here that is acceptable to all sides. I hoped there would be more time for Senator McCain and others to discuss the issue tomorrow, but there are some conflicts that we are trying to recognize and accommodate. 
So I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Thursday, the Senate resume the pending McCain amendment, and the time between 10 a.m. and 12 noon be equally divided in the usual form for debate only. I further ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon Senator Feingold be recognized to offer a motion to table the pending amendment. 
I further ask unanimous consent that if the amendment is not tabled, the time prior to 1:45 p.m. on Thursday be equally divided in the usual form for debate only, and notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote occur at 1:45 p.m. on Thursday.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also just discussed with Senator Daschle the possibilities of working out a procedure that we could take up the bankruptcy reform, allow for amendments to be offered, and get some sort of understanding about what those amendments would be and the time that might be involved. There are a number of Senators who are interested in this legislation on both sides of the aisle--Senator Grassley obviously, Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin; Senator Kennedy has an amendment he wants to offer. 
I had not seen any movement earlier than this afternoon toward working something out, but I believe now that there will be a good-faith effort to see if we can work out some sort of agreement that we will come together on tomorrow. But so that we can get the matter laid down in the proper way, and so that there can be protections for all concerned until we get an agreement worked out, I want to go ahead and do this procedure. But if we get an agreement worked out, obviously I would move to vitiate it. I really would like to get bankruptcy reform done, but I think we need some sort of reasonable agreement in order to accomplish that and in order to not go forward with the cloture vote. 
So I understand that there is no further need for debate on the pending motion, and I ask the Chair to put the question.

Mr. President, just in conclusion, once again, I urge all of the Senators that are interested in this legislation that they begin work right away, tomorrow, so that we will not let the whole day pass without trying to work something out. Senator Daschle and I will talk as the day progresses. That would be the wise thing to do, I think, if we can work something out that is reasonable, to allow us to continue to complete campaign finance reform, and so we can go on and hopefully complete the Interior appropriations bill. 
This is a positive move and I appreciate the opportunity to work on it to see if we can get something agreed to. 
Mr. President, at this point, I ask that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.

I know there are amendments that Senators are very interested in that would even be relevant postcloture, and then there are others that obviously Members are interested in, too. I hope they will file them. The managers are attempting to clear as many amendments as possible and would like to reach a consent agreement limiting amendments, if that is at all possible, and perhaps that could be taken care of in our agreement that we are working on.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, when the Senate reconvenes on Thursday, Senator Brownback will be recognized to speak in morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume the McCain amendment with the time until 12:00 noon equally divided for debate. At noon, Senator Feingold will be recognized to offer a motion to table the McCain amendment. If the amendment is not tabled, the debate time will continue equally divided until 1:45 p.m. At that time, a cloture vote will occur on the McCain campaign finance amendment. 
Following that vote, assuming cloture is not invoked, there will be a brief period of morning business, and then the Senate will continue offering and debating amendments to the Interior bill. Therefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout Thursday afternoon and into the night, with the first vote, of course, occurring at 12:00 noon on Thursday. 
I really hope that we can make some progress on the Interior appropriations bill. If Senators have amendments they would like to offer, I urge them to come to the floor on Thursday afternoon and Thursday night and we could possibly even carry over a vote or two until Friday and have a sequence of stacked votes. Of course, that will depend on what we are able to get done Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. This is an important bill. There are some important amendments that need to be debated and voted on. I hope we can get started. 
Unfortunately, it has kind of been sandwiched between campaign finance reform amendments and cloture votes on national missile defense and also bankruptcy. These are all important, but we need to get more focused on Interior appropriations tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow night.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last week, the Senate made good progress, and I want to express my appreciation for the cooperation. We did pass the military construction appropriations conference report, the first appropriations conference report of the year. We also completed action on two other appropriations bills, the foreign operations appropriations bill and the Treasury-Postal Service. In addition to that, we completed action on the Texas Compact legislation and got started on debate on bankruptcy reform. So I think we made good use of our time. There were also some very interesting hearings that occurred last week. I hope we can continue that pace this week. 
We will have a period of morning business until 12:30 today. Following morning business, the Senate will recess until 2:15 to allow for the weekly party caucuses to meet. When we reconvene after the party caucuses, it is my intention for the Senate to begin consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. That will be the 11th appropriations bill to be considered for the year, leaving only D.C. appropriations and the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill. We have not quite a month, but we only have the three remaining bills to get done. With a little cooperation, we can complete them. Hopefully, we will begin to see two or three conference reports cleared each week for the balance of this month. 
Members are encouraged to come to the floor and offer amendments if they have amendments on the Interior appropriations bill so that we can have debate and votes and make substantial progress on it. We would expect to have rollcall votes this afternoon and into the evening, perhaps, on the Interior bill amendments or any legislative or executive items that may be cleared. 
Also, as a reminder to all Members, there will be two cloture votes on Wednesday. The first will be on national missile defense. We voted on this a few months ago. Cloture failed by just one vote. I believe, in view of what has been happening around the world--the uncertainty in Russia, the actions by North Korea, and the problem in Iraq--for us not to have a national missile defense, to not have a plan, to not have commitment, is indefensible. I would not want to be on record as not supporting this. The American people expect it of us. If we don't act now, the year 2010 will come and we still will not have a missile defense. With a lot of dangerous people, chances of rogue or accidental launch is there. We should not take it for granted. 
After we vote on cloture and hopefully complete action on the national missile defense bill, we will then turn to the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act. We hope we will get cloture on that. Because of objections from Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, we had to file cloture on a motion to proceed. If we get cloture on that, then we would move immediately to cloture on the bill itself, if necessary. But I hope we get cloture on the motion to proceed. Then we can work out a way to consider this legislation and Senators would have a chance or chances to offer amendments, if they would like to. 
This could be a busy week. It could be a productive week. We also will probably file cloture sometime this week, perhaps Wednesday, on the child custody bill, but we will make that decision as we see how the week is proceeding and progressing. We will make that call probably Wednesday. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was somewhat hesitant to speak at this time because I didn't in any way want to make this a partisan series of speeches, but my effort here and my intent is to make it totally nonpartisan and bipartisan. 
I won't say anything today about the specifics of the substance that the Senator from Connecticut addressed. I made my comments on this subject on Monday of this week at a press conference down the hall. But I listened carefully, very intently to what the Senator from Connecticut had to say. I don't think there was very much more or less in what he had to say than what I had said earlier. I think our desire and intent, and our wishes and hopes are both the same. 
Instead, I want to talk today about the Senator from Connecticut. I expected no less than this from him. He is truly one of the Senators in this body that is always standing for the right thing, trying to make sure that we do have a moral compass as individuals, as an institution. I knew that at some point he would rise and put it all into the proper perspective and that he would not go too far, that he would make us stop and think--not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Senators and Americans--about the seriousness and the difficulties that have been caused by this situation. So I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut for what he had to say, and what he has had to say on many other occasions on other subjects, and for the leadership he has provided on children and the violence and the filth they are being exposed to, and the leadership and pressure he has exerted to try to get us as a country and those involved directly in providing those films, those scenes, to do something about it. So I thank him. 
I know it was not easy. I know he has taken time to think about it and pray about it for over about 3 weeks now. I know there was probably a lot of reason not to say anything. But I also know that his conscience dictated that he had to express himself. I commend him for it and I thank him for it. 
I also appreciate the fact that Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, would come here and lend his support to what the Senator from Connecticut had to say. This very day, I had lunch with the Senator from New York. Maybe the American people do not realize that we are friends off this floor and that we enjoy each other's company. And we do travel together. We get to be together with our wives and sometimes even our children. But today at lunch, with Senator Mack of Florida, Senator Roth of Delaware, we were joined by the Senator from New York. We talked about the very serious situation in Russia. Every time he joins us, I immediately want to raise a part of the world and say, `What about India and Pakistan?' or `What about that country or this situation?' He is such a fountain of knowledge and has a wealth of experience and a tremendous understanding of history and people. I found it very informative, and I have been dwelling on what he had to say about Russia this afternoon. 
I think at times like this, when our Constitution is going to be reviewed again as to what it means and when we are going to have to make decisions about what to do when we are presented with a set of facts--which may be nothing--it is going to be so important that there are some men and women on both sides of the aisle in this body, and in the other body, that can reach across the aisle and say, `What do we do?' and, most important, `What is best for our country?' With these men, and with others in this Chamber here today such as Senator Hatch, Senator Coats, Senator Nickles, and the great Strom Thurmond, I am sure we will find a way to rise above petty politics and do the right thing, and Senator Lieberman will lead the way. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Domenici has been on official Senate business earlier this week and was therefore, necessarily absent for the two votes held on Tuesday and the five votes held on Wednesday. He attended the Summit in Russia. 
During the Summit an important agreement was signed regarding the management and disposition of weapons-grade plutonium. Senator Domenici was instrumental in first identifying this issue and recommending a strategy for significantly reducing the amount of dangerous plutonium in the world and to make sure that it is kept away from rogue states and terrorists. Senator Domenici's suggestions were a blueprint for taking advantage of this opportunity for the United States and Russia to work together to withdraw approximately 50 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium from each countries' respective nuclear weapons programs. This is very important arms control/non-proliferation objective. The countries agreed to cooperate in transforming this weapons-grade plutonium into a form that cannot be readily used to make nuclear weapons. This agreement, when its terms are carried out, will make the world a safer place. 
I am pleased that the Senator from New Mexico represented the majority and the Senate at this United States-Russian Summit.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have failed. 
For the past nine months, I have worked with the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Administration to draft much needed reforms to our nation's hazardous waste program. These reforms would have made RCRA work more quickly and more cheaply. They would have removed the bureaucratic obstacles that hinder environmental cleanups. They would have given the states the proper authority and freedom they need to responsibly manage their RCRA sites. 
My colleagues, the Senate has failed to save the federal government $2 Billion this year in clean up costs. Despite our best efforts, agreement could not be reached on a bill to save two billion dollars per year. 
Early in this Congress, the General Accounting Office released a report highlighting the need for a legislative change in remediation waste policy. The Administration, states, stakeholders--even the EPA--agreed that only a legislative fix could adequately streamline the program and speed the pace of cleanups. This GAO report also said that a legislative fix would save the federal government $2 billion each year. 
Unfortunately, the Congress and the administration were unable to come to agreement on how to structure this legislative fix. Discussions among interested parties and legislators clearly showed the need for a bill, but translating this need into legislative language has been difficult. Progress was made, but not enough. 
And so, Mr. President, the next Congress is tasked with addressing this two billion dollar environment opportunity. Although I am truly disappointed that these many months of educating and negotiating have left us without a bill to champion, I am hopeful that the Senate will return to this issue with renewed vigor next year. 
I know that Senator Chafee, the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Smith, Chairman of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment Subcommittee, share my commitment to seeing meaningful RCRA reform enacted in the next Congress and will make it a priority. With this leadership, I believe that we can resolve the outstanding issues quickly and move forward with legislation that will indeed make the cleanup of contaminated sites smarter, faster and better. This is also true of those on the House Commerce Committee as well as many in the Administration. 
I was encouraged by the RCRA team built this year and look forward to working with this team again next Congress. 
I again want to stress that the RCRA reform goals have not changed. To make RCRA work more cheaply and quickly, to streamline the bureaucratic process and give more authority to the states and to speed site clean up. It is unfortunate that yet another year has passed without reform. 
Mr. President, let's make sure Congress gets the job done next year. The nation expects and deserves its RCRA sites to be cleaned up. This nation wants $2 billion in savings each year. I would like to thank my colleagues and their staffs for the work done this session and look forward to redoubled efforts in the 106th Congress.

Sunshine in government is a principle that enjoys broad support from both sides of the aisle as evident from the bipartisan support of the Freedom of Information Act and the 1986 Community Right to Know Law. While we all agree that this principle is important, the Senator from Alabama has correctly identified a major inconsistency--the public's lack of access to federally funded research data. Currently, there is no systematic government-wide process for the public to access research data supported by federal funds. Equally disturbing is the fact that this research data is often used to support major rulemakings. Because of Senator Shelby's interest in this issue, the Treasury, General Government Appropriations bill for FY 99 contains a requirement that the Director of OMB evaluate current government-wide procedures for making research data available to the public and report back to the Committee on the need for changes to existing procedures. My own view is that reform in this area is long overdue and I would like to commend Senator Shelby for his leadership to help rectify this matter and pledge to work with him and Chairman Campbell in Conference on final language to correct this problem as soon as possible.

Mr. LOTT. I commend the chairman of the Treasury-Postal Service Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee for the work he has done on this. It was a little bifurcated. We did work on it back before the recess, but he continued to work, working with his colleague from Wisconsin, and they produced a bill that I obviously believe has broad support. I thank them for their willingness to cooperate and go ahead and get this completed today. They have done good work, and I hope that they will get into conference early next week and have a conference report completed that we can send to the President in short order. 
So I thank them for their efforts and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for allowing us to get through this list of amendments we had and complete this legislation. 
Mr. President, I believe we are ready to go to a vote, but after the vote we will go into recess--temporary recess--so that we can hear, before the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, from Scott Ritter, a senior inspector of UNSCOM in Iraq. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I speak, I am sure, for the entire Senate in extending congratulations to Senator Thurmond, a great Senator from South Carolina, for having just cast his 15,000th vote in this Chamber. 
An occasion like this reminds us of the continuity and the stability which the framers of the Constitution sought to establish in the Senate. I am sure that they had Senator Strom Thurmond in mind when they sought that. In the person of Senator Thurmond their intent was most notably fulfilled. 
I am sure that if our distinguished President pro tempore were to ask which of those 15,000 votes he considers his most important, he would probably respond, even though I am sure he was proud of the vote he just cast, that the most important one is the next vote, for Strom always looks ahead. 
Today, we join him in looking ahead, not recounting the tremendous record that he sets with this vote and all the votes of the past but, rather, counting on his future votes for what is good and right for the country he has served so long. 
Madam President, this is a milestone. This is a magnificent gentleman who brings tremendous credit to his constituency, his State, to the U.S. Senate, and to America. I am very proud to call him a colleague and to commend him for this 15,000th vote he has just cast. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is to advise the Senate that Virginia's senior Senator, John Warner, is unable to make votes today because of work he is undertaking for the Senate Armed Services Committee. As second senior member of the committee, Senator Warner has met with senior U.S. military officials and government representatives in Bosnia, Serbia, and Macedonia. Senator Warner traveled to Sarajevo, Belgrade, Skopje, and Pristina in Kosovo. His travel and briefings included field visits as well. 
Senator Warner is compiling a first-hand assessment for the Armed Services Committee of the military and political situation in this troubled and war-torn region of the world. He is scheduled to return later today.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, we do have an amendment on which we are ready to vote. After brief remarks, I believe we will be prepared to go to a vote on that amendment. 
We will then go to the low-level waste compact between Texas, Maine and Vermont. I believe the vote will be on that tomorrow morning. There will be some time before the vote, but I believe it is 30 minutes equally divided, or I hope that will be the time for a recorded vote. 
Before we vote, though, I do want to urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. First, there is no treaty to monitor, and there will not be one in the foreseeable future. Until all 44 specified nations ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it will not enter into force. So to be providing funds before we have anything to monitor seems very questionable to me. 
We have not acted on this treaty. And certainly something of this magnitude should be given very serious, careful and extensive thought by the committee of jurisdiction and by the full Senate. We should not provide the funding that prejudges whatever the Senate may or may not do before it takes up the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
Beyond that, I have grave reservations, I admit, about whether the CTBT is in America's national interest. I am not convinced it is effectively verifiable. I am convinced it will limit our ability to maintain the safety and reliability of our vital nuclear deterrent. 
There are strong signs that India's decision to test nuclear weapons was, in part, a response to pressure to sign the CTBT. Ironically, the most tangible result of this treaty seems to be a nuclear arms race in Southeast Asia. So I just think this is not the time or the place to debate this treaty. Anything less than 67 votes in support of this amendment will send a strong signal that the Senate is prepared to reject this treaty. So I question even the proponents of the treaty wanting to do this at this particular time. 
Whatever the arguments for or against the treaty, putting millions in this organization does not make sense at this time. So I urge the defeat of this amendment. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. I believe we are prepared to go to the vote.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today I would like to share a few details about S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act. As you are well aware, Senator Ford and I co-authored and introduced S. 852 to protect the hundreds of thousands of American consumers who fall prey to unscrupulous auto rebuilders who conceal damage information from prospective car buyers. Equally important are the millions of us who share the roads with previously totaled automobiles and trucks sold as undamaged vehicles. This type of fraud is a national travesty that puts America's motorists and passengers in great peril. It can and must be stopped by this Congress.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is good to see you again, looking in good form. I welcome back all our Members and staff. I hope everyone had a peaceful and restful August recess. 
Now we will begin the final stretch of the legislative session of the 105th Congress, as we work to complete action on appropriations bills and a number of other important pieces of legislation. 
I think our goal should continue to be to keep our commitment to the budget agreement of last year, stick to the caps we agreed to, preserve the surplus, and see what we can do to return taxes to the people who have worked and earned those taxes. 
We have a number of other issues, obviously, that are very important--agriculture issues, education, bankruptcy reform. So we have a lot of work to do--missile defense, the defense of our country. I am very concerned, as I have said in writing to the President and my communications to the Pentagon. I am very worried that we are seeing a deterioration of the morale and the readiness of our military. Of course, there are many foreign policy issues that we will need to address--and all of this in only about 5 weeks or so. 
As a part of that, of course, this week we will take up the foreign operations appropriations bill. We expect to be on that issue Tuesday and Wednesday. We would like to finish it up Wednesday night if at all possible. We will have to count on the Members to work with us in trying to get identification of amendments that will be offered. 
I hope Senators will reduce the number of amendments that they are offering on these appropriations bills. In July, it seemed as if every appropriations bill had 100 amendments. It was difficult, on both sides of the aisle, to work through all those amendments. I hope we will have a limited number of amendments and can complete that work. 
For today, we will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following that, we will turn to the consideration of any legislative or Executive Calendar items that can be cleared for action. 
As a reminder to Members, there will be no rollcall votes today, but throughout the August recess I continued to hear from Senators, saying, `How about it, are we really going to work that first week in September?' The answer is absolutely yes. We are going to be working seriously Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. We will begin by having our first vote at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, on the adoption of the conference report to accompany the military construction appropriations bill. We expect Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday night, perhaps Wednesday morning, to have a vote on the low level waste disposal issue. And we expect votes on amendments with regard to the foreign operations appropriations bill. We could have votes on cloture or clotures before the week is over, and we could, of course, have votes if they are called for with regard to Executive Calendar items. 
I want to assure Senators, not only will we be having votes; I am going to make sure we have votes, probably more than normal, just to bring the point home clearly that Senator Daschle and I have kept our word to Senators this year. We told Senators in January this is when we will be in, having votes, and this is when we will be out. So far we have kept our word to the day on every one of those, both when we would be in and when we would be out. 
So this is going to be a busy week. I know it takes a little time to get up and running again after you have been gone for a few days or a few weeks, but it is important that we make progress this week. Of course, next week we will not be in session on Monday because that is Labor Day. 
I believe that is all I would have to say at this time, Mr. President. I look forward to meeting with leadership on both sides of the aisle this afternoon or tomorrow, and I will be talking to Senators about the need to be here and debate amendments and to have legislation prepared to be brought up for them. I do want to say that I expect to file a cloture motion on missile defense sometime soon, and I do expect to file a cloture motion, probably on Friday, with regard to bankruptcy reform. 
So those are two issues that will at least begin to be considered this week, even though we may not be able to complete them until next week. 
I yield the floor. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will have a period for morning business today. Following that, the Senate will turn to the consideration of any legislative or Executive Calendar items cleared for action. We are hopeful that some bills can be cleared by unanimous consent. I believe that last night we were able to move around some 20 nominations, plus military nominations, plus at least two or three bills. The Work Force Development Conference Report was one of those. I am glad we were able to move it quickly by unanimous consent. It is almost a shame to do it just in wrap-up because that is such a monumental achievement. We have been working on that legislation now for at least 3 years. We have had difficulty getting it through each body and through conference. But I believe the conferees did a fine job. 
I commend Senators Jeffords, DeWine, and all the Senators on both sides of the aisle that were involved in that. That consolidation of jobs training programs will allow us to get better use of the money we have, and a better program for workplace development is an important cog in our effort to improve our overall education opportunities, which should include job training. 
As we continue to move toward more and more people going off of welfare and into meaningful jobs, it means we have to continue to work and improve elementary and secondary education, higher education, as well as vocational education and job training. I believe that conference report will do that. I wanted to point out once again this morning what did occur last night. We will continue to try to move other agreed-to bills and conference reports of that nature. We do expect that we will move a number of nominations throughout the day. We may even have to wait a little while to get those agreements worked out or to see if there are others that may be coming out that could be cleared today. 
When the Senate returns from the August break, there will be two back-to-back rollcall votes at a time to be determined by the two leaders. Obviously, as we announced last night, there will be no recorded votes today. I know all the Senators already knew that, but I just wanted to confirm it again. As it stands now, we will have two votes when we return, either on August 31, or the 1st of September. The first one will be on the adoption of the Texas low-level waste conference report. There will be 4 hours of debate on that, equally divided, and then a vote. Then we will have a vote on the conference report to accompany the military construction appropriations bill, which will be broadly supported, probably 99-0 or 100-0. As is usually the case, if we don't vote on an appropriations bill when it goes through the Senate the first time, we do usually want to have a vote on the final conference report. 
Again, I thank all our colleagues for their cooperation over the last couple of weeks. I think we made some really good progress. We have cleared eight appropriations bills, and the ninth, Treasury-Postal Service is probably within 30 minutes or an hour of completion. I hope we will be able to do that the first week we are back. 
We do expect to take up other appropriations bills when we return. I don't know the exact order now, but we have the foreign operations appropriations bill, the Interior appropriations bill, the District of Columbia appropriations bill, and the Labor-HHS, Education appropriations bill. We expect, also, to take up the bankruptcy legislation that came out of the Judiciary Committee. And we do have the trade package from the Finance Committee. I will need to talk with all interested Senators about exactly when and how to schedule that. 
I wish all my colleagues a very restful and productive August break. We will look forward to seeing our colleagues then.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and commend the Members and staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee for their tireless work towards producing a targeted RCRA reform bill this Congress. 
Mr. President, what the Committee has undertaken is no easy task. Although the bill we are crafting only deals with a narrow part of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the drafting process has been a difficult and long road. RCRA is the most complex and technical environmental statute in existence, and to fix a piece of it, one must understand the whole. The Committee has spend many months educating themselves--and this determined effort is paying off. 
The majority and minority committee staff have been exchanging language and ideas in intense negotiations over the last several weeks. They are not debating principles, Mr. President, they are getting down to brass tacks. They are refining the language so that it reflects a consensus position on the issues. After all, we all agree--the Administration, the EPA, Republicans, Democrats and stakeholders--that RCRA needs to be fixed. The challenge now is putting the agreed-upon remediation waste reforms into legislative language. 
Mr. President, Congressional Republicans and Democrats are working with the Administration and the agencies as a team. Our team is closer than ever to producing a bill that is fiscally and environmentally responsible. Our team is on the brink on introducing a bill that will be embraced by Congress and the Administration. Our team is within striking distance of a win for everyone. 
The biggest winners, Mr. President, will be those affected by our bill. Industry, the states and the environmental community support our efforts towards reform because they know our goal is to speed up site cleanup and reduce agency bureaucracy. 
When setting out to craft a targeted RCRA remediation waste bill in 1996, this same team focused on three primary goals. Today, my goals and that of the team are still the same. 
First, I want to make RCRA work. I want it to work faster. I want it to work more cheaply. A RCRA reform bill is worthless if it does not clear these basic hurdles. 
Second, I want to remove regulations that are counterproductive to cleanup and streamline decision-making. This will give EPA the flexibility it needs to get the job done. Current law keeps the EPA from removing some of the largest obstacles to clean-up, and the only way to fix the problem is by fixing current law. 
Third, I want to give the states more authority over the management of these cleanup programs. States not only have the ability to do the job right, they have the resources and talent. These officials know how best to deal with the communities and counties impacted by the site and its cleanup. 
Mr. President, I believe we are on the way to a final product that keeps faith with these goals. 
I must take a moment now to commend the good work being done by the House Commerce Committee. Certainly the Senate could not have come so far so fast were it not for the efforts in the House. Our colleagues on the other side of the Capital have done a remarkable job, through stakeholder meetings and dialogs, to educate us all as to the potential implications of our actions. I know Senators Chafee, Smith, Baucas, and Lautenberg join me in commending the efforts of Chairmen Bliley and Oxley and their staff on this issue. 
Mr. President, environmental cleanup programs only work if sites are truly being cleaned up. With over 5,000 RCRA sites nationwide, our work is cut out for us. I look forward to returning to the Senate floor in September to join my Senate colleagues in introducing our RCRA remediation waste reform legislation--a first step towards an effective and responsible RCRA program. Thank you.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I join several of our colleagues in cosponsoring a bipartisan bill which will strengthen the manufactured housing industry. This legislation will benefit the fastest growing segment of the housing industry, while establishing a balanced process for the development, revision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety standards. This legislation also focuses on the consumer. 
In addition to announcing my cosponsorship, I want to pay tribute to Jerold Kennedy, a native Mississippian, entrepreneur, a business owner, and advocate for manufactured housing. Jerold championed reforms of the regulations controlling this segment of the marketplace. He worked for many years to advance legislation that would modernize the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Act of 1974. Today, I honor Jerold's efforts. S.2145 reflects those efforts, and Mr. Kennedy would be proud of S.2145. 
This segment of the industry, to which Jerold dedicated his life, plays a vital role in making affordable, unsubsidized housing available for a wide range of Americans. First time home buyers, single parents, and senior citizens are just a few groups who greatly benefit from manufactured housing. This industry is responsible for one out of every three single-family homes sold last year. One-third! For less than $40,000, millions of Americans can realize their dream of owning a home. This is an appealing alternative compared to the 5.3 million Americans who pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent. 
In order for this industry to sustain such phenomenal growth and make affordable housing available, it is necessary to update the laws which regulate this industry. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act (MHIA) will do just that, creating a process for keeping construction standards current, and enforcing the federal authority on those standards. S.2145 will be the first step in fixing the inadequacies which confront the manufactured housing industry today. 
This bill will also create a private consensus committee made up of all interested parties. They will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Recommendations which will serve as a valuable tool in revising the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in a timely manner. Additionally, this legislation will authorize HUD to use industry labeling fees to pay for any additional staff needed to do the new work. This user fee mechanism will remove a need for additional federal funding. 
This legislation pays tribute to Jerold Kennedy, who passed on before S.2145 was introduced. I want Mrs. Kennedy, and their three children, to know that Jerold's legacy lives within this bill. Jerold Kennedy founded Belmont Homes, Inc., and dedicated 28 years of his life to the manufactured housing industry. Congress owes a great deal to Jerold Kennedy. His common sense approach to update the standards which regulate the industry are the foundation of S.2145. I hope this Congress can make his dream a reality. This legislation pays tribute to a man of integrity. His honesty, trustworthiness, and professionalism helped both the profession of which he was a part and the efforts to reform its public policy. 
Mr. President, this legislation will address the recognized and acknowledged problems in HUD's manufactured housing program. S.2145 will provide real-world, viable solutions enabling the manufactured home industry to prosper, while providing consumers with even more benefits and protection.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had, obviously, extensive consultation about how to proceed to this point. There is disagreement about this particular amendment and how we can complete the Treasury-Postal Service and other related agencies appropriations bill at this time. 
In the interest of Senators to have time to work on the substance, what we have agreed to do is to set this bill aside--I will ask unanimous consent to that effect in a moment--and we would go on to the Department of Defense appropriations amendments and continue to work progressively, with the idea of finishing the Department of Defense appropriations bill as early as possible--hopefully, even tonight--which will allow us time to work on some nominations and allow Senators to attend the funeral tomorrow and adjourn for the recess at a reasonable hour tomorrow, or earlier if there is any way of doing it. 
I ask unanimous consent that the pending Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill be laid aside, not to recur prior to September 1, unless agreement is worked out in the meantime. There is hope that could be done. Maybe we could act on it after the DOD appropriations bill is completed. If not, it would be September 1. And no call for the regular order serves to displace the treasury bill, when it is pending in September, in the status quo.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will momentarily proceed to passage of the Department of Defense appropriations bill. 
But I can't let this moment escape without first commending the chairman, Senator Stevens, and his ranking member, Senator Inouye, for the unbelievable speed in which they have been able to handle this appropriations bill and bring it to a close. 
They are absolutely the best when it comes to knowing this legislation, and perhaps all legislation. I think they probably have set a record. But I think they did it in a way that was sensitive to all Senators' needs. And it took a lot of cooperation on both sides of the aisle. 
So I thank Senator Stevens. He set an example for all of us to follow. And the better part of wisdom was for me to get out of the way and let him do his job. He did a great job. I thank him, and I know that all Senators extend their thanks to him, and congratulations. 
Having said that, the Senate still must consider two additional items before I can announce the voting situation for the rest of the evening. 
Those items are the Emergency Farm Financial Relief Act, and legislation coming from the House relative to H-1B, the Nonmigrant Immigrant Program.

This is an issue that I am sure that all agriculture Members would very much like for us to get resolved. There is no budget impact. All it does is say that this allows farmers suffering from drought, El Nino, fire, and other natural disasters to begin considering and receiving emergency transition payments that they are entitled to under the Freedom to Farm Act. As a matter of fact, I understand that it will allow them to get these benefits in October rather than having to wait until January. I did it for a reason. 
If we don't get it resolved before we get to a final vote, then objections later on tonight would make it impossible for us to get any consideration. 
If the Senator would indicate to me that there is some idea that we could get this agreed to tonight, I would be glad to work with him like I always do. But the timing was such that we have to do it now in order to get it considered, or it could be objected to after Senators have gone, and we would not get it completed. 
I am trying to complete action so that we can go through a long list of Executive Calendar nominations, so that we could complete some more of them tomorrow. If we don't do these two issues now, they are basically gone until September. 
I thought that--I understood there was an objection, but that we had worked through that, and that we would not have any problem in getting this cleared. 
I had talked to Senators on your side of the aisle that have agriculture interests that indicated they would not object to this. 
If there is some problem that we could resolve right quick, I would be glad to withhold. But we need to try to get this resolved, because it is something that is very important timewise to the Department of Agriculture and to the farmers that have been affected by drought. 
We have worked this year on both sides of the aisle on the agriculture appropriations bill to get considerations for farmers that have been impacted by these disasters. This is just one way to do that. 
Since there is no cost factor involved, it just gives authority for this to be moved forward.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this comes as no surprise to Senators interested in agriculture on either side of the aisle. In fact, I did bring this subject up to Senator Daschle earlier today, standing right there. 
By the way, I have been working on amendments and Executive Calendar items while we have been having these last few votes. I have been talking to Senators on both sides of the aisle about nominations. I talked to Senator Dorgan who I know confers with Senator Daschle all the time about this particular unanimous consent request within the hour. 
I don't believe there is anybody on either side of the aisle surprised by this.

Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, we just discussed it a moment ago. 
If the Senator wants to object, he can go ahead and object. I think the implication here is that there is some sinister effort here. And it is certainly not true. This is something that is very noncontroversial. I don't know of any problem with it. I can't imagine why any Senator would object to it.

Mr. LOTT. With regard to his unanimous consent request, I have no idea of the ramifications of the unanimous consent request he just asked. I don't know what is involved there. We already passed the agriculture appropriations bill. There was action taken on that particular item. 
I would not be able to agree to that at this point without checking with Senators that have been involved in that legislation with that amendment. 
So there is no need in holding up the Senate any further. If the Senator wants to object, he can do so. 
I am going to also ask unanimous consent that he go ahead and move on the H-1B issue which has been worked out previously in conference by both sides of the Capitol by both parties. This is an issue that we need to get resolved. 
I thought that we had a reasonable resolution of the issue.

There is no effort to play games here. This is an effort to provide some help to the farmers who need it as soon as they can possibly get it. That is all there is to it.

I am either going to have to do it now or later tonight or tomorrow, when everybody else is gone. We wouldn't have been able to get this cleared, probably, tomorrow.

We will have other opportunities before the year is out to provide more help as we go through the conference.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the continuing efforts of Americans for Computer Privacy (ACP), a broad-based advocacy coalition, to energize the discussion now taking place in Washington on encryption. ACP has a role since they represent industry, private citizens and interest groups from all sides of the political spectrum. The computer industry believes, as do many members in both the House and Senate, that it is time to reform America's outdated encryption regime. Last week, an important step was taken when a multimedia campaign was launched to raise Congressional and public awareness on the encryption issue. This campaign includes television commercials, print media, and an online banner component with such statements as, `would you give the government the keys to your safety deposit box or home.' In the past few days, television commercials highlighting the need for encryption reform have appeared during Good Morning America, the Today show, Hardball, and Cross Fire. 
Mr. President, ACP has an impressive membership which includes such organizations as the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, the Louisiana Sheriff's Association, American Small Business Alliance, Americans for Tax Reform, Electronic Commerce Forum, Information Technology Industry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and over sixty technology companies. It's bipartisan advisory panel includes several intelligence and law enforcement experts such as former National Security Advisor Richard Allen, former NSA Deputy Director William Crowell, former CIA Director John Deutch, former FBI Director William Webster, and former San Jose Police Chief Joseph McNamara. This array adds credibility to their message. 
As you are well aware, encryption plays a significant role in our daily lives. This technology scrambles and unscrambles computer text to keep private communications from being read by unauthorized individuals such as hackers, thieves, and other criminals. Encryption protects private citizens credit card numbers when they buy something over the Internet, ensures that only authorized medical personnel can read a patients' medical records stored on a hospital database, shields tax information that we send to the IRS, and safeguards personal letters that we E-mail to loved ones. Encryption means that American companies can protect confidential employee information, such as salary and performance data; valuable trade secrets and competitive bidding information; and critical target market data. 
Encryption also benefits America's security by protecting our nation's critical infrastructures, like the power grid, telecommunications infrastructure, financial networks, air traffic control operations, and emergency response systems. Strong encryption thwarts infiltration attempts by computer hackers and terrorists who have destructive, life threatening intent. 
Yes, this is an issue that truly affects all Americans. 
By allowing a public policy that limits encryption to continue, we risk sending more potential U.S. business overseas. This approach only serves to harm America's economic and national security interest by encouraging criminals to purchase foreign made products now widely available with unlimited encryption strength. By contrast, the broad development and use of American encryption products should be advantageous to our law enforcement and intelligence communities. 
I must say that I am deeply troubled by the comments made by Commerce Under Secretary William Reinsch, head of the Bureau of Export Administration, in response to ACP's efforts. Apparently, Under Secretary Reinsch doubts that this initiative will work--that industry and privacy advocates are wasting their money. I disagree. This media campaign is rightfully educating the public about the importance of encryption in our every day lives. These advertisements make clear that encryption technology preserves our First Amendment right to freedom of speech and our Fourth Amendment freedom against unreasonable search and seizure. They illustrate that we need strong security to keep all Americans safe from infrastructure attack. And they explain that Americans and computer users everywhere must feel confident in the knowledge that their private information will remain private. Clearly, the development and use and strong encryption is critical if Internet commerce is going to grow to its full potential and sustain the economic engine that is driving this country into the 21st century. 
I believe this advertising campaign is yet another indication of industry's willingness and desire to find a reasonable solution to the encryption issue. Industry and privacy groups, for example, have been working in earnest with Administration officials for several months. In May, a proposed interim solution to the encryption issue was offered. The Administration responded that it would take five to six months to review the proposal. This reaction in conjunction with Under Secretary Reinsch's recent comments, lead many in Congress, from both sides of the aisle, to conclude that the Administration, despite what it has been saying publicly, does not want to see a balanced resolution before this Congress adjourns. 
Mr. President, I think it is also important to reiterate that the Administration's restrictions against U.S. encryption exports and its proposals to control domestic use just cannot work. Innovation in the high tech industry is relentless and ubiquitous. The government cannot stop it. It is for this reason that industry is trying to persuade the Administration that innovation is the solution to this issue, not the enemy. Two weeks ago, a coalition of thirteen companies proposed `private doorbells', a technology solution that would provide law enforcement with court approved access to computer messages. Clearly, industry leaders want to help officials capture criminals and terrorists. I believe the ideas they have put forward are reasonable and responsible. On the other hand, I do not believe the Administration's response has been forthcoming. Encryption policy can be modernized with the stroke of a pen, but the Administration has shown little willingness. Thus, industry takes appropriate action by implementing a media campaign. 
While encryption is a complex and divisive information technology issue, this media initiative reinforces the need for legislation to bring America's encryption policy into the 21st century. The national security and law enforcement communities have legitimate concerns that must be considered. I believe that the best way to deal with these concerns is to pass during this Congress legislation that strikes a balance on encryption. Legislation that would help keep private and corporate communications away from hackers, terrorists and other criminals, provide a level playing field for U.S. encryption manufacturers, and ensure Constitutional protections for all Americans. A number of my colleagues have been pushing for this type of reform for years and several competing encryption bills have been offered in both the House and Senate during this session. 
Mr. President, as you may recall, I engaged in a colloquy with my colleagues last week which reinforced the need for Congress to act during this session to break the impasse. This is a difficult issue, not easily explained or understood, but it is a crucial one. Momentum has been built in both the House and Senate toward finding a workable solution. Congress must seize upon these efforts and pass a consensus encryption bill now or risk starting all over during the next session. Congress has come too far on this issue to go back to the beginning. 
Americans need a sound and reasonable encryption policy that protects public safety, reinforces security, promotes digital privacy, and encourages online commerce and economic growth. Without the development and use of powerful encryption, we may bear the consequences of the next hacker's attack on the Pentagon's information network, a terrorist attack on the city's power supply, or a thief's attack on the international financial markets. 
With over $60 billion and over 200,000 jobs at stake by the year 2000, the House and Senate cannot continue to hope that the Administration will reach an amicable solution that satisfies the needs of all parties. I strongly encourage my colleagues to report out a balanced encryption bill that Congress can act on before the end of this session. Before it is too late.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill, I know there are amendments that are pending. They are trying to work out something on that. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to agree to reasonable time limits, and let's have a vote. But I am directing my remarks now more to other Senators who are not on the floor who may have amendments. 
We need to make it clear that we are going to finish this bill tonight. We should be able to be through by 6 o'clock. But we still have a number of amendments that have not been resolved and haven't been worked out, or accepted, or offered. 
We are going to have to just keep going. That could mean another late night. The managers of the bill would like cooperation to get this completed. But we are either going to be having votes at 11 or 12 o'clock, or we are going to agree to some process whereby we can finish the amendments that are still out there and get final votes on them in the morning in a stacked sequence. We can agree to that. But one of the things that is required is that Senators who do want to offer amendments have to come over here and offer them. 
I am going to talk with Senator Daschle. I believe that he will support me in supporting the managers. If at a certain hour tonight Senators have not offered their amendments and have not come over here to debate those amendments, we will go out of session, and all amendments that have been agreed to would be stacked in sequence if they have to have votes in the morning. 
Once again, while this week has been a difficult week because of the sadness we have all experienced, everybody has tried to be understanding of that, but now we are beginning to get back into the old routine. We have far too many amendments left on the bill that really shouldn't be that difficult to finish. 
I plead again with my colleagues to come over here and offer their amendments. Let's get an agreement on how we are going to handle them and get votes on those amendments. If we don't get amendments, I can force votes tonight at all hours of the night. I don't want to do that. But it is going to take some cooperation again. 
Mr. President, do we have an agreement on how to dispose of the present amendment? Do Senator Thompson and Senator Harkin have something worked out in terms of a time agreement on this, or do I just need to move to table everything right where we are?

Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle. 
We have, it looks like, probably no more than two amendments left on our side that might require a vote. With regard to one of the four you identified, I believe Senator Baucus has an amendment. We are working very hard to see if we can't get some agreement on that right now. 
For the information of Senators, with regard to schedule, we think the best thing to do is just keep going and not have a break for the mealtime because we think that actually might wind up wasting time. If we would stay on the floor and focus here, we could finish this by 8 o'clock and would be through with this bill and then could decide--Senator Daschle and I need to discuss further--then, exactly whether we are going to go to health care or go to the DOD appropriations bill. We could get on that tonight, and then that would be the final business for the week. 
We need your cooperation. When you do offer an amendment, agree to a short time so we don't have to go straight to a motion to table. We want everyone to have a chance to explain their case. With your cooperation, we can finish this at 8 o'clock. 
I also note there are some Senators who would like to be able to go to the funeral in the morning. If we could finish this at a reasonable hour tonight, we wouldn't have to have stacked votes in the morning. We tried very hard to not have a lot of late nights, but we are going to have to in order to finish this, but with your cooperation we could finish it in a couple of hours. 
I urge Members to do that. I thank Senator Daschle. Let's keep this working and see if we can't get this down to no more than two or three votes.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, I ask Senator Bingaman to allow Senator Daschle and I to bring up an issue we have been wanting to do, and also say we are working with a number of Senators to see how we might deal with this, see if it can be handled without having to go to a recorded vote. We need a few more minutes. In the meantime, Senator Daschle and I would like to do an exchange here with regard to a unanimous consent. 
Mr. President, we need to try to clear up what we are going to do for the balance of the week. Senator Daschle and I have been working, back and forth, since the middle of June, trying to come to a unanimous consent agreement on how to handle the health care Patients' Bill of Rights issue. We have had a number of suggestions back and forth. We have not been able to come to agreement. There are ways that legislation could be brought to the floor anyway. But I am sure there would be objections if it were done in a way where there could not be amendments or, from this side, if there were unlimited amendments. But we need to try to see that there is one final opportunity for us to get a way to bring up the health care issue. 
I ask unanimous consent the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, shall turn to S. 2330 regarding health care. I further ask, immediately upon its reporting, Senator Nickles be recognized to offer a substitute amendment making technical changes to the bill, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer his Patients' Bill of Rights amendment, with votes occurring on each amendment with all points of order having been waived. 
I further ask that three other amendments be in order on each side, for a total of six, to be offered by each leader or their designees, regarding health care. Following the conclusion of debate and following the votes with respect to the listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed to H.R. 4250, the House companion bill, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 2330, as amended, if amended, be inserted, and the Senate proceed to vote at no later than 3 p.m. on Friday, July 31. 
To sum up, what I am asking is we would have debate on the two underlying bills, six amendments, three on each side, and of course the votes that would be ordered as a result of that, and finish, then, by 3 on Friday, the 31st. I think we could have a good debate, have some votes, and complete that debate. 
I further ask that following the vote, the Senate bill be returned to the calendar.

Mr. LOTT. That would be our concern, then. There would be no way of knowing how many amendments or how long it would go on. 
As the Senator knows, this year we have attempted some bills and we never could quite bring them to a conclusion. I really want to be able to get the Senate to actually vote on a bill that goes to conference. I believe Senator Daschle wants that, too. I am afraid, if we just go into it with relevant amendments with no limits--we only had 18 amendments, as I recall, on the tobacco bill. We stayed on that for 4 weeks. We only have 5 weeks and 2 days left, so I don't think we could do that. 
Let me say to Senator Graham, I know he and others are working on another bill. What we could do, we do have, under my proposal, three amendments on each side. We could make their substitute one of those three amendments. I presume that would be what we would probably do on our side, if there is one that is developed as an alternative. 
 Alternatives would have an opportunity under that proposal. 
Since we couldn't get any kind of guarantee that we will get it to a conclusion, I have to object to the addition that Senator Daschle proposed.

I remind our colleagues, it is a quarter till 7. I can't think of any profound statement that can be made that will take 30 minutes that will affect one iota the vote or its outcome. If the Senators will be willing to yield some of that time, that will be very helpful.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am continuing to struggle to try to get a finite list of amendments. I think we have that. I know a number of these amendments will be worked out, will be included in the managers' package. I have discussed this arrangement and this list with the chairman of the subcommittee, the ranking member, and with Senator Daschle. I believe this is the best way to get this to a conclusion that would be fair to one and all. 
Again, I do note, before I make that unanimous consent request, that we do have some Senators who are going to represent the entire body at the funeral in the morning. So we are trying to go ahead and take up the Department of Defense appropriations bill first thing in the morning, lay it down at 9 o'clock, and then any stacked votes would occur at 1 o'clock. 
To renew the bidding, in the earlier unanimous consent agreement, we have lined up for consideration the McConnell amendment for 30 minutes, the Glenn amendment for 30 minutes, and the Harkin amendment for 30 minutes; Harkin with regard to drug control, the other two with regard to FEC. 
I now ask unanimous consent that no further first-degree amendments be in order other than the list agreed to earlier this evening and the below-listed amendments, and they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments: Graham relevant amendment, managers' package; DeWine regarding Customs; Domenici regarding FLETC; Stevens relevant amendment; Senators Daschle and Lott--one relevant each; Conrad regarding high-intensity drug areas; Dorgan regarding an advisory commission; one by Graham; Harkin and Bingaman--all three on the high-intensity drug issue. I hope they could work those out or roll them into one or something of that nature; Kerrey regarding sense of the Senate; and a Kohl managers' amendment. 
I further ask all amendments must be offered and debated tonight and the votes be postponed to occur at 1, if any are needed, on the amendments. And, of course, final passage on Thursday, and that they occur in stacked sequence with 2 minutes for debate at that time before each vote for closing remarks, and that following those votes the bill be advanced to third reading. 
I further ask that if the motion relative to the Graham motion to reconsider is not tabled, the underlying amendment and motions be limited to unlimited debate.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to say to the managers that I don't think we should have a lengthy debate this afternoon on this subject. It is one that I could see us spending hours or days on, because there is plenty to talk about. But we need to continue to make an effort to move our appropriations bills. 
I know the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Treasury and Postal Service, the Senator from Colorado, would like to do that. He and the ranking member from Wisconsin are working hard. But I want to give a few remarks briefly in support of this amendment. I have stayed away from doing that on amendments on appropriations bills because I have been discouraging amendments all along the line. But this is one I feel strongly about. 
It is also very hard for me to rise in support of an amendment of this nature when the chairman of the Finance Committee is expressing his reservations. But it is totally understandable. He wants to make sure that when we do it, we do it right, and that we develop another tax system that we have thought about. He is doing what you would expect a cautious chairman to do. He takes a back seat to none of us when it comes to finding ways to make the Tax Code fairer and giving tax relief to the American people. 
Having said that, I think we ought to do it. There is plenty of time here to think about what the alternative is going to be. Four and a half years--how long does it take? I will tell you how long it will take--forever, unless we make up our minds on behalf of the American people. With their support, we are going to make this happen. We are going to do it. 
Others have pointed out what we are talking about. Here it is, Mr. President. This is the Internal Revenue Code. 
The copy I have here is about 7,000 pages long in very small type. Frankly, that is absurd. This Tax Code contains the accumulation of 85 years of special interest provisions--your special interest, my special interest, somebody else's special interest, but it has become a hodgepodge. It is not understandable. It makes no sense. It is not simple. It is not fair. It is hopeless. We ought to start over and try to get it right and make it fairer and simpler. 
It has become, quite frankly, a three-headed monster, and we have to cut off all three heads. We are working on two of those. One, you cut off the head of unfairness and try to provide some of the tax relief that really is needed by allowing families with children to keep more of their money, as we did last year; by moving to eliminate the death tax, as we started on last year; by hopefully getting started seriously phasing out as soon as possible the marriage penalty tax this year. We are doing some things that make it fairer and even a little simpler, and we will continue to do that. We should do some more of it this year and some more the next year. We should do some of it every year. 
The second head is intimidation--the culture, the problems at IRS that we saw that have developed over the years since the last time we reformed the IRS Code way back in 1952. Well, this year we got it done. It took us almost a year, but we did get fundamental reform and restructuring done. That was the second head that we were able to chop off and deal with. 
But the third one is to terminate this Tax Code, do it in a responsible way. It won't terminate until December 31, 2002. Plenty of time to decide. 
When I go to my own State and I ask people: What do you think about the Tax Code? They react negatively. And I say: How many of you think we should eliminate it? Every hand, every hand goes up. Then you start saying, OK, what are we going to replace it with? We have got time to go to the people in Wisconsin and Colorado and ask their opinion. 
Let's think this thing through. Let's do it right. But let's make it clear, let's make it undeniably clear we are going to do it. This is the way to do it. 
Some people say, well, gee, unless you have a plan in place, you shouldn't do this. Well, in Michigan, the great State of Michigan, a big State, they eliminated the property tax without a replacement because they knew that the deadline would force their legislature to act on a replacement. And they did. Wisconsin--Wisconsin--created a deadline for abolishing its welfare system, and it drove the reforms that have worked in that State probably better than any other State, at least from what I understand. 
This will guarantee that we get it done. I think we should pass the termination date, and I think we should make ourselves live by that date. We should move toward making decisions, and we should fundamentally reform our Tax Code. It is overdue. It is the third head of this monster that must be removed so that the American people can be free, free of the oppression that we have developed over these 85 years in this Tax Code. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.  
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere appreciation to Senator Warner for his unique and untiring dedication to increasing recycling in America. 
Each of us has heard from our constituents about the importance of recycling and how current law is hindering efforts to improve the environment through a viable recycling industry. Through his dedicated efforts, Senator Warner has made sure that recycling equity has not been overlooked as the Senate addresses the many conflicting and contentious environmental issues our Nation faces. In the 103d, 104th and 105th Congresses, Senator Warner forced the debate over Superfund to recognize how recycling benefits America's environment and economy. I look forward to working with the senior Senator from Virginia and my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the issue of recycling equity before the end of this Congress. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing appreciation to Senator John Warner for his leadership on this matter. He deserves our gratitude for his understanding, dedication and commitment to the cause of recycling equity.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I remind all Senators that we will be recessing from 11:55 a.m. until 12:15 p.m. so that the Senate may proceed as a body to the Rotunda to pay our proper respects to the two fallen U.S. Capitol policemen and their families. The Senate will recess again today from 2:45 p.m. until 3:45 p.m. so Members may attend the memorial service for these two heroes. 
With regard to the Senate's schedule this morning, the Senate will resume consideration of the credit union bill, with 15 minutes for debate remaining on the Shelby amendment regarding small business exemptions. At approximately 10 a.m; the Senate will proceed to vote on, or in relation to, the Shelby amendment. Following that vote, it is the hope that the Senate will move quickly to final passage of the credit union legislation. 
For the remainder of today's session, the Senate may begin consideration of the Treasury appropriations bill, health care legislation, or other appropriations bills or conference reports as available and after consultation with the leadership on both sides of the aisle. Therefore, Members should expect votes throughout today's session and into the evening as the Senate attempts to complete its work prior to the August recess. 
I want to emphasize something here, too. The plan has been we would spend Friday afternoon on the credit union bill, and we would have votes Monday afternoon late, and this morning we would vote on the Shelby amendment and go to passage. I understand the managers are not sure they are ready to do that, or other people are showing up with amendments. I discourage amendments. Senators had an opportunity Monday afternoon and Friday afternoon to offer amendments, and to show up now and say, `Oh, by the way, I have another amendment,' I think, is not helpful in trying to get done what we agreed to and move our schedule along. 
Let's have the final debate on the Shelby amendment and let's vote and move to passage of this legislation, and then go to an appropriations bill. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal trespass action pending in the Court of General Sessions for Sullivan County, Tennessee. The case involves an incident at Senator Fred Thompson's Blountville office in which an individual refused to leave the premises and was arrested by public safety personnel for trespassing. The State is seeking testimony from the Senator's caseworker who has knowledge of these events. 
This resolution would authorize the caseworker to testify, except where a privilege should be asserted, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate later on today will adopt an appropriate resolution. It will be a joint resolution, House and Senate. We will confer with the leaders of both bodies on both sides of the aisle as to the appropriate time to have that vote, and we are reviewing the language at this time. 
In addition to that, we will resume consideration later on today of the credit union bill which was debated last Friday. I understand that Senator Hagel will be present later on to offer his amendment regarding credit union loans. Senator Shelby is tentatively scheduled to offer his amendment at about 3:30. 
By previous consent, a rollcall vote with respect to the Gramm amendment will occur at approximately 5:30, or shortly thereafter, but not later than 5:45. It is also hoped that we will vote in relation to the Hagel amendment immediately following that vote, and therefore two stacked votes are expected at around 5:30 this afternoon, with the possibility of one other. 
After the Senate completes consideration of the credit union bill, it will move to available appropriations bills. We have three or four that could be available this week. Health care legislation is on the agenda for the week, plus any conference reports that become available and any legislative or executive items, and we do expect, because of the cooperation we received on appropriations bills, we will be able to move a number of Executive Calendar nominations this week. This is the final week prior to our August recess period, when we will have an opportunity to go to our respective States, so I know our days and nights will be quite busy. It is necessary we do that to complete our work. 
I thank all Senators in advance for their cooperation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their attention to these resolutions. I am pleased that we are going to have an appropriate memorial ceremony tomorrow to honor these two fallen policemen. They represent the very best of those that serve our country and work with us in the Senate, from our personal staffs, to the floor staff, to the officers of the Senate, to the policemen, the people throughout these Capitol buildings. 
They certainly did their job last week, and the country and we owe them a personal debt of gratitude. As I said this morning when we opened the Chamber, we see them every day. And we get to know them personally. They are part of our family. And I have sensed today that every Senator and every person I have talked to has a sense of deep sympathy and sorrow for this event. 
We will take every precaution to make sure that the Capitol is secure, but that it remains the people's body and the people have access to it. I also have asked Senator Daschle to join me in designating a Senator on both sides to make sure that in fact, the officers' families are appropriately cared for so that we can take a look at what benefits they are entitled to and what happens with their memorial fund. We will make a decision and we will report to the rest of the Senate about how to proceed in that area if there is a need for it. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I want to advise my colleagues on the implementation of the one-call notification (`call-before-you-dig') law. This legislation, which was enacted into law as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21), has taken almost three Congresses to complete. However, this Congress was able to accomplish the goal, thanks to bipartisan support and lots of cooperation among the affected entities: pipeline, telecommunications, cable and electric utility companies, state one-call systems and numerous others of good will. 
Last week the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety announced a public meeting will be held on August 25-26. The purpose of this meeting is to begin organizing a process to collect information on the suggested `best practices' in one-call notification. All affected parties--underground facility operators, excavation contractors, railroads, one-call centers, states and municipalities--should participate in this meeting which will be a joint government-industry effort to bring together the best information on one-call notification practices, techniques, technologies and enforcement processes. Information on these best practices would then be shared among the various state one-call programs, in order to improve performance. The ink is barely dry on the law, and already implementation rulemaking has begun. This is great because this is all about the public's safety. 
This is enlightened federalism: the federal government working together with the states and the private sector to mutually decide how to protect our nation's vital underground infrastructure. The federal government does not dictate to state and local governments, nor does it try to fit private companies into some prescriptive regulatory scheme. That never works. Results come by working together. 
I congratulate the Senate Appropriations Committee for including a modest but sufficient amount of support for implementing the one-call bill in the FY 1999 Transportation Appropriations bill. I hope the House appropriators will follow this lead and an agreement can be reached in conference for funding to be available in the coming fiscal year. 
The one-call bill, which was enacted into law, provides that general revenues are to be used to improve our one-call systems. Realizing there is such a long list of beneficiaries from better one-call notification, this is only fair. I expect the appropriations process to reflect this principle of fairness and to fund this program from general revenues. 
We have all seen the tragedies and near tragedies that can occur when accidents happen at underground facilities. These accidents are preventable, and this law provides the surest way to present these accidents. I urge all affected parties to join in participating in the August 25-26 meeting to begin the cooperative, responsible process envisioned in the one-call law. 
Mr. President, I promised my good friend, former Senator Bill Bradley, when he left the Senate that his colleagues would continue the legislative effort to enact a one-call notification bill. This was accomplished this year. The terrible 1994 accident in Edison, New Jersey, showed Congress the kind of accident which must be prevented. Now a law has been enacted that can do the job. Let's continue to work together to carry it out.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we had considered doing the memorial resolution between these votes, but we decided, after discussion with Senator Daschle, the most appropriate thing would be to go to this next vote and then have the memorial resolution read. 
I would like to ask Senators to remain in the Chamber and take their seats so that we can hear this memorial resolution. It is not that long, but it is very appropriate. I think the Senators will like to hear it. Perhaps at that point Senator Daschle, who was not able to speak this morning, will want to make a statement, and others, and then we will go on to other issues. 
I also want to remind Senators that at 11:50 tomorrow morning, Senators are asked to assemble in the Chamber. We will recess at that time to go en bloc to the Rotunda to pass through and around the coffins of the officers that will be there in the Rotunda. We will be back then at about 12:15, and we will go forward with legislative business. Then again tomorrow afternoon, at approximately 2:30, we will go for the memorial services beginning at 3 o'clock with the President and the Vice President in the Rotunda. 
I just wanted Senators to be aware of that. So we will have the resolution read. We would like to ask you to stay, if you can, immediately following this vote. This next vote will be the last recorded vote tonight, although we may try to move to an appropriations bill. This will be the last vote tonight. The next vote will be in the morning at 10 o'clock on the Shelby amendment, followed by final passage on the credit union issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to extend our appreciation to the Chaplain for his prayer for these two fine Capitol policemen and friends that we have lost. 
I would like to ask that we take another moment of silence to remember them, and to say our personal word of prayer for their family and friends.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what happened in the Capitol last Friday afternoon was a tragedy for our Nation. But for all of us here it was something more. It was a death in the family. 
We work here every day together, as Senators and as officers of the Senate, staff members, pages, policemen. We see them, and we pass them, over and over again. We talk to them. Some of them we get to know quite well. 
I have had the occasion myself to develop a very personal relationship with the man that was my security detail when I was the whip in the House, a man named George Awkward. He did for me what John Gibson did for Tom DeLay as the whip in the House. We got to be very personal friends. He had pizza at night, when we would get home late, with my wife and with me and my children. 
So I know how much these men and women put their lives on the line, and how much they mean to us on an individual basis, but also how far too often we walk past them; we take them for granted; we don't realize that they really are there for a very important purpose--protection of our constituents and of all of us and of this magnificent building in which we serve. 
Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut were members of our congressional family. They died defending us. 
They died defending this Capitol building, this temple of law, where armed violence is a sacrilege against our democratic institutions. 
So much has been said in their praise, and yet we need to say more. 
So much has been offered in their honor, but we still look for ways to express our admiration, our gratitude, and most of all, our sorrow. 
We search for words to comfort their families, and it is not easy to find them. Some losses stay with us forever. 
But far more important than our words and our condolences is the assurance of Scripture, that our Chaplain just gave--that `greater love than this has no man, than that he lay down his life for his frinds.' 
That is what the speaker of those words did, almost 2,000 years ago, and that is what officers Chestnut and Gibson did 3 days ago. 
In fact, it is what they were ready to do every day of their career, every day when they left their homes and loved ones knowing that they could face a deadly peril in their daily routine. 
We do not think often enough of the quiet bravery it takes for officers like those two--the men and women who come to work, here at the Capitol and in communities throughout the country, knowing that this might be the day they encounter mortal danger in the course of their duties. 
In my own area of the country--the gulf coast of Mississippi--we recently lost a policeman in the line of duty in Long Beach, MS, and it made an indelible mark on that community and on our whole region. 
Senators have already been informed that Officers Chestnut and Gibson will lie in state tomorrow in the great Rotunda of the Capitol. 
This is an extraordinary honor that we are paying to them. In the past only Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, and generals like Pershing and MacArthur, former Senator Pepper, have lain in repose in the Rotunda. But I think it is appropriate that these two men, who gave their lives just down one flight of stairs defending that room always packed with constituents, would have this moment to be honored the way they deserve in that room. 
There will be times throughout the day for Members and staff and the general public to pay their respects to these two men to say a prayer, to consider how much we owe these fallen colleagues and their families and all those like them throughout the country. 
It is important to note that the public will be welcome in the Capitol during that time, and welcome to join us in our solemn tribute in the Rotunda, with the exception of only one hour in the afternoon where there will be a private opportunity for Members of Congress to observe and to pay our respects to these men. 
It is most fitting that the public, our constituents from all over the country and all over the world, should be there with us, as they will be, for Officers Chestnut and Gibson and their colleagues were defending them, too. 
I can understand the wish in some quarters to make the Capitol absolutely impregnable, or even to close it to the general public so that nothing like this could ever happen again. We will, of course, examine closely all of our security procedures again as we continue to do almost daily to see whether anything can be done to improve it. But we have to keep in mind that this Capitol is, more than any other edifice in the country, and certainly I believe in the world, the people's house. 
When I walk out of my majority leader's office and take three steps, I am standing with constituents from all across America. They are there every day. Sometimes they seem surprised that they would see Senators and Congressman walking amongst them. But that is the way it should be. This building is accessible and it amazes our visitors, domestic and foreign, many of whom have had chance encounters with Members of Congress, the President's Cabinet, in the halls, in the dining rooms, in the elevators. The reason the Capitol is so open is that our society is so open. 
We pride ourselves on that fact. 
The people's access to their Capitol is the physical manifestation of democracy. It represents something rare and precious, something all Americans take for granted. It represents the bond between those in high office and those who put them there. It represents, in short, our freedom. 
For that freedom, throughout our history, men and women have been willing to stand guard, to fight if necessary, and to die on many fields in many places in the world. 
They have done all that to protect their homes, to shield their loved ones, and to preserve their Nation. Some of those brave individuals are memorialized in the Capitol itself in statues of bronze and marble. They stand among us, mute but strangely eloquent about the price of liberty. 
Tomorrow, amid those grand statues of heroes past, we will honor two of our own to whom heroism was simply duty. For those two, for Officers Jacob Chestnut, affectionately known as J.J., and John Gibson, this open Capitol, with wide-eyed kids learning the Nation's history, with strangers from abroad awed by its grandeur, with Americans of all creeds and races and religions celebrating their common faith in God, and in one another, this Capitol itself will be their enduring monument.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we would have to begin those votes a little earlier than that, probably at 5:30. It would be partially driven by how many votes we have. If we just had one vote lined up, for instance, we could begin about 5:45. If we have two or three, we would have to begin at 5:30 in order to get the voting sequence completed by 6:30. 
So that is what we are up against. We are trying to accommodate Senators coming in late and Senators who have to leave after 6:30. But the hope is that you would have two or three amendments ready to be voted on Monday afternoon beginning around 5:30, with the understanding that if we need to hold that first vote a little while for Senators coming in with a close plane connection, we would be prepared to do that, and then have the vote probably on the Shelby amendment and final passage Tuesday morning at 9:30. 
I discussed that with Senator Daschle, and he and I worked on trying to accommodate Senators' schedules on all sides. I believe, if you could go ahead and get debate on all amendments today and Monday, then we could have one or two or three votes Monday afternoon, sometime between 5:30 and 6, probably not later than 5:45, and then the last two votes Tuesday morning.

Once again, I know we have had to work late, but we have made good progress on the appropriations bills. This is a good bill. But I still think the Senate should work during the day and be home with their families at night. That is a novel idea that I still advocate, so I am going to be with my wife eating supper Monday night at 7 o'clock. Good luck before then. But we will try to accommodate everybody, including my favorite lady in the world.

Mr. LOTT. I give myself such leader time as I might use. I will be brief, because I know Members are expecting to vote right away. 
But I rise to speak against the Craig amendment. I have a long history of being interested in and concerned about the rights and guarantees that we have given Indian tribes. We have one in my home State that has been very industrious. They are really good entrepreneurs and good citizens. I enjoy working with them very much. But this is something beyond that. This would give them ability to get into Internet gambling in a way that it could go into every school and every home all across America. 
This is not about tribal rights on their reservation or within their tribal areas. This goes across America. To have a special carve-out for Indian tribes on gambling, I think, is just a fundamental mistake. 
I understand why the Senator from Idaho feels he must do that. I understand that there have been some court actions about it. But I also think there is a fundamental principle here. And this violates that principle. They should not be given an opportunity that nobody else in America would have. It touches all Americans. 
I am always hesitant to rise in opposition to my friend and my coleader in the Republican Party. But I think in this instance he is just fundamentally wrong. 
I urge colleagues to vote against the Craig amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. I would like to say to the Senator that we would be glad to agree to have this debate and go forward with the Patients' Bill of Rights issue. I would like to begin thinking in terms of what we could work out as a unanimous consent agreement. Going back to June 18, originally it was suggested that Senator Kennedy's bill be up and we have an alternative, and that we have a good debate and vote. That is fine. Let's do that. Then I suggested, well, if we could get some time agreements on when we could complete it, with some limited amount of amendments, we could do that. I don't think 40 would be considered reasonable. 
But I am saying to the Senator that I would like to work something out. I am hoping that next week, Wednesday or Thursday, we are going to get to this and get it done before we go home for the August recess period. 
I just want to say that we are ready. We would like to do this. Beginning next week, I am going to start asking unanimous consent requests to actually get it done, because we are ready to go to a vote. But we also have other things. And Senator Kennedy has been cooperative. We have been working to get issues done. We need to try to do that and allow time for a full and fair debate on this issue. We would be glad to do that. 
I just wanted to make sure he was aware that we are willing to do that.

It would help us be prepared to move on to other appropriations bills and be able to get out of here as scheduled next Friday.

Mr. LOTT. I know the hour is beginning to get late and Members would like to know what they can expect tonight. We do have a list of amendments that the managers are working on right now. I believe most of those are going to be resolved without the necessity of extended debate, or even a vote. We should know in another 15 minutes or so exactly what that would be. I hope there won't be more than one or two amendments that require some time. 
Our intent would be to do those amendments that are necessary and final passage, and then Senator Daschle and I would like to go to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. Senator Coats and Senator Lieberman have an amendment that they are prepared to debate tonight, discuss tonight, and we hope to have all debate on that and other amendments, but the vote on the amendments and final passage we would propose would be done then Monday night at 5 o'clock in order to accommodate one of the managers. 
Tomorrow, while we will have a vote or two early in the morning, we will go to the credit union bill early in the morning. There are not expected to be any recorded votes on the credit union bill in the morning. 
So in summation, if we could get cooperation on the transportation bill, we could wrap that up here relatively shortly and that would be the final vote tonight, if the Members would cooperate with us. 
Senator Daschle has been working to get this amendment list identified. He agrees that this would be a good approach. The Members would have a decent night tonight, and we would be able to wrap up early in the morning and then go to the credit union bill. 
I ask Senator Daschle if that is his thinking on this process at this time.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the managers of the legislation are trying their best to move this bill along. Senator Daschle and I have been working trying to keep extraneous amendments off of this bill, amendments that are not really related to it, strictly legislating on this appropriations bill. We have had some success over here, and, obviously, there has been an effort and success on the Democratic side. As usual, the longer we go, the longer the list of amendments. We need to get some finite list of amendments and work on this bill to get it completed. 
It is my intent, after discussion with Senator Daschle and the managers, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, that we complete this bill tonight and that we have votes tonight, as late as is necessary. 
Everybody needs to know that this is not going to be a night where we all leave at 7 o'clock and the managers try to make things happen and nothing happens. We are going to be voting into the night. If it takes going to 11, 12 or 1 o'clock, I think it is time we have to do that in order to complete this work. 
In that vein, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only remaining list of first-degree----

Mr. LOTT. We are ready to go. We have our bill. I think we have a good bill. Senator Kennedy has his bill. I would like for us to just have a vote on his bill and a vote on our proposal. I understand that you feel you have solutions we need in this area. We feel very good about our bill. 
The problem has been last week, for instance, it was suggested, `Well, we will need 40 amendments.' If we have these bills that have just been sent down on both sides, why don't we vote on what we have instead of going on for days and weeks trying to reach a conclusion? 
Having said that, Senator Daschle and I have continued to talk to try to narrow down exactly when would be the best time to do it. We are talking about how we can get an agreement with which both sides can be satisfied. Obviously, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, wants to be involved in what the final unanimous-consent request will be, and a lot of Senators on this side, including Senator Gramm, will have an interest in it. 
I think we can come up with a reasonable proposal. I have been sending proposals since June 18, for a month. I continue to say, `OK, how about this?' And Senator Daschle has responded. I know he is negotiating in good faith. Both of us have a difficult time trying to satisfy Senators on both sides of this issue on both sides of the aisle, but we are narrowing them. 
If we can get an agreement to a time certain that it will come up, with a couple of days for debate and for discussion of amendments or a limited number of amendments on both sides, that will be perfectly reasonable. But I know of no bill in the history of mankind that needs 40 or 50 or 70 amendments. Why do we want to go through that process? A reasonable number can be agreed to. 
All I have to say is, just say yes. We are ready to do what the Senator from Massachusetts asked for a month ago. You get a vote, we get a vote and we move on. Yes; just say yes, we will do that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the Senators are trying to get some idea of how this will go from here on. I have been working with Senator Daschle. 
Mr. President, we have four more votes in this stacked sequence, which will take us a good portion of the next hour. We are trying to work an agreement whereby we would then, at the conclusion of this series of votes, go back to the Kyl amendment and have the debate on that concluded tonight, with a vote occurring at 9 in the morning. Then we would get an agreement that all other amendments and final passage occur by noon tomorrow. 
I think that is reasonable. Senator Daschle is working with me to see if we can get everybody to agree to that. We are trying to find a way to give you some reasonable night tonight and get this to a conclusion. I do not want to prejudge amendments that are being offered, but I really think we have reached a point where we need to get a conclusion. If we do not put an end to it, it will go on and on and on, on this bill. The alternative is to go back to Kyl and vote on that and to have other votes. I still have the luxury of going to the Executive Calendar, if all else fails, and have some votes on that. 
We need cooperation so Senators can make progress so the rest of us can get a decent night's sleep and so we can complete this bill tomorrow. I am not going to ask that right now, to give both of us time to work with those who have amendments, but I think that is a very reasonable arrangement, so I hope all of our colleagues will help us by talking to other colleagues who might have amendments, and I hope we can get this worked out by the next vote. 
I yield the floor.

I ask unanimous consent that following the next vote, the Senate resume the pending Craig amendment to the Kyl amendment and a vote occur on or in relation to the Craig amendment at 9:15 on Thursday, with 10 minutes equally divided for closing remarks prior to the vote. 
I further ask that following the vote in relation to the Craig amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Kyl amendment, as amended. I further ask, following the Kyl amendment, the following amendments be the only amendments to be offered to the pending legislation other than the managers' amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order, and limited to the times, where specified, all to be equally divided.

I would like for Senators to work during this vote. We cannot tell you this is the last vote now. So you are not going to be able to vote and leave unless we can get something worked out very quickly.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be happy to withdraw this action just taken if the Senator from California would be willing to agree to the following consent, which I will now propound. This consent would allow for a vote in relation to the Craig gun safety issue as well as the Boxer trigger lock issue. I hope the Senator would consider and would agree to the consent. 
I ask unanimous consent, then, that the pending Boxer second-degree amendment be withdrawn and the motion to commit be withdrawn and the first-degree amendment be laid aside and Senator Craig be immediately recognized to offer a first-degree amendment relative to gun safety. 
I further ask that there be 90 minutes for debate on both the Boxer and the Craig amendments combined, to be equally divided between Senators Craig and Boxer, with no second-degree amendments in order to either amendment, and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Craig amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on or in relation to the Boxer amendment.

Mr. LOTT. If I might say to the Senator's objection, I think this is a fair way to consider this issue. The Senators have time to state their position on both sides of the issue and we could then come to a vote on both of them. My effort here is to try to get it set up in that way where each side gets a fair vote, each side gets a fair time to debate it. I hope the Senator will give consideration to that. If the Senator likes, until we can decide exactly how we might proceed, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate pauses to recognize Senator Jeff Sessions, who has now presided over the Senate for one hundred hours during the 105th Congress. It is a long-standing tradition in the U.S. Senate to award these members with the golden gavel. 
Since the 1960's, the golden gavel has served to mark a Senator's 100th presiding hour and continues to represent our appreciation for the time that these dedicated members contribute to presiding over the U.S. Senate--a very important duty. 
With respect to presiding, Senator Sessions and his conscientious staff have worked to assist with presiding difficulties when scheduling difficulties arose. 
It is with sincere appreciation that I announce to the Senate the latest recipient of the Golden Gavel Award--Senator Jeff Sessions.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I know there may be a couple of statements by the managers of the bill. I thank them for the work they have done. They stayed here until about midnight last night. 
The distinguished chairman from Missouri and ranking member, Senator Mikulski from Maryland, have done outstanding work. By staying here until midnight last night, they completed a bill that probably would have taken 2 full days next week, so I congratulate them for their good work. We just passed the HUD-VA appropriations bill. That is the fourth appropriations bill this year. 
We will next proceed to the legislative appropriations bill. However, no further votes will occur during today's session. Because of the good progress we are making and the cooperation we are receiving, we can go to the legislative appropriations bill. Any votes with respect to the legislative appropriations bill will be postponed to occur at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Therefore, there will be no recorded votes on Monday. On Monday, the Senate will begin the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 436, S. 1482, and it be considered under the following limitations: 1 hour of debate equally divided on the bill; one amendment offered by Senator Durbin, regarding reviews of criminal records, 30 minutes of debate equally divided; one amendment offered by Senator Moseley-Braun and Senator Durbin relating to Internet predators, 30 minutes of debates equally divided; one amendment offered by Senator Dodd regarding blocking software, 30 minutes of debate equally divided. No other amendments will be in order to the bill. 
I further ask consent that following the expiration or yielding back of debate time, and the disposition of the above-listed amendments, the bill will be read for a third time and the Senate will proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate. 
I further ask consent that the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 437, S. 1619, and it be considered under the following limitations: 1 hour of debate equally divided on the bill, 30 minutes for Senator Murray; one Dodd amendment regarding America Online, 30 minutes equally divided; one Feingold amendment, text of S. 900, 30 minutes equally divided; and one relevant amendment offered by Senator Burns, 2 hours equally divided. 
I further ask unanimous consent that following the expiration or yielding back of the debate time and the disposition of the above amendments, the bill be read the third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate. 
I finally ask consent that S. 442, the Internet tax bill, be referred to the Committee on Finance, and, further, that if the bill has not been reported by July 30, it be automatically discharged from the Finance Committee and placed on the calendar. 
Now, I might just say before the Chair puts the question on this agreement, this would be the process whereby we bring to the floor the Internet filtering bill, the Internet pornography bill, and the Internet tax bill. 
So I did ask consent that it incorporate a process to bring all three of these very important matters to the floor of the Senate.

Mr. LOTT. I would like to say we have worked on it and I think we have made some progress. These are all interrelated or connected, because it does involve the Internet with regard to filtering, to keep out certain programs in our schools; and of course the tax question. There has been a lot of work that has gone on in that area, working not only with the companies that would be affected, then, the Internet companies, but working with Governors and mayors, making sure that all points of view are involved. But the pornography question is a very, very important part of it all and it does relate to the Internet. In fact, there have been indications just recently that even more pornography than what is already there is planned for the future, free and accessible to everybody. 
So, for now, I think we should keep the three together, but we will continue to work with the minority and see if we can get an agreement to clear all three of them or consider just doing two of them if all else fails. I think we should not neglect any of these.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators with regard to the schedule tonight, I understand the Senate will be voting very shortly now on final passage of the agriculture appropriations bill. The managers have worked out the Dodd amendment, and we will be shortly ready to go to final passage. 
Following that vote, the Senate would then resume consideration of the HUD-VA appropriations bill. There is an amendment pending to that appropriations bill, which I understand may be withdrawn. But it is my hope and the intent of the managers--I was just talking to Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski--that we would get time agreements on amendments that are pending, and finish all debate on all amendments tonight, and then the votes that would be required would be in the morning at 9:30. 
We would then go to the legislative appropriations bill during Friday's session. 
So votes could be expected on Friday's session at 9:30 with one other possible vote. 
I am hoping maybe that the legislative appropriations bill will not have any complicating issues and that it could be handled by a voice vote, or with only one vote. 
I would like to finish it all tonight. But the managers have a number of amendments they have to work through. 
So what we would have, then, as we now see it, is final passage on agriculture, go to HUD-VA, and we have one issue that may be resolved, which would then not require a vote, and then we would go on to the amendments. 
So it is possible that after this next vote, the next recorded vote will not be until 9:30 in the morning. We will do everything we can to not go late tomorrow and certainly not later than 12 o'clock. But cooperation from Senators on both sides will allow us to actually finish it up by 10 o'clock or 10:30 tomorrow.

I want to make this point. We have had some good debate on this. I know there are some important issues out there. But we need to get on with it and we need to complete this bill this afternoon. I would say to my colleagues, we are going to have to finish it today because we have other votes. 
I hope everybody would recognize that this afternoon at some point we should just start, on both sides of the aisle, moving to table all amendments. If we had a vote right now on this bill, it would get over 90 votes. So I hope the Senate would cooperate. I know Senator Daschle and the managers on both sides are trying to do that. But I am a little nervous that the tempo is not there yet to get this completed so we could go on to other appropriations bills and so Senator Daschle and I can continue to work to try to get agreement on other important issues. 
So please let's cooperate. Let's bring this to a conclusion by the middle of the afternoon. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is 12:15 and we have had one vote. We have dispensed with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the agriculture appropriations bill. Now the managers are having difficulty getting Senators to come to the floor and offer amendments. This is beyond ridiculous. 
If we don't get going in the next 15 minutes or so, we are going to go live on a quorum. I am going to look, then, for the next serious action to take, because we should be through with this bill. If Senators are serious, they should be here offering their amendments. If they are not, then we are going so start having votes of another nature. We are not just going to stand in a quorum for the next hour, hour and a half. It is not fair to the managers. We will be here at midnight tonight, and I don't think anybody wants that. 
So again, I call on Senators to come to the floor. Surely a Senator has an amendment, out of the 40 amendments we have pending, that could be offered. Let's dispose of it. 
We will wait 15 minutes, or so, to get one going and then we will go to a live quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this was old home week in the Senate. Former Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, who served almost two decades in this body, returned to give us a piece of his mind--in the best sense of the phrase. 
To be precise, he delivered, in the august Old Senate Chamber, the second presentation in our Leader's Lecture Series. The first address earlier this year, by former Senator Mike Mansfield, was both moving and memorable. Senator Baker's remarks were no less so. 
He entitled his remarks `On Herding Cats,' a reference to the nature of the work of a Senator Majority Leader--or, for that matter, a Minority Leader. Suffice it to say that, as the current holder of the leadership office which Senator Baker gave up when he left the Senate, I fully understand what he means.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Bud Selig on his unanimous election as the ninth Commissioner of major league baseball. 
Baseball is enjoying a renaissance of popularity at all levels of play. Participation and interest in youth baseball is at an all-time high. Minor league baseball sets new attendance records each year while bringing the joy of the sport to smaller communities across our Nation. Major league baseball is enjoying unprecedented interest as its great players and teams continue their assault on the all-time records. 
As a lifelong fan of baseball, I know Mr. Selig will continue to make baseball even more popular for its millions of fans and players from youth league through the major leagues. He will also bring considerable experience and background to his new post all of which will add to the glory of our national pastime. I wish him well. Baseball has chosen well.

I presume that will be accepted by a voice vote. Then we will go to the Torricelli second-degree amendment, with 2 minutes for him to describe his amendment, 2 minutes for Senator Dodd in opposition, and then a vote on that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to commend the continuing efforts of America's computer industry to find a technical solution to the encryption issue. On Monday, July 13, a consortium of thirteen high-tech companies announced an alternative to the Administration's proposed key escrow/third party access system. As you will recall, many computer and security exports have stated that key escrow would be an invasion of privacy, technically unworkable, and cost prohibitive. 
Unlike the key recovery system advocated by the Administration, industry's `private doorbells' approach would not require sensitive encryption keys to be escrowed with third parties in order for law enforcement to gain access to computer messages. Instead, the FBI and other federal, state, and local agencies would be able to combat crime by being provided with court approved, real-time access to communiques at the point where they are sent or at the point where the message is received. Clearly, high-tech executives have not been sitting on the sidelines as the encryption debate continues. As this announcement indicates, the computer industry is working hard to find a balanced solution that ensures the needs of our law enforcement and national security communities while maintaining privacy protections for all U.S. citizens. We owe it to them, and to all Americans, to find a balanced legislative solution to encryption.

Mr. LOTT. Americans want and need strong encryption to protect their most sensitive data and communications from unauthorized access. Yet the Administration continues to pursue an encryption policy that limits exports, requires key recovery backdoors for law enforcement, and ultimately stifles American innovation. Instead of keeping technology out of the hands of criminals, continuing export controls will only ensure that U.S. citizens have less protection than other computer users throughout the globe. The financial institutions announcement confirms what many in Congress have been saying for some time: users of electronic commerce will be best served by providing relief from current export control regulations. Allowing advanced encryption to be exported ensures that sensitive data is protected while helping American companies compete globally. Individual consumers, as well as multinational financial institutions, will not buy and will not use encryption systems when government mandated recovery keys for these products are provided to third parties. This system, as many experts have reported, creates a host of security risks, making our online communications vulnerable to attack by thieves, hackers and other criminals.

Mr. LOTT. I agree with my colleagues. While I strongly support the passage of legislation on both encryption and on digital signatures, I am convinced that the best approach during this session is to deal with these matters in separate bills. Let me say again, that in order to pass legislation on both of these issues during this Congress, we must recognize that there are significant differences between these important and complex policy issues. Digital signature and certificate authority have appeared in various proposals in association with encryption. However, these matters need to be considered separately because they raise different questions and complications. 
A digital signature is a technical method for authenticating the identity of a sender or author. 
As its name implies, it is a digital version of a person's written signature. Encryption is a means to ensure confidentiality. It is a set of algorithms used to scramble and unscramble text in order to keep unauthorized person's from reading your computer data and messages. It is a technology that protects medical, business, and individual files from invasion. Again, encryption for confidentiality, and digital signatures for authentication and related certificate authorities, are not the same issue. Dealing with encryption and digital signatures in one piece of legislation could lead to the demise of such a weighted bill. Consequently, I am prepared and committed to moving separate bills dealing with these issues during this session. I urge my colleagues to support this dual track approach as my colleagues have recommended. I share the belief that this is the best chance for legislation to be passed in both of these areas during the 105th Congress. 
Congress needs to stop debating these issues and enact balanced legislation that will ensure the privacy rights of individuals while protecting America's public safety, economic, and national security interests.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am always reluctant to add another national holiday to our calendar, but were we to do so, then July 15 would be a good bet. For today is Max Fisher's birthday. 
In fact, it is his 90th birthday. But longevity, important as it is, is the least of his accomplishments. 
Many of our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, know Max very well. He has long been one of the most prominent and influential leaders in the American Jewish community. 
He has advised every Republican President since Richard Nixon. He has advised every Israeli Prime Minister since Golda Meir. He was a critical force behind the airlift that helped save Israel in the darkest days of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. 
The great work of his life has been building bridges between Israel and the United States. But that is only one of many reasons to honor him. 
Max is one of our Nation's greatest philanthropists. He played a vital role in his home city of Detroit after the tragic riots of 1967 by promoting reconciliation and economic opportunity. He continues in that effort today. 
No one will ever know how many people have benefited from his quiet generosity. 
Max, of course, would prefer the term social responsibility. Whatever the words, the meaning is the same, and so is the inspiration. As the Book of Proverbs teaches, `He who is gracious to the poor lends to the Lord.' 
Ten years ago, when Max celebrated his eightieth birthday, accolades came in from around the world. President Reagan called him `a legend.' 
Today, ten years later, the legend continues to build. He still works quietly, behind the scenes. 
It is no coincidence that his biography is entitled, `The Quiet Diplomat.' That book documents what all of his friends and admirers know so well: His dedication to the cause of peace, his energy in the cause of justice, his wisdom and effectiveness in working for a better world. 
At some point, with a man like Max, we run out of accolades. He has heard them all--and probably been impressed by none of them. 
His eye is always on the future: What remains to be done, what is still to be built, what has not yet been set right. 
In that spirit, on behalf of the Senate of the United States, I want to wish him yet another Happy Birthday, in the full realization that these ninety years have been as much a blessing to us and to the Nation as they have been to him and to his family. 
To Max from America: Mazel tov, and God bless.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am going to provide an update on the investigations that have been proceeding by four of our committees into this U.S. policy toward satellite exports. We have not reached any final determinations. I want to emphasize that. The good counsel is that we have made some progress. We are learning some things, but there is a good deal more work that needs to be done. I believe the Intelligence Committee has an open hearing scheduled tomorrow. Senator Cochran's subcommittee has hearings scheduled I believe next week. So we will continue this. We are going to be thorough and we are going to be cautious. We should not jump to conclusions. 
In this connection, I recently came across the following statement from 1989 concerning the Bush administration's decision to allow export licenses for three United States satellites: `Allowing these launches is not in the best interests of our country or of our relationship with China. It casts a long shadow that distorts beyond recognition what the United States ought to represent to our own people and to the people fighting for democracy in China.' This statement was made by then-Senator Al Gore. He obviously has changed his position. 
What we have to examine is whether the policy of allowing the export of U.S. satellites as implemented by the Clinton-Gore administration adequately protects American national interests. 
Let me start with the bottom line. Senate investigations have only begun. Lack of cooperation from the Administration has hampered our efforts. Thirteen hearings with 32 witnesses have been held by four committees. I have met with the committee chairmen and other members of our informal task force on China. At this point, five major interim judgments can be made based on what we already know. 
First, the Clinton administration's export controls for satellites are wholly inadequate. They have not protected sensitive U.S. technology. National security concerns are regularly downplayed and even ignored. 
Second, in violation of stated United States policy, sensitive technology related to satellite exports has been transferred to China. We know what the case is. 
Third, China has received military benefit from United States satellite exports. 
Every day, there continues to be additional information that comes out in this area. 
In fact, in today's Washington Times, there is a news article that says `U.S. Technology Builds `Bridge' for China Missile.' 
Fourth, the administration has ignored overwhelming information regarding Chinese proliferation, and has embarked on a de facto policy designed to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from sanctions under U.S. proliferation law. We have a statement from White House official to that effect. 
Finally, new information has come to light about China's efforts to influence the American political process. This new information should remove all resistance to naming an independent counsel to investigate the evidence and the allegations. 
The administration has failed to fully cooperate with the Senate investigation, even though they have indicated that they would, and there is still time for that. But on May 22, 1998, along committee chairmen of jurisdiction, I sent letters requesting administration documents from the White House, the Departments of State, Commerce, Defense, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. On June 1, 1998, a letter was sent to the Department of Justice requesting documents. On June 2, 1998, a letter was sent requesting documents from the Customs Service. On June 12, 1998, Senators Shelby and Kerrey sent letters requesting information from eight Governmental agencies and the White House as part of the Select Committee on Intelligence investigation. 
The letters I joined in sending requested documents in three areas: First, all issues associated with the export of satellites to China, including waivers of U.S. law governing such exports and the decision to transfer control of satellite exports from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce; second, issues associated with China's proposed membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR; and third, information on Chinese proliferation activities which indicate possible violations of U.S. laws. 
A significant amount of documents have been provided concerning some areas of satellite exports--particularly from the White House and particularly on the presidential waivers allowing satellite exports. But virtually no information has been provided concerning the transfer of export controls from State to Commerce--from the White House or any other agency. And virtually no information has been provided on Chinese membership in the MTCR, or on Chinese proliferation activities in violation of U.S. law. 
A review of executive branch compliance with our document requests demonstrates how limited the cooperation really has been. 
Until Friday of last week, the Department of Commerce only provided an initial limited set of documents. More has been promised, but the response has again glacial and incomplete. The documents they have provided contain redactions that limit their utility, quite frankly. 
The Department of Justice has provided nothing to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and has insisted on reviewing virtually all documents provided by any other Government agencies--significantly slowing down the process in this area. 
The Department of State has provided also virtually nothing. Classified documents, according to a July 2, 1998, letter, would not be provided to the Congress. Instead, documents could be read only at the Department of State. Given that far more sensitive information is routinely provided for the use of the Senate in Senate spaces, this can only be seen as bureaucratic obstruction. 
The White House has not responded to the Intelligence Committee. Neither has ACDA, Customs, or State. Defense and Commerce have only provided limited information. 
The White House initially declassified some documents concerning waiver decisions in June, but has provided nothing since then. 
The Department of Defense has provided only a very limited number of documents. 
The Customs Service has provided nothing other than a June 23, 1998, letter stating that they would not meet our June 15, 1998, deadline, but we haven't gotten that information as of yet. 
After a review of the Clinton administration's compliance with our requests for information, it is hard to escape the conclusion that delay has become the standard operating procedure. Once again, it is going to make it difficult for us to get the information we need so we can make a clear determination about the damage that has been done with this technology transfer. After an initial show of good faith by the administration, we have not had a lot more cooperation since then. 
We will be forced to consider other measures to compel enforcement. I don't plan to move nominees of these non-cooperative agencies until our legitimate oversight requests are honored. We are actively examining the possibility of subpoena options. It is becoming increasingly difficult to continue with the very productive hearings that we have had 
without this cooperation. 
Now, I would like to address the five points I raised earlier in some greater detail. Again, these are preliminary conclusions and we are seeking additional information. 
First, the Clinton administration's export controls for satellites are simply inadequate. There has not been adequate protection of sensitive U.S. technology. National security concerns are regularly downplayed and even ignored. Hearings before several committees have detailed the shortcomings in the development and implementation of export controls of satellites. 
For example, a senior official of the Defense Trade and Security Administration testified before the Committee on Governmental Affairs on June 25, 1998, that `over the past six years, the formal process to control dual-use items has failed in its stated mission--to safeguard the national security of the United States.' 
Transferring the control of satellite exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department in 1996 really resulted in dramatic changes. According to the General Accounting Office testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 10, 1998, the transfer reduced the influence of the Defense Department. It eliminated Congressional notification. It exempted satellite exports from certain sanctions. Technical information is not as clearly controlled, leading to uncertainty on the part of aerospace companies and to more technology transfer than previously allowed. 
Testimony on July 8, 1998, before the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, has established that the Department of Defense monitors are not required to be present at satellite launches. This is directly contrary to previous administration claims. No statute, policy, or regulation requires U.S. Government monitors. 
At least three U.S. satellites have been launched in China with no U.S. monitors present. No one in the U.S. Government knows what transpired at these launches or if U.S. laws and policies on technology transfer were followed. No one in our Government is even attempting to examine what occurred at these unmonitored satellite launches. Looking at these unmonitored launches, I think, would be a critical element of the next phase of our investigation. 
Today's satellite export control system relies on the good will of the Commerce Department, a department which has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to ignore national security concerns on satellite exports. This is an area where we need to take a close look at how we are going to proceed in the future and what is going to be expected of the Commerce Department. 
For example, Commerce has unilaterally removed items subject to interagency license review without notice to other affected agencies. Commerce has also refused to send approved licenses to Defense so officials there can evaluate the final product. When it involves satellites and technology, clearly the Defense Department should be a part of this process. 
Second, sensitive technology related to satellite exports has been transferred to China. In at least two cases, U.S. companies analyzed Chinese launch failures and communicated with Chinese officials. In 1995, Hughes analyzed the `APSTAR 2' launch failure. Commerce now concedes that this analysis should have been subject to State and Defense Department reviews before a Commerce official gave it to the Chinese. Commerce only provided the report, concluded in 1995, 2 hours before a Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Proliferation hearing on July 8 of this year. 
The 1996 Loral launch failure is the subject of a Justice Department review for possible illegal transfer of technology. Compliance with the law is the province of the Justice Department. So we are looking into the impact on American national securities. It is very important that the Justice Department complete that work. 
I agree with three assessments by three elements of the State and Defense Departments that China derived significant benefits from their technical exchanges with U.S. companies after the Long March crash in 1996, exchanges which are likely to lead to improvements in the reliability of their ballistic missile, and especially their guidance systems. So we have to be concerned very much about this transfer. 
Third, China has received military benefit from U.S. satellite exports. There is a division within the executive branch agencies over how much China has benefited. But there seems to be agreement that certainly some benefit was derived. 
The New York Times has reported that U.S. satellites are being used by the Chinese military for its internal coded communications. Administration officials concede that China is using American-made and exported satellites for their military communications. This is a clear and uncontested military benefit for China. The New York Times also reports that an additional satellite export that could enhance the Chinese military's ability to eavesdrop on phone conversations is under review by the Clinton administration. 
The administration has ignored overwhelming information 
regarding Chinese proliferation and has embarked on what appears to be a de facto policy to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from sanctions under our U.S. proliferation law. For instance, on June 11, 1998, the Committee on Foreign Relations heard testimony from the former director of the Nonproliferation Center of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Clinton administration has used `almost any measure' to block intelligence judgments that China had transferred missiles to Pakistan--a clear violation of U.S. law that requires the imposition of sanctions. Intelligence analyses `were summarily dismissed by the policy community.' 
According to the testimony, the intelligence community is `virtually certain that this transfer had taken place . . .' I am convinced, after a personal investigation, that it did take place, and it was a very dangerous for Pakistan to be receiving these missiles. Why has that been the case, and why hasn't the administration been willing to take actions providing sanctions where clearly that information has been provided? 
Finally, new information has come to light about China's efforts to influence the American political process. This new information should remove any doubt about the need for an independent counsel in this area. 
It has already been reported that FBI Director Freeh has indicated his view that an independent counsel should be appointed. It is time to renew attention on the Attorney General. It is time for an outside, impartial investigation by an independent counsel into the serious and credible charges of direct Chinese Government financing or involvement in the 1996 elections. We have very good committees that are working together in a bipartisan way and looking into these very important questions. I urge them to continue to do so, and to do it in a calm and methodical way. It is essential that we get cooperation from the administration to provide the additional information that we requested, the additional evidence. And we will carry out our constitutional responsibilities. Nothing less should be expected of us. 
In view of the inquiries we had about how these are proceeding, what information we have been getting, what is outstanding, and also what is our plan, as far as future hearings, I thought it was important that I give some review of what has transpired. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, under a previous order, the Senate will debate the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Daschle amendment, with a vote occurring on the motion at 10 a.m. 
Following that vote, the Senate will continue consideration of the very important agriculture appropriations bill, with the hope of finishing the bill as soon as possible this evening, or as early as possible this week. And I am very proud that my senior colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, will be doing his usual very good job in handling this important bill. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate, with the first vote at 10 a.m. 
For the remainder of the week, it is hoped the Senate will complete several important appropriations bills--at least agriculture, HUD-VA, and legislative. That would be a very positive movement and would give us an opportunity to address other important issues. 
Members are reminded that we have the second in the Leader Lecture series this evening. I will be honored to introduce our former majority leader, Senator Baker. That will be held tonight at 6 p.m. in the old Senate Chamber. 
Also, on Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock, there will be a Joint Meeting of Congress in the House Chamber to receive an address from the President of Romania. 
I urge my colleagues to come to our lecture series session this afternoon with Senator Baker. I know it will be interesting and, as usual, filled with good wit and good humor, and will be very informative about his views of the Senate and where we have been and where we are going. The next speaker in the leader series is scheduled to be Senator Byrd of West Virginia. I believe it is in September.

Mr. LOTT. I have been indicating all year that the Senate was going to take this issue up, and beginning June 18 I sent suggested unanimous consent agreements to Senator Daschle. He and I talked yesterday. We are working together on that issue. We fully expect that probably early next week we will turn to this issue. We have not worked out the exact time or the exact procedure. But we had a good discussion yesterday, and we will continue to have that discussion. 
I would like for us to do it where we have the Patients' Bill of Rights as the issue that is pending, with Senator Kennedy's bill as one of those, obviously, that would be offered, and the task force bill that has been put together by Senator Nickles, and others, and not tie up appropriations bills. We have the people's work to do. The appropriations bills keep the Government running. They fund our farm programs, they fund our veterans programs, they fund our housing programs, they fund our parks and Interior, Commerce, State, and Justice. The Senator knows the list. So we need to go ahead with those appropriations bills, and then we will turn to the Patients' Bill of Rights in a reasonable period of time. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed with my leader time so that I can make a statement with regard to the committee hearings on the investigation with regard to the satellite exports to the People's Republic of China.

Cathy Abell worked for every Member of the Senate as the Secretary of the Army's legislative liaison to the Senate. She was instrumental in facilitating the exchange of information between our constituent services offices and the Department of the Army. Mrs. Abell is an expert at cutting through the red tape of the military bureaucracy and never lost sight of the fact that taking care of the individual was paramount. I never knew of an instance in which Mrs. Abell would back away from doing the right thing for the Army, the soldier or family member and the Senate offices she served. 
Mrs. Abell earned the reputation as someone on whom we could rely on to respond to our inquiries in a responsive, professional manner. She always provided informative, well researched responses to our constituents. Cathy Abell was the `go to' person in the Army's Senate Legislative Liaison Office. When a Senate office had a really complex case, the legislative assistants knew that they should direct the inquiry to her. Mrs. Abell would skillfully work through the complex military regulations and determine how best to maintain the integrity of the Army's processes while permitting the soldier or family member to receive the relief required by their situation. She is able to communicate effectively with both military officials and Congressional staff members and has developed superb working relationships with our staffs. Her professional abilities and the excellent working relationships earned her the respect and trust which served her, the Army and the Senate so well. 
Mrs. Abell recognized that many of our staff were not familiar with Army organizations, processes and procedures. To address this lack of familiarity, she organized and implemented a series of trips in which our staffs were able to experience first hand the conditions under which military personnel are recruited, processed and trained. As a result of her initiative, Senate staff members are able to more accurately explain Army procedures to constituents, in many cases eliminating the need for a formal inquiry. Initiative, caring service and professionalism are the terms used to describe Mrs. Abell. 
Mister President, Cathy Abell is a great credit to the Army and the Nation. As she now departs to share her experience and expertise with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize her service to the Senate and wish her well in her new assignment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this afternoon there will be a period for morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin debate on a motion to proceed to the property rights bill. At 5:45, under a previous order, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the private property rights bill. Following that vote, the Senate will consider any legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. 
For the remainder of this week, the Senate will attempt to complete action on the private property rights bill, finish several appropriations bills, including agriculture appropriations, the HUD/VA appropriations bill is a possibility, and hopefully the legislative appropriations bill. We could also begin consideration of the credit union bill, and we are also looking at when we will begin and how we will debate and consider the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have some Internet bills that we are trying to get cleared so that we can consider those under a short time agreement. 
Also, as a reminder, on Wednesday, July 15, at 10 a.m., there will be a joint meeting of Congress to receive the address from the President of Romania. 
So we have a good bit of work that we need to do this week, as usual. The focus will be on appropriations bills throughout most of the week, turning late in the week or early next week to the Patients' Bill of Rights or the credit union bill. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
I observe the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is about to vote on S. Con. Res. 107, introduced by Senator Torricelli, myself and many others earlier this week. This resolution was necessary to address the uncertainty created by President Clinton's remarks in Shanghai on his recent trip to China. 
Our resolution reaffirms our commitments to Taiwan as spelled out in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. That act is the law of the land. Successive Presidents have reached bilateral agreements with the People's Republic of China, but they have never been submitted to the Senate for ratification. They are not binding on the United States. The Taiwan Relations Act is. 
It is unfortunate the President chose to lay out a new course on Taiwan--unfortunately it was done in Shanghai, unfortunately it was done without any consultation with Congress, and unfortunately it was done without consultation with the democratic government of Taiwan. 
It is also unfortunate the President did not apparently even seek to get China's leaders to renounce the use of force against Taiwan. Instead, he said exactly what Beijing wanted to hear. 
One likely effect of the President's statements is to strengthen the voices in Taiwan seeking full independence. While seeking to please Beijing, he has strengthened those in Taiwan who argue the United States cannot be trusted as an ally. 
President Clinton's statements have emboldened Beijing in its efforts to intimidate Taiwan. A Chinese official told Taiwan to `face reality.' The Washington Post reports today the Beijing plans `to use the remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into political talks on reunification.' 
The article also reports that the remarks `underscore the important role the United States has played in forcing Taiwan to the bargaining table.' 
Chinese officials understand what Clinton officials deny: The President's remarks were a major victory for Beijing and major blow to democratic Taiwan. 
Passage of this resolution sends a powerful signal that the Senate is not accepting President Clinton's new policy. It is a strong statement coming so soon after his return to the United States. 
But passage of this resolution will not be the end of our efforts to try to understand the administration's new policy on Taiwan. Administration spokesmen have said they have not changed policy, when the opposite is obvious. 
We will explore whether the administration stands by its 1994 Taiwan Policy Review. That review pledged to upgrade relations with Taiwan. That review pledged to support Taiwan's participation in certain international organizations. Is this still administration policy? 
We also will try to determine whether the administration still adheres to the `Six Assurances' made to the Senate in 1982: No date for ending arms sales to Taiwan; no prior consultations with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan; no U.S. mediation role between Taipei and Beijing; no agreement to alter the Taiwan Relations Act; no change in the United States position regarding Taiwan's sovereignty; and no pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with Beijing. 
We will ask the administration if they still adhere to these assurances given to the Senate after the Third Communique was reached in 1982. 
This resolution is an important step and a timely step. But it is not the end of repairing the damage from the President's statements in China. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement reached last night, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 107 regarding Taiwan, with a rollcall vote occurring immediately after I give a brief statement on the resolution. 
Following that vote, the Senate will be asked to turn to any other Legislative or Executive Calendar items that have been cleared for action. However, no further rollcall votes will occur during Friday's session of the Senate. 
As a reminder to all Senators, a cloture motion was filed on the motion to proceed to the private property rights legislation. That cloture vote will occur on Monday, July 13, at 5:45 p.m. 
As a final announcement, there will also be a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, July 15, at 10 a.m. to receive an address by the President of Romania. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation on the schedule, including getting the higher education bill passed last night.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have in my hand a copy of that wonderful document, the Constitution of the United States of America. It begins, `We, the people of the United States * * *' Like Senator Byrd, who refers to it quite often and carries a copy of it in his pocket, I find that when I go back and read it and reread it I always see something different, something special, something very treasured. I refer, today, to the last phrase of Article 5, which is very clear and unambiguous. It says: 
* * * nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. 
The Constitution is very clear. And yet all across this country, privately owned property, including a lot of farmers' private property, and the private property of businessmen and individuals, is being taken pursuant to government action without just compensation. In many instances for so-called `good and valid reasons--for example, to preserve wetlands or to protect endangered species. Such takings may, upon examination, be legitimate, but not if private property is taken from the property owner in an inappropriate way and without just compensation. 
This is one of the rights I think we as Americans hold most dear, and is so deserving of protection that it is spelled out in our Constitution--the right to privately own property and to not have it taken away by government action without just compensation being paid. 
When I visit with people from all over the world, particularly those who have lived behind the Iron Curtain and in Eastern European countries, one of the things they want, one of the things they feel so strongly about in America, is the ability to own private property, own your own little piece of the world, and to own your own home. Yet, in America--in America--we are in danger of losing that right even though it is guaranteed in the Constitution. 
So I filed for cloture last night on S. 2271, and I intend to strike and substitute the content of H.R. 1534, which passed the House by an overwhelming vote--I think the margin was well over 100--and which has been amended and passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
I commend the Judiciary Committee for the work they have done in this area under the chairmanship of Senator Hatch and with a lot of other Senators being involved, including Senator DeWine from Ohio and I think Senator Sessions from Alabama. They produced this very important legislation, which is intended to protect an individual Constitutional right, the right to own and keep private property, by guaranteeing timely access to the Federal courts. 
A primary function of the Congress, I think, is to safeguard rights guaranteed by our Constitution. When the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, our Founding Fathers were confident that the right of an individual to own and use private property without unreasonable restrictions of that right would be guaranteed. However, the framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights could not have reasonably foreseen the tremendous changes in our Government structure that have resulted, I believe, in the real impairment of these property rights guarantees. 
The encroachment of Federal Government agencies into matters of private land management is an issue of escalating cost to taxpayers, businesses, and private property owners. Such encroachments often result in decreased property values, reduced or terminated business activities, and lost jobs. 
What value does a piece of property have in Kansas or in Connecticut or in Mississippi if you have been told, `Oh, yes, it is your land. We won't take it. But, by the way, you can't use it in the way you intended, for the purpose perhaps that you had bought it; or you can't do something on your land that you have inherited from your forefathers?' You might as well just take it off the face of the globe. What value does it have if you can't use it? 
The extreme interpretations, in my opinion, of the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act by Federal regulatory agencies are resulting in a policy of national land use control. Further, the rights of individual property owners are imperiled when faced with oppressive Government regulation without the ability to even fight for those rights on equal footing. This must not be allowed to continue unchecked. 
I believe a legislative remedy is now needed to reinstate what should otherwise be inalienable. At a minimum, an individual property owner should be confident in the knowledge that the Federal court system is available to resolve a dispute over the taking of an individual's property without just compensation in a fair and timely manner. 
That timely access to the courts will be assured by the passage of this legislation before the Senate Monday, and the vote will be at 5:45 p.m. on Monday to allow us even to proceed to consider this bill which will guarantee private property owners access and the opportunity to go to the Federal courts. 
This legislation affects only Federal property rights claims brought before a Federal court. Despite the contentions of opponents to this legislation, State and local prerogatives and State and local claims--those based on State and local law--are not affected. The mere fact that a property rights constitutional claim may arise from some action taken by a State or local government does not make that claim per se a State law claim rather than a Federal claim. 
The Judiciary Committee has endeavored to strike the proper balance when weighing any impact on State and local governments caused by this legislation. This legislation will certainly empower property owners--that is what it is intended to do--but I believe it will merely place them in the position they should have been in all along and will place them in a position that balances the need of the governmental entity with the rights of the private property owner. 
Finally, it should be clear to all that the U.S. district courts in particular (and the Federal court system in general) are the proper venue for the adjudication of Federal constitutional issues such as this Federal right stemming from the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. This legislation does no harm to our well-established principles of federalism. The Federal courts reviewing these claims will have no power to write permits or to make zoning decisions as do local governments. The courts do, however, have the responsibility to ensure that such decisions are constitutional and do not improperly infringe upon the property rights established by the Fifth Amendment. 
I am confident that this legislation will accomplish its desired effect, no more and no less. That effect is to ensure that a private property owner has his day in Federal court and a fair and timely hearing of his cause. This is a bedrock right, and it must be preserved. 
This is not the same private property rights bill that had been considered earlier by the Congress. It is much narrower. It is targeted, but it gives access to the Federal court system. By taking this step, Congress will make great strides to ensure the preservation of this important Constitutional right. 
I would like to hear any Member of the Senate go to his or her constituents in their respective States and say, `Private property owner, we think your property should be taken for whatever good and just cause that might be involved without just compensation, and, oh, by the way, you don't even have the right to go to the Federal courts and have a determination made if it is constitutional or not.' Try to defend that. 
We are going to have a vote. We will see who really believes in private property rights in America. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Now, of course, we return to the Higher Education Act. The managers of the legislation have been making progress. We have at least a couple of amendments that will still take some more time. I encourage Senators to speak briefly and just go ahead and get a vote on the issues that are involved. The plan is to stay on the Higher Education Act until we complete it tonight, so we will need cooperation of all Senators. I understand some Senators may have other events they would like to go to, but you can't say, `I want to offer amendments, but, by the way, I have an event I have to go to.' 
Please work with the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts. This is important legislation that expired July 1. We need to get it completed so we can get it in conference and get it done before we go out at the end of the year. I believe with a little cooperation, we can complete this very important Higher Education Act tonight. It is my intent for us to stay in until we get it done tonight.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as all Members are aware, when a cloture motion is filed in the Senate, the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture rule, require all first-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by 1 p.m. the day before the cloture vote occurs. 
Last evening, I filed cloture on the substitute amendment to the product liability bill. Realizing and observing how upset the Democratic leader was when cloture was filed last night, I checked with the desk as to exactly how many amendments had been filed to the product liability bill by our Democratic colleagues. To my dismay, earlier only two had been filed, but still a very small number, and only 21 Democratic amendments have been filed, and it is almost 1 p.m., the deadline time. 
The Democratic leader stated last evening that many Members on his side of the aisle had amendments they wish to offer on this bill. And he also stated, `It is the right of all Senators to fulfill the functions of their responsibilities to offer amendments.' Well, where are the amendments? And why have Members on the Democratic side of the aisle chosen not to file amendments within the timeframe that is outlined under rule XXII? 
Could it be that our colleagues had never been prepared to exercise their right to offer amendments when it comes to the legislation? Instead, have our colleagues on the other side of the aisle just decided they would vote against cloture with the intention of never attempting to offer amendments that would have been intended, I am sure, to `improve the bill,' as Senator Daschle suggested? 
Since there have only been 21 amendments filed, it seems to me that maybe our Democratic colleagues are not serious about addressing this important issue which is, by the way, a bill that has been laboriously worked out. It is a compromise bill. Senator Gorton of Washington, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia, have spent hours, days, months working on this. And this legislation has been approved by the administration, by the White House. They have indicated they would sign it. So why in the world would there not be a serious attempt here to pass this legislation? 
But having said all that, I am prepared to offer a consent agreement that would extend the filing time for first-degree amendments until 5 p.m. this afternoon, if that would help accommodate our colleagues on the Democratic side or, for that matter, on the Republican side. 
Therefore, I do now ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding rule XXII, that the filing deadline for the first-degree amendments with respect to the product liability bill be extended to 5 p.m. this afternoon.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution does not break new ground with regard to Taiwan. It simply reaffirms our support of the principles of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. It calls on the President to seek a Chinese renunciation of the use of force to affect Taiwan's future. 
President Clinton gave two impressive performances at Beijing University and at the joint press conference, but I am very much concerned about the perception of what he had to say, of what the effect is of what he had to say with regard to Taiwan. Instead of pressing Beijing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, President Clinton accepted Beijing's position on Taiwan. By ending the ambiguity of the U.S. position, we have harmed democratic Taiwan's position. 
Congress has pressed previous administrations to change its policies with regard to Taiwan. In fact, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 was a clear example of congressional restraint on executive actions on Taiwan. In 1995, we urged the President to grant a visa to Taiwan's President to enter the U.S. for a college reunion. The administration changed its position after Congress took that action. 
This resolution is necessary to correct the effects of the statements that were made in Shanghai. Before Shanghai, U.S. policy was to acknowledge Beijing's position. Now we have prepared to make Beijing's position our policy. 
China refuses to take the use of force off the table. We should not unilaterally deny Taiwan membership to international organizations, and we should not take action in concert with the dictatorship in Beijing without even consulting the 21 million people under democratic rule in Taiwan. 
Instead of undermining Taiwan, we should support our fundamental national interest in the peaceful resolution of differences. We do not want to see a war in the Taiwan Straits. Deterrence is the way to avoid such a possibility. 
We should support the provision of missile defenses to Taiwan so that they can protect their democracy from a dictatorship's missiles. We should support Taiwan's membership in international organizations where they are willing and able to help an organization's goals--such as free trade and economic stability. 
There is a second resolution, S. Con. Res. 30, on the issue of Taiwan's membership in the IMF and the World Bank. It has already been passed out of the Foreign Affairs Committee by unanimous vote. I hope we can pass that resolution this week. 
I thank Senator Torricelli and the rest of our cosponsors. I urge other colleagues to join us because this is certainly a bipartisan issue. I look forward to rapid Senate action on the resolution to reaffirm our relationship with Taiwan and the primacy of the Taiwan Relations Act.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately proceed to a vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the product liability bill. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will debate the motion to proceed until the policy luncheons at 12:30 p.m., and following the policy luncheons, it is expected the Senate will resume consideration of the HUD-VA appropriations bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor this afternoon to offer and debate amendments to the HUD-VA bill. I understand there are some amendments and some very legitimate amendments. I hope we will get started on those early in the afternoon so that we can have a reasonable debate, but under a time agreement, and get to a conclusion as soon as we can this week on the VA-HUD bill. 
The Senate also this week will consider the IRS reform conference report. We are not sure exactly when that will begin. We thought about possibly tonight. It will depend on what happens on product liability and the HUD-VA bill, but we are definitely taking up the IRS reform and restructuring conference report before the end of the week to get a vote. I think this will be a tremendous reward for the American people for their patience, and also to help address the serious problems we have had with the IRS in recent years. 
I also remind Members that July is expected to be a very busy month with late-night sessions and votes, and votes on most Fridays and Mondays. If anything develops to the contrary, of course, we will notify Members as soon as we can. Members have to expect votes late on Monday afternoons and on Fridays also. We certainly need all Senators' cooperation to get this work done. We did get time agreements at the end of the session before we went out for the Fourth of July recess period on higher education and also on a package of energy bills. So we will work those in at the earliest possible opportunity this week or next week. I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this vote in relation to the space station was the last vote of the evening. Wednesday, the Senate will consider the IRS conference report. I expect a considerable amount of time for debate to occur with respect to this IRS reform and restructure bill. A lot of Senators put a lot of time into it. There are some important provisions I know they will want to emphasize. Therefore, a late afternoon or early evening vote can be expected to occur with respect to the IRS reform legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morning there will be a period of morning business until 10:10. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the nominations of A. Howard Matz to be United States District Judge for the Central District of California, and Victoria A. Roberts to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan. It is, therefore, expected that up to two votes will occur on those nominations at approximately 10:15 this morning. 
Following those votes, the Senate may consider any of the following items: drug czar reauthorization bill, the clean needles bill, the reading excellence legislation, the legislative branch appropriations bill, and other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. 
Once again, Members are reminded there will be rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate, with the first vote expected at approximately 10:15. 
I understand from our discussions with Senator Daschle that we perhaps have been able to get an agreement on the higher education bill--we did get the time agreement locked in--with a number of amendments in order. We will work to consider that bill as expeditiously as possible. We need to get it done because the authorization expires July 1. Even though we have had an extension of funding for 90 days, that is something we need to get done absolutely before we go out for the year. So we need to get it completed in the Senate and be able to get it in conference. We also may be able to take up the intelligence authorization bill later on today. 
Let me go ahead and announce to the Senate, and I will repeat it later, right before votes probably, Senators should expect long days and lots of votes during the month of July. We will have votes on most Mondays, even though we have not made a final decision with regard to July 6. It is expected we will have one vote on that date, but we are still working with Senators on both sides to determine what that one vote will be late in the day. 
Throughout July, though, Senators should expect to be here on Mondays and on Fridays. I expect that we will be in 6 or 7 hours each Monday; that we will have night sessions every night; that we will be in usually 12 hours a day Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays; and I will be trying to schedule bills and votes into the night Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays so that we can move several appropriations bills and some of the bills I have mentioned here. 
We have a number of other important issues--product liability, bankruptcy, the credit union bill. We have a lot of work to do, so what I will try to do is dual-track some of these, with appropriations bills being on the floor almost every day and then maybe work at night on other issues. 
For instance, it is my intention to have the conference report on the IRS restructuring probably the Tuesday or Wednesday night that we come back. We may actually have a final vote on it the next morning. But in order to get our work done, Senators should expect that I will schedule votes around 9 o'clock every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 
I have really bent over backwards to be helpful to the Senate, to try to be considerate of their family needs, but it seems that we have not gotten reciprocation from Senators, frankly, on either side. The number of amendments is totally 
out of control. Every bill now has 100 amendments. If Senators can't learn to be serious, only have major amendments, cut the debate time, if we do not get cooperation on both sides of the aisle, then I have no alternative but to start having what would be called `bed check' votes. If we get our work done, we will not go late. If we do not, we will be here until 9 and 10 o'clock every night in July. 
So Senators need to prepare for that, and then we won't surprise anybody. But that is the schedule we have to work in order to get six or eight appropriations bills done in July, and maybe more, if we can, and other important authorizations that have to be done. I know that is good news for one and all, and now morning business is in order. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, when the Senate reconvenes on Monday, July 6, at 12 noon, there will be a period for morning business until 1. Following morning business, it will be my intention for the Senate to begin consideration of the VA/HUD Appropriations bill. I had earlier indicated that we might go directly to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill, but one of the managers will be necessarily absent. So we will go to the VA/HUD appropriations bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor during Monday's session to offer and debate amendments to the VA/HUD bill. We need to get a number of appropriations bills done in July, and if we could get this one done, working on Monday and Tuesday of that week--certainly not more than Thursday--that would be helpful. There will be no votes, though, during Monday's session. 
Any votes ordered with respect to the VA/HUD Appropriations bill will be postponed to occur on Tuesday, July 7, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. A cloture motion was filed on the motion to proceed to the products liability bill, with a vote to occur Tuesday morning at 9:30 a.m. Also, on Tuesday evening, the Senate may vote on the IRS reform conference report. When I say Tuesday evening, I mean probably night. 
Finally, I remind all Members that July will be a very busy month. We will have late night sessions during each week. We should expect to have votes on most Mondays and Fridays. The cooperation of all Members will be necessary for us to complete our work prior to the August recess.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the fine men and women of the United States Air Force, who honored my great state and her great people by naming the 19th operational B-2 Stealth Bomber, The Spirit of Mississippi. I saw the B-2 fly--and it filled me, and all those who participated in the naming ceremony, with enormous pride. 
The dedication of this magnificent aircraft took place in a moving ceremony on Saturday, May 23rd, in Jackson, Mississippi. The ceremony took on additional meaning for all those who joined me since it came at the start of the Memorial Day weekend, when we honor those who sacrificed so much for the defense of our great nation. 
The ceremony included a number of great Americans. General Richard Hawley, the Commander of the Air Force's Air Combat Command, chose Mississippi as the name to grace this aircraft as she serves to deter our enemies for decades to come. Also participating in the ceremony was Mr. Kent Kresa, the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Northrop Grumman, the company that built this technological wonder with the help of the skilled people and companies of Mississippi. 
I was pleased to be joined by a number of senior political leaders from Mississippi: My esteemed colleague, Senator Thad Cochran, Governor Kirk Fordice, and Congressman Roger Wicker of the 1st District. 
Major General James H. Garner, the Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard, and Colonel Robert Barron, the Commander of the 172nd Airlift Wing at Jackson, served as our hosts for these ceremonies. 
When you stand up close to a B-2, and have the opportunity to see a B-2 fly, you realize just how magnificent this aircraft truly is--and the magnitude of the technological accomplishments that it represents. Just to put this in perspective, the B-2 aircraft has a wingspan about 2/3 the length of a football field and, so they tell me, the radar signature of an insect. With refueling, it can fly anywhere on the planet to deliver 16 one-ton precision-guided bombs--even in bad weather. The B-2 offers a revolutionary combination of stealth, range, payload, and precision. It could only have been built here in America--and, I say with pride, only with the help of my fellow Mississippians. 
Fielding this revolutionary aircraft took courage and dedication on the part of key leaders in the Senate, the House of Representatives, and four separate Administrations. To get where we are today, from concept to a squadron of B-2s ready to fly and fight, took almost two decades of effort. Standing here now, we can better appreciate their vision. And we need to remember the time it took to develop the B-2 as we look to the future of America's long-range bomber force. 
We in Congress believe that long-range air power will be even more important in the future than it has been in the past. The reasons are straightforward. Our forces based overseas are shrinking in size--and that trend is likely to continue. Potential adversaries are arming themselves with fast-moving conventional forces and weapons of mass destruction. Long range air power gives the President the ability to respond to aggression immediately and decisively--and that's what helps provide deterrence. 
We in Congress, however, have had growing concerns about the future of the bomber force. Accordingly, we mandated last year that a distinguished and independent panel of experts--the Long Range Air Power Panel--examine current plans for the bomber force and recommend actions to the President and the Congress. That panel has completed its review and I'd like to briefly share some of its important recommendations regarding the B-2 and the future of America's long-range bomber force. 
The Panel stated up front that, and I quote: `long-range air power is an increasingly important element of U.S. military capability.' Over the near term, to make sure that the bomber force can meet the increasing demand for long-range air power, the Panel recommended that we need to invest in and upgrade the current force. In the case of the B-2, for example, the Panel stated that we should work on in increasing the B-2's sortie rate using a combined program that improves stealth maintenance and performance. This will take some additional funding beyond what we provided in the 1998 budget, but keep in mind that doubling the B-2's sortie rate would in effect double the combat power of the force. That's a bargain. 
The Panel also made an important recommendation regarding the long-term future of the bomber force. As I noted before, it took almost 20 years to field the B-2. In less than twenty years from now, the Panel stated that we should be fielding a next generation bomber--and to do so, we need to get started now to develop a plan to replace the existing force over time. I don't know what the next generation bomber will look like. Maybe it will be an upgraded B-2 or something completely different. But I do know that given the strategic importance of long-range air power, we need to get started. I look forward to seeing the Pentagon's recommendations next year about this important issue. 
The enhancements suggested for the B-2 are in line with the requirements identified by my fellow participant in the Spirit of Mississippi naming ceremony, General Hawley. As we complete work on this year's defense budget, we should follow the example offered by a brilliant former leader from Mississippi--the late Senator John Stennis--who along with other leaders in this chamber had the vision to start building the B-2. His vision is now a reality that will fly for many decades into the future. In following Senator Stennis' guidance, we need to support the continued enhancement of the revolutionary B-2 stealth bomber. And we need to encourage the Air Force to provide us with a comprehensive plan for developing a next-generation bomber to sustain the long-range air power force over the long-term. John Stennis would be very proud of our actions--and our long-term vision.

I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of H.R. 2614, all without any intervening action or debate. 
I would like to note that I have discussed this with White House officials, and they have urged that we try to find a way to get this legislation up. Actually, this was a week or two ago, so we have been trying to get something worked out. I would like very much for us to be able to do that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would have to object to that at this time because if we add any amendments to this bill in its present form, then it would require further House action. And, of course, the House has already adjourned for the July 4 recess until July 14. 
I note also, if we do not do this bill now in the form that it was called up, the money that would have been used for this Reading Excellence Program, some $206 million, I believe it was --something of that nature--would then go over to the IDEA, Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, so that money would be gone. So we really are in a box here. 
I think everybody would like to do the Reading Excellence Act. But if we don't do it in the form that I have called it up, it would have to go back to the House. Basically, then, we wouldn't get anything done. We need to send it directly to the President. 
So that is why I would be constrained to object to that modification.

I think for the Federal Government to be distributing needles encourages people to use needles for drug abuse, and I had hoped we could get it cleared. We had worked earlier to try to get some sort of agreement on how we could clear it, with maybe even some amendments being ordered. We could not do it. 
Also, in order to get the President's signature, we would have to do it in this way.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I should note we had at least one very important amendment that a Senator wanted to offer on this side of the aisle to this bill, too, dealing with the penalties for the use of powder cocaine. Certainly, it is a very important issue, and I would like it to be considered, but I called upon that Senator--actually it was two Senators--and said you will have a chance to offer that on other legislation including State, Justice, Commerce. He was willing, then, to agree to put it aside. 
I really think we need to reauthorize the drug czar office. I am hoping this is not the final word on this. Maybe we can work out something in July to consider it. But our problem is, we are really running out of time. I think it is going to be unconscionable if we can't find some way to quickly reauthorize the drug czar's office. We will have to do it without it taking up more than just a couple or 3 hours, because we just don't have the time, when you look at the appropriations bills and everything else we are going to need to do.

Mr. LOTT. I understand that. I know every individual Senator can demand his or her right to offer amendments. But I would have to say, I am very concerned that the Senate is getting more and more into a position where we try to rewrite or write bills on the floor of the Senate. One of the basic tenets I was told about when I came over to the Senate is, if you have a bad bill, don't think you are going to fix it on the floor of the Senate. When you have something like a drug czar reauthorization--I know there are a lot of drug-related amendments that are sort of pent up and Members want to offer them, but it seems to me we ought to just reauthorize that office--it is not a big, complicated bill--and allow the drug czar to do his job. 
But we will keep working and hopefully find a way to get a limited amount of time and limited amendments on that issue.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been talking about a task force to consider the question of economic sanctions, how they are put in place, how they are dealt with, both in the short term and over the long term. We have discussed this matter with Secretary of State Albright. 
I think there is feeling on both sides of the aisle that perhaps the proclivity to place sanctions, economic sanctions on countries around the world repeatedly, and with not a clear way of ending those, has become a problem, at least one we should think very carefully about to see if there is a way we can deal with some of the pending legislation in this area, like, for instance, the Glenn amendment that was applicable in the case of India and, I believe, Pakistan with the Pressler amendment, and a number of other instances. 
On the longer term, I think we need to have a task force to give thought, how we do this, when we do it, and even when we end it. I have discussed it with a number of Senators on our side of the aisle who work in this area of foreign policy and deal with the question of sanctions, and so I am satisfied we can have a good group and this will be a bipartisan group. So I want to announce we are agreeing to create a task force on economic sanctions to examine this whole area. 
I wanted to have a short-term mandate, though, not just the broader policy questions, but to examine what we can do or what should be done about sanctions on India and Pakistan as a result of their nuclear programs. With the recent stories of nuclear tests in south Asia, it is important to look at the U.S. sanctions laws and how they affect our ability to de-escalate the nuclear arms race in the region. 
I have asked the task force to make recommendations to the Senate leadership by July 15, 1998, on sanctions relating to these two countries--India and Pakistan. We will also ask this task force to examine overall issues related to sanctions, legislation, and implementation. 
I have asked the task force to report back to the Senate leadership by September 1, 1998, on the following issues: 
What constitutes a sanction? 
There are many categories of legislative and executive branch action, using economic sanctions in an effort to support policy goals, including restrictions on U.S. Government funds, conditions on the export of sensitive technology, and limitations on normal commercial activity. 
What sanctions are now in place? And what flexibility is provided in these different sanctions? That would be a second question. 
Third: How should success be assessed in determining the effectiveness of these sanctions? When have we done what we wanted to achieve, and then can perhaps remove them? 
Fourth: How should policy goals be defined in considering and implementing these sanctions? 
Are effective procedures in place now to ensure coordination between the executive and legislative branches for the consideration and imposition of sanctions? 
I have to say, I think the answer to that question is no; there is not adequate coordination and communication between the executive and legislative branches in this area of sanctions. 
Are effective procedures in place for oversight and monitoring of the executive branch compliance and implementation 
of existing sanctions? 
I have been stunned by some of the instances that I have seen with regard to Russia and with China where clearly sanctions were called for, should have been almost automatic by the administration, and it did not happen. Why not? And so we need to think about that. 
Should there be a unique Senate floor or committee procedure for considering sanctions legislation? 
Answering all of these questions in the limited timeframe will not be easy, but I am confident this very distinguished and qualified bipartisan group can come up with some very good recommendations. And I hope that the Senate will reserve its judgment and not act in this area until we see what will come out of the task force recommendations. 
The task force will include 18 Members and will be chaired by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He is chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. The cochair will be Senator Biden. The task force will also include Senators Helms, Baucus, Lugar, Dodd, D'Amato, Glenn, Mack, Kerry, Kyl, Leahy, Warner, Levin, Hutchinson, Lieberman, Roberts, and Moynihan. I think you can see this is a very distinguished group. And I know they will have some very important recommendations to the Senate. 
I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.

Mr. LOTT. I thank you, I say to Senator McConnell. 
I do note that Senator Daschle and I have been communicating on this back and forth the last 2 weeks. I am sorry he is not able to be here now. But this is an example of how we do come together and work very carefully and sensibly, hopefully, when it comes to foreign policy questions. And he certainly wanted to go forward with this. I am glad we were able to make this announcement this afternoon. 
I do have a series of bills I believe we can deal with before we adjourn for the week. 
I know Senator Ford here is on behalf of the Democratic leader. So we can go through these pretty quickly.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President I would like to take leader time just to go over the schedule briefly because I know Senators are interested in the balance of the day and when we return. 
This second vote will be the last vote of the week. We did get a good deal accomplished yesterday and I thank Senators for their cooperation on the Department of Defense authorization bill, the military construction appropriations bill and nominations. 
The Senate will recess this afternoon until 12 noon on Monday, July 6, for the Independence Day recess. When we reconvene on Monday, it will be my intention to turn to the Department of Defense appropriations bill. Any votes to occur with respect to that appropriations bill will be stacked to occur on Tuesday, July 7. It is my understanding the managers may have as many as 20 amendments to consider on Monday, and expect to debate those amendments and have votes, then, on Tuesday. 
Before the Senate adjourns, I will ask consent that we turn to the product liability bill. If that request is objected to, then I will move to proceed to that matter and file cloture. That cloture vote will occur, then, on Tuesday, July 7, at 9:30, if it is necessary to file cloture. We will then be asked to consider the IRS reform conference report Tuesday evening, and I do mean Tuesday night, so that we can get work done on appropriations bills, product liability, and the IRS reform. 
There will be no vote occurring, then, on Monday, July 6. There are a lot of conflicts, Senators trying to get back and I am trying to be cooperative on that. But I do want to announce again, as I did earlier today: Expect votes on Mondays and Fridays and expect 12-hour days Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays throughout July. We have to do at least 8 appropriations bills during July. 
If we get our work done, we won't have to have votes at 9 or 10 o'clock. But it would be my intention, if we don't get cooperation, that I would schedule votes at 9 or 10 o'clock every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, because we have to get it done. I hope Senators will stop introducing 100 amendments to every bill. It is ridiculous. If you have three or four important amendments on each side, and I am talking to both sides, fine. But if we call up DOD and there are 150 amendments offered, it just tells you something about the Senate. So we are going to get our work done in July if we have to go way into the night every night. 
Members should be prepared, then, to work on the appropriations bills and the conference reports. We have a time agreement on higher education. We will work to take up bankruptcy, drug czar reauthorization, Internet gambling, pornography and filtering. I thank all Senators for their cooperation. 
I thank Senator Gordon Smith for what he has done to the dress code in the Senate. I think the Senate is looking brighter, lighter, and it is good for our image and, I think, for the country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am truly honored and awed by the beautiful, flowing, wonderful remarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I can assure him that the `House of Lott' will forever treasure his remarks here today. 
I actually was not sure that the Senator was going to do this today. But by accident, coincidence, I had suggested to my wife earlier this morning about 10:30 that she might want to look in on the Senate's activities this morning. I hope that she and my son and daughter-in-law and young grandson have been able to watch this magnificent presentation. 
I could never match, nor would I even attempt to respond in kind to the magnificent statement that has just been given by the Senator from West Virginia. 
The American people have seen once again here this morning what an important and incomparable role that the Senator from West Virginia plays in this body. He is our historian. He is our conscience. He is the one that guarantees that we honor this institution, respect each other, that we are honest and fair with each other, that we think about our country, and that we have moments of great oratory and moments where we reach for that power star in this country and in the world. But only Senator Byrd would take the floor and take the time to talk about the importance of family, fatherhood, grandchildren, and generations yet to come. 
He brings us back to Earth. He makes us appreciate, once again, how really humbled we should be to be here, and that we should always keep our priorities in order. 
History gives us something we can look back toward as we move in the future--great events, great moments, crowning of kings, and war treaties. But in most lives nothing is more important than the birth of your children, your daughter, and your son, and your grandson. 
So I thank him for what he had to say here today, not just for my grandson and me, but what it says about this institution, what it says about our relationship, and what is says about America and the importance of family. 
I am very proud. I am a very proud grandfather. I have a wonderful wife and two wonderful children, and now our grandchild. 
You are right. I have held him in my arms already. I was reduced to a puddle of tears and excitement about this occasion. It really is one of the magic moments in your life. 
But the most wonderful experience I had over the past week was when I took my son to lunch last Sunday to give him a break because it had been a long time through the delivery. And his wife did wonderfully well. And I was talking to him. I said, `Now, son, don't feel like you have to pass the family name on. You know, call him whatever you want.' He said, `Dad, I want to name my son after my best friend.' 
I couldn't say anything more, because I was so proud of him and what he had to say. 
So this is a great event. I am really appreciative of what you had to say, and I am appreciative of being able to serve in this great body. 
Thank you.

Mr. LOTT. This morning the Senate will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Under the previous order, Senator Wellstone will immediately be recognized to offer an amendment regarding Department of Defense schools under a 30-minute time agreement. I see he is here, ready to go. 
At the expiration of that debate time, the Senate will proceed to vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment. Following that vote, there will be 10 minutes for closing remarks with respect to the Inhofe amendment, regarding the base closure issue, with a vote occurring following that debate. There will then be 10 minutes for closing remarks with respect to the Harkin amendment that was debated last night, which deals with the VA health care issue, followed by a vote in relation to that amendment. 
Therefore, three votes will occur beginning, I presume, shortly after 10 o'clock this morning. Following those votes, it is hoped that Members will come to the floor and offer and debate remaining amendments, with the understanding that the bill will be concluded during today's session. I believe that is possible. But once again, it takes cooperation and commitment to agree to reasonable time limits and get to a conclusion on this bill so we can move to a number of other very important issues that we are trying to get cleared, or appropriations bills. 
We will make an effort to get short time agreements with regard to the clean needles bill, the reading excellence bill, the drug czar reauthorization bill, perhaps the higher education bill, and any other appropriations bills that we may take up, plus some Executive Calendar items we would like to be able to get done before we go home for the Fourth of July recess, but they are all related to each other. If we get cooperation on the one side, there will be cooperation on the other; if we don't get cooperation and clearance on the bills, the Executive Calendar will have to wait for another week, month, or year. 
Also, the Senate can be expected to consider, prior to the Independence Day recess, as I mentioned, the higher education bill. I think we are very close to getting an agreement worked out on that. We can expect votes throughout the day, into the night, and on Friday. There will be at least two votes on Friday, and Senators need to be aware of that. 
I yield the floor.

We haven't locked in an agreement to get a sequence of votes on amendments and final passage. If we don't get that done right away, we will be here past 10 o'clock. So it is time we cut our speeches short and get the vote scheduled and bring this to a conclusion. Otherwise, we will be here into the wee hours of the morning. 
I want to thank Senators Warner, McCain, Thurmond, and Levin for trying to put together an agreement. We need to get it done and quit talking and get to the final votes on this defense bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand now that there is one other amendment that will be disposed of without a recorded vote, and then we would be prepared to go to final passage. 
But before we do that, I think it is appropriate that we pause just for a few minutes so that Senator Daschle, and I, on behalf of the entire Senate, can express our appreciation and our admiration for the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
All Senators who would like to express their appreciation and their affection for this distinguished Senator should feel free to do so after the vote on final passage, and put their remarks in the Record. I know that every Senator will want to do that. 
But I think it is appropriate that we name this bill the `Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999.' Just think for a minute what this man has done. He is truly one of the legends of the last half century in this country. Certainly he has had a profound impact on the U.S. Senate, with his perserverance, his unfailing gentlemanliness, his respect for each one of us, the institution, and his strong feelings about the importance of national defense for our country. 
This is a man who has served in a way that probably would take six others of us to even come close to. He was a two-star major general. He was in the Army Reserve after he served in World War II, where he was a hero, having crashed behind enemy lines. He was a judge. He is an author, an attorney, a schoolteacher, Governor, Senator, and Presidential candidate. 
In short, in my opinion, he is `Mr. Defense' in the Senate. I think that after all he has done for us as individuals and for 
this country that it is appropriate tonight that we express our appreciation to him for his leadership, for the tremendous job that he does in getting these important bills through the Senate. They are never easy. The defense authorization bill always takes time and effort. But he is here ready to do battle for what he feels so strongly about--and that is the defense of our country. 
So, Senator Thurmond, we thank you for what you have done for this country. We thank you for what you have done in this Senate, and it is a great honor for me to join others in supporting the naming of this legislation in your honor. 
Thank you, sir. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today S.J. Res. 54 concerning Iraq's violations of the cease-fire agreement that ended Operation Desert Storm in 1991. 
Yesterday, the Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) presented clear and compelling evidence to the U.N. Security Council that Iraq has lied about a critical aspect of its weapons of mass destruction programs. 
UNSCOM has uncovered proof that Iraq has turned the deadly nerve agent known as VX into missile warheads. Iraq still denies the truth today, but no one should be fooled. The proof is certain. 
And no one should be surprised. Iraq has consistently lied to UNSCOM for 8 years. It denied having any biological weapons. Iraq concealed the number of missiles it possessed. Iraq has refused to account for its chemical weapons programs. Iraq has refused to provide access to sites or documents necessary for UNSCOM to complete its work. 
In the past, under both this administration and the previous administration, Iraq's violations led to action on the part of the U.S. Iraq has been found to be in material breach on many occasions which are spelled out in this resolution. Military action has been threatened and even employed to force compliance. 
But now there is a different tune from the Clinton Administration. Now the Clinton Administration is on the defensive. Just keeping U.N. sanctions on seems to be enough--even though a U.S. veto would keep sanctions in place regardless of Russian or French pressure. I cannot understand why the Administration has been so passive in the face of the smoking fun demonstrating Iraq's deception to the world. 
Earlier this year, President Clinton came close to using military force in response to Iraq's violations. Instead, U.N. Secretary General Annan went to Baghdad and made a deal with Saddam Hussein. Hussein promised to do what he has been obligated to do since 1991. In return, a new `Special Envoy' for Iraq was created. Special procedures of certain UNSCOM inspections were laid out. 
If the goal was to avoid the difficult decision to use force, the Clinton Administration was successful. If the goal was to achieve Iraqi compliance with its international obligations, the Clinton Administration has failed. 
In recent months there are a number of signs that the Clinton Administration is abandoning a serious policy toward Iraq. First, U.S. military deployments in the Persian 
Gulf have been reduced. There has been no change in Iraqi behavior. Congress fully funded the deployments through the fiscal year. Yet the force without which diplomacy is empty has been significantly and unilaterally reduced. 
Second, the Administration refuses to support effective opposition to Saddam Hussein. The Congress provided $5 million in support for the Iraqi democratic opposition and required the Administration to submit its plan to Congress for using the money in 30 days. Today, almost 60 days later, we have received no report. 
The Administration has refused to provide direct support to the Iraqi National Congress--the opposition group most effective in challenging Saddam Hussein in the past. Instead, they provided a list of dozens of so-called opposition groups that included fronts for Syrian intelligence, groups compromised by Iraq, groups linked to Iran, and a number of cultural and religious groups with no history in political opposition. This list--and the absence of a report--make it seem the Administration has no interest in an effective policy of supporting the Iraqi opposition. 
Third, the Administration is acting in a very bizarre way in the case of Iraqis detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in California. Six Iraqis involved in efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein--part of more than 6,000 evacuated after Saddam invaded northern Iraq--are now subject to secret deportation proceedings. former CIA Director Woosley is representing them free of charge, but even he has been denied an opportunity to see the alleged `evidence' gathered by INS. Something very suspicious is going on here. The Congress will look at why the executive branch is trying to send Iraqis who supported our goals in Iraq back to certain death at the hands of Saddam Hussein. 
Fourth, the U.S. acquiesced in a dramatic expansion of Iraq's oil exports for the ostensible purpose of feeding Iraqis. The new program, approved just before Secretary General Annan left for Baghdad, allows Iraq to export more than $10 billion a year. This is not about feeding Iraqis--it is about repairing Iraq's oil infrastructure, building roads and otherwise helping Saddam Hussein provide the services he has been denied because of U.N. sanctions. It goes a long way to allowing Saddam Hussein to enjoy the benefits of ending sanctions while the U.S. has received no additional support for keeping sanctions on Iraq. It is a bad deal that seems to be getting worse--for our position. 
Finally, there is the mute response to evidence of the weaponization of VX by Saddam Hussein's regime. This is one of the most deadly substances know to man. A single drop can kill a person. Saddam Hussien had it in missile warheads. He denied it. UNSCOM caught him in his lies--again. 
The Administration needs to do more than simply hear the evidence and say the sanctions should remain. They need to develop and implement a coherent policy that addresses the threat posed by Saddam Hussien's regime. The need to respond--as the U.S. and even the U.N: has responded before to material breaches by Iraq. Instead they are, in effect, looking the other way and hoping the French and Russians are not too offended by UNSCOM. 
This resolution is intended to put pressure on the Administration to act on the information uncovered by UNSCOM. This is a material and unacceptable breach of Iraq's obligations. If the Administration refuses to act, Congress will be forced to step into the vacuum. 
I would like to thank the cosponsors of the resolution: Senators Lieberman, Helms, Kyl, Shelby, Brownback, and McCain. I look forward to continuing to work with them in supporting an effective policy toward Iraq.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the Coverdell education conference report. Under the previous order, after the expiration or yielding back of debate time, the Senate will proceed to vote on the adoption of the conference report. That vote is expected to occur at approximately 11:30 a.m. Following that vote, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the defense authorization bill. 
It is my hope that the defense bill can be concluded soon, hopefully today, certainly tomorrow. In that vein, I want Senators to be on notice that we will plan on working into the night. I have tried very hard all year, and since I have been majority leader, to be sensitive to night sessions so that Members can be with their families, but we must get more work done. We must get this bill done. So Senators can expect a vote around 8 o'clock tonight. That may be moved a little bit one way or the other depending on how the debate is going, but we will have a vote on the defense authorization bill, an amendment, or on a judicial nomination tonight. So just make your plans to be here around 8 o'clock. If the committee wants to continue to work after that, they should do that also. 
So Senators should be on notice that we could very well be in session late Thursday night, and they should be prepared to have votes Friday afternoon at around 2 o'clock. So if you have flights out of here Thursday night, cancel them unless you want to miss some votes. If you plan on leaving Friday morning, cancel it, unless you want to miss some votes. We will be voting as it now stands Friday afternoon. It may be on DOD, if we haven't completed it; it may be on a conference report. It could be on IRS reform and restructuring. I don't think any Senator would want to miss a vote on that conference report. If we could get some more cooperation around here, which we have not been getting, we could maybe not have to do that. But we are going to act on this authorization bill, we are going to move toward appropriations bills, we are going to do conference reports, and we are going to do nominations. 
I asked the Senate to help me. The Senate has not been doing that. And so we will be voting tonight, Thursday night, and Friday afternoon. In fact, I don't have to leave until Saturday afternoon late so I would be delighted to stay here. This sword can be pointed both ways. But we have to go to work, and we have to cooperate with each other on behalf of the country. We are talking about defense authorization. Is there a more important bill we will do this year? We are developing a hollow military. We are not funding defense adequately, and yet we have military men and women steaming all over the world, stretched to the limit. It is ridiculous that we are here arguing over details when we ought to be acting on this very important bill. 
If you have amendments, what are you waiting on? Get over here and offer them, because I have already heard, `Well, I haven't had my chance yet.' This is the sixth day, I believe, we have been on this bill. If you have an amendment, come offer it. Otherwise, I would like to move to third reading and just let the chips fall where they will because enough is enough. If you have an amendment that is important, you should be over here at 11:30 to offer it as soon as we go back to that bill. 
Rollcall votes should be expected throughout the day. We are still working to try to get an agreement on the Higher 
Education Act. There is a great deal of irresponsibility on that act; Senators are saying, oh, I have two, three, six amendments. This bill expires, the authorization expires July 1, and we are not going to have it passed in the Senate. I think that is a real problem also. 
I mentioned the IRS reform conference report. We have at least four appropriations bills that are ready, and we would like to work with both sides to see if we could not clear some Executive Calendar nominations. For instance, the Amtrak board, if we don't approve the board by July 1, the Amtrak authorization expires. Now, anybody who wants their Amtrak efforts last year to be for naught better be thinking about it, because if we don't get the authorization, we don't get the reforms, we are not going to get the money in the future. I have been a supporter of Amtrak, but I said last year it is the last time. We are going to do it right or we are not going to get the money we need in the future. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I again thank Senator Coverdell and his colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked on this very important education bill. I am excited, honestly excited, that we are about to pass one of the most important education bills that the Senate has acted on in years to encourage more savings for our children's education, for their needs. That is certainly worthwhile. 
I particularly note that in addition to Senator Coverdell, Senator Torricelli has been very helpful, sticking to his guns against a lot of opposition. It would encourage prepaid tuition. Twenty-one States have that program. My State has that program. It will be very helpful to get tax benefits of prepaid college tuition. Also, we should encourage employers to give employees benefits for pursuing higher education. This is a really great bill. I believe it will pass with a wide bipartisan margin, and I believe that education will benefit and children in America will be better off because of it. 
So I thank those who have been involved. I think it will be one of the most important things that we have done this year. I hope the President will find it in his heart to sign this legislation. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Hutchinson is now in a position to have the pending China human rights issue withdrawn. 
However, before the Senator is recognized, let me put the Senate on notice as to where the bill is going, hopefully, for the next few days, which will take some cooperation, but I believe we are going to get it. I certainly hope so. 
Following the withdrawal of the China issue and a statement by Senator Hutchinson--and I believe he is on the floor and ready to proceed--the Senate will resume consideration of the DOD authorization until approximately 5 p.m. At that time, the Senate will turn to the Coverdell A+ conference report for approximately 2 hours of debate tonight. The Senate will resume the conference report consideration on Wednesday at 9:30 and, therefore, the vote on final passage will occur around 11:30 on Wednesday on the Coverdell A+ education bill. 
The Senate will then resume the DOD authorization bill. It is the hope of both leaders that the bill can move forward and be concluded by the close of business on Wednesday. I realize that is a big order, but we are calling on our leadership.

Mr. LOTT. Wednesday of this week, or Thursday at the latest, because we do have a lot of other work to do. 
I realize there are some, I don't know, 150 amendments pending. Who are we kidding? That is not only not serious, that is totally laughable. This is the Department of Defense authorization bill which we need to do for our country. This is a bill that the Armed Services Committee has already done the bulk of the work on. While I realize there are a lot of policy issues, a lot of amendments that Senators would like to offer, I hope they will cooperate and we can get this bill completed in a reasonable period of time. This is the fifth day that we have been on the DOD authorization bill. 
Tomorrow will be the sixth day. So we need to get it concluded. I do now put the Senate on notice that I intend to call up H.R. 2358, relative to the China human rights issue, sometime after July 6, 1998. I will notify all Members when the date has been finalized so all Members will have time to prepare for it. This is an important issue for our country. Senators on the Democratic side have said we should not debate this while the President is going to China. I think, as a matter of fact, that the reverse is the case--that we should make our point, express the Senate's concern on these very important issues before the President goes, but not necessarily while he is there. It is an issue that we need to address further, and we are going to do that sometime after July 6. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following a brief statement by Senator Hutchinson, the motion to recommit be automatically withdrawn.

I join in expressing my appreciation to the Senator from Arizona for the work that he has done in taking this issue up in the Commerce Committee, being willing to deal with it, being willing to deal with the criticism both in this Chamber and other venues for the effort he has made. Also, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his cooperation in a number of ways, in the way he worked with Senator McCain. 
I do have some requests to ask that have been cleared with Senator Daschle, or he is aware of what I am going to ask for. After I make these motions, then I would like to just make some brief comments. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to file a cloture motion on the committee amendment to the tobacco bill, and at the hour of 5:15 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on the cloture motion with the mandatory quorum under rule XXII having been waived. 
I further ask that the time between now and 5:15 be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. I further ask, if cloture is invoked, Members have until the close of business today to file first-degree amendments and until 10 a.m. on Thursday to file second-degree amendments.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was going to explain that after I had asked these unanimous-consent requests. Since the Senator has asked, there has been a request and efforts made in the past to get cloture, to have cloture filed and have votes. We have had three of those. This is a cloture motion that we will vote on, instead of 2 days from now, go ahead and vote today to see where we are. 
It is my intention to vote against cloture. I still think we should not cut off some of the amendments and substitutes that could be offered. We also still have the pending problem of what to do about farmers in this issue. But I think we need to see where we are. 
I have, over the past several weeks, been hoping that we could come to some resolution on this matter, but we have spent 78 hours or more now and 56 minutes--I guess it is probably closer to 80 or 82 hours. I don't see how we are going to conclude this just by moving along at the slow pace we have been moving along. I think we need to see where the votes are. This cloture vote will give us that opportunity. I think it is important that we not have this vote occur next Monday or next Tuesday. If we file cloture today or tomorrow, that will be the result. After this cloture vote, then we will make a decision where to go from there.

Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the motion has to be filed to get a vote on the cloture process. It doesn't mean that you will vote for cloture, and I don't want any inference to be made here that this is unusual. This is, as Senators on both sides know, done quite often by majority leaders, that they file cloture and on occasion vote against that cloture. So this is just a process to get us to a vote, to see where the Senate is, to see if the Senate is ready to cut off debate, and there is nothing unusual about that at all.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am sure that a lot of people will read into that vote and other votes any number of things, and I am sure that it will be described by Senators on both sides of the aisle in the way they would like to describe it, maybe even going so far as to impugn the integrity of Senators based on that vote. 
But all that means to me, as the Senator says, is that we should not waive the Budget Act. We agreed to the Budget Act; we agreed to the budget last year. That is one of the major problems with this whole bill. The original concept that we try to get some limits on teenage smoking, to stop teenage smoking and drug abuse and to deal with some of the problems caused by smoking, that is one thing, but it has gone far, far afield from that. 
I had planned to comment on some of those later, but I will go ahead and mention them now. The micromanaging in this bill, 
the exceeding of the budget caps--what really has happened here, while we have a good principle that we can all vote on something right now that will deal with teenage smoking if we wanted to and health problems caused by smoking, what has happened is a lot of people have figured out, `Oh, look, this is a cookie jar, this is a bill we can use to pay for all these programs that we are not going to be able to pay for'----

Mr. LOTT. `For these programs under the strictures of the budget agreement we had just last year.' The Washington Post outlined it pretty clearly today. It is going to be tough to get the appropriations bills done, to get a budget done this year because of the constraints that we agreed to. 
This bill violates the Budget Act in several instances, I think about six different points. At least one of them we are pointing out here today. That is all it means, that you don't want to waive the Budget Act, that we have agreed to pass this bill that started out well-intentioned, but has grown like top seed to the point where we have to decide whether we want to take this cup from our lips and move on or not.

Mr. LOTT. So everyone is clear, the cloture vote will occur at 5:15. Following that vote, if not invoked, the Senate will proceed--well, will have 10 minutes equally divided, and then proceed to the second vote on the motion to waive the Budget Act to allow Senator Stevens and somebody on your side, some designee on your side, to speak on the particular budget point of order. 
Therefore, there would be then two back-to-back votes at 5:15, with the 10-minute interval between those two votes.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I agree with that part of it. It is a sorry mess. We have gotten into gridlock. And there are lots of explanations for that. I don't think we should start blaming one Senator or one side or the other. 
But I wanted to commend the Senator from California for the efforts that I was under the impression she had been making with Senator Hatch and others, perhaps on both sides of the aisle, to come up with a bill much different from what is before us--smaller, probably, by $100 billion, with all the components that would really be needed. 
I want to remind the Senate that I have given a lot of time and a lot of personal effort and have taken a lot of flak for trying to find a way to get a bill through here that was responsible enough that we could choke it down in a reasonable period of time, and we are not there. And I cannot figure any way to get a bill that would be credible that we could get through here. 
In fact, when we have had some critical votes, they went the wrong way. I am not blaming that on one side or the other. There were some votes on our side that were really disturbing to me, that you are really trying to get something. 
But what is wrong with this bill now is it has lost sight of the original noble cause of just dealing with the question of teenage smoking and drug abuse, if you want to add that--and I think we should--and some limited effort to address the problems for the States on health problems caused by smoking or research. 
But we are talking about a bill very different than what you are talking about. If we could wind up somewhere in the area that you are talking about, I would support that. And I want to note that when this point of order is sustained, or we do not waive the Budget Act, the bill does not disappear. It goes back to the Commerce Committee. 
There has also been a suggestion that we consider having a task force to see if we could come up with something that could 
resurrect this in a way that would be much smaller, to do what we say that we want done, but without these massive micromanaging government controls that we see in this bill. 
Most Senators are not happy with this bill. I mean, some don't like it because of, perhaps, the marriage penalty tax, although I think, generally speaking, everybody realizes that is going to happen; it is a good idea. 
But we have major problems with it over here. But we are stalled out with no end in sight. Even if we get cloture today, which, you know, I hope we don't, there are about seven other opportunities for cloture motions to be filed. 
The Senate, in its unique way, has not reached a consensus here. We have not reached a consensus. It is like Senator McCain has said before: We can guarantee a vote; we can't guarantee a result. And until we find a way we can get together on something that is much smaller, that is targeted and limited, that is not just more Government from Washington, dictates from Washington--I mean, this thing even has requirements in here that not only you can't have smoking in Federal buildings, you can't even have smoking in front of Federal buildings.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for our nation's computer and electronic industries. As you are well aware, the Administration's export policies prohibit American companies from selling state-of-the-art encryption technology abroad without recovery keys and back door access. Encryption is a series of mathematical formulas that scramble and unscramble data and communications. It is used to thwart computer hackers, industrial and foreign espionage agents, and criminals from gaining access to and reading sensitive personal, business, and military communications. The higher the bit-key length, the more difficult it is for unauthorized persons to break the code. Technically advanced encryption ensures that an individual's medical, financial, business, personal records and electronic-mail cannot be accessed without their consent. The Administration is now promoting the deployment of recovery keys so designated third parties would be able to access and share with law enforcement the computer data and communications of American citizens without their knowledge. Currently, government mandated key escrow is not required and is opposed by the computer industry, privacy advocates, legal scholars, and by many members of Congress.  
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19980617</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Even though a national recovery system would be technically unfeasible, costly, and violates an individual's privacy rights, the Administration continues to require key escrow as a precondition for relaxing America's encryption policy. Again, Mr. President, I would point out that state-of-the-art encryption is available in the international marketplace without key recovery and without backdoor access. This backdoor door requirement is simply backward thinking policy. It does not make sense to hold the computer industry hostage to force the creation of such an unworkable system.

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-3-19980617</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Even though advanced encryption products are widely available across the globe, the White House continues to stall Congressional and industry attempts to reach a sensible market oriented solution to the nation's outdated encryption export regime. This stonewalling tactic will only cede even more of our nation's technology market to foreign competitors and America will lose forever its ability to sell encryption technology at home and abroad. 
It is time to change America's export policy before it is too late. If the Administration will not do what is right, reform its export regime, then Congress must enact encryption reform during this session. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-4-19980617</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. That's right. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Trusted Information Systems found that hundreds of foreign companies sell over 600 encryption products from 29 countries. It is even possible to download some of the strongest technology available, 128-bit key length encryption, off of the Internet. Clearly, America's policy of restricting the sale of American encryption software and hardware has not impacted the availability and use of this technology throughout the globe. 
No one disputes the fact that the development and use of robust encryption worldwide will continue with or without U.S. business participation. What is particularly disturbing to me is that export controls, instead of achieving their intended purpose, have only served to deny America's premier computer industry the opportunity to compete on a level playing field with foreign competitors. Costing our economy and our nation billions of dollars and the loss of countless American jobs in the process. Given the wide availability of encryption technology, continuing to restrict U.S. access to foreign markets makes no sense.

Mr. LOTT. I think it is worth repeating to my colleagues that the Administration's approach to encryption makes no sense. It is not good policy. Continuing to restrict the foreign sale of American encryption technology that is already available abroad, or will soon be available, is anti-business, anti-consumer, anti-jobs, and anti-innovation. 
The time for a change in America's export regime is long overdue. Unfortunately, the Administration continues to support its outmoded and competition-adverse encryption control policy. That is why this Congress needs to find a legislative solution to this issue. 
If America's export controls are not relaxed now, then Congress places in peril our entire technology industry. Not just those companies that create and market encryption products and services, but virtually every company involved in the development and sale of computer hardware and software. Congress cannot and will not put America's entire technological base at risk for an ineffective and outmoded export policy on encryption.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, if they would go ahead and be seated if they are in the Chamber--I note that there are a number of our colleagues who are still not here--we will go into a quorum call momentarily to allow Senators to reach the Chamber and be seated. 
Also, those who are here, I want to note that the camera is located in this corner over to your right. So I ask that all Senators turn their chairs toward the camera. We need to be able to see the camera. The photographer will then take eight pictures, so there will be eight flashes. 
Once we get started, it should not take very long. But it would be helpful if the Senators who are in the Chamber would take their seats so that when the others arrive we will be able to go straight to the pictures.

I also want to note once again, as I did earlier, the camera that will be taking the picture is over my right shoulder here in the corner. If both sides of the aisle would adjust chairs where you can see the camera, we could get a good shot. The photographer will take 8 pictures with 8 flashes. Once we get all Senators in their chairs, it shouldn't take but just a few minutes to get that done. 
After the photograph is taken, we will go, I believe immediately without any intervening debate, to a vote on the Gorton amendment. Then we will go to the next Democrat amendment. 
Those of you that are due to be at a bill signing ceremony about 3 o'clock should be able to make it. If all Senators would take their seats we should be ready to go momentarily.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senate Minority Leader Daschle, in introducing legislation which removes an unintended yet troublesome legal obstacle to recycling. 
It is not a widely known fact that Superfund is biased against recycling. I am confident that the authors of the statute did not intend to favor new materials over those that have been recycled, but we now live with this unintended consequence. 
Mr. President, our bill corrects current law and encourages recycling. It simply recognizes that recycling is not disposal and that recyclables are not wastes. Common sense tells us that recycling something is not the same as disposing of it. 
Nonetheless, Mr. President, those who sell materials for recycling are being pulled into Superfund cleanups because, under the law, selling recyclable materials is equivalent to `arranging for disposal.' Our bill waives Superfund liability for those who are legitimately recycling these goods. Clearly, recycling is not disposal--it is the opposite. 
The Superfund Recycling Equity Act is necessary to correct Superfund's fundamental bias against recycled materials. Under current law, recyclable materials, such as paper, glass, plastic, metals and textiles cannot be competitive with new materials. This bill will help level the playing field between the use of recycled goods and competitive virgin raw materials. Currently, suppliers of virgin raw materials face no Superfund liability for contamination caused by their customer. This bill would provide the same waiver to those who sell recyclable materials. 
Mr. President, this bill also contains protections to ensure that sham recyclers are unable to benefit from this exemption. In order for recyclers to be relieved of Superfund liability, they must act in an environmentally sound manner and sell their product to manufacturers with environmentally responsible business practices. Considering that most recyclers are currently operating in a reasonable and conscience manner, this should be an easy test. 
Mr. President, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act is the product of lengthy negotiations between the federal and state governments, the environmental community and the scrap recycling industry. These negotiations have resulted in a bill that I believe to be both environmentally and fiscally sound. 
Americans nationwide have embraced the benefits of recycling. We know that increased recycling means the more efficient use of our natural resources. By removing the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, we will encourage more recycling. 
I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will lend their support to this targeted and much-needed reform bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Lieutenant Commander Gary Mayes, who has served with distinction for the past two years in the Navy's Senate Liaison Office. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he has provided this legislative body, the Navy and our great Nation. 
Lieutenant Commander Mayes is a graduate of Purdue University and was commissioned an Ensign upon graduation from Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida, in May 1988. He proceeded to flight training where he received his `Wings of Gold' and was designated a Naval Aviator in October 1989. 
Lieutenant Commander Mayes' first assignment in the Navy was as a pilot flying the UH-1N and C-12B at Naval Air Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from July 1990 to May 1991. Following training in the SH-60B Seahawk helicopter, he reported to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron, Light Four Eight (HSL-48) as the Detachment Five Assistant Maintenance Officer. He qualified as an Aircraft Commander and deployed aboard USS Boone (FFG-28) to the Mediterranean. He was next assigned to Detachment One as the Maintenance Officer during Operation Support Democracy to Haiti while embarked on USS Spruance (DD-963). He also was deployed on USS Comte de Grasse in 1995, flying missions in support of exercise UNITAS around South America. 
Lieutenant Commander Mayes joined the Navy's Senate Liaison team in January 1996. During his service as a Navy Liaison Officer, he provided members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, personal staffs, as well as Senators from both sides of the aisle, with timely support regarding Navy plans, programs and constituent casework. His valuable contributions have enabled Congress and the Department of the Navy to work close together to preserve the well-trained and well-equipped naval forces upon which our country has come to depend. 
Mr. President, Gary Mayes, his wife Stephanie and their daughter Gabrielle have made many sacrifices during his 10-year Navy career. He has served proudly with a dedication and enthusiasm that only comes from our Nation's best and brightest. Lieutenant Commander Mayes is a great credit to both our Navy and our country. As he now departs to attend the Marine Corps Command and Staff War College, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and following seas.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill. As a reminder to all Senators, any votes ordered today with respect to the bill will occur at 5 p.m. this evening. I believe there is one amendment that there may be a vote on. We should expect a vote at 5 o'clock, and it will probably be very close to 5 in order to accommodate Senators who will have to leave shortly thereafter. It is expected that no more than two votes will be ordered today. 
Pending is the amendment of Senator Reed of Rhode Island regarding the deductibility of tobacco advertising. We hope to lock in that vote for 5. But we will notify Members if it is going to be any different from that. It is hoped that the next Republican amendment can also be offered today. The vote on that may follow the vote on the Reed amendment. But, again, that has not been locked in yet. 
We may also attempt to reach an agreement with regard to the Higher Education Act. We made some progress on that last week. There are some concerns still pending. But we will have the committee chairman and the Members working on the Higher Education Act. We need to get that completed. We have extended the time for the loans and grants under that act for 90 days. We don't have the July 1 deadline that would cause the students not to get their loans and grants, but the program expires July 1. We need to try to get that legislation moved as soon as possible. 
We also have the NASA authorization bill and the drug czar office reauthorization bill, as well as other legislation or Executive Calendar items that may be cleared for action. 
Any votes with regard to other items on the tobacco bill will occur then on Tuesday morning at a time to be determined by the two leaders--probably around 9:30 or 10. But we will need to see if we have something ready by then. 
The official photo for the 105th Congress will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, June 16, at 2:15 p.m. All Senators are asked to be in the Chamber and seated at their desk at that time. Again, at 2:15 tomorrow, Tuesday, we will take the official photograph. This is the best time, looking at everybody's schedules and illnesses that we have been having to work around. But we want to get this done. We plan on doing it tomorrow. 
One final point: We expect that the education conference report will be available one day this week--maybe Wednesday. That is the Coverdell A+ issue with some other parts that were added to it in the Senate. I believe this is a conference report that will have broad bipartisan support. We will take that up when the conference report is available. 
Observing no Senator wishing to speak, I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, there will be no further votes tonight. The Senate will debate a Democratic amendment and the Gramm amendment to the tobacco bill during the remainder of today's session and Friday's session of the Senate. The Senate could also consider the higher education bill, or vocational education, or NASA authorization, or the reauthorization of the Drug Czar office. These are all bills that are relatively noncontroversial, or there may be an amendment or two that Senators want to offer. We are trying to take advantage of time that may be available tomorrow to consider one of these bills. We want all Senators to be aware that we are trying to clear one of these four to be considered tomorrow after the Democratic amendment and the Gramm amendment. However, there will be no votes during the session on Friday. There will just be debate on these two amendments and any bill that can be cleared out of this group of four. 
Any votes ordered with respect to the amendments on the legislation just identified, the tobacco bill, will be postponed to occur on Monday at a time to be determined by the two leaders, but not before 5 o'clock. We would like, though, to have those two votes back-to-back on the two amendments, if they are necessary, to the tobacco bill, as close to 5 o'clock as possible. We may begin at 5, or shortly thereafter, and have the two back-to-back. Then any vote, if necessary on any bill that is cleared, would not occur until Tuesday morning at approximately 9:30 or 10 o'clock. We will make that specific time available later.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a criminal prosecution brought against Jack L. Williams and Archibald R. Schaffer, III, representatives of Tyson Foods, Inc., alleging illegal gratuities to officials of the Department of Agriculture, including former Secretary Espy, and related charges. The Independent Counsel, who is bringing this prosecution, seeks evidence from an employee of the Senate on the professional staff of the Appropriations Committee about communications with meat and poultry processing industry representatives and Executive Branch officials about a labeling rule promulgated by the Agriculture Department in 1993. The defense may also call Senator Bumpers to testify. 
This resolution would authorize testimony and document production by Senator Bumpers and employees of the Senate, except where a privilege should be asserted, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as most Senators are aware, there is a signing ceremony at the White House at 5:30 on the highway transportation bill, so a large number of Senators will be there for that occasion. But we thought it was important we get a vote on the drug-related amendment this afternoon. So we have checked with parties on both sides. 
I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on amendment No. 2451 at 6 p.m. this evening, and immediately following that vote the Senate proceed to vote on the Democratic alternative, with the time between now and 6 o'clock to be equally divided on the issue of drugs. 
I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following the granting of this consent, the Democratic leader be recognized to offer their alternative, and the Coverdell amendment be temporarily laid aside for that purpose.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators--and I know Senator Kerry will want to comment; but I want to make it clear what we have done here--these two votes will be the two votes that will begin at 6 p.m., with one right behind the one at 6. They will be the last two votes of the evening. 
Following those two votes, we will continue to work on a similar agreement, which we have not yet gotten everybody to sign off on, that will provide for votes on the marriage penalty and the self-deductibility of taxes issue by midday on Wednesday. We are working to see if we can get an agreement to have a vote at 1 o'clock, followed by an alternative that the Democrats would offer. 
We do have a joint meeting in the morning to hear the President of South Korea at 10 o'clock. So we will not actually be able to get started on the marriage penalty and its alternative discussion until about 11 o'clock. But Senators will be notified when the second cloture vote will occur and the marriage penalty votes will occur during Wednesday's session of the Senate, we assume shortly after the noon hour; hopefully by 1 or 2 o'clock. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a great day for America's drivers, rail passengers, and freight haulers. Today, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) has been signed into law. TEA21 will lead to better, safer, and less congested roads and bridges throughout the country. This extremely important transportation legislation is a great investment in our nation's future. 
I applaud my colleagues, in both chambers of Congress, and on both sides of the aisle, for passing the Transportation Equity Act by overwhelming majorities. 
Transportation is one of the few issues that Congress deals with that clearly and directly impacts every American, every day. That is why it was so imperative that both chambers take swift action on this important infrastructure bill. Whether driving to work, participating in a car pool, taking a commuter train, riding a school bus, hauling goods from one city to the next, or transporting an accident victim to the nearest hospital, Americans depend on safe roads, highways, and bridges to get them to their ultimate destination. 
When the extended Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) ran out on May 1, Congress recognized the importance of getting this new reauthorization legislation passed. A number of states could have been in serious jeopardy had Congress waited beyond the Memorial Day recess to enact the Transportation Equity Act. Now that the President has acted on this landmark transportation bill, I am proud that Congress has fulfilled one of our most important responsibilities to the American people. Authorizing road and bridge improvements into the next century is a significant accomplishment. This act alone should dispel the notion that this Congress has done nothing. 
The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) deals with a wide range of highway, transit, research, recreational, safety and environmental policy initiatives. TEA21 is a balanced and effective infrastructure bill that will enhance our nation's roads and highways. TEA21 extends and improves upon many of the provisions contained in ISTEA, helping move America forward into the next century. It furthers the notion of an efficient and integrated national intermodal transportation system. This unified system links America's 161,000 mile National Highway System with state and local roads, ports, trade corridors, and airports. TEA21 is necessary for our nation's prosperity. 
The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century provides a total of $216 billion for infrastructure development and improvements. That represents a 40% boost in transportation spending over current levels. This bill affects every state, every county and every city, providing significantly more money for the projects around the country that need and deserve federal assistance. TEA21 provides $173 billion for highways, $41.3 billion for mass transit, and $1.7 billion for highway safety programs. That translates into an annual highway spending increase of $8 billion and about $2 billion more annually for mass transit. Every year, $10 billion more will be spent on needed infrastructure. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the Transportation Equity Act, as its title implies, provides more equity than the formula allocations provided by ISTEA. Under TEA21, each state is guaranteed to receive at least 90.5 cents for every dollar that its drivers send to Washington through the gas pump. As a result, forty-nine states will receive more money, with an average increase of about 44% over their current allocation levels. Even Massachusetts, the one state that did not receive a funding increase, will still get back more than it contributes annually to the Highway Trust Fund. 
Many of the beneficiaries of the Act's minimum guarantee are the southern, midwestern, and western states commonly referred to as donor states. For years, these states have received far less in highway funding than they contributed in gas tax revenues. While TEA21 doesn't completely eliminate their donor status, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, Montana, among other donor states, will for the first time see an overall increase of more than 50% and a return of more than 90 cents on the dollar. 
My home state of Mississippi, for example, will receive 92 cents. That's a 58% increase over the state's current gas tax return. While this is not a perfect dollar for dollar exchange, it represents significant progress that will help pave a great number of dirt and other substandard roads in Mississippi. In the years to come, I will continue my efforts to improve the formula allocation for all donor states. 
Mr. President, TEA21 also re-establishes the covenant with our nation's drivers. It insures that each dollar of revenue contributed to the Highway Trust Fund is spent on transportation priorities and not on other initiatives. While this bill does not take the Highway Trust Fund off-budget, it does guarantee a minimum of $200.5 billion will be spent over the next six years on highways, safety, and mass transit programs. TEA21 also ensures that Congress fulfills its obligation to live within the Balanced Budget Agreement. 
TEA21 authorizes bridge repair and improvement projects around the country. It supports the preservation of national historic covered bridges and includes funding that will allow states to retrofit bridges so they will be less prone to earthquake damage. Additionally, the bill provides $900 million to replace the decaying Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, a 35 year old structure that now carries more than twice the 72,000 vehicles it was built to withstand. At the current rate of deterioration, passenger and freight traffic will be forced to stop in seven years. This is a major crossing on America's East-Coast highway that carries over 190,000 cars and trucks daily. That is why TEA21 was correct to step in. 
I believe Congress has passed a bill that not only improves and enhances America's transportation system, but one that enriches our nation's economy and our quality of life. New roads and bridges spur economic development, increase mobility, and foster connectivity. For each dollar spent on our nation's infrastructure, society receives an exponential financial and social return on this public investment. In fact, economist Thomas Hogarty recently concluded that motor vehicle transport yields $6 trillion to $10 trillion in tangible benefits annually. That's trillion with a `t.' Good roads, good bridges, and good transit systems facilitate the movement of people and supplies from the suburbs to major metropolitan areas and back, from one region of the country to another and from America to across the globe. Aside from heightening intrastate and interstate travel and trade, transportation improvements also support the creation of better and higher paying jobs. In Mississippi, for example, road work over the last ten years has helped prompt a 34% increase in the state's growth rate. I am very excited about the economic prospects for Mississippi under TEA21. 
Mr. President, passage of the Transportation Equity Act will help repeat Mississippi's success story in each and every state. Infrastructure expenditures directly and indirectly support the 10 million people employed by our nation's transportation and related industries. In fact, Congressional Quarterly recently reported that TEA21 will lead to the creation of 400,000 new jobs throughout the United States. 
TEA21 will strengthen our trade relationships with neighbors to the north and south of our nation's borders. TEA21 provides $700 million for trade and border crossings, and supports the continued development I-69, an 1,800 mile interstate that will stretch between nine states, from the Texas border with Mexico to Michigan's border with Canada. This Pan-American roadway, with vital regional connectors, will promote economic development all along its path. Additionally, I-69 will help virtually every state by fostering interstate and international commerce, helping our nation realize the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
The Transportation Equity Act is also a bill about safety. It provides over $2 billion for highway safety programs and authorizes $650 million in motor carrier safety grants. One of the many important reforms in TEA21 is the $500 million seat belt program which provides incentive grants to states that increase their seat belt usage or that exceed the national average. The Act also takes aim at drunk driving. It provides grants to states that have or adopt the more strict 0.08 percent blood-alcohol standard. TEA21 also promotes the development of airbags that do a better job of protecting children and smaller adults. 
One of the issues that I felt very strongly about was the creation of a program to encourage states to improve their one-call system. As this Congress focused on our surface infrastructure, I felt it was important to include protections for our underground infrastructure. This took the form of a national call-before-you-dig system used to prevent accidents at underground facilities such as telephone, cable and power lines, water-maines and pipelines. A number of serious accidents have been caused by excavation without notice or by inaccurate markings of underground lines. While 49 states have one-call programs, it is widely recognized that many states' systems need to be strengthened. 
Under TEA21, states that significantly improve their current one-call systems will qualify to receive federal grants. TEA21's one-call provision does not impose a federal mandate or establish a one-size-fits-all approach. It merely establishes national goals and offers states that want to participate the opportunity to apply for assistance. Decisions on a state's one-call system will still be left up to each state. The identification of minimum standards, however, will offer states a guide-post to help them improve their systems should they choose to do so. I believe that this non-prescriptive approach to state one-call systems will significantly enhance public safety, minimize disruptions, and improve environmental protection. 
The Transportation Equity Act is also an environmental bill. It establishes private sector mitigation banks in support of wetlands, and streamlines the environmental review process for transportation projects. Senator Bond and Senator Breaux championed these much needed fixes. TEA21 also increases annual funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program and for Transportation Enhancements to $1.5 billion and $630 million respectively. Additionally, the bill extends the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which supports sportfish restoration and boat safety programs, and provides to the fund an additional 1.5 cents per gallon of fuel tax revenues in fiscal year 2002, and another 2 cents after 2003. Another one of the important compromises achieved in this bill involves the harmonization of the Environmental Protection Agency's schedule for regulating regional haze and the 2.5 particulate matter standard. 
This bill also authorizes several transportation research programs which will help our nation adapt to and utilize constantly changing technologies that will improve safety, ease congestion, and protect the environment. 
Mr. President, I would like to conclude by thanking our colleagues who were instrumental in crafting and passing this landmark bill. First, my heartfelt appreciation goes out to Senator John Chafee for his stewardship of this important, responsible, and historic transportation package. I also want to pay special tribute to Senator Warner, Senator Baucus, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Bond, and Senator Nickles because their guidance and leadership proved vital to this effort. I also want to recognize Senator Domenici for his efforts to ensure that the desired funding levels fell within the budget caps. Without his help, we may well have ended up with a much smaller bill. 
All of the Senate conferees deserve a great deal of credit for bringing this much-needed transportation bill to fruition. Each and every one of them rolled up their sleeves and worked with Congressman Bud Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the House conferees to produce the largest infrastructure bill in U.S. history. 
Lastly, a number of Senate staff worked long and hard on this bill. They worked many weekends and frequently late into the night. Mr. President, our colleagues know that staff provide invaluable assistance as public policy is formulated. Here they were essential. On behalf of our nation's highway users, I would like to thank each of them. I believe it is important to identify the staff directly involved in TEA21. 
From the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works: Daniel Corbett; Albert Dahlberg; Stephanie Daigle; Chris Hessler; Abigail Kinnison; Ann Loomis; Jason Patlis; Jimmie Powell; Kathy Ruffalo; Tom Sliter; Ellen Stein; Sharon Tucker; and Linda Willard. 
From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation: Ann Begeman; Carl Bentzel; Moses Boyd; Lance Bultena; Charlotte Casey; Timothy Cook; Penny Dalton; James Drewry; Clyde Hart; Clark LeBlanc; John Raidt; and Sloan Rappoport. 
From the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: Robert Drozdowski; Rachel Forward; Loretta Garrison; Steven Harris; Peggy Kuhn; Howard Menell; and Joseph Mondello. 
From the Senate Committee on the Budget: William Hoagland; Brian Riley; and Austin Smythe. 
From the Senate Legislative Counsel: Janine Johnson. 
The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senator: Rob Alexander; Steven Apicella; Mark Ashby; Doug Benevento; Renee Bennett; Kirsten Beronia; Chad Bradley; Rick Dearborn; Steve Dye; Mike Egan; James English; Tracy Henke; Keith Hennessey; Timothy Hess; Gerry Gilligan; Chris Jahn; Arnie Kupferman; Adam Lawrence; Stephanie Leger; Ryan Leonard; Lisa Linnell; James McCarthy; Stephen McMillin; Ashley Miller; Beth Miller; Liz O'Donoghue; Justin Oliver; Brigitta Pari; Peter Phipps; Mark Prater; Chris Prins; Darla Romfo; Joyce Rechtscheffen; Brad Robinson; Peter Rogoff; Jason Rupp; Christine Russell; David Russell; Pamela Sellers; Joshua Sheinkmen; Becky Shipp; Gary Smith; Dave Thompson; Polly Trottenberg; Joseph Trujillo; Mitch Warren; Andrew Wheeler; Melissa White; Clay Williams; and Drew Willision. 
Again, these individuals worked very hard on the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and the Senate owes them a debt of gratitude for their dedicated service to this legislation. 
Mr. President, now that President Clinton has signed The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, our nation has enacted the foundation of our infrastructure for the next millennium. TEA21 will improve interstate and international commerce, stimulate our economy, protect our environment, and foster the use of modern transportation technologies. 
With TEA21, American's can now look forward to better, safer and less congested roads and bridges throughout the nation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of the Coverdell drug amendment pending to the tobacco legislation. As a reminder to all Members, under a previous order, a cloture vote on the tobacco committee substitute will occur at 2:15 p.m. today. Members have until 12:30 p.m. in order to file second-degree amendments. And with respect to the second cloture motion which was filed, all Members have until 12:30 in order to file first-degree amendments. 
It is hoped that a vote could occur on the Coverdell drug amendment prior to the cloture vote today. Therefore, rollcall votes can be expected this morning prior to the recess for the party caucuses to meet. If the first cloture motion is not invoked--and I expect it will not be--I will be consulting with the minority leader for the timing with regard to the second cloture vote, which would occur some time on Wednesday. It could occur on Wednesday morning, but it will depend on other developments in the interim. Also during today's session, the Senate may consider any legislative or executive items cleared for action. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 to allow for the weekly party caucuses to meet.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I listened with great interest to the comments of the Senator from Rhode Island about these two amendments. I urge him to think about the end game and not just look at this vote or this amendment at this time. Like everybody else around here, people are assuming that if we have a bad bill at this point--which we do--or if we add an amendment here or there, that is going to become law. Somebody needs to think about how do we get to an end result that will achieve the things we want. 
If there ever is a bill, it will have a teenage smoking cessation campaign and it will have a drug abuse cessation 
campaign. It is very appropriate that we tie these two together. It will have additional help for health programs that have been affected by smoking. NIH, obviously, would be a major beneficiary, and it should be. We need research on the health problems caused by smoking. Medicaid and Medicare--that would be the end result. Somebody better think about how do you ever get an end result. If we don't add something on marriage penalty, tax relief, and on drugs, there won't be a bill. There will not be a bill. 
I want to remind everybody how we got to this point. First of all, Senator McCain, the manager of the bill, chairman of the Commerce Committee, had hearings; his committee met. They reported the bill out. I think it was 19 or 20-1. Republicans and Democrats voted for it. All of them had to sort of hold their noses, knowing there were too many things in here that were the wrong thing to do, and they had gone too far. They had some problems, but they got it done. It was a Republican chairman and every Republican but one voted to report it out of that committee. 
I want the record to show, once again, that I am the guy that called up this legislation for it to be considered. But I am here to say that at this point it looks to me like it is over because of the games that are being played. Now, efforts were being made this very morning to work out a reasonable compromise on the tax cut proposal by Senator Gramm. We were going to have to have a good debate and a vote on this drug-related amendment. There were going to have to be additional votes on the attorneys' fees issue. There is going to have to be votes on the substitutes, if offered, by Senators Hatch, Gramm and Domenici. At that point, perhaps cloture could begin. That is not what has been happening. 
Yesterday, Senator Daschle filed a cloture motion and, frankly, I did not appreciate the way that was being done. We are not ready for cloture on this. We have some other issues that have to be considered before cloture would ever be invoked. And now, for the information of all Senators, the junior Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has filed a cloture motion on the pending committee amendment to the tobacco bill. Now, who else is going to file a cloture? We have a good man back here in the cloakroom, Tiny; maybe he can file cloture on this bill. Is everybody going to wander in and file a cloture? Do we want two cloture votes on Tuesday, or one every day, or do we want a bill? 
Frankly, Mr. President, I am offended by this. I consider it a breach of the good faith that we have worked in within this Chamber. I was not notified this was going to happen until 5 minutes after 11. I never had a discussion with my counterpart on the other side, and then Senator Conrad files his cloture motion at about 11:20. I resent it. I don't appreciate it. It is counterproductive and it is killing this bill. So I truly regret this action by our minority colleagues. 
As all Senators know, rule XXII, the cloture rule, is one of the most rigid of our rules, as far as imposing an arbitrary schedule for the consideration of a bill. Amendments and even dictating the convening time of the Senate with respect to the time of a cloture rollcall vote are locked in under this rule. The bill before us would require eight cloture motions--that is an important point--to be invoked and each of the eight cloture items to be disposed of with up to 30 hours of debate on each. 
They are as follows: cloture on the Commerce Committee amendment; cloture on the bill, S. 1415; cloture on the motion to proceed to a House revenue bill; cloture on the substitute amendment to insert the Senate text into the House revenue bill; cloture on passage of the House revenue bill; cloture on the motion to insist on the Senate amendment required to send the bill to conference; cloture on the motion to request a conference with the House on disagreeing amendments; and cloture on the appointment of conferees. 
I am not the only guy in the Senate who knows where all these cloture motions can be filed. Of course, that is assuming you get cloture, which then would require 30 hours and hundreds of amendments. This is a very complex, very important piece of legislation, no matter what your viewpoint is, for or against. Everybody has to acknowledge that it has many moving parts, is very complex, and there are many opportunities for amendments to be offered and for mischief to be caused. It could take forever or, in fact, never, as far as this bill being completed, unless we have some modicum of cooperation on both sides of the aisle and some effort to be fair to Senators that do have amendments that they think should be offered. 
So I am disappointed. But if this is the way we are going to proceed, if it is going to be done this way, then I will join the ranks of those that are going to use every procedural parliamentary tool to work against this legislation, and we can just go ahead and admit that it was a good thought. 
We tried our best. It didn't work. I think that is unfortunate. But the way that this is set up now, that is exactly where we are. 
I yield the floor.

It is my hope that a vote will occur on the drug amendment prior to the scheduled cloture vote at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. That means it will have to occur before the luncheons that day. Rollcall votes could occur then Tuesday morning, one after 9:30 a.m. and then a second one at 2:15 p.m. I will consult with the minority leader, of course, further with respect to the scheduling of the second cloture vote, assuming the first cloture vote is not invoked, and that vote will occur then I believe on Wednesday.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I must say that I think it is unfortunate that this process has been adopted by the Democratic leader. I had indicated all along that at some point, if it was necessary, I would be prepared to consider cloture but not until we had an opportunity to debate and vote on some amendments that clearly are important to Senators and until we had time to have debate on this bill in general. 
There are still some very important amendments pending: The Durbin amendment, the Gramm amendment, and we have the drug amendments. We have at least two substitutes that would be cut off from being offered: The Hatch substitute, which I know a number of Senators would support, and it is something much closer to the original settlement agreement that was entered into than anything else that is pending around here now; plus the Domenici-Gramm substitute. 
I think most Senators would acknowledge very readily that those two Senators are very thoughtful Senators and have given a lot of thought to an alternative approach. Yet there is a choice here. The choice is: Do you want a bill or not? If you want a bill, this is a good step toward having nothing happen, because this further sours the well. Yes; I would like to see things move along on this bill and on to other bills and other issues that I know Senators on both sides want to address, but you have to also allow Senators to be able to work through the problems and come to an agreement. 
If we stay on this bill, we are going to have a vote on the Gramm marriage penalty tax elimination. We will have it this year in some other form or another. It seems to me like this is one way to help address some of the concerns about the excessive amount of money that is in this bill. It is clearly way beyond what is necessary to fight teenage smoking, or even teenage smoking and drug abuse, address some of the health care problems, and address the needs of the farmers. It goes way beyond all of that. That is the problem. 
As I have said in other forums, this has become a problem of greed. Everybody who touches this bill adds to it. It grows like Topsy. What is our goal here? To have a whole, big, new Federal program outside the regular budget process, or to address the problem of smoking, and teenage smoking, in this country? 
I had been working on and had kind of sent word to the Democratic leader informally--and I did try to call him, and we were both going back and forth to our luncheons--I had a unanimous consent agreement here that I was working on, and was prepared to work with him on, that would set up a process for us to have a vote on Durbin, although I think Durbin is a very bad amendment. It is another jump, more cost, another hit on actually getting something done. That is one of the problems here. I am still trying to figure out, do Senators, and do the health care community people, and the attorneys general want a bill? 
Do you want an issue? Do you want to do something about this problem or do you want to play games? It is not clear to me because everybody keeps adding to it, adding to it, and it is just going to collapse out here in a great, humongous pile of nothingness. 
But I was going to suggest we have a vote on Durbin at 5:30 today, and that we have a time agreement on the Gramm amendment and a vote on it, and a vote on the drug amendment, and that--I assumed at some point the Democratic leadership might have a tax amendment of their own, and we would start going on down the trail. I don't like it when we basically--people say we have to make progress; we have to get this bill done. Where is the progress? This week, we can't blame each other for yesterday; we had a funeral for a former Senator. We had to go to that. We have problems with Senators being here on Monday. We have problems with Senators--I won't get into all that. 
But you cannot make progress until you make progress, until you are here and you have Senators prepared to vote. And that is one of the unique features of this creature, the Senate. Things move very slowly, they look like they are not moving at all, and it looks hopeless, and then all of a sudden you get ready to vote. I thought we were close to getting ready to vote. 
So I think this is not a positive thing to happen, and I will urge every Republican Senator to vote against cloture. If we don't get cloture, then what? Then what? I thought at some point next week after we voted on Durbin and Gramm and the drug amendment and Hatch and the Domenici-Gramm substitute, maybe a couple other Democrat amendments, at that point we could have sort of a bipartisan effort to see if the Senate was ready to go to cloture and get to a vote. 
This undermines that. I understand why it is being done, but I think it is counterproductive, and I hope the Senate would defeat this overwhelmingly. I view it as another blow to our chances of actually addressing this issue in a responsible way and getting on to other important issues. 
I must say I thought that Senator Gramm and Senator McCain and others who were interested in how you deal with the marriage penalty tax were very close to an agreement--maybe not exactly the way Democrats would like it or the White House would like it, but something that would have been fair for both of us to have and we could make progress on other things. But c'est la vie, this is it. You filed a cloture motion. And also, by the way, that cloture would ripen on Monday, and I think that is going to be a problem for the leadership and a number of Senators, and we will have to discuss when and how that vote would occur. 
I hope all concerned would reconsider their thinking on how we bring this to a point where we could get some votes and make progress. I really believe, I said publicly, that if we had a tax cut provision added and we had a drug provision added, then the prospects for the bill would be helped substantially; we might actually get a bill through the Senate. Without that, we are going to be sitting around here. If you want to sit around and shout to your feet for the rest of this month and all summer long and try to make out this is a totally partisan thing, that is OK, too. That is OK. I am relaxed. We can just waffle along here and look pathetic if everybody wants to do that. Or we can decide how we are going to get together and make something responsible happen. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

I did not have that proposal come to me in any form, and I would not agree to that. I am prepared to say we are going to get a vote on Gramm, and in some logical order, I assume, we have a deal here where we are alternating back and forth--we offer an amendment; you offer an amendment. And the Democrats could offer an amendment at some point on taxes in the regular order. We could not prevent you from doing that. 
But that was not the way it came to me. And it did come to me through the media in a way that certainly would not be acceptable.

Mr. LOTT. Because he is right, and I think that was a mistake. And I objected to that at the time. I think everybody who was on the floor knows that. I did not appreciate the fact that the going back and forth was interrupted. The Senator from Texas knows that, and he has indicated, to his credit, that he was not really intending to break up that sequence. We did break up the sequence, but I do not think we should let that block us from proceeding in that way in the future, a fair way where we offer our amendment, you offer your amendment, and we go back and forth. 
But you are right about that. The order was broken, and I certainly did not like it.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would not agree with that at this point. I am not saying that at some point we might come to some sort of understanding of how this would be handled. The first thing is, I think, the Senator from Texas and Senator McCain have got to come to an agreement on the content. That is one of the reasons why we can't go on procedure--until you get something that is worked out, hopefully that everybody can support, because when we get a vote on the Gramm amendment, on the marriage penalty tax, it is going to pass overwhelmingly. A great majority of the Democrats are not going to be able to vote against that. They are going to vote for it. So it is going to pass. 
But what I would say is I have a unanimous consent agreement right here that would allow us to set up a process to move forward with consent to get a vote on the Durbin amendment at 5:30, and that following disposition of the Gramm amendment Senator Coverdell be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment relative to drugs, there be 2 hours of debate on that--and that there then would be debate on the Coverdell amendment and a vote on that after 2 hours. 
We have a unanimous consent request here that we would be willing to offer, and then we could go back to your amendment, we go to a tax amendment, if you want to do that. 
But here is the other side of it. You have to get unanimous consent. And our people are not going to agree to an arrangement at this time where you get some vote on a subsequent tax proposal that would be the king of the tree. I think when the thing is done, when we get an agreement, you are going to vote for the Gramm amendment and that is what will prevail, and we will move on. But we have to try to come to an agreement on that or we are not going to go anywhere. If that is the way it is going to be, that is the way it is going to be. I have been trying to help make this thing move from a procedural standpoint, but if we want to let it collapse on this line, OK with me.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to point out we could have had a vote on the Gramm amendment last week. I was perfectly willing to do that, I believe it was last Thursday. We were ready, I thought, to go to a vote on Durbin and Gramm last week. As I recall, there was objection to that from the Democrats. So if you talk about delay or time being consumed, it was because we could not get an agreement worked out on Thursday how we could go ahead and vote on the two of them. 
What I am proposing here, or have been prepared to propose, is we have a vote on the Gramm penalty tax amendment, the Durbin look-back provision, the Coverdell drugs provision, and a Daschle or others marriage penalty provision. That is Republican-Democrat, Republican-Democrat; it is a way to deal with this thing. 
But let's set that aside. You know, there is concern that has been expressed about the cost of the marriage penalty. How about the American people who are paying that tax? A penalty for getting married? They cannot help it, if it is so unfair a tax, that young couples all over America are getting hit with this tax just because they got married? So what we are saying is, `Oh, well, to eliminate this unbelievable tax that is in the Tax Code it costs too much money, so we want to squeeze down what Senator Gramm is 
proposing to less and less and less.' What we ought to do is eliminate the marriage penalty tax altogether. Right away. Flat out. Whatever the cost is.

Mr. LOTT. This is one way to help deal with the problem that this tobacco bill costs somebody money. It doesn't come from heaven. Somebody is going to pay for this. This is one way, and it is targeted, by the way, to couples earning under $50,000, as I understand it, to help the people at the lower end of the tax structure by getting rid of this tax penalty. 
You are talking about these other people. Yes, we ought to have a campaign to fight teenage smoking and drug abuse, but we don't need all these hundreds of billions of dollars to do that. This is a way--and everybody involved understands it, really--this is a way to help make it possible for this legislation to get through the Senate and maybe, eventually, get to a conclusion.

Maybe at some subsequent point the discussion turned to, really, some alternative to Gramm. But, you know, this is something that has evolved, as far as I can tell, since we met. We were having that discussion, whenever that was--Tuesday, I guess it was.

Mr. LOTT. They could be. I don't see any problem. I would like for us to have it in the same day, because it means we would be making progress. I would like us to have the opportunity, on the tax issue and tobacco bill, to have more than one vote in a day. Maybe we could get two or three votes. That would be healthy. I would like to see us make progress on that. I think we could work that out. We don't want a separation of days. 
I just object to the `king of the hill' type approach which goes--that is a throwback to the House. But having it the same day, that would be fine with me. We are not interested in getting a day's or a week's separation. If we are ever going to find a logical way to conclude this thing, you have to make progress and have more than one or two votes in a day.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just one brief response to the Senator from North Dakota. If he has been here 12 years, then surely he remembers Senator Byrd and Senator Mitchell doing just that. I remember many occasions in my time here that they dictated and filled up the tree. I learned the way of doing business around here from them. 
I might also note, to make every taxpayer punished by the marriage penalty even with unmarried people costs $38 billion. If we are serious about really eliminating this penalty, that is the cost. I believe the Senator from Texas has a proposal that unfortunately is below that. It is less than that. He would like to completely eliminate it. 
In the interest of trying to come to some accommodation so we can get a vote and still leave money for legitimate programs, like the teenage smoking cessation program and the Medicaid programs in the States, he has been prepared to negotiate below that level. I am not sure he should have gone down as far as he has.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, pending now is the drug amendment. I hope Senators will begin to debate this very important amendment. I know that there are very strong feelings on this amendment also. However, no further votes will occur tonight. I expect the debate on the amendment to continue through tomorrow's session. 
The minority leader filed a cloture motion on the committee amendment earlier today. That cloture vote will occur on Tuesday, at a time to be determined after discussion between the two of us and after consultation with others in terms of schedule. So there will be no votes in Friday's session of the Senate. 
However, Senator Daschle and I are looking at bills that are relatively noncontroversial or noncontroversial that we may be able to take up tomorrow during the day. And the vote would be scheduled in the group on Tuesday morning when we vote, at a time we will notify the Members later on on Tuesday. 
Now, again, I hope we can reach agreement tomorrow to provide for a vote on this amendment, hopefully prior to the cloture vote; but all Senators will be notified about the voting schedule. I urge the Senators who have been working on the marriage penalty tax to continue to work to get an agreement on that amendment so that we can have a vote on it. We will try to see if we can reach agreement perhaps to consider another bill on Monday. But we will continue on amendments to the tobacco bill beginning after the cloture vote is defeated on Tuesday morning.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond. I thought that Senator Daschle and I had talked about it and had an agreement that we would do it on Tuesday morning. I realize we have to get consent to do that. The alternative is, as he said, that we not be in session on Monday, which is, I guess, a possibility, but it is pretty hard to complain about not making progress when we are not in session working on something. 
The other alternative is to come in at an early hour; and approximately an hour after that time, the vote occurs then, which means that the vote could be at 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, Monday afternoon, which, for Senators coming from California and Utah and Washington State, that presents a real problem because their planes do not get here until about 4:30. 
So I was hoping we could take that time Monday to make some progress on some other issue or have debate on this issue and have the vote that everybody will be here for at 9:30. But it would be fine with me that we have it earlier in the afternoon. But I just assume that both sides will have problems with that. We will talk about it further, and we will hotline the Members on exactly what time they can expect that cloture vote to occur.

Mr. LOTT. We would not bring it up without Members being on notice who have an interest in it. That technical corrections bill does need to be done. I believe it is supported on both sides of the aisle and by the administration. We need to get that done, and we would need to do it by unanimous consent. But if the Senator has reservations, he will be notified about it. But we will get it done, and we would want to do it without a modification.

Mr. LOTT. I say to the Senator, it is important we get these technical corrections done, because some legitimate, honest mistakes were made and several important projects could be affected. And we need to do it as soon as we can. But unless we can get unanimous consent, it will not be done. It has already passed the House. So we will have to find a way--I am working with Senators on our side, too, as I know Senators are working over there, to clear up concerns. 
There are other ways to address those concerns. And we are trying to get that worked out. We need to get it done. We need to do it by unanimous consent. And I, in fact, have met with one Senator this afternoon and discussed how to address a legitimate concern he has. So we will work with the chairman. 
Did the chairman want to respond to this at all?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in order to make this perfectly clear, I do have a unanimous-consent request that would accommodate my desire on behalf of the Senate to have a vote on this very important nuclear waste issue and then return to the pending business, the tobacco bill. So I do want to ask unanimous consent--and I am not propounding it right now--that would say that once we have this vote, notwithstanding rule XXII, with respect to the nuclear waste bill, we would come back to the tobacco bill. 
This is not in any way intended to delay or to drag out the tobacco bill. There is nobody here, I do not believe, who would not like to see us find a way to deal with the tobacco issue and move on. At the same time, as the majority leader, I have to continue doing things as we go along. We have some Executive Calendar things we want to vote on. We have some other bills that I believe Senators on both sides might agree that we want to do as we go along. We have to think about the appropriations 
bills next week, beginning to move those appropriations bills. 
The thing with the nuclear waste issue, the way it comes to us, because the issue was blue-slipped in the House, or the objections because we did it before they did it in the House, we have to go through a series of hoops that take time so that we can take action on nuclear waste and then go on about our business on the tobacco bill or defense bill, whatever it may be. So my purpose here is to get this issue started, and then, after we have a vote, go on back to the tobacco bill. So that is the intent here. 
I would ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, to resume consideration of the tobacco bill notwithstanding rule XXII with respect to the nuclear waste bill.

Mr. LOTT. If I could just clarify, the Senator did not object; he was reserving his right to object to my request. Did you propound a modification to that? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-4-19980602</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Then I believe the correct thing would be for me to reserve my right to object to his modification of my unanimous consent request. 
The alternative here is to have the vote on the nuclear waste cloture motion on the motion to proceed, and if we get cloture, we are on the nuclear waste bill. If the unanimous consent that I propounded is accepted, we could set that aside and come on back to the tobacco bill. 
The problem I have with the addition that the Senator has propounded here that we remain on the tobacco bill until it is completed is that we don't know whether that would be a day, a week, or a month. I know that there is other work we will need to get done over a period of days and weeks and that we could, in fact, continue to work on the tobacco bill. 
For instance, there is a meeting that will be occurring here in the next few minutes. Senator Daschle is familiar with it. Senator McCain, Senator Gramm, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be involved in that meeting at 4:30. You need a little time sometimes to work out an agreement, a compromise even. 
Under this agreement, we wouldn't be able to set it aside and go to any other issue. So that is all I am saying. We have a lot of work we need to get done during the month of June. It is going to take a lot of cooperation. The tobacco bill is on the agenda. My intent is for us to continue to make progress on it but not to the exclusion of everything else. So I would object to the modification.

Mr. LOTT. I believe the pending business is the McCain amendment. Senator McCain had hoped he could have a recorded vote on his amendment, but I know it has unanimous support. Because a number of Senators are having problems with schedules, Senator McCain has agreed that we will go ahead and have a voice vote on his amendment. I thank him for that cooperation. I know he feels very strongly about it, and it is the right thing to do for the veterans of our country. So that will be then the next order, the voice vote.

We will put it on the recording so Senators will know. 
There will not be, it doesn't appear at this time, an early vote on Thursday, but we do hope to get a couple votes before noon on Thursday. We will be working on that. We will do this by voice vote, and that will be the last vote for the night.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate in expressing to the family of Senator Barry Goldwater our sympathy for their loss and for our country's loss as well. On Wednesday, many of us in the Senate will attend his funeral in his beloved Arizona. The Senate Sergeant at Arms is making arrangements for those who wish to join in this last tribute to our former colleague. All Senate offices will be informed about those details soon. In fact, I believe that information has gone out and we do expect a large number of Senators to join in going to the funeral services in Arizona. 
The Senate will not be in session on Wednesday in honor of this great Senator and leader from Arizona. 
If Barry were here with us today, I think he would tell us in his characteristically blunt manner not to be too solemn about this occasion. After all, he was an extremely fortunate man and he felt that way and said so himself many times. He was blessed with length of days and devotion of family and friends. In fact, as I looked over the details of the services, I noted that he will be carried by his grandsons as poll bearers. I know that would have been really special to him. He loved his work. He loved the people he represented. He spoke his mind. In many ways, he owed nobody, but he loved everybody. He was a winner, not just in the sense of winning elections--with one rather major exception--but in the most important sense of having his ideas vindicated by the course of history. 
In his one losing election, the Presidential race of 1964, he was subject to more falsehoods, in my opinion, than any candidate should ever have to bear. 
In losing with honor, he did more than encourage others to stand up for their beliefs. I was one of those young people that was fresh out of college and working for my alma mater, the University of Mississippi, and casting my first vote ever in a Presidential election for Barry Goldwater in my hometown of Pascagoula, MS, and watching the election returns that night from Pensacola, FL. I remember how I had been inspired by what he had to say. I think that was the moment I decided I would spend a good portion of my life involved in trying to be a representative of the people in Government. 
Along with then-Governor Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater energized the grassroots of American politics, fostered the growth of modern conservatism, and thereby transformed the Republican Party and the Nation. 
His statement of political faith--a slight book called `The Conscience of a Conservative'--continues to challenge and inspire readers. I have my little paperback version of `The Conscience of a Conservative' that I keep in a small library in my hometown. There are many Members of Congress today who treasure their well-worn copies of that volume, as well they might, for it remains an eloquent manifesto of the cause of liberty. 
The conservative movement has had many heroes, but Barry Goldwater remains preeminent, even though he came to disagree with conservatives on some issue. That disagreement has belatedly won him some new admirers, even some liberals who fail to see the difference between his reasoning and theirs. 
The difference is that they tend to downplay personal responsibility. Senator Barry Goldwater, on the other hand, demanded it. He expected individuals to live with the consequences of their decisions. It was his sense of responsibility that brought Barry Goldwater into Government and empowered his fight against big Government. 
It was personal responsibility that he preached to his fellow Americans. In 1964 many were unwilling to listen. Today, three decades later, his message is heard and echoed from think tanks to pulpits, from classrooms to the Congress. 
He gave so much to the country he loved so much. So many years of service in government, so strong a voice for national security against the threat of communism, and so passionate a confidence in the ability of average men and women to do extraordinary things. 
But surely his greatest gift was preparing the way for a rebirth of the conservative ideas and values which make freedom possible. 
That long ago won him an honored place in the hearts of his fellow believers, and it now ensures for him an honored place in the history of America.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the case of Pointe Properties, Inc., et al. versus Michael J. Bevenour, et al., is a civil case pending in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia. 
This defamation action by a land development company and two of its officers and directors arises out of two 1996 letters prepared and distributed by the defendants, members of a citizens group opposed to the development of certain land in Maryland's Anne Arundel County. A few months prior to mailing these letters, some of the defendants met with Mike Morrill of Senator Mikulski's staff to discuss plaintiffs' land-development proposal. Counsel for these defendants have asked Mr. Morrill to testify about that meeting, and Senator Mikulski would like Mr. Morrill to be authorized to do so. 
This resolution would authorize Senator Mikulski's staff to testify and produce relevant documents, with representation from the Senate Legal Counsel. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco legislation, with several amendments pending. As was announced prior to the recess, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. And also as a reminder to Members, a cloture motion was filed with respect to the motion to proceed to the nuclear waste bill. That vote, and any votes ordered during today's session or during the morning session of the Senate tomorrow, will be postponed to occur Tuesday, June 2, at 6 p.m. 
For the remainder of the week, the Senate will continue consideration of the tobacco legislation, the nuclear waste bill, and possibly the Department of Defense authorization bill. I know the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is anxious for us to return to the DOD authorization bill. It is my intent to do that at the earliest possible opportunity and that work be completed on the authorization bill so that we can go to the military construction appropriations bill and the DOD appropriations bill. 
We also may have some executive and legislative calendar items that will be cleared for action. I believe we have at least one more judicial nomination, perhaps others, that we will be able to move on today. We are hopeful there will be some conference reports available this week. Specifically, the Coverdell A+ education bill conference report could be ready this week. Work will continue on the IRS conference report, but it looks like that may not be available until next week. 
Finally, I announce that with respect to the passing of our former colleague, Senator Barry Goldwater, the Senate will not be in session on Wednesday in honor of this distinguished Member of the U.S. Senate. Members will be attending funeral services on that day in Arizona. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention and their cooperation as we go through the balance of this week. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Let me say, because I know everyone is interested in this, this is a critical moment on a very important bill. The managers of the ISTEA II legislation have labored late into the night and all morning trying to make sure Members are aware of what is in the bill. I think they have done a good job. It might not be perfect in anybody's eyes, but we need to get it done. We need to get it done this afternoon. 
There will be an opportunity for Members to express themselves, but I believe for all concerned the wise thing to do is to go to this bill as soon as we can, have a limited debate, and vote. It won't be easier on Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock. It won't be easier in a week or a month. 
I think we need to complete this legislation. We will work on both sides, as we have all along, to make sure that Members are satisfied with what we try to do.

Mr. LOTT. In response to the Senator from Alaska, I understand that he wants to see what is in it. I think he will like what he sees in it, both for him and his constituency and the country as a whole. 
This is over a $200 billion bill that is needed in this country for safe, decent roads, bridges, and mass transit. We have drug it out for weeks and months and it is time to act. 
Now, does every Senator deserve a right and an opportunity to see the formula and see how each State does and look at what it means for the Appropriations Committee and every committee? Yes, let's do it. Let's do it now. You will have an opportunity to look at this, and others should. But it is time that we get serious and get it done in a reasonable time in the best interest of America. 
My father died on a narrow, two-lane road that wasn't safe and I am not going to stand any longer for us having inadequate roads and bridges in this country and for money to be sometimes spent in 
other places. 
I am bending a little bit here, but I think everybody in this Chamber knows I tried to listen to everybody's needs, concerns on both sides, on tough legislation this week and this year. I am sympathetic. I wanted to look at the numbers. I have. I haven't seen the report. I don't know whether it is perfect. But it has been a laborious, tough, involvement and it is time that we bring it to a conclusion. Help me do that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I acknowledge the Senator from New Mexico who spoke just a few moments ago. Senator Domenici has been very helpful throughout this whole process. I appreciate the comments he has just made. I appreciate the way he worked with the authorizers in trying to develop this formula and to establish the policy for the future and to deal with the offsets. He has just been tremendously helpful, including working with the Appropriations Committee this afternoon. I thank him for his work. 
A lot of other people here put in effort on this. Senator Bond, Senator Gramm, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Byrd, and Senator Kerry have been involved in this. There is a long list of Members on both sides of the aisle who have been involved in this and there has been a lot of give and take. And some of us were giving, even last night, on some projects for which we were very hopeful. 
But I want to remind my colleagues, when you might say, `We could do better,' this is the largest infrastructure transportation bill in history. The formula is more fair than it has ever been before. My State got 84 cents on a dollar in the past; it is going to be in the 90s, like every other State this year. Most States will be getting more than they got over the past 5 or 6 years. 
So I think we need to get started. There are States in this country, in the Midwest and the Northeast, they need to know that they have this money and how much so they can get started with projects now. The season is going to get away from them. So I hope every Senator will keep that in mind and allow us to get this to completion.

Mr. LOTT. I would like to say to all Senators, with regard to the week we are coming back. I have been discussing this with Senator Daschle. When we complete this infrastructure transportation bill, ISTEA II, and dispose of that, that will be the last vote or action of this week, other than doing some Executive Calendar matters we are trying to clear. The next vote will not occur until Tuesday when we come back. That would be June 2. But when we return on Monday, June 1, we will continue to debate the tobacco bill, and the pending issue is the Durbin amendment. Of course, there are other amendments that are pending. We will be talking back and forth over the next week as to exactly how the process will go forward. 
On that Tuesday, the 2nd, the Senate will conduct a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the nuclear waste bill, which I will put in place in the next few minutes, as well as amendment votes relative to the tobacco legislation. 
I do want to emphasize, the nuclear waste issue we intend to double track. That is one where we can take an action and then come off of that and go, then, to other legislation, the tobacco legislation. And it will take a period of days to get through the process we have to go on, on nuclear waste. But that is not intended to take the place of either the tobacco bill or the Department of Defense authorization bill. It will be double tracking as we go forward. 
So I expect the Senate will be considering the tobacco bill and the nuclear waste bill during the first week in June. If problems arise with regard to either one of those, the other issue that we have already done some work on, and we want to go back to at the first opportunity, would be the Department of Defense authorization bill. We need to get that completed so we can then go to the appropriations side of the defense bill. I 
know that first week back will be a busy one because we have a lot of important work to do. We will be in session on Monday, but we will not have recorded votes on that Monday. 
Senator Daschle, did you want to comment or ask a question on that?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement of April 3, I now call up H.R. 2709, the Iran sanctions legislation. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19980522</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just want to clarify the procedural situation. As the Chair just said, it is 90 minutes on the underlying measure, and then 90 minutes on the Levin amendment, if need be to use that time. It is the intent that we go forward to completion of this act and that we have a recorded vote at the end of that time. 
I am really pleased the Senate is finally completing action on this very important piece of legislation. Senator Lieberman and I introduced the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act on October 23, 1997. It has 84 cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. This is not really a complicated piece of legislation. It is designed to address one of the most pressing security issues we face in the world, Iran's determined drive to acquire ballistic missile production capability. 
This legislation requires specific targeted sanctions against any foreign entities providing direct support to Iran's missile development efforts. The House passed companion legislation on November 12, 1997, without a single dissenting vote. House action modified certain provisions of the legislation to meet concerns of the administration, most notably--and I have made this point to the President in my discussions with him about this legislation--that he is granted a waiver, and that was requested by the administration, and that was included in the bill when the House passed it. 
The House also passed legislation adding the Chemical Weapons Convention to the package. Our legislation addresses a clear and present danger. Iran is a terrorist state under U.S. law. Last year, a German court found Iranian intelligence directly responsible for murder committed on German soil. Earlier this very week, the Government of Argentina found Iran responsible for a terrorist bombing of a Jewish synagogue. The same Iranian Government responsible for terrorist murder around the world is engaged in efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. They already have chemical weapons. They are working on biological weapons. This is a very serious matter. 
Much of the knowledge that Senators and administration officials have on this issue cannot be talked about here in the Senate because of their very sensitive intelligence issues. But every time I receive a briefing, I become more alarmed about what Iran has and what additional capability they are trying to acquire. 
Their missile program has been advanced tremendously by the assistance from a wide range of Russian entities. The details, as I said, are classified, but it is comprehensive and it is ongoing. I urge every Senator to review the intelligence information. A summary is available right now in S-407 for Members' review. The intelligence community will brief any Senator on the extent and impact of Russian cooperation. I have had that briefing and continue to review intelligence information. Let me assure the Senate, Russian cooperation is deeply disturbing. It is widespread. It has made the day Iran is able to target American forces and American allies closer by years. If I went into the details of the capability they have acquired and how soon they could have the ability to use that, everybody in the Senate and the United States would be alarmed. 
The basic facts are not in dispute. Iran wants ballistic missile production capability. Russian assistance has materially advanced Iranian efforts. American diplomatic efforts to halt assistance have not succeeded. That assistance continues today. That is why we have H.R. 2709 before us today in the Senate. 
We have not rushed to judgment on this issue. Last November, we did not act after the House sent us the legislation, and I received specific calls from the President's National Security Adviser asking that we not act. In the last week we were in session, this legislation could have been passed, probably on a voice vote, immediately. But, in response to the administration's efforts and assurances that they were going to get some cooperation, we said all right, we will see if we get some results by waiting. 
In January, the administration asked for a 3-week delay to compare assessments with Israel, our ally most directly threatened by Iranian weapons of mass destruction. In February, the administration asked for delay until Vice President Gore's March meeting with then Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. In March, the administration asked us to wait until April. In every instance, I consulted with Senators on both sides of the aisle, talked to Senator Lieberman, checked the intelligence information, listened to the requests from the President's National Security Adviser and the Vice President, and continued to make an effort to give them time to see if we could get some results, get some action. It did not happen. It did not happen again and again and again. 
In April, though, we said there had to be an end to this or the Senate's credibility would be in doubt, if we continued to just hold this out there and not act. And, also, if we do not act soon and this continues--the capabilities that they are acquiring are extremely dangerous, to say the least. 
So we entered into the unanimous consent agreement in April, the middle of April, to consider this legislation today. We said we would do it by or on May 22. For 6 entire months, we have tried to give more time for this matter to be addressed, for there to be some indication that Russia was in fact able to deal with these companies and these individuals who were involved in this intelligence, scientific, and ballistic missile capability exchange. It did not stop. Again, I cannot go into details, but there were specific instances of things we were concerned about. The overwhelming majority of them did not stop, did not change. 
We have had at least five delays that have been requested by the administration and granted by the Senate. President Clinton has had ample time to allow his diplomatic approach to work. I would point out, however, the administration has refused to make sanctions decisions which are required by law, and there clearly have been some instances where those sanctions could have and probably should have been implemented. A number of Russian actions supporting Iran's missile program require U.S. sanctions under the Missile Technology Control Act. In fact, if the administration had acted last year, as called for under that law, this legislation probably would not be necessary. 
The administration often asks for bipartisanship regarding foreign policy, and I think that is as it should be. I have tried more than once to be cooperative and to make sure that we proceeded in a bipartisan way. We have done that. I have done it sometimes while coming under heavy criticism from the media or members of my own party. But I thought, and I think, it is the right thing to do. I try to accommodate whenever and however I can. This legislation, though, should not be delayed further. It could not be more bipartisan. I reiterate, 84 Senators on both sides of the aisle are cosponsors of this legislation. 
I hope the administration will reconsider its opposition. I think it actually could be helpful. I think the fact we have had this legislation pending has been helpful. It has given the administration leverage. Unfortunately, the leverage has not produced results. 
I fear that the Russian Government does not have sufficient capability to stop this exchange from occurring. They do not have the export control laws that we do. They do not have the ability to go to a company in Russia as easily as we do and say, `Do not be engaged in this very dangerous process.' Or if they do, they haven't been able to carry it out so far. 
There are those who are going to say, `Well, there have been some changes. We have a new government there. Chernomyrdin has been replaced by a new young Prime Minister. He is talking good.' 
They have made some recommendations, but some of the things we have been told have happened we do not have the evidence of yet. Again, we are being told that within the last 10 days greater assurances have been given by Russian officials. This has been going on for months, really years, and now all of a sudden they say, `Well, wait, there is a new leader on the block; he is going to make a difference.' 
If we go forward today and accept the amendment of Senator Levin from Michigan and pass this legislation, it still has to go back to the House. It will probably be 10 days or so before the House can act. There will be a little more time to see if, in fact, these new leaders in Russia can begin to make a difference. The President, I reiterate, has waiver authority, and he may decide that this is such a sensitive national security issue at this particular time that he needs to veto it. He can do that. But I think that the Senate should not delay any longer. 
There is beginning to be a pattern around the world of some of our friends, supposedly, and allies, or countries that we are trying to work with, contributing to very dangerous weapons proliferation and nuclear activity. Think about it. Do we want Iran to have this ballistic missile capability? Not only chemical and biological weapons, but they would like to have nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver them in the region or in the world. I don't think so. 
It is time the Senate delivered a clear message on this--a clear bipartisan message. I really think it will be helpful in getting this process, that Russia and others have been participating in, stopped now before it is too late. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tomorrow we will convene at 9:30, and there will be 1 hour for morning business, and then we will begin consideration of two items tomorrow, calendar No. 299, H.R. 2709, relative to Iran sanctions, with a total of 3 hours for debate. We already entered into an agreement back before the Easter recess as to how this issue would be considered, on or before May 22. So we will have this issue up tomorrow. There could be an amendment offered by Senator Levin. But we hope to get that up tomorrow. 
I won't even announce at this moment exactly which one of these two bills will come first, because we will need to see, for instance, if the ISTEA highway and infrastructure bill is ready to go. As soon as we get it, we want to take that up. But it will be the Iran sanctions issue, and then we will consider and dispose of the ISTEA conference report. So, votes will occur tomorrow, probably at least one, maybe two or three. It will depend on how these issues develop. 
Some people are saying, Will the ISTEA conference be completed? I am told by the leaders that they will be able to complete it tonight. They may need a little extra time in the morning to make sure that Senators who are affected one way or the other have been briefed as to exactly what is in it, but they know that we need to complete this legislation before we go home for Memorial Day recess, and we should be committed to get that done. 
With that, I yield the floor and the morning business would be in order.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had a good bit of discussion today and two very important votes. I hope that we can move on now to some other amendments that really are important and will determine how this legislation is eventually written. 
I thank Senators again for keeping calm and working through this. The managers are working very diligently. I emphasize again to my colleagues, while I think every Senator obviously needs to have the time and will have the time he or she needs to make a statement, I do think it would be wise if you can say what you have to say and we can move on. To go for an extended period of time on an amendment 2, 3, 4, 5 hours is going to make it very difficult to ever get a satisfactory result. 
I hope Senators will agree to some reasonable time limits. I am not going to ask for a unanimous consent agreement now. I don't think it is necessary, but I will suggest the form that we might take in a consent agreement as to how to proceed. 
It is my hope that Senator Gregg from New Hampshire will be recognized next to offer his amendment, with Senator Leahy, regarding immunity. Senator Gregg and Senator Leahy have been circling the area since we started. They are ready to go. The debate should last the rest of this session today. It is my hope that the vote on, or in relation to, that amendment can be scheduled to occur first thing on Thursday morning--I mean early--so we can move to the next amendment, which will come from the Democratic side. Senator Daschle and Senator Kerry will have to decide what amendment that will be. 
Following the disposition of that amendment offered by the Democrats, then I hope the Senate will consider the farmers' protection issue and debate it, have a vote on that issue or issues in a way, hopefully, that is agreeable and as fair as possible to both sides of that issue. Then we will really have a feel for where we are and can make an assessment about time and where to go from there. 
I hope that Senators are comfortable with that. I think that it is a fair way to proceed alternating back and forth. We are not ducking the tough issues. This last amendment was a key amendment. This next amendment is a key amendment. The farmers' amendment is critical to all concerned. So I hope this will be acceptable and we can move in this way. I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this evening, a number of us will be gathering together to honor Stuart Balderson who recently retired from the United States Senate after nearly four decades of exemplary service. I would like to take just a few moments to thank Stuart and to wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his life. 
On May 23, 1960, Stuart Balderson, a twenty-two year old fresh out of the Navy, came to work in the United States Senate. At that time, Lyndon Johnson was the Majority Leader and Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House. Stuart was brought on board by Secretary of the Senate `Skeeter' Johnston and assigned a position in the Senate Finance Office. Over the course of the next 38 years, Stuart worked in every department of that office, including payroll, accounting, retirement and benefits, and legislative budgeting. In 1980, he assumed its top position, Financial Clerk of the United States Senate, and served in that capacity for the next 18 years. 
Over the past 38 years, Stuart has seen a lot of history on Capitol Hill. To give you an idea of how much things have changed, when Stuart began working in the Senate, the Capitol Building was still using direct current from its own generators. You needed to use an AC adaptor if you wanted to plug in any electrical equipment, but there wasn't much electrical equipment to plug in. In those days, `computers' referred to the people who calculated the numbers rather than to any machines they used. Stuart's predecessor, Bill Ridgely, used to call those the `Bob Cratchitt' days of the Disbursing Office, when the Senate's bookkeepers, like Bob Cratchitt in Dickens' A Christmas Carol, wore green visors and armbands and sat on high stools. 
A lot has changed since then. The number of Senate employees relying on the Senate Finance Office to handle their paychecks has more than doubled. Total Senate expenditures have risen from $25.9 million in 1960 to $583.3 million in 1997. In many ways, Stuart grew with the Senate, but the two things that always remained constant were his dedication to this institution and the financial integrity he brought to the job. 
I know I speak for many other members and staff, past and present, when I say that we will miss Stuart. We commend him for his long and outstanding service and we wish him well as he retires.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today Senator Chafee, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has introduced legislation to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. I support the Foundation and the activities it undertakes to further conservation and management of our nation's fish and wildlife resources. 
Created by Congress in 1984, the Foundation has forged a strong relationship between government and corporate stakeholders, fostering cooperation and coordination. It has been successful in bringing private sector involvement, initiative and technology to bear in solving conservation problems. With this reauthorization, the Foundation's record of providing real on-the-ground conservation will continue. 
Mr. President, all federal money appropriated to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation must be matched by contributions from non-federal sources: corporations, State and local government agencies, foundations and individuals. The Foundation's operating policy is to raise a match of at least 2 to 1, to maximize leverage for our federal funds. With the financial assistance of the private sector and the technical knowledge of the States, the Foundation can be both effective and responsive to conservation needs. 
All of the Foundation's projects are peer reviewed by agency staff, state resource officials, and other professionals in the natural resource field. No project is undertaken without the input and support of the local community and state interests. The Foundation has also initiated a process to solicit comments from members of Congress concerning grants in a member's district or state. 
Mr. President, one of the things that distinguishes the Foundation from other conservation groups is its results in the field. The Foundation has worked with over 700 agencies, universities, businesses and conservation groups, both large and small, over the last decade. These relationships have helped the Foundation become one of the most effective conservation organizations in the nation. 
In Mississippi, for example, the Foundation has supported local habitat restoration projects to help private landowners install water control structures to provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl. Our farmers have learned that it also benefits weed control, seed-bed preparation, prevention of erosion--all at a lower cost. The Foundation has provided grants to assist private landowners in restoring bottomland hardwood habitats critical to migrating neotropical songbirds and other water-dependant wildlife species. These efforts are helping to maintain the state's original wetlands habitats. 
Activities of the Foundation do produce real on-the-ground conservation benefits for the resources of our nation. I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this legislation.

Mr. LOTT. First of all, I want to congratulate the Senator from Michigan for his efforts on this very important legislation. I also appreciate the cooperation of Senators on the other side of the aisle that worked through the day, including Senator Kennedy, so that we could get to a conclusion on this important legislation. I think it is good for the country. It is the fourth of the high-tech bills that we worked on last week. I thought the combination of those four bills were important and will make a difference in our high-tech community and having the workers and the opportunity for workers to be able to do these important jobs in the high-tech sector. I congratulate Senator Abraham for his work, and Senator McCain, who came up with the suggestion that we try to do several of these high-tech bills in a row.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman, the ranking member and a majority of the members of the Commerce Committee, I wish to modify the Commerce Committee substitute. 
Before the Chair declares the amendment is modified, I announce to the Members that this is the text of the so-called managers' amendment that the chairman and ranking member have been working on for the last few days. The modification also incorporates the Finance Committee reported amendments as part of the new Commerce Committee substitute.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is objection. Before I renew the request that I made, which was merely that this substitute be printed as a Senate amendment and the final version only be printed in the Record, I want to note that all this means is that we would have to print all three of these documents, which are all pretty substantial in size. We can do that, but there is a cost involved and there is time involved. I hoped that there would not be objection to having this document printed. It would be available to the Members to review. But if there is objection to that, it won't stop anything. We will go forward. 
Let me respond to a lot that has been said because I thought it was important that the former chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from South Carolina who worked with Senator McCain, be heard, and I thought it was very important that the Senator from Kentucky make his case. But let me also explain what is going on here. 
Everybody knows this has not been easy to get through the committee process to get at this point on the floor of the Senate with a lot of give and take and a lot of Senators who had to take positions that were hard for them, including the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. And other Senators who are going to be involved in this have had to accept some things they didn't go along with. I acknowledge that the Senator from South Carolina has worked very carefully with the Senator from Arizona. But also it is my job as majority leader to try to find a responsible way to move this forward to get it to the floor in the fairest possible way. There is no way to do that without some people feeling like, `Well it is not exactly the way I wanted it,' or `It doesn't give me a fair position,' or `It doesn't give me more than a fair position. All I want is an advantage.' 
Now the Senator from Indiana is chairman of the Agriculture Committee. It seems rational to me that you would understand that as majority leader I would be interested and concerned in the position, or an amendment to be offered on this important piece of legislation by the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and, if we didn't do it this way, he would be disadvantaged in that he would have to have 60 votes, not 51--not a majority, a supermajority of 60 votes. I understand that the Senator from Kentucky wanted to require that, and he has used his influence to get it in the position where that could have occurred. He also understands that what I am doing here is perfectly within the rules. I am trying to get everybody on a fair and equal footing. I don't know how the votes are going to go.

Mr. LOTT. If I could, because I didn't interrupt the Senator from Kentucky. 
I don't know how the voting is going to go. Senator Lugar might get 51 votes. Senator Ford might win and prevail because 51 votes cannot be achieved for the Lugar amendment. There are a lot of people who don't think either one of these are all that hot. Quite frankly, they would like a whole different arrangement to be of assistance legitimately to the tobacco farmers. These are not the only two solutions in the world. There might be some other ones. 
I do not want to disadvantage anybody. But this is an amendment that has been around on this subject for quite some time. Senator Lugar has never made it a secret of the fact that he would want this to be offered, or as an alternative available to him to be offered. There are others who do not like this provision or that provision that is included or not included. But, in other instances, the Senators would have to offer an amendment only to get 50 votes. 
So I think this is a fair way to go. I am sorry the Senator doesn't agree with it. But I have been very meticulous to make sure that everybody was aware of what we were trying to do here. I have not been in all of these substantive negotiations. I have been strictly looking at how we can move this forward and what the process is to have it come up and considered in a fair way. 
The chairman of the Finance Committee is standing here now wanting to ask some questions of the Chair about what this means for the Finance Committee and what they did. They had a tough time. They came up with some improvements. They came up with some things certainly I don't agree with, and I don't think the chairman does, either. But he is willing to get a clarification of what it means for him, and to go forward. I think he has taken the right position. 
So I just wanted to take this opportunity to say that I understand where everybody is coming from but that I think this is the fair way to do it. 
I don't think we ought to start over by saying, `Well, if we don't get this, or don't get that, we are going to kill it.' I don't think anybody wants that to happen on your side of the aisle. Let's go forward. Let's have some amendments. And let's see where the votes are. That is the way to do this.

Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Massachusetts is speaking under reservation. 
Let me assure him that I have looked at all of the alternatives. I have looked at the best possible way to bring this up. I didn't know it was going to wind up having to be done this way. We didn't know 2 weeks ago that we would have the Finance Committee angles. I have said all along that Senator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, was going to have a fair shot, along with anybody else, to offer his amendment and win or lose by majority vote. I am surprised that some people are surprised by this. But I understand. But I just say that I have been having people on this side of the aisle complain about this, too. There are a lot of people on my side of the aisle who do not want this brought up under this concept, or any other. 
But I will say this to Senators on both sides of the aisle: Anybody who wants to stand in the way of this bill, if you don't want us to try to find a way to deal with children's porn, and drug abuse by children, if you don't want us to find a way to try to deal with the health problems caused by tobacco--all I am trying to do is get a 51-vote majority for an amendment--go right ahead. 
There are people on both sides of the aisle threatening to do just that. 
Now, I know the Senator from Massachusetts is trying to contribute by saying let's keep calm and can we find a way to work this out. I think this is a fair way, and I admonish everybody to stay calm, too, and keep our eye on what is the target here. It is bigger than the sum of its parts, and we ought to keep that in mind. We may not be able to do it this week. We may never be able to do it. The odds are very strong that this thing is going to implode by the weight we are placing on it. Every time we tested it, it has gotten bigger, fatter and more difficult to get through. So it is OK with me however it works out. But I believe we have here a reasonable way to begin this process, and I urge my colleagues, hold your fire. Let's go ahead with the opening statements by the Senators. Let's get some amendments going. Who knows for sure how it is going to work out?

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until noon. Following morning business, under a previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1723, the Abraham of Michigan immigration legislation. Any votes ordered with respect to the Abraham bill will be postponed to occur beginning at 5:45 this evening. We have modified the time of the vote just a little to accommodate some Senators who will be coming in close to that time. So it will be 5:45 instead of the earlier indication of 5:30. It could involve one, two, or three votes, depending on how the amendments go during the day. 
Following those votes, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco bill. Members should expect busy sessions every day this week as the Senate considers this important issue. 
Also this week, the Senate may consider the ISTEA transportation conference report. I understand that the conferees have basically reached an agreement on the broad parameters, broad issues of the ISTEA transportation bill. They are running the numbers to make sure they have numbers that reflect what their agreements were. We hope to have a vote on that Thursday, or Friday at the latest. We may also consider the Coverdell A+ savings account conference report, if available. 
The cooperation of all Senators will be necessary so that the Senate can complete its work prior to the Memorial Day recess. There will be ample opportunity for Senators to be heard this week, and there will be ample opportunity for Senators on either side of the aisle on the issues involved to be frustrated or to lose their temper perhaps. But I hope everybody will remain calm and be thoughtful in their debate. I believe we can proceed and get to a conclusion that will be acceptable to, hopefully, a large number of Senators in a bipartisan way. 
I yield the floor.

It is anticipated this vote will occur at 5:30 Monday afternoon. We have, in the past, over the past month, tried to make Senators aware of Mondays and Fridays, that we would not be having votes. This Friday we will not be having any votes. We notified the Members of that, I think at least 3 weeks ago. But we have been saying all along on Monday, the 18th, they should expect a vote. But we will try to have it late in the afternoon, so we could conduct some business during the morning and afternoon, so Senators will have time to get back here from their respective States. We do expect that vote probably around 5:30, but we want to check with all the Senators to see if that is the best possible time. We may need to move it a little bit one way or the other.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the WIPO Copyright Treaty which has up to 1 hour under the consent agreement that was reached on May 12. Therefore, the next vote will occur shortly--hopefully in less than an hour--on passage of the WIPO copyright bill, and that will be the last vote of the day. 
I know there are some Senators here who have worked on this issue who do want to be heard briefly--the Senator from Missouri, and, of course, the Senator from Utah has been working on this assiduously. We had a little problem we ran into yesterday, but we are going forward with this and we will try to work it out with the House, and I will certainly try to be helpful with that. 
This is important legislation. A lot of effort has been put into it. Some of the problems have been resolved, thanks to the courtesy and leadership of Senator Hatch, working with Senator Ashcroft. So I think we need to go ahead and do it 
today and we will have had, really, an incredible week on these high-tech bills. 
Again, the next vote will occur on Monday--there will be no further votes after the WIPO vote tonight--and I will notify all Members as to the time of that vote. 
With regard to the DOD authorization matter, I will be talking with the managers of this legislation to see what their wishes are, and we will have some further announcements of when that legislation will be brought up again. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate has now passed the second of the four high-tech bills that we had been working on and have worked to get agreements. And we have been successful in that. It is our intent at the earliest opportunity to consider and pass the WIPO bill, even though I understand there may be a technical problem with the blue slip issue involving the House of Representatives. We are trying to check that out, and also the immigration bill that the Senator from Michigan has been working on, and Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. 
It would be our intent to call up that immigration bill, if we do not do it before noon on Monday, with the possibility of stacked votes on Monday afternoon about 5:30. I am not asking unanimous consent to that effect right now. I have discussed that with Senator Abraham, and Senator Kennedy. But I would need to check that with Senator Daschle and others. 
But I want the Members to know that we need to complete action on these high-tech bills. A lot of great work has been done. We have been able to pass two of them. We are very close to being able to get the other two done. Our intent is to stay with that until we get it completed. 
The Senate will now begin the DOD authorization bill. 
Having said all of that, there will be no further votes this evening, and the Senate will consider the DOD authorization bill throughout Thursday's session of the Senate. I had hoped there would be opening statements. But I understand we will just lay the bill down, and then we will begin tomorrow. 
But I want the Record to show that I was requested to have the remainder of the night for the DOD authorization bill so that we could get 2 or 3 hours on it. We are not going to be able to do that. But I am certainly prepared and willing, and wanted to do that.

Much success can be attributed to the Foundation's leadership in ensuring each center establishes a clear vision and conducts careful strategic planning involving their industry partners. Among the impacts of this program are: Next generation engineering systems developed from new knowledge discoveries and new technological developments; Technology transferred to hundreds of companies and governmental agencies; Technical assistance and training provided for industry and government; Thousands of undergraduate and graduate students involved in the research of the centers and exposed to next generation systems research and development; and Outreach to K-12 and to underrepresented groups.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will be considering a series of bills that truly impact and shape our lives in this age of ever-changing technology. 
Many of us in this chamber can remember a time when the words `Internet' and `intellectual property' had no meaning in our day-to-day activities. That is changing. Rapidly changing. New, competitive markets are emerging, and exploding, thanks to continuing technological advancements and innovations. 
The potential benefits of such unprecedented growth is exciting. Besides transforming the structure of the communications industry, high technology is literally changing the way millions of us live and do business. 
I would like to share a good Samaritan story about how wireless technology does impact, and possibly save, lives. 
Mrs. Debbie Sanders, one of my constituents from the small town of Enid, Mississippi, is the 1998 recipient of the VITA Wireless Samaritan Award for her act of heroism. On her way home from a long day at work as a store's assistant manager, Debbie saw a car flipped upside down in a water-filled ditch. She used her wireless phone to call for help and pulled the victim from the vehicle. Not sure of her exact location on this lonely stretch of deserted, rural road, Debbie had to remain on the phone for over one hour with emergency personnel until she and the victim could be reached. 
Mr. President, this is only one example of how high technology can enhance our world. 
There will be boundless opportunity in the next century for new technological applications to evolve. With that opportunity will come an absolute necessity for a highly skilled labor work force to ensure America's competitive standing and high-technology leadership. Our vibrant economy is directly tied to this cutting-edge technology. Bills that advance our country's ability to compete will strengthen our future and our children's future. 
Several measures will be considered, but I want to particularly mention the Consumer Anti-Slamming Protection Act. We need a public policy to crack down on slamming. We need to protect the telephone consumer. The world indeed is shrinking, and we all have come to depend upon long distance service, not as a luxury but as a necessity. We want to talk to those closest to our hearts, wherever they may be. 
The practice of `slamming'--unauthorized switching of long distance telephone service carriers by competing service providers--must stop. It is abusive to the consumer, and has become much too frequent and too disruptive. Our colleagues have told us horror stories in the past, and today we will hear even more illustrations of slamming abuses. With this statute, I join my colleagues in urging the FCC to strengthen its enforcement program to stop this unscrupulous practice. Tougher penalties against companies that intentionally slam will be an effective solution. 
I want to thank my Senate colleagues for their diligent leadership and keen focus on tackling these legislative challenges. Their willingness and commitment to work in a bipartisan manner is the reason we are here today. Although some of the issues may be fundamentally noncontroversial, I know the issues are complex, and I appreciate their efforts. 
Mr. President, I look forward to the debate. It is also my hope that progress will be continued, and consensus achieved, on other critical pieces of legislation to address a variety of high-technology related concerns shared by many in this Chamber.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on Monday a good deal of work was done and the predicate was laid for a number of bills to be considered this week. We will begin the morning with morning business until 10 a.m. I observe that there are at least a couple of Senators who wish to take advantage of that. 
Following morning business, Senator D'Amato will be recognized to introduce a bill regarding patient care for breast cancer. It is hoped that a short time agreement can be reached with the D'Amato bill. 
At 11 a.m., under a previous order the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the agriculture research conference report. The time until 12:10 will be divided among several Members for debate on that conference report. Following that debate, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the National Science Foundation reauthorization bill, again under a short time agreement. A rollcall vote will occur on passage of that bill, the National Science Foundation reauthorization, at approximately 12:15 or so. Therefore Members should be aware that the first vote of today's session will occur at 12:15. Then the Senate will recess after that vote for the weekly policy caucuses. 
When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, Senator Gramm of Texas will be recognized to move to recommit the agriculture research conference report. There will be 1 hour of debate equally divided on the motion. At the conclusion of that debate, the Senate will proceed to vote on or in relation to the motion. Following the vote, it is hoped that a short time agreement can be reached with respect to the agriculture research conference report. Any of several high-tech bills or other legislative or executive items also may be taken up today, if they can be cleared. 
I did have a good conversation late on Monday afternoon with Senator Daschle. I believe we are going to be able to clear at least three of those high-tech bills. All of them are broadly supported and I believe will have an overwhelming vote once we get to a vote. I won't list them now, but we will make some further announcement on that later on today. 
Finally, as a reminder to all Members, a cloture vote will occur on Wednesday on the motion to proceed to the missile defense bill. Senator Cochran handled this debate on the floor on Monday. He has done excellent work on this bill. This is something we should do for the defense of our country. The American people, I find, when I go around and talk about missile defense, are shocked to learn that we don't have a National Missile Defense System in place. So this bill is very important, I believe. I appreciate the work that has been done by my colleague from Mississippi. 
The next 2 weeks obviously will be extremely busy as Members attempt to complete action on several important pieces of legislation. There are a number of conferences that we hope to have completed and voted on before the Memorial Day recess, including the ISTEA II, the highway transportation bill, the education conference report, the IRS reform and restructuring conference report. We also have a vote already agreed to with regard to Russia-Iran missile technology transfer, which is a continuing concern. Progress is not being made sufficiently, 
and I do expect that there will be a vote on this before the end of the next week. 
There are a number of other very important bills now that Members are getting cleared through committees or that Members are seeking to have voted on. We will try to schedule as many of those as we can. Obviously, we will need the cooperation of all Members as we try to get through this process before the end of the May recess for Memorial Day. 
I again emphasize we do have probably three high-tech bills that we have cleared: we have the agriculture conference report, we have the missile defense bill that Senator Cochran has been working on, and the National Science Foundation reauthorization bill. And we are going to try to clear some Executive Calendar nominations, too. 
So, again, thank you for your cooperation. These are all very important bills for the American people and I hope we can continue the good progress that we have made over the last 3 weeks. When you look back at what we have been able to get through the Senate, in terms of education, the NATO treaty enlargement, and also last week the IRS reform--if we can have another week and complete the week with the DOD Department of Defense authorization bill I think we can feel very good about what we have accomplished over the last month. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had not intended to speak on this amendment, but I did want to speak in wrap-up on the bill itself, and also to notify the Members of what the schedule would be. This seems like a good time to do all of them because I have been inspired to want to speak on this amendment. 
I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Georgia, and especially my colleague from Mississippi. This is totally outrageous that this kind of random audit is going on, and the people who are getting the brunt of it are the people at the low end of the scale, from a poor State like my own State of Mississippi. 
As a matter of fact, I believe we first got the inkling that this was going on at hearings last fall when we had hearings in the Finance Committee, because I remember being struck by the fact that States like Mississippi and Idaho were the ones that had a disproportionate share of these random audits. 
I think a great job has been done on this bill, and there has been bipartisan input. But this is an unfairness that cannot be allowed to go on. I am going to support this amendment. I realize it is going to be difficult, under the circumstances. But I plead now with the chairman and the ranking member to get into this because we cannot allow this to continue. It is just another example of the type of thing going on at the IRS that I think Senators and the American people, frankly, as a group, have been shocked to learn from the hearings that we had, and as we are finding out more information. I commend the Senator for his amendment. I call upon the committee to do more on this and to work to make sure the IRS stops this kind of conduct.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of the Thompson-Sessions amendment to H.R. 2676, the IRS reform and restructuring bill. Under the previous order, the time between approximately 9:30 and 10 a.m. will be equally divided for debate on the amendment. At the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate will proceed to vote on or in relation to the Thompson-Sessions amendment. I repeat, that will be around 10 o'clock, maybe slightly after. Or, of course, some time could be yielded back. 
As a reminder, we have reached an agreement limiting amendments to the bill. However, there are almost 50 amendments on the list. I had hoped maybe there would be a dozen. I assume, even though some of these, or most of them, would qualify as relevant amendments, Senators will decide that they can offer them on some other legislation or some of them, hopefully, will be accepted after working with the managers of the legislation. I hope those who do want to offer amendments will come forward and do that this morning. 
We need to begin to get a lineup of which amendments will be debated and voted on and a time that will be used. I see no need to debate these amendments for 2 or 3 hours. Most of them we ought to talk about 30 or 40 minutes and have a vote, because a lot of work has already been done on this legislation. We have two or three contentious issues we need to flesh out and have a debate and vote on, but even those amendments I don't think are going to be critical at this point if either side wins. We still can work further on this once we get to conference, even though I hope the conference will be short. I think it is incumbent upon the Congress to complete this legislation before we go home--I mean in its entirety--for the Memorial Day recess. 
We need the cooperation of all Senators in order to complete action on this important bill today, and we all have assumed it will be done today. It should be done today. We don't need to, and should not, drag it over until next week because if it does it will bump everything else. We have high tech, crop insurance, and Department of State authorization, just next week. Higher education is pending out there. We need to act on that. 
There will be a lot of work during the next 10 days to see if we can get an understanding of how to proceed, if we are going to proceed, on the tobacco bill. We need to get this done. For those who think I am huffing and puffing here, we can replicate last Thursday night if the Members want to. We can be sitting right here at 11 o'clock finishing up this bill or we can get going. Progress was made yesterday because we got an agreement to limit amendments, but I didn't feel the sense of urgency. 
So I say to the managers of the legislation, let's get going. Let's get the amendments racked up and be prepared to tell Senators that if they are not going to come to the floor and offer their amendments they will be shoved off at the end and they will get 5 minutes or 2 minutes to describe their amendments. 
Again, we don't want to stifle the Senate being able to work its will, but I think we have to be reasonable and be prepared to complete our work. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today we begin our second day of floor debate on legislation to rein in the Internal Revenue Service. As hearings demonstrated last week, once again, the IRS is an agency with real problems. I should note, again, it has a job to do. It is not an easy job. We acknowledge that. We also have to give credit to those IRS employees who work hard, do an honest job, and don't target people for unnecessary audits or try to set up laundering schemes, things of that nature. A lot of IRS employees have put their own jobs on the line and have endured a lot of harassment because they have said there are problems here. 
We heard from a number of them last week who came in. In fact, one lady came in, she is chief of a division, and complained about the slowness or inaction by the Deputy Commissioner of IRS where there has been misconduct within the IRS. It seems when complaints or problems develop and recommendations are made, they are put in a desk somewhere, or on a desk, and they seem to just disappear. It was an IRS agent who came and said the Deputy Commissioner is not following up on things. 
We had a panel of IRS agents who came in and talked about the problems they had found. IRS agents are the ones who pointed out there had been targeted audits of people like Senator Howard Baker. It was three IRS agents who were, in effect, punished or moved because they said there is a rogue agent here out of control doing something that is wrong and illegal. So a lot of IRS workers are the ones who have brought these matters to our attention. 
The most compelling testimony, though, last week, for me, involved small businessmen who had been raided unfairly. Some of them still, obviously, are emotionally distraught over what they had to endure. One of them was a man by the name of John Colaprete. Mr. Colaprete is a small businessman, a restaurant owner, in Virginia Beach, VA. He told the Senate Finance Committee how the IRS almost destroyed his business. This morning you will get a chance to hear his story in his own words. I am going to read his testimony because it was so compelling. I fear a lot of Senators did not hear his testimony, and a lot of the American people didn't hear it, but this is just one of the three. I know there are many others in the country. 
This is the type of thing that is being done by the Criminal Investigation Unit at IRS that has to be reined in.  
My name is John Colaprete. I'm from Virginia Beach, and I'm in the restaurant business. 
I'm also a husband, a father, and veteran, having served my country proudly as a U.S. Marine Corps captain from 1965 to 1969. 
I have never been in any sort of trouble with the law, and I believe that every American has an obligation to pay their fair share of income taxes. 
I have never failed to meet that obligation. 
I have always considered myself both patriotic and a law-abiding citizen. 
I will always be a law-abiding citizen. However, I feel I have literally been punished for upholding the laws of the nation I swore an allegiance to honor and defend. 
Four years ago, I employed a bookkeeper in my restaurant who eventually embezzled approximately $40,000.00 from the business. She went to prison for her crimes, but not before turning my life, and the lives of countless others, upside down. With the full cooperation of the Internal Revenue Service, this woman, a multiple felon, who already had an outstanding warrant for her arrest, managed not once but twice, to victimize me, my family, partners, employees, patrons and others in the business community who depended upon me and my business. 
This dance with the Devil began in March of 1994, when my partner and I became aware that we were being swindled by our bookkeeper. When we discovered substantial shortages in our accounts, we confronted her, and she admitted to stealing from our business. She told us she would make restitution. Unfortunately, rather than make restitution, she sought shelter with the IRS and told them a fantastic tale of money laundering, gun running and drug dealing by my partner and me. 
Little did I know that the IRS would spend less than 48 hours investigating my bookkeeper's allegations before conducting raids on my business, my home, and the home of my manager. 
Little did I know that the government I had so proudly served would accept these allegations to be true, despite the alarming lack of substantiation, probable cause, or proof of any sort whatsoever. 
Little did I know that the IRS, when faced with the outrageous claim that I had thousands of pounds of cocaine stored like cordwood in my office, would subscribe to a policy of Guilty Until Proven Innocent. Unfortunately, in the case of the IRS, I now know this is standard operating procedure when dealing with law-abiding taxpayers. 
This wasn't a matter of an honest mistake; in fact, a recently retired FBI agent divulged in a deposition taken for the case that I have pending against the IRS, that he had advised all involved to be skeptical about the claims of my accuser. The FBI specifically declined to become involved, and in the words of one of its agents, the whole story sounded like a `Grade B' movie. 
On the morning that both my home and business were raided--raids executed solely on the word of my ex-bookkeeper--I was in a church for the occasion of my son's first holy communion. Armed agents, accompanied by drug-sniffing dogs, stormed my restaurant during breakfast, ordered patrons out of the restaurant and interrogated my employees. The IRS impounded my records, my cash registers, and my computers. Since the raids, we managed to get up and running, despite what can easily be perceived as our own government's best attempts to put us out of business. 
Today, I still wonder how such a thing can happen, but I know it does. And I'd like you to know that for every taxpayer like me--those who have survived armed assaults on our businesses and our homes--there are perhaps several thousands of taxpayers who, in fear, lick their wounds, tally their losses, and consider themselves lucky that the IRS has finally left them alone, their innocence notwithstanding. I have nothing to hide, and I will never consider myself lucky when I ponder the events of the last four years. As for the taxpayers who have suffered similar injustices at the hands of the IRS, I hear from these people every week. They seek me out and relate horror stories that, at one time, would have evoked from me nothing more than simple skepticism. I used to believe that such things could only happen in a Communist bloc country, or a police state. I don't believe that anymore. 
When the raid occurred at my home, the front foor was torn from the hinges. My dogs were impounded, along with my safe and 12 years of my personal income tax returns and supporting documents. When that safe was finally returned, an heirloom watch that I had received as a gift from my father was missing. In the aftermath of the raid, I returned to find my home in shambles. It was as if I had been burglarized, both in appearance and in the sense of having been grossly violated. 
While my restaurant and my home were being raided by armed agents of the Internal Revenue Service, a raid was also being conducted on the home of my manager. 
In that raid, my manager was pulled at gunpoint from the shower and forcibly restrained while he attempted to call an attorney. His teenage son was forced to the floor at gunpoint. His daughter, 14 years old at the time, had several friends over for a slumber party the night before. These young girls had to get dressed under the watchful eyes of male agents, despite the presence of female agents. The IRS agents stood in the doorway to the bedroom, refusing these young girls even a semblance of privacy. 
We were never charged with any crimes. After scrutinizing our records for four months, the IRS returned most of them. A rental truck pulled up in front of my business one day, and the items that were returned were basically dumped in a pile on the street for us to sort through. I never received an apology. 
Following the raids, I could get no answers as to why all of this occurred. I was met with `No comment, Mr. Colaprete,' at every turn. Freedom of information requests were ignored, ostensibly due to a backlog of such requests, and despite legally mandated time limits on such requests. Two newspapers in Virginia Beach made repeated requests under the Freedom of Information Act, only to have the Justice Department thumb its nose at those requests. When an investigative journalist began to get to the bottom of things, he was also subjected to the harassment of the IRS. He had an opportunity to interview Special Agent Carol Willman from the IRS office in Norfolk, Virginia. During that interview, Ms. Willman interrupted the reporter's inquiries with a demand for his Social Security number. Within the year, he was notified that the IRS wanted to audit his return. When a local publication reported this, the audit was abruptly canceled. An IRS agent stated at the time that the agency does not retaliate against citizens through the use of audits, but the facts would seem to indicate otherwise. 
The ex-bookkeeper, meanwhile, was kept in protective custody by the IRS in a motel up until the time of the raids. It is almost unimaginable that there could be such a level of incompetence at the IRS that they would not only take the word of this woman and begin any sort of investigation, but they would shield her from the authorities who were trying to arrest her. The woman who the IRS was protecting and on whom they had relied had already been convicted numerous times. In fact, the outstanding criminal charge pending against her at the time she approached the IRS was for a crime involving lying and stealing. Ironically, just a week before this woman approached the IRS, I had specifically gone to the police and filed a complaint against her, alleging that she had lied, stolen and embezzled from me. In the face of all of that, how could anyone, let alone a supposedly trained, professional inspector with the IRS, accept at face value what this woman was saying? Based on her word, she--Carol Willman--not only commenced an investigation, but completely shut down a business and turned the lives of innocent people upside down less than 48 hours after first being introduced to the woman. Is there such a competitive atmosphere within the IRS to add another feather in their cap that they would ignore not only basic investigative techniques, but the obvious flaws in this woman's character and simply accept her at face value? It is frightening that such a woman could have conned the IRS into believing that her employer, despite all appearances to the contrary, was a high-level gangster and then shield her from the law in the belief that she would lead them to a bigger fish--like me. 
To compound the Keystone Cop mistakes that had already been made, the IRS then allowed her to leave the jurisdiction of Virginia to go to North Carolina where she was only later sent to jail for embezzling from three other employers in that state. On the surface, it might appear that she acted alone, but that just isn't so. The IRS was her partner in crime--first, acting in concert to destroy my life, and then allowing her to flee the state and victimize others. 
I looked for answers and was rebuffed at every turn. I suffered a deep depression that lasted a year. I was immobilized and could not get out of bed some days. My neighbors shunned me. My wife, who is an artist, has not been able to pick up a paint brush in four years. My children were taunted at school and told that their father was a gangster and a drug dealer--a Mafioso. I raised my children with a zero tolerance for dishonesty, and now they must hear allegations that I am a tax cheat. I am here to tell you that I am none of those things. 
Relatively speaking, the trauma that has befallen me is mild, compared to what has happened to my manager. He has suffered severe depression, sought counseling from his pastor, literally been shunned by friends and acquaintances, and has yet to get his life back in order. He has been ruined financially and emotionally, with little or no hope of ever getting his life back to where it was prior to the raids. 
I'm also here to tell you that we cannot treat our citizens this way--not in America. I have been repeatedly victimized over the past four years, primarily by a government tax agency that is funded with my tax dollars. If Americans have a perception of the IRS as the Boogey Man, it is because the IRS itself has promoted that perception through policies that are fundamentally unconstitutional and illegal. 
This is not a partisan issue--it is a people issue and a freedom issue. 
I have a lawsuit pending against the IRS, and I will not rest until I have had my day in court. The IRS response to the lawsuit has been to cast doubt on my character by insinuating that they did, in fact, find evidence of wrongdoing, but they chose not to prosecute if. If I was guilty of anything, why would they `choose' not to prosecute? While any `allegations' will eventually be shown in court to be what they are, i.e., a smoke screen, until I can get into court to prove my case, these `allegations' linger in the community where I live and work and continue to compound my frustration. 
The system does not work for the American taxpayer. The total sense of violation that we have experienced has had a devastating effect on us all. In the wake of all of this, I find there is no system in place to defend me, or others like me. I'd like to believe that someone takes responsibility for what has happened--for what continues to happen every day in this country. If the example we are to set for our citizens is one of no accountability and no remorse, then our form of government--the oldest surviving democracy on the planet--cannot survive much longer. 
A day doesn't go by that I don't wonder what harassment will occur next. I would like to know why this dark entity known as the IRS has come into my life and refused to leave. So who protects me in the system? Who cares about my constitutional rights? Not the courts. Not the IRS. I am hoping that the buck stops here--with you, Senator Roth and this Committee. 
I leave you with just three questions, Senators:

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2676, the IRS reform and restructuring bill, for debate only, prior to the policy luncheon recess, except for the offering of a managers' amendment if one is agreed to and worked out. I have the impression they have made good progress in that area. 
Members are encouraged to come to the floor to debate this IRS reform bill so the Senate can complete action as early as possible this week. It is certainly very important legislation. A lot of effort has been put into its development. I know Senators do want to make comments on it, but I hope they will not wait until later in the week. They have a golden opportunity this morning and this afternoon to go ahead and make statements they are prepared to offer. 
As a reminder, a rollcall vote is scheduled this evening at 5:30 on passage of H.R. 1385, the workforce development bill. There will be 1 hour of debate prior to that, beginning at 4:30. Any votes ordered with respect to the IRS reform bill will be stacked to occur following the 5:30 vote. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention to this. I hope we can have the type of cooperation this week that we received last week. 
Mr. President, I do have a statement I would like to make, but before I begin that, let me observe the absence of a quorum just for a moment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been working throughout the day to get an agreement that will allow us to come to a fair and reasonable conclusion to the IRS restructuring and reform bill. We have been able to work out, I think, a fair agreement, and I would like to propound that. 
I ask unanimous consent that with respect to H.R. 2676 all amendments be relevant to the bill except amendments to title VI must be both relevant and cleared by both the managers and leaders, one amendment offered by the chairman that pays for the cost of the legislation, with no second-degree amendments in order, one amendment offered by Senator Kerrey that also pays for the legislation, with no second-degree amendments, and it not be in order prior to the conclusion of debate on the chairman's `pay for' amendment.

Mr. LOTT. Having reached this agreement, there will be no further votes this evening. 
After Senator Daschle makes his comments, I do want to respond and comment on the fact that, frankly, Senators on both sides of the aisle have had to hold back and be cooperative. This was not easy to reach. But this is a very important piece of legislation that has been crafted in a bipartisan way. If we didn't get this agreement, we could have been working on it for days and weeks and it would have wound up pushing everything down the line, many bills that we do want to 
 do and can do. 
So I appreciate the cooperation and I appreciate that Senator Daschle has had to work very hard. I could start naming Senators on this side and he can start naming Senators on that side who had good and valid amendments. But I think we did the right thing. After the Senator comments, I would like to respond further to Senator D'Amato's generosity and very responsible action and talk about what we are going to try to do to be helpful.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to say, before Senator Kerrey leaves the floor, that the time that he outlined so both Senators could explain what is in the amendments that would pay for the costs of these corrections at IRS sounds fine. If we could have votes by 10:30 in the morning, I don't see any problem with that, two back to back at 10:30. 
Let me say to Senator D'Amato, once again, I appreciate his cooperation here, and it is not the first time he has cooperated this year on a lot of issues. But on this issue in particular, I know how strongly he feels about it and I am absolutely satisfied that he is going to get a vote on this issue, and he should get a vote on this issue, and I am going to work with him to make that happen in a reasonable way. 
I will work with you to try to see if we can get an agreement to bring this up next week. It is going to take work on your part and on my part. Senator Daschle has a number of Senators who have views, or amendments even, on this. That is a problem, because it could very easily get totally out of control and have the whole world caving in on it. But we will work on that. 
If, for some reason, that does not work out, every bill that comes along will be a prospect for an amendment, for the Senator's amendment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to say once again how much I appreciated the cooperation that I received from Senators on both sides of the aisle last week. I think last week was a very good week for the Senate. We completed the NATO enlargement debate, and I thought it was a good debate. I thought the Senate showed a great deal of seriousness and maturity in the way they handled the final phases and cast their votes on Thursday night. 
We also completed action on the supplemental appropriations bill, which has gone to the President. That way, we will have the funds we need for the defense of our country and to assist with natural disasters that have hit any number of States over the past few months. 
Also, on Friday, we did have debate on the workplace development bill--all debate except for the final 1 hour. All amendments were handled. I believe there were five or six amendments that had been pending. So Senator Jeffords, Senator DeWine, and others did a good job getting that debate done on Friday. We will pick that bill back up at 4:30 on Tuesday. There will be 1 hour of debate, followed by final passage on the Workplace Development Act at 5:30 on Tuesday. 
Following morning business this morning, the Senate will begin consideration then of H.R. 2676, the IRS reform and restructuring bill, for debate only. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer opening statements and debate this very important piece of legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as a member of the Finance Committee, once again, last week I found the hearings on IRS enlightening, in fact, horrifying. We had witness after witness come in and put their own jobs and reputations on the line--if they were IRS employees--to talk about the protection system of mismanagement and misconduct within IRS. We had small businessmen come forward and talk about businesses being raided--in one instance, I think by 64 gun-carrying IRS agents and U.S. marshals--when they had done nothing wrong. We heard great detail about the efforts that have been gone to by management to protect misconduct. 
Finally, we heard of targeting of political officials or public officials for audits or for, in one case, an effort to show that this person had been laundering money, and it was not true. Senator Howard Baker, the great former majority leader, came before the committee and told what he had experienced--by the way, even though he was under a lot of pressure not to do so. 
We clearly have a culture of intimidation and misconduct at the IRS. It is not something that has just developed; it has been growing and getting worse for the past 15 years. We need serious IRS reform. The House-passed legislation made a major step in the right direction last year, but we have found a lot more abuses. We have come up with more things that need to be done to make the IRS genuinely representative of what the people expect them to be--that is, to do their job, which is not easy, and to protect the truly hard-working and honest IRS agents who are doing their jobs every day, some who came forward and pointed out where problems have been. 
We have learned a lot and have come up with some good legislation. There will be some relevant amendments that will 
need to be offered and debated and voted on. I hope we can come to an agreement that will not allow this bill to become one that is attacked by poison pills or cause its delay or destruction. The American people want this IRS reform. I think to get off in a debate of unrelated issues--whether it is trade issues, many of which I may be for, or health issues, or whatever--would be a big mistake. We ought to have a good debate this Monday and Tuesday. We ought to complete this IRS debate by Wednesday or Thursday night, at the latest. We were able to get our job done last week. I hope we can do it again this week. 
Now, in addition to those bills, on Thursday or Friday we may try to take up a couple of other issues. It will depend on how the debate goes. The agriculture research conference report is something we might try to get up Thursday night or Friday, or not later than next Monday. We also have pending before us a number of other important bills, including the higher education legislation and nuclear waste. So there are a number of bills that are waiting. 
Again, I ask for the cooperation of the Senators on both sides of the aisle to work with the chairman of the Finance Committee and ranking member to get an agreement on how we can proceed. Let's have a good debate, relevant amendments, and let's complete this job. 
Even the President, who originally resisted IRS reform, on his radio show Saturday said what has been happening at IRS is outrageous and that we should act on this legislation and get it to him as quickly as possible. I hope we will move forward, now that we have him involved in this effort, and complete this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I note that there are no Senators waiting to speak. I believe the managers of the legislation will be here at noon. From now until noon will be a period of morning business. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on one of the amendments that will be considered this morning, an amendment by Senator Craig of Idaho. 
Senator Craig is an outstanding Member of this body and one of my closest friends, but I reluctantly will oppose the amendment he offered. I think he knows that I opposed the President's decision to deploy U.S. Armed Forces to Bosnia in 1995. I continue to have major problems with the situation there and questions about what the end game is. But I don't look at Bosnia in a theoretical sense only or without considering the history of that part of the world. 
I have traveled to Brussels to meet with all of our NATO allies and discuss the situation in Bosnia. I spent the last 4th of July in Bosnia, Sarajevo, and Tuzla. I have looked at the situation firsthand. I spent many hours with administration officials and outside experts discussing the situation in Bosnia. I have grave concerns about the administration's completely open-ended commitment to remain in Bosnia. We were solemnly given dates and unequivocal assurances that U.S. troops would be out by December 1996. They weren't. Then it was July 1998. The President intends not to meet that date. The assurances we were given were wrong. 
The fact that the administration has been so often wrong raises questions about their overall policy. Do we want peace there? Yes. Have we been willing to make a commitment? Yes. But the question is, How much, how long, and for what? Is the situation under control there? What is happening in Kosovo? Did the administration turn a blind eye and ignore that problem and only now realize the ramifications, the implications, that Kosovo has in the region? 
There has been some progress in Bosnia. Many time lines and the agreements that were supposed to have been met, however, have not been met. We do need to continue to move forward and to encourage peace, democracy and freedom--not fighting and killing--in that part of the world. 
But the U.S. taxpayers have already spent some $8 billion in Bosnia since December of 1995. Our European allies have been reluctant to shoulder more of the burden. There are even credible reports that a French military officer tipped off the most notorious war criminal and helped him avoid apprehension. Basically, they say, You are the world leader; without you, it won't be done. We assume a very serious responsibility and maybe a certain degree of pride in that. But I think more needs to be done by our European allies and there needs to be a plan, some way of dealing with this problem, just like there should be a long-term plan in dealing with Saddam Hussein. There is no plan there, no plan to find a way to remove Saddam Hussein so the people in Iraq can be free. 
The pattern begins to be clear. I have been very careful as majority leader to try to rise above politics or partisan politics. I have taken a pounding from some sources for that. I did support the Chemical Weapons Treaty and I do support NATO. But there is a limit to how far I will go. I will not support the administration unconditionally--particularly if there is no policy, no clear plan. I think that is the case in Iraq, where the policy of containment is not working. So what is next? Quite frankly, it falls to the Congress to try to say: How about this? Would you consider that? Develop a plan to do something, anything. We are prepared to do that if we have to because of the absence of action by the Administration. 
For all those reasons, I am concerned about the administration's policy in Bosnia. This issue should be addressed by the Senate on merits later on this year in the appropriations process. But we should not use it as a way to delay the decision to enlarge NATO. 
NATO enlargement is the right thing to do. But it should rise and fall on its own merits. We should not allow it to tangle up our decision into issues like Bosnia. I agree with Senator Craig's concerns, but I don't think this is the place to have the debate or action based on what may or may not be the future in Bosnia to determine what would happen in NATO. We should not make the legitimate aspirations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic subject to our differences with the executive branch on Bosnia policy. I hope the Senate will defeat this amendment and move to conclusion and pass NATO enlargement. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think this has been a very good debate. There have been significant amendments offered and now voted upon. I see from the list we have before us as many as six or eight additional amendments still pending, several of which we have not been able to work out a time agreement on. I thank all Senators for being cooperative. We have had opponents and proponents who have been cooperative. I encourage that to continue. 
I believe maybe a Senator or two indicated that they didn't know we were going to try to finish this bill this week. I think I have said all along that we should have a focused, unobstructed debate, but the intent was to complete it Wednesday or Thursday. Here we are on Thursday at almost 4 o'clock. I talked to Senator Daschle, and we are agreed that we are going to finish NATO enlargement either at a reasonable hour this afternoon, or a late hour tonight, or tomorrow, or Saturday, but we are not going to leave this week until we finish NATO enlargement and the supplemental appropriations bill. 
Now, we can do both of those in a very responsible way with still some good debate remaining. We need cooperation and time agreements. We need cooperation on the supplemental appropriations. We agree that these two issues must be completed this week so that next week we can move to IRS reform, or the Workplace Development Partnership Act, and perhaps even crop insurance and agriculture insurance. So we don't have the luxury of rolling this over until next week. 
Our first vote will not occur until Tuesday at 5 o'clock. Please work with us, and we can complete this bill and have a vote by 6:30 or 7 o'clock if everybody will agree to a reasonable time limit. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, as if in legislative session, that the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, may proceed, after disposition of the NATO treaty, to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3579, the supplemental appropriations bill, and, further, the reading of the conference report be waived. 
I further ask there be 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form, and following the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action or debate.

Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator from Texas wishes to be recognized next, but just so the Senators will be on notice to what I think will happen now, the Senator from Texas wishes to speak a few minutes on the final disposition of this issue. Senator Smith will be recognized to offer an amendment. His amendment will be set aside, and Senator Inhofe will have an amendment he will offer. At the conclusion of their debate, then we would anticipate that there would be two or three votes that would occur, hopefully in sequence, so this could begin in a relatively short period of time. 
We do not have a time agreement, but we hope to reach conclusion before too late into the night.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be brief as we complete debate on the resolution of ratification providing our advice and consent to the addition of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Ths has been an excellent debate in the finest traditions of the Senate. We have spent more than 40 hours on the resolution over the course of 9 days. Almost 50 Senators have made statement, many of them on several occasions. The Senate has considered 20 amendments. We have adopted 12 and rejected 8. This is in addition to the 4 conditions and 7 declarations in the committee's Resolution. 
Many people deserve credit in this debate. The Chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, has shown great leadership. Senator Roth led the NATO Observer Group with energy and diligence. Senator Biden served as the lead Democrat to both and made valuable--and frequent--contributions to our debate. Senator Gordon Smith, Chair of the Europe Subcommittee played a central role. 
Many staff played key roles as well. Steve Biegun, Brian McKeon, Beth Wilson and Mike Haltzel of the Foreign Relations Committee can all now get on with their lives. Ian Brzezinski (BRA-zin-ski) with Senator Roth was always there for the Observer Group. The Congressional Research Service, especially Stan Sloan, on the floor now, provided invaluable services for members on both sides of the issue. Legislative Counsel Art Rynerson drafted virtually all of the language we have been debating. 
A number of issues have been raised in our consideration. We have addressed future enlargement, NATO's mission, costs, Bosnia and arms control. I believe all sides have had an opportunity to have their voices heard. Now it is time to cast our votes. 
Much has been said about Russia over the past week--how Russia will react to NATO enlargement and the impact on a wide range of bilateral issues. Both sides agree that Russian hard-liners should not have a veto over our course of action. But supporters and opponents of enlargement differ greatly over the impact on our relations with Russia. 
We have heard many estimates of how our vote will influence the tangled web of Russian politics and the disturbing course of Russian foreign policy. I do not think anyone can predict the impact with complete precision. But we can look at some basic facts. 
First, NATO poses no threat to Russia. No serious person inside or outside Russia believes NATO--with 16 or 19 members--jeopardizes Russia. The thought of Czech tanks rolling across the Russian steppes is ludicrous. 
Second, the average Russian is not concerned about NATO enlargement. A recent poll even shows the majority of Russians in Moscow support adding these three countries to NATO. 
Third, the Russians have delayed action on START II for years. NATO enlargement is only the latest in a long line of reasons given for their inaction. 
Fourth, Russian diplomacy in Brussels has not been affected by our debate here. Just yesterday, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council discussed a wide range of issues. Alleged Russian concerns about enlargement were not an issue. 
Finally, long before NATO enlargement became a real possibility, Russia has engaged in a large number of foreign policy actions that harm our interests--from proliferation to Iran and violations of START I to subversion of its neighbors. NATO enlargement may provide an excuse for Russian adventurism, but will not provide a cause. 
Our principle concern with Russia must be Russian behavior--not the volatile mood swings of Russian domestic politics. 
Mr. President, this will be a historic vote. It is fitting that we are voting on including the Czech Republic in NATO sixty years after the sellout at Munich, fifty years after the communist coup in Prague, and thirty years after Soviet tanks crushed the winds of freedom in Czechoslovakia. 
That is the past and, as many Senators have pointed out, this vote is about the future. It is about what kind of a Europe we want to see. It is about what kind of allies we want in a continent where we have fought three great wars in this century. 
Expanding NATO is about ensuring this generation and future generations are not called to fight a fourth time. It is about a 21st century trans-Atlantic partnership that provides more freedom, more security and more opportunity for all of us. 
A few days ago, I received a letter from Polish Foreign Minister Geremek (GAR-a-mech). His words are an appropriate way to close debate:  
The consistent and visionary foreign policy of the United States has opened a historic window of opportunity. Just as in 1989, it was American leadership which was the decisive factor in ending the Cold War. . . . so today it is the U.S. Senate which will decide whether a new page is turned in history of the Transatlantic area and Eurasia. It will be a chapter testifying to the triumph of freedom and democracy and to the success of the biggest and most successful alliance in world history. It will strengthen the Alliance to the clear advantage of Europe and America. 
I thank all Senators for their cooperation in reaching this moment. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the votes are final passage of the NATO enlargement treaty, and according to the rules of the Senate, Senators should be in their assigned desks and vote from their desks. That is in the rules. I have discussed it with Senator Byrd. We are all here. I think it would be an appropriate thing for us to do. The rules do require it. 
I also think it would help us expedite the vote. So, if the Senators would take their assigned desks, we will have a vote on the historic treaty. 
The second vote is final passage of the supplemental appropriations bill. Tomorrow, the Senate will debate the Workforce Development Act under a time agreement of no more than 4 hours. Several amendments will be offered. Consequently, those votes will be postponed to occur Tuesday, May 5, at 5:30. 
Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the IRS reform bill. I know we will have a number of Senators who will wish to make opening statements. We will check with the managers and with the leadership to see about the possibility of amendments being offered. But if they are offered, they, too, would occur at 5:30 on Tuesday. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for a productive week. I congratulate the managers of this legislation. I thank the Senators who made it possible for us to complete this action tonight. I know some of those who are opposed to it would have liked to have delayed it over until next week, but I believe the time is right for us to vote. I thank all Senators for their help, and I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation and I yield to Senator Byrd.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume now the consideration of the Craig amendment, numbered 2316, pending to the NATO enlargement treaty. Under the previous order, the time until 12 o'clock noon will be equally divided for debate on the Craig amendment. At 12:00 noon, Senator Moynihan will offer an amendment regarding the European Union under a 1-hour time agreement. Following that debate, Senator Warner will be recognized to offer an amendment relating to a 3-year pause under a 2-hour time agreement. 
At the hour of 3 o'clock this afternoon, the Senate will proceed to three consecutive stacked rollcall votes. The first vote will be on or in relation to the Moynihan amendment, to be followed by a vote on Senator Warner's amendment, to be followed by a vote on Senator Craig's amendment. These are three very important and very critical amendments. I hope the Senators will be able to listen to the debate and be here for the votes at 3 p.m. I hope all three amendments will be defeated. I will speak on that briefly in a moment. 
I remind my colleagues that last night we reached a unanimous consent agreement which limits amendments to the treaty. I know the chairman and the ranking member have been working hard to see that many of these amendments can be accepted or worked out in a way they can be accepted without a rollcall vote. As for those amendments that cannot be accepted by voice vote, I urge those Senators to work with the managers on the treaty to consider their amendments this afternoon under short time agreements. I think there are only two or three that are still sort of in that category. I hope that Senators will be reasonable. 
We have had a good debate, I think a high level of debate, on this important treaty issue. Senators have been able to make their case. Amendments have been considered, and others are being considered today. I think it is time we vote. We know the substance. We have had many, many hearings. We know the arguments. Let's bring it to a conclusion. 
I hope that no Senator will be dilatory in bringing up his or her amendment this afternoon. Bring amendments up quickly with a short time agreement so we can complete that vote tonight. It is time to vote. There are a number of Senators who would like to see this completed at a reasonable hour so they can attend to other very important matters, including a bipartisan delegation that is going overseas to see if some of our allies will not be more helpful to us in covering the costs of our Persian Gulf efforts with regard to Iraq. This is a very, very important trip. It has been encouraged by the joint leadership. I hope they can get away at a reasonable hour so they can maximize their time over the weekend. 
In the remainder of the week, the Senate may consider the supplemental appropriations conference report. I spoke to the chairman this morning. He believes we will have that ready to be acted on by the Senate this afternoon. In addition, there is an agreement for consideration of S. 1186, long in the process of being developed and agreed to. That is the Work Force Development Partnership Act. We have a time agreement with some amendments in order in that time agreement. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in getting the lineup for the amendments this afternoon.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the sister-city relationship between the City of Solleftea, Sweden and the City of Madison, Mississippi. This international partnership has provided opportunities for cultural and business exchanges, as well as providing Swedish and American citizens unique experiences to broaden cultural perspectives. 
The Sister-City Program was inaugurated by United States President Dwight David Eisenhower in 1956. This business and cultural exchange was chartered to foster greater friendship and understanding between the people of the United States and other countries through the medium of direct personal contact. Since its inception, over 1,200 American state and local governments have joined with 2,100 foreign partners to create a network of international friendship. 
The citizens of Solleftea and Madison have expressed their willingness and desire, through their respective councils, to become sister-cities and to adhere to the ideals set forth by President Eisenhower. These two cities also wish to encourage cultural exchanges that will lead to a lasting friendship between the communities. 
The sister-cities agreement was signed by Solleftea and Madison on June 27, 1997 in Sweden. Since this time, three Swedish companies have opened or plan to open businesses in the City of Madison. Hagloff, Inc., Minitube and Logosol are three Swedish companies that should be commended for their efforts to further the spirit of the June 1997 compact. 
The Solleftea and Madison friendship has served as a model for future sister-city partnerships. I commend the efforts of these two great cities and wish them continued success in the future.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am concerned about Amtrak's future. Though Congress has worked to ensure its continued existence, the Administration has yet to fulfill its statutory responsibilities which are necessary if Amtrak is to have any hope of turning into a viable operation. 
As my colleagues well know, the Senate has invested countless hours during the past several Congresses to enact legislation that would enable Amtrak to reinvent itself, both operationally and financially. After three long years, Congress achieved a bipartisan reform package that was signed into law by the President on December 2, 1997. 
This package, the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, was touted as Amtrak's `last chance.' It provided significant changes, allowing Amtrak to operate more like a business. Congress expected Amtrak to immediately begin implementing the many reform provisions. Certain responsibilities concerning Amtrak's future were assumed by Amtrak's union and management employees, the American taxpayers, Congress and the Administration. 
For their part, Amtrak's employees agreed to negotiate employee benefits just like other segments of industry in exchange for financial security. The taxpayers contributed considerably--$2 billion for capital improvements in addition to the $22 billion already given to Amtrak to date. 
Congress fulfilled its part of the deal, too. The Congress appointed its members to the newly created Amtrak Reform Board. Further, the Senate recently adopted a provision in the budget resolution urging full funding for Amtrak to enable it to reach its goal of zero operating assistance by 2003. 
Who is missing from this effort? Mr. President, I content it is the Administration. 
In the past months, the Administration has missed numerous deadlines and issued contrary proposals. 
First, the law requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) Inspector General to begin an independent audit of Amtrak's financial situation. The audit was supposed to begin within a month of enactment, which would have been this past January. The DOT Inspector General has worked to abide by the statute, but the Secretary of DOT has refused to allow the audit to go forward. DOT's refusal prompted both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee to provide specific funding to cover the audit's expense. DOT knows that funding is on its way, yet the Secretary has refused to permit the IG to begin the process. 
Second, the law required the President to nominate a new 7-member Reform Board to replace Amtrak's current Board of Directors. Since the reform package required Amtrak to operate like a business. Congress and the Administration agreed that new leadership was imperative. After all, instilling a `new culture' among Amtrak employees and management necessitated that changes start from the top. 
The law requires the Reform Board to be in place by March 31, 1998--almost 1 month ago--yet we still have not received a single nomination from the President. Most troublesome is the fact that if the new Reform Board has not assumed the responsibilities of the Amtrak Board of Directors before July 1st, Amtraks' authorization lapses. I do not think the Administration would want this to happen. 
Mr. President, in addition to the Administration's recent shortcomings, it has also failed to announce the names of individuals who will fill the Administration's three slots on the Amtrak Reform Council. Because the Council is expected to play a critical role in formulating passenger rail in the years ahead, I have encouraged the 8 members appointed by the Congress to begin their work. I understand the first meeting of the Council should occur in early May. 
The only action taken by the Administration thus far has been to propose a budget that underfunds Amtrak in fiscal year 1999. The Administration's budget submission seeks to take money away from capital expenditures and to use it to pay for Amtrak salaries and operating expenses. This diversion proposal is in direct violation of the statutory language in the law which established the capital funding subsidy.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is beginning to formally debate now the enlargement of NATO. I want to emphasize that this is the `formal' beginning of the debate. The real beginning goes back more than 4 years. 
I want to again commend and congratulate the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his work on this issue and his leadership, and, of course, the ranking member, the Senator from Delaware. I note the presence of two other distinguished Senators on the floor, Senator Warner and Senator Moynihan. They have some very important views which they will express, and they will have an amendment or amendments that I think will be very carefully considered by the Senate. 
I do think it is important that we note that this issue has been debated for years. We did have some discussion a month ago. But because Senators felt that they needed more time to consider the issues--at least one Senator expressed the desire to actually go to Europe and meet with our allies, meet with NATO ambassadors, go to the affected countries. I thought that was a legitimate request, so some time was allowed to pass. 
But now I think it is important that we stay focused on this. There will be no other issue that will be debated today or tomorrow or Wednesday other than NATO enlargement so that Senators will have a chance to focus, and so that the news media will feel this debate has been focused, and we can give it the consideration that a historic treaty of this nature deserves. 
I had hoped that the U.S. Senate could have been the first country to vote on the enlargement of NATO. But Canada, Germany and Denmark have already ratified the enlargement by overwhelming margins. 
I must express some surprise over media accounts which claim the Senate is giving NATO enlargement short shrift and we are rushing to judgment. We have not. We will not. The Senate should not rush to judgment on a treaty of this magnitude. 
In 1994, in 1995, and in 1996 the Senate explicitly voted on urging NATO enlargement. The implications of this issue were all raised by opponents of that legislation, and in each case the legislation was overwhelmingly passed. But it has been debated and discussed and considered by the previous administration, by this administration, and by Congresses and the Senate since 1994. 
Last April, I realized how serious this issue was. That is why I, along with the Democratic leader, created a special group, with the endorsement of the President, beyond the existing 
committee structure, to make sure that Senators were involved and were thinking about this enlargement question, to make sure that Senators on both sides of the aisle, not on the committees directly involved, would have a chance to attend hearings and go to Europe. 
The Senate NATO enlargement group included 28 percent of the Senate--28 Senators. I made it a particular point to make sure that Senators who had reservations that had already been expressed would be included. That is why Senator Warner was in the group, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was in the group. Senator Moynihan was included. And it did include members from the Appropriations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees. 
The observer group held 17 meetings with administration officials as well as political and military leaders from Europe. Senator Roth led two observer group delegations to Europe. 
I want to say at this point that I, too, took the time to go and meet with our allies. I went to London, and then I went to Brussels. I met with all of the NATO ambassadors. I went to Budapest, Hungary. I have taken advantage of opportunities to meet with leaders from the Czech Republic and Poland as well as Hungary to make sure I understood all the ramifications of this very important issue. 
I think the criticism that we moved too quickly or have not seriously considered the issues of NATO enlargement does a real disservice to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Their hearing record, for instance, from just 6 weeks last year is 552 pages long, reflecting six hearings with 32 witnesses. 
More than 20 Senators have already spoken on NATO enlargement here on the floor when it was considered last month. GAO and CRS have issued more than 30 reports on NATO enlargement. More than 1,000 op-eds, editorials and articles have been published in newspapers and academic journals on NATO enlargement. In fact, just recently I have seen endorsements, I believe, from the Washington Post and the Washington Times and criticism from the New York Times. So there has been a lot of thought, and a lot of articles and editorials have been written on this very important matter. 
Let me provide an answer to one of the questions about the timing and nature of the Senate debate on this momentous issue. Why is there not more controversy? The answer is the supporters of NATO enlargement have been successfully making the case for 5 years. The arguments in support of NATO enlargement have convinced an impressive array of individuals and organizations. Much of the groundwork has been laid. That is why the 1996 platforms of both the Republican and Democratic Parties endorsed NATO enlargement. That is why every living former Secretary of State supports NATO enlargement. 
I have made up my mind to support NATO enlargement. I believe it is in the strategic, moral, and political interests of the United States, as well as Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
Later this week all Senators will have a chance to vote on this issue. I think they will have all the time--I am going to make sure they have all the time they need to express themselves. I think the vote will be decided by an overwhelming margin. And it is a question not only of the security of the United States, but expanding the NATO alliance to these three countries. I think it will shape the future of Europe for many years to come. 
I do subscribe to the view expressed by some--I believe Senator Biden has said this--that it is a natural extension of having won the cold war in that it is extending the ring of freedom to those countries that would like to join NATO. 
That is one thing that impressed me so much. In Hungary, they have made progress toward democracy. They are making progress toward a stronger economy. They do want to have better communication and cooperation between our military capabilities. They are committed to doing the things that are necessary to help their country as a member of NATO and as they move toward full membership in the European Union. I think they would be greatly disturbed if at this point, after all these considerations and after the efforts they have taken after the votes that they had in their own countries, if we walked away from this opportunity. 
There are those who say, `Well, what about Russia? Won't they be alarmed by this?' First, it is interesting to me that some of our colleagues who have felt the strongest against the Soviet Union and have raised the most concerns about Russia are the ones now saying, `Oh, well, what will Russia think?' Well, I think we should consider that. 
But look at Senator Lugar, who for years has been trying to make sure that the United States worked on its relations with Russia. He is for the NATO enlargement. He would certainly not want to do something that would harm the interests we share in a developing relationship with Russia. The bottom line is that NATO poses no threat to Russia or Russians unless Russia has ambitions against current or prospective NATO members. 
As I noted, Senator Warner will have an amendment to have a 3-year pause before NATO acts to invite additional members. There is no Member who is more thoughtful than Senator John Warner of Virginia when it comes to our national security, our military, NATO, and European security interests. I do not think that he is right in this instance that we need this pause. I think it would send the wrong signals. 
I think we can make the right judgment as to how much time should be required or when additional countries would be invited to join. But I do think it is important we think about that and that we give all the time that is desired to the Senators who want to advance this amendment so that we can think clearly about what will the future hold as far as other countries that might be considered for admission to NATO and where it will eventually lead.

Mr. LOTT. I am looking forward to listening to the debate. I know that it will rise to the standard that the Senate has always reached in consideration of historic matters of this type. I think when we get to the conclusion, hopefully by Wednesday, the American people will feel we have done our duty appropriately. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. Res. 218 
Whereas, in the case of Buroojy, et al. v. Walsh, et al., Civil Case No. 97-91407, pending in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona, documents have been subpoened from the offices of Senator John McCain and Senator Jon Kyl; 
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate may, by the judicial process, be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; 
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to represent Members, officers, or employees of the Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for evidence relating to their official responsibilities; 
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistently with the privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That employees of the offices of Senator McCain and Senator Kyl are authorized to testify and produce documents in the case of Buroojy, et al. v. Walsh, et al., except concerning matters for which a privilege or objection should be asserted. 
Sec. 2. That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent Senator McCain and Senator Kyl and their employees in connection with the testimony and document production authorized in section one of this resolution.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil case pending in the Superior Court for the State of Arizona. Prior to the litigation, some of the defendants sought assistance from Senator McCain's and Senator Kyl's offices in connection with a child custody dispute. The plaintiffs in the ensuing litigation have alleged, among other things, that the defendants defamed them in connection with the custody dispute. The plaintiffs have now subpoenaed correspondence from the files of the offices of Senator McCain and Senator Kyl. 
Senators McCain and Kyl are willing to provide the requested correspondence to the parties in this case. Accordingly, this resolution would authorize Senator McCain's and Senator Kyl's offices to produce and authenticate documents in this case, except where a privilege or objection should be asserted. The resolution also would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator McCain's and Senator Kyl's offices, to protect the Senate's privileges in connection with this matter.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on a couple of issues. I will not take long. But I want to again express my appreciation to a number of Senators and to the Senate as a whole for the passage of the education bill on Thursday night by a bipartisan vote of 56 to 43 with one Senator being absent. I think you have to acknowledge that Senator Coverdell of Georgia was persistent. He was fair. This issue really has been considered in one form or another for over a month. But he stuck with it. There was a lot of give and take. I appreciate the involvement of Senator Torricelli of New Jersey and his support of the bill. But more important than that, I appreciated the tone of the debate. There are fundamental disagreements on how we begin to improve the quality of education in America, deal with violence in the schools, and drugs in the schools. That is understandable. But we don't have to be nasty in our disagreements. We weren't. 
I thought the debate was of a high quality. While the disagreements are passionate, we covered a lot of subjects over the last week, a lot of amendments. We probably voted on 10 or 12 amendments on this bill. Others were accepted or agreed to in one way or another or set aside by agreements. It took cooperation to get it done even after most of the week was spent on that. I think we came up with a good bill. Education is important. This is the best debate I have seen on education in many years. Having been in Congress for 25 years, the debate on education over those 25 years has always been the same: more decisions from Washington, more programs from Washington, more strings from Washington, more money from Washington. And the test scores and the violence--the test scores have been going down and the violence and drugs have been going up. What we have been doing is not working. We need to try some different things. 
This bill does that: More choice in elementary and secondary education, No. 1. 
I emphasized in my remarks that in my own State, higher education in America is the best in the world. People want to come from all over the world and go to schools, from Stanford to Harvard to Ole Miss, to get degrees in science and engineering, business, or whatever. 
But our elementary and secondary education has been deteriorating, and we are way down on most lists. Why is that? What is the difference between higher education and elementary and secondary education? One difference is choice. When you finish high school you can go to a trade school, you can go to a community college, you can go to a denominational college, or you can go to a university. You have a choice. The second big difference is you have financial assistance to be able to do it. 
For 2 years I worked in the placement and financial aid office at the University of Mississippi. I know the importance of grants, loans, scholarships, and work-study programs for any student in America. Any student in America can go to college. He or she has a choice. Not so in elementary and secondary. If you are poor, if you come from a blue-collar working family like I did, son of a shipyard worker and a mother that taught school to help make ends meet, they couldn't afford to send me to a different school. They couldn't afford today's market. They wouldn't have been able to afford tutors or computers. They just couldn't have done it. We don't have financial assistance. There needs to be some. How can you get it? 
No. 1, allow the parents to keep more of their money and make choices about how to spend their money in helping their children. This is not an attack on public schools. 
I am a product of public schools. My wife is a product of public schools. Both of my children went to public schools from the first grade through college. Now, a lot of people who are pontificating as great defenders of public education went to private schools and send their children to private schools. It makes it difficult to believe that you are as sincere as I am. I want to help public education, but I want to give parents a choice. 
When I give this sort of speech to some of the traditional education groups, they say, `But the bad schools, the bad public schools may not make it.' Right. That is the idea. It is called competition. It is called quality. Get right, improve the quality of your teachers, improve the quality of the administration, or go out of business; let somebody else do it that can do a better job. 
This bill also included merit pay for teachers, teacher testing. I still don't understand why it is OK to test and test and test the students but, oh, you can't test the teachers. That is one of the problems we have all over this country. We don't always have good-quality teachers. Should we encourage it? Should we pay them better? Yes. Should they be paid by the Federal Government? No. That is a local decision, State decision. 
Senator Gorton came up with a block grant approach, but it was an interesting approach. Again, it is a choice. He took programs, consolidated them into something over $10 billion, and he said, Well, now, States, if you want to continue with the traditional strings-attached, Washington-knows-best controls from the bureaucracy, you can do that. If Massachusetts wants its money to come through the Federal multiplicity of programs with directions of how it must be spent, Massachusetts can choose that. But if Texas wants to bring it through their State government and then to the local schools, they can choose that. 
Or in my State of Mississippi, I hope we would choose to let it go direct to the schools. Why does it have to stop in Atlanta or Jackson and trickle down and trickle down and trickle down, with everybody taking a bite for administrative costs--5 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent? Why not let it go from Washington directly to the schools and let the administrators, the parents, the teachers, and the children decide where that $10 billion portion that they get would be spent? Hopefully, they would spend it for STAR teachers, merit pay for better teachers, teachers who work hard, do the extra thing. Maybe they would decide to spend it on construction. That is OK if they make the decision at the local level. That is their choice. 
I think they are crying wolf. Those who want the status quo, those who want Washington to make the decisions, those who want controls and directions of how the money is going to be spent from Washington, they didn't like what we did this week and what we voted on last night. Those who say the status quo is not good enough when it comes to education should feel good about our effort last night. Now, they say, Well, the President is going to veto it. I don't know that he will. It is like laws; they are not unconstitutional until some court or the Supreme Court says they are unconstitutional. A bill is not vetoed until a President vetoes it. It will have to go through conference. Perhaps changes will be made. Perhaps the President will have a conversion and decide this is good legislation. But if he does veto it, the parents will know who 
has faith in them and the local education apparatus and those who believe Washington is the only place that can decide what is best for education in America. 
So I slept better last night knowing that at least we were trying to make sure that my prospective grandson will have more opportunity and greater choices in education.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on the legislation we are fixing to take up, the State Department reorganization bill, this is the result of literally years of work, give and take, by Senator Helms, the chairman of the committee, and by the administration. I think credit has to go to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She worked with Senator Helms on this State Department reorganization, which is so long overdue, which would allow us to do a better job in our foreign policy apparatus. Senator Biden has been a good partner, I believe, with Senator Helms, as the ranking member on that committee that reported this legislation, in developing this State Department reorganization. 
So this is very important legislation which has been a long time coming. 
The second part of that bill does provide for the U.N. arrearages, something over $900 million, I believe. You can still argue about how much really the United States owes to the United Nations. You can still argue that the United Nations doesn't always make the right decision. You can argue back and forth. But it is an agreed-to compromise which will allow the United States to fulfill its commitment in a way that a majority of those directly involved, Republican and Democrat, conservative, moderate, and liberal, feel is a fair way to get this job done. 
So that is an important part of this package, not only the reorganization of the State Department, which will be of tremendous benefit, I believe, in the next few months and years of this administration and of future administrations, but then you add to that that we are finally addressing this question of U.N. arrearage. That is very important. 
There is also included in this bill language that maybe nobody is totally happy with but language dealing with the so-called Mexico City issue, which is language that would have some restraints on lobbying other governments and organizations with taxpayers' dollars to promote the changing of laws to provide for abortions or to deal with the abortion issue. It is an issue that we have been tangled with for years. I am not diminishing it by putting it that way, but it is just something that we have been trying to find a fix to. There is no easy answer. You have passionate people on both sides of the issue. And I have clearly been on one side of the issue forever. I don't think that taxpayers' dollars should be used to promote abortion. Does anybody want to question Jesse Helms on this issue? Anybody? No. 
Now, the others who are on the other side of the issue, such as Senator Biden, they argue very strongly. They have been consistent on the other side. This is a compromise. This is a part of the package. This is a way to deal with three very important issues in this package. It has been agreed to reluctantly, but now I think with understanding and vigor, by the Senators who are involved directly with this legislation. 
So I urge my colleagues to think about it, recognize that you may not like one piece of the three or maybe two of the three, but what is the alternative? Are we never going to reorganize the State Department? Are we never going to deal with the U.N. arrearage issue? Is the abortion issue going to be involved with U.N. arrearage, State Department reorganization, IMF, appropriations bills? How long will this go on this year? This is the solution. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
I caution the administration and urge them to stop lobbying against this legislation, their bill. I have expressed this to the Secretary of State, in which I said, `Madam Secretary, this is the last train out of Dodge on the U.N. arrearage.' Now, I don't believe it will happen--if this bill doesn't pass the Senate and if this bill is not signed by the President, then the U.N. issue is probably dead for the year. 
Am I advocating that? Am I defending it? No. I am just stating a fact. I don't see how you do it. Senator Helms and Senator Biden have reluctantly agreed to this process, but it is the only process, I believe, that will allow us to deal with these three difficult, complicated, but important issues. 
So I hope the Senate will have a good debate today and will think about it. I don't think anybody is going to be surprised by what is in here. We do not need a lot of pontificating on either side of the aisle. You are for or against State Department reauthorization. You are for or against the U.N. arrearage issue. And you may be for or against the abortion issue. But this is a reasonable solution, and I hope it will pass when we vote on it Tuesday at 2:25. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1757, the State Department reorganization bill, under a 6-hour time agreement. Under the previous order, the vote on the conference report will occur on Tuesday, April 28 at 2:25 p.m. 
On Monday, following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the NATO expansion treaty. It is hoped that Members who wish to offer amendments to the treaty will come to the floor on Monday to offer and debate those amendments. 
We have had some discussion already on this NATO enlargement. I remember very well an outstanding speech given on the floor by the distinguished Senator from Oregon a month or so ago, a beautiful speech laced with history. It made an indelible impression upon my mind. 
Senators have claimed that we have not enough time on NATO enlargement, or that the issue has been unfocused. But one of the problems has been that Senators have not been willing to come to the floor and offer their amendments. 
Beginning Monday, the debate will be focused and uninterrupted on this very important issue of the NATO treaty alliance. We will spend all day on Monday and all day on Tuesday with the only interruption being the vote at 2:25 when we come back in from our policy luncheons. We will spend whatever time is necessary on Tuesday and Wednesday. I hope that we can complete it Wednesday after a thoughtful debate. Every Senator will have an opportunity to make a statement, if he or she wishes, or to offer amendments. But we must begin the process, and it includes having amendments in fact offered so we can bring it to a conclusion. 
I remind our colleagues that we still have a lot of very important issues that we need to take up. Unfortunately, earlier in the year several committees had not acted. But committees are acting profusely, and good bills are beginning to line up now. I would like to begin to move bills. In fact, we probably are going to have a high-tech period where we take up as many as 10 bills from a variety of committees that are important to the high-tech area, all the way from antislamming in the telephone area to gambling on the Internet, and a lot of things in between and beyond those. We have other good bills that we want to try to consider. 
In order to be able to do that and get to the IRS reform package the week after next, we are just going to have to have more cooperation. If Members continue to delay, then there will be more nights like last night where we were here at 8 or 8:30 or 9. I don't think our work is as good when we are working late into the night. 
As a reminder to all Members, there will be a rollcall vote on Monday at 6 p.m. on an Executive Calendar matter to be determined today by the majority leader after consultation and with information, of course, being provided to the minority. 
As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session since we have 6 hours reserved for debate on the State Department reorganization. 
The next vote will then occur at 6 p.m. on Monday.

So it would be stacked, those two--first the education vote and then the vote on the Ireland resolution.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kennedy and Dodd for their comments. I thought it appropriate today, without another day going by, that the U.S. Senate express itself on this very important issue on behalf of the American people. That is why we made sure that we brought it up and had these few minutes to discuss this resolution, and that we put on the Record our salutations to those who have been involved in these negotiations. We offer our congratulations to all the participants in the negotiations. I think they deserve recognition for their willingness to make honorable compromises in order to reach this agreement. 
I think particular credit goes to our former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, for his persistence and his doggedness. Frankly, I wasn't sure that it could be pulled off, but he stayed with it. I think we owe him a debt of gratitude for his work. 
Also, of course, I commend Prime Minister Tony Blair and Taoiseach Bertie Ahearn for their involvement and leadership. I believe the American people are proud of the contributions the United States and our President have made to this effort. We hope it will lead to approval in the May 22 referendums. Most of all, we hope it will lead to a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. That is the desire and that is the prayer of the people in Northern Ireland, in America and, hopefully, throughout the world. I endorse this resolution. 
I have no further request for time. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of our time.

I am hoping that Senators have had an opportunity to say what they need to say on this. Those who want to make closing remarks will be free to do so under this agreement, but it would be all right with the majority leader and the Senate if we did not have to use the full 3 hours 40 minutes. At that time, we will have a recorded vote, if this agreement is entered into, on the education bill, followed by a vote on the Irish resolution. 
I further ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Friday, the Senate begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the State Department reorganization bill under the consent agreement of March 31, and that the vote occur on adoption of the conference report at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 27, with 10 minutes of debate remaining for closing remarks to be equally divided just prior to the vote. 
I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate reconvenes on Monday, April 27, following morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the NATO enlargement treaty.

Then we will have the State Department reorganization debate on Friday, with no recorded votes. The next recorded vote after tonight will be at 5:30 p.m. on Monday. We will have no other subject debated on Monday other than NATO enlargement. We will stay on NATO enlargement until Senators feel they are prepared to vote. Hopefully, by having that debate Monday and votes on amendments perhaps on Tuesday and Wednesday, we can come to a conclusion on Wednesday, but we will not hurry this most important issue and deliberation of the Senate with regard to the NATO enlargement treaty. 
Therefore, that will be the schedule for the remainder of this week and through some part of Wednesday of next week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so all Members will be aware of what we are talking about at this point--and I do not have a unanimous consent request ready at this moment, but I will have one momentarily for Senator Daschle to review--we will be having additional votes tonight. We try to accommodate Senators' schedules, but we believe we can get an agreement for final debate on the education bill and then have a recorded vote. That I presume would occur sometime around 7 o'clock, or earlier if some time is yielded back. That will be followed, if we can enter the agreement, by a debate of approximately 30 minutes on the resolution dealing with Northern Ireland and a vote after that. 
I assume we will have then two additional votes tonight, and then we will have a further announcement about the schedule on Friday, but with no recorded votes on Friday, and Monday with likely recorded votes, at least a vote at 5:30 on Monday. But we will have that for each leader to review momentarily, and we will be asking for consent to that effect.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today is a great day for America's maritime community; for those who sailed the high seas during the final days of World War II; for those who sail the seas today in the international container industry; and for those who will go to sea in the future. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will permit me to take a long view of the maritime issues being addressed by the Senate during the 105th Congress. 
I am a product of the maritime industry. I grew up in a maritime community where my father built ships. The maritime world was the source of my first job as a lawyer. I still live in Pascagoula, Mississippi where the proud maritime tradition continues with Navy contracts to build DDG-51 Destroyers. 
As I grew up on Mississippi's coast, an important lesson was learned. Our nation was founded as a maritime nation and remains one today. We are a nation that must continue to invest in this vital industry. 
As you know, this is the International Year of the Ocean and tomorrow is Earth Day. As we celebrate the 28th Earth Day, we recognize the importance of the world's 4 oceans and 54 seas. Oceans cover more than 75% of our globe. Oceans provide us all with vast sources of food, medicine, and minerals. They provide a means for recreation, transportation, and commerce. Teaming with life and resources, oceans are where America's merchant maritime industry must be present. Oceans are where our government must make a conscious decision to maintain America's presence. 
Many of our colleagues understand the importance of a strong, healthy maritime industry. This including ports, vessel owners, vessel operators, shipbuilders and the workers to run the ports, sail the high seas or build the latest ship. In a world of increasing international trade by sea, a strong maritime industry is essential to our national security and our economic strength. This is a simple but true equation. 
To provide a context for today's action, I want to reflect on our work in the 104th Congress changed our maritime public policy. In the last Congress, the Maritime Security Act of 1996 was enacted into public law. It received overwhelming and bipartisan support. It was the first maritime policy change in over a decade. It was a profound change and has successfully reformed how our maritime industry supports our nation's defense. 
This program now effectively ensures that efficient commercial ocean transportation services are available to the Department of Defense for national security purposes. The use of modern U.S.-flag commercial vessels saves DOD hundreds of millions of dollars that would otherwise be required to procure additional sealift capacity. As we enter the appropriation cycle, I hope my colleagues will support full funding of the Maritime Security Program. 
Today, the Senate completed action on S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. 
This bill will increase competition in the ocean liner shipping industry and help U.S. exporters compete in the world's market. S. 414 was a bipartisan compromise. It was supported by all segments of the industry. Even U.S. businesses that use ocean liner services supported this legislative approach. The bill is a true compromise where the many diverse and competing interests benefited equally. 
My good friend, Senator Slade Gorton, wanted to get a little bit more for one of these segments, but in so doing jeopardized the Senate's ability to pass this important legislation during this Congress by taking the delicate compromise out of balance. This is why the amendment was defeated. 
Just for the record, non-vessel-operating common carriers are not real common carriers. However, they can successfully compete with vessel operators. Also small shippers will continue to have equal access to the transportation systems. 
Mr. President, S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 is a major step forward in the 105th Congress' maritime reform agenda. 
This year's maritime bill focuses on one part of the commercial segment while last 
year's bill dealt with the defense segment. 
As with the maritime bill in the last Congress, competition is its hallmark. It will permit competition for the ocean liner shipping industry. This means that U.S. exporters will also enhance their competitiveness in the world's market. The majority of international trade is carried on ships and that is why S. 414 is so important. The United States will now have an ocean liner shipping system that enables America to compete with other countries on a level playing field.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can just say a few brief words about S. 1133, the Parent-Student Savings Account Plus Act, which is commonly referred to now as the A+ Act. Everywhere I went during the recess period in my State of Mississippi--and I did a number of events throughout the State in a variety of forums in towns and cities--education was at the top of every list. 
I spoke to the Mississippi Economic Council, which is an organization really affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but it represents a variety of businessmen and women, professionals, people who really want to make sure that we have what we need to create jobs and move forward economically and have opportunities for all our citizens. An important part of their plans for this year did include, of course, continued emphasis on education. 
So I am really excited that a good portion of this week will be spent on debate concerning the education savings account and the other portions that we have added to this education bill in the Finance Committee and other amendments that will be offered on the floor of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. 
Some people have said, `Well, it could be messy debating education with as many as a dozen or more amendments being in order and with second degrees being in order.' I think there are very few issues that we could be debating in the Senate this year in America more important than education. Of course, there are differences as to how to proceed on this education issue. 
I feel very strongly that we should encourage parents to save more for their children's education, not only for college but also for elementary and secondary education. We should make it possible for parents and grandparents and scholarship groups to set aside money in savings, in an education IRA, and that money then could be used for a variety of needs for children, whether it is tuition, books, supplies, computers, transportation, even uniforms. In my hometown, I was surprised to learn that the school board had voted that the students will begin wearing a certain form of uniform because they think it will help cut down on some of the violence associated with the clothes that are worn to school. 
I think there are a whole variety of options now that could be available. There are those who oppose the savings account for education for elementary and secondary students, but I ask why--we just last year, and the President signed into law, increased the opportunity for education savings accounts for higher education, and we raised the limit of those savings that could be set aside up to $2,000 a year--why 
shouldn't it be available for elementary and secondary education? 
There are some other components of this legislation that have the guarantee that it would be bipartisan. In addition to the bipartisan support for the education savings account, other components in the bill include the expansion of the exclusion of employer-provided educational benefits to graduate education, which is a policy strongly advocated by the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan. We should encourage employers to provide education benefits as a part of the package that they get in the agreement between employer and employee. This bill does that. 
While I was home, I spoke with the treasurer of our State of Mississippi. He made a particular point of coming over and asking me, did the bill still include the State prepaid tuition programs? I assured him that it did. We should encourage parents and students to save for their tuition. In this bill they will be able to exclude from income payments from State prepaid tuition programs. 
Also, this bill does provide for some opportunity for bonds for school construction. I personally do not think the Federal Government should begin paying for school construction at the local level. I think that is a decision that should be made by the States, by the local governments. 
Some people say, `Well, they can't afford it.' I represent the poorest State in the Nation--or what was the poorest State; thank goodness we are making progress now and getting off the bottom of many lists--but one of the ways we have done that is we have been putting more money into education, more money into building new high schools and new elementary schools. The education level in the State has generally been rising. The credit goes to the parents, the administrators, and the teachers at the local level. But to provide some process where there would be this bonding opportunity for school construction is one that I think we should consider. And it is in the legislation. 
There will be a number of other amendments that will be offered from both sides of the aisle. I will agree with some of them, and I will disagree violently with some of the others. But I think this is a debate worth having. I commend Senator Coverdell for his dogged work in support of education in this bill and the cooperation he has had from and with the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli. 
So this will be a great opportunity this week to do some things that will help education. One of the amendments that will be offered could be to consolidate some of the many, many Federal education programs into block grants and then allow that money to go back through the States with the direction that 95 percent of the money go to the school districts. Only 5 percent of it can be eaten up by administrative costs; 95 percent of it will go to the school districts without strings attached. Let the schools decide. Let the local school officials decide if that money will be used for STAR teachers or for construction, if you will. It would be their choice. That is the fundamental difference between what some others will be trying to do, which would mean more decisions, more money, more direction and more strings from Washington. That is not the answer. I think in many cases that is the problem. 
So, it will be an interesting debate. I commend the Senators for working with me to try to get an agreement as to how this process will go forward. We will spend today and all 
of tomorrow and possibly or probably even part of Wednesday completing this legislation, but it is time well spent. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, recently, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) held a public meeting in Washington, D.C. to discuss the findings of a comprehensive study it conducted to assess the safety initiatives undertaken by industry and government and private organizations to prevent excavation damage to underground pipelines. As a result of the study, the NTSB adopted twenty-seven safety recommendations to reduce the risks posed by excavation damage. I want to take this opportunity to commend the NTSB for its proactive stance on this important safety issue. 
Excavation damage poses serious safety risks to our Nation's critical infrastructure. This infrastructure, among other things, transports natural gas, petroleum, and other chemical products through pipelines and enables telephone and Internet access through a vast network of fiber optic cables and communication lines. Damage to this infrastructure not only exposes people and the environment to safety risks, but impedes economic development. 
The NTSB agrees. In a press release issued on the study, the NTSB states `a single pipeline accident has the potential to cause a catastrophic disaster that can injure hundreds of persons, affect thousands more, and cost millions of dollars in terms of property damage, loss of work opportunity, community disruption, ecological damage, and insurance liability. Excavation and construction activities are the largest single cause of accidents to pipelines.' The Safety Board goes on to say that in `addition to being expensive and inconvenient, disruption of the telecommunications network can have significant safety implication, such as impact on traffic control systems, health services, and emergency response activities.' 
The NTSB further found that `damage from outside force is the leading cause of leaks and ruptures to pipeline systems, accounting for more than 40 percent of the reported failures.' Excavation damage, the NTSB determined, `is also the single largest cause of interruptions to fiber cable service.'

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I remember that disaster to which the Senator from New Jersey refers. That, along with other devastating excavation damage acts, such as those in Puerto Rico and Minnesota, led to the NTSB's decision to issue new strong safety recommendations to the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), states, and other industry groups including trade associations. 
But today, I want to focus on two recommendations in particular. As a result of the study I mentioned above, the Safety Board issued a recommendation strongly urging states to adopt comprehensive one-call statewide excavation programs. They believe that one-call programs are proven to prevent damage due to excavation, thereby reducing the likelihood of pipeline disasters.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. The Safety Board issued another recommendation. It also determined, as a result of the study, that our nation's railroads should involve themselves in statewide excavation damage prevention programs. The recommendations state that the associations should urge their members `to fully participate in statewide excavation damage prevention programs, including one-call notification centers.' The recommendations were issued to the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and the American Short Line Railroad Association. 
Why has the Safety Board taken such a position? Perhaps it is because some railroads apparently oppose participating in excavation damage prevention programs, including one-call notification centers. Some one-call notification center participants indicate that the railroads are often no-shows when it comes to underground damage prevention. 
Currently, railroads are required to participate in state one-call notification systems in ten states. I want to repeat that again, only ten states. Yet AAR opposed the Lott-Daschle one-call notification bill which passed by the Senate by unanimous consent last year because we would not include provisions preempting state laws and exempting railroads from participation in state one-call notification systems in the remaining forty states. 
I understand the railroad industry is taking the same position in the House. I am told AAR is vigorously opposing the Lott-Daschle one-call notification legislation unless the House mandates that railroads are exempt from state's one-call notification systems. So much for industry opposition to Federal mandates. 
Instead of advancing the cause of safety and underground damage prevention, AAR is 
trying to use my bill to reduce safety through a federal exemption in the states where one-call participation is required. This stance is exactly opposite from the position being urged by the Safety Board. 
Do the railroads pose a safety risk to underground facilities? Yes, they do. Ameritech recently released a survey of major telecommunication facility outages which found that 17 percent of the major outages in the United States were caused by railroads. This survey, as well as the NTSB study, demonstrates that there is a clear benefit to the public if railroads participate in one-call notification systems.

Mr. LOTT. The Safety Board has long been our Nation's premier safety agency and the Congress has turned to it on many occasions for its advice on ways to improve transportation safety. Moreover, Safety Board recommendations have served as the foundation for many transportation safety bills and laws. 
Rather than launch a campaign for exemptions, the railroad industry might better serve transportation safety if it works with Congress to implement the reasonable recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
Let me stress to my fellow Senators that I remain a big supporter of the nation's railroads. Railroads are, as they like to say, `the engine that drives America.' I agree railroads are a huge engine, an important engine in America's economy.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 1 p.m. in order for Senators to make statements and to introduce legislation. At 1 p.m. today, the Senate will begin consideration of the Coverdell education A+ bill under the provisions of the consent agreement of March 27, 1998. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today, but it is hoped that Members will be available to offer their amendments to H.R. 2646, the Coverdell bill. As a reminder, the next rollcall vote will occur tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. on or in relation to the Gorton amendment to S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. 
Just to remind Senators, we did have debate on the Ocean Shipping Act on Friday when we went out for the Easter recess period, and we completed all the work except for the vote on the amendment and then, of course, final passage after that, if that is necessary, and I presume it may not be. 
Senators should expect further votes throughout Tuesday's session on or in relation to pending amendments to the Coverdell education bill. 
In addition, it is hoped that during this week the Senate will be able to consider the NATO expansion treaty and the State Department reorganization conference report under the consent agreement of 6 hours. 
I want to say again that there will be no rush to judgment on NATO enlargement. I want to make sure that Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue will have a chance to make their statements and point out their concerns or their reasons for support. So, if it is necessary to take that over into next week before we get to the conclusion of the NATO enlargement, we will certainly do that. 
During the next 5 weeks, the Senate can be expected to consider the following items, and therefore Members can expect busy days with votes most every day that we are in session, including Mondays or Fridays, except for those where we have already indicated we will not have votes, and we will reconfirm those during the next 2 days so Senators will know for sure the Mondays or Fridays where there will not be recorded votes. 
In addition to the items I mentioned, this week we also will take up, hopefully, with cooperation from both sides of the aisle, the IRS reform legislation; Department of Defense authorization; the budget conference report; supplemental appropriations conference report--perhaps even reports, depending on whether there are one or two there--the nuclear waste bill; a series of high-tech bills. There could be as many as three or four of those coming out of the Commerce Committee. I will have to consult with the chairman as to exactly how many there will be. I believe they have already reported a couple, and there may be two more. 
The Iran sanctions legislation is pending. We have tried 
to be cooperative with the administration on this issue, but we did get an agreement right at the end of the session before we went home for Easter as to when action could occur on the Iran sanctions. I believe that is before May 20, but we will reconfirm that later. And, of course, the tobacco legislation issue is pending before the Senate, having been reported by the Commerce Committee. 
This is not an exclusive list, of course, and additional legislation or Executive Calendar items may be cleared for action. I look forward to a productive legislative period.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will have a period of morning business today until 12 noon. It is planned today to consider S. 414, the international shipping bill. In addition, the Senate, of course, will take up any executive or legislative business cleared for Senate action. I thank all the Senators who have been working on the international shipping bill, including the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Hutchison; the chairman of the full Committee on Commerce, Senator McCain; Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who has been working to address some concerns he still has, and he believes he may have an amendment on this later on today; and Senator Harkin and others who worked with us on getting this language agreed to so that we can take up this important legislation. 
I do confirm that there are some further nominations that we hope to move today. Several of them were considered and approved last night, but we will be going over the list in the next couple hours to see if there are others that can be approved. There will be no rollcall votes today. The next rollcall vote will occur on or in regard to the Coverdell A+ education savings account bill on Tuesday, April 21, at a time to be announced--probably in the morning, hopefully the early morning of Tuesday.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is considering the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. This legislation provides a major step forward in reforming America's public policy on maritime issues. 
When the Senate adopts this legislation, it will make America's maritime container shipping industry more competitive in the global marketplace. 
The bill is a fair and responsible balance for all the parties affected by this policy change. 
This bill will increase competition in the ocean liner shipping industry and it will help American exporters, from every state in the nation. Every American exporter and the American maritime industry will have a better chance to compete in the world market. 
Just last night I was working with Senator Harkin to address his concern with the bill--Iowa farmers who export produce wanted to make sure we got the bill right. This is just another illustration that all states have a stake in making sure this maritime reform is completed. 
Maritime policy affects all Americans. If an American company exports, it is likely that its goods are sent overseas by container ships. That is why it is especially important that the United States have a shipping system that allows American carriers to compete on a level playing field.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since there is no other Senator seeking recognition at this time, I wish to further comment on the action of the Senate over the past few days, particularly with regard to the budget resolution that passed last night. Because of the lateness of the hour and the fact that we had had 24 votes during the day on Thursday, we did not really have an opportunity to give proper accolades when we completed that work. 
I say again how much I appreciate the leadership of Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee. As always, he exhibited real leadership. He knows more about budget substance, about the numbers, and about the points of order than all the rest of us combined probably. He did a great job of getting the bill through in, I believe, record time at least in recent history, certainly since I have been in the Senate since 1988. So I thought that was a tremendous 
accomplishment. He did get good cooperation from Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and he worked on both sides of the aisle to hold down some of the amendments that really did not need to be offered, either sense of the Senate or could be offered at another time. 
It was really a tremendous accomplishment to get it completed from a process standpoint, but also the substance deserves more attention than we were able to give it late last night. It is a historic budget because it does for the first time since, I believe, 1969 get us to an actual balanced budget and to a surplus, hopefully, in this year and over the next few years, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars of surplus, which is something we have not experienced in a long, long time. So it is balanced. It will lead to surpluses. It provides tax cuts, and we hope to have even more tax cuts agreed to in the conference report beyond what was actually included in this budget resolution. 
It does take steps to further protect and preserve and allows us to look at reforming Social Security so it will be there not only for our parents but for ourselves and our children well into the next century by setting aside a surplus for Social Security. 
I think that is a very positive step. I think we need to think very carefully about how we go beyond not just setting aside some money but how we really deal with the future needs of Social Security. It also, after repeated attacks, continues to say that any tobacco settlement that we may reach will go into Medicare, where it is needed, because over the next 8 to 10 years that program will again begin to have problems. 
So the combination was a really good budget resolution. It goes to conference now, as I noted. We will have a good conference. I hope, as we discussed yesterday, that we can actually come up with more tax cuts than we have earmarked in this budget resolution. But I remind my colleagues we can always come up with more than what is provided in the budget if we can find offsets, and we should look for them. We should look for places where there is spending not necessary or that is duplicative or can be better used by allowing people to keep their own money. 
I do think we should make a special effort this year to begin the process of eliminating the marriage penalty tax. How in the world in America can we defend the fact that young couples, when they get married, pay more taxes even though they make no more income. The average tax increase for a married couple over what they pay before they are married is $1,400. You talk about fairness in the Tax Code. That is one provision that must be changed, and we will work together in a bipartisan way to see if we can eliminate the marriage penalty tax this year. 
I also thank the Senate for a lot of good work in other areas over the past couple weeks. We did reach agreement on how to consider the Coverdell A+ education bill. It will be a very fair process. We will have 15 or so amendments that will be offered dealing with education only, not extraneous matters that we argued about for over 2 weeks. It will deal with education from both sides of the aisle. Some of them may be accepted, some of them may be second degreed, but I think we will have a great education discussion when we return on April 20, and hopefully we can complete that bill by April 22. 
We do hope to take up the NATO enlargement bill later on that week, but I want to make sure that every Senator is comfortable with how that is done, make sure that we have enough time to debate that very important matter fully, but reach a conclusion within, hopefully, 3 days or so--probably by the 26th or 27th of April. 
The Finance Committee took a very positive step forward earlier this week with regard to IRS reform. The House did a good job last year getting it started, but we found where there are other real abuses by IRS. We had a unanimous bipartisan vote to report the IRS reform bill out of the Finance Committee, so that bill will be coming to the floor, probably around the first week in May--May 4, something of that nature. It does deal with abuses of such things like the innocent spouse, where an innocent spouse, even though he or she may be divorced, is now being held responsible for half or all of the debts of their spouse or former spouse in a very unfair way. It does provide for some restrictions on the excesses of penalties and interest. Many of us know instances, now, where people have found that they owe more in penalties and interest on taxes than they originally owed. So this bill will begin to cut that back and get it under control. I think the taxpayers will be very proud of that. 
Finally, I think we should take note of the vote that occurred in the Senate Commerce Committee on a tobacco settlement package. It still has a long way to go, but that vote was 19 to 1, and was reported out. Most people thought it would never get beyond the committee, that it probably would never even be considered. But it was considered, and I think that was a move that will lead us to an opportunity in late May to take up that very important legislation to deal with teenage smoking, to try to deal with the Medicare problems that are caused by the health effects of smoking. 
I commend Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, all those on both sides of the Commerce Committee for their leadership there. 
So, as is typical of the Senate, after a lot of work behind the scenes, there was a burst of activity this week, and I think it has put us in a position to complete a lot of good bills when we return the latter part of April. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. When the Senate reconvenes from the Easter holidays, we then will resume consideration of the Coverdell education A+ bill. In addition, it is hoped the Senate will be able to consider the NATO enlargement treaty the first week after the Senate reconvenes. I want to emphasize again that that will be done only after careful consideration of the arguments of those who are for the treaty enlargement and also the arguments of those who are opposed. We want to make sure we have ample time for all the arguments to be heard on both sides. So we will work early in the week to make sure we get a time agreement that is satisfactory. 
We also hope to take up the State Department Reauthorization Conference Report under a time agreement. 
As earlier announced, there will be no rollcall votes on the Monday that we return, so the next votes then will occur on Tuesday, April 21, at 10 a.m. The Senate could consider further votes on Tuesday morning as a result of debate on the Coverdell education bill, because we do have 15 amendments that could be offered as well as second-degree amendments to those. Senators should expect votes throughout the day of Tuesday, April 21, and we will begin early in the morning and we will go potentially late into the night that day.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Nickles for the magnanimous gesture he just made. However, I want to emphasize we are trying to move these votes, and the Chair was absolutely right, because it is up to the discretion of the Chair to respond when Members ask how they are recorded, but also when regular order is called for, especially when we are trying to move through all these votes, the Chair is under an obligation to bring this to a conclusion. 
I think we had the right resolution here, but I want to make sure everybody understands, we are trying to move these votes through. We are trying to get to a conclusion, and that brings me to my next point. 
It is 5 after 9. We still have, it looks like, as many as five amendments that we may have to vote on. I urge Senators, if they are planning on calling up those amendments, to see if we can't work out something where maybe some of them can be accepted or not offered and that we not go through the process of having second-degree amendments offered at this point. 
If we can do that, we can finish this within this hour, by 10 o'clock. I thank Senator Reid and others for the work they have been doing in trying to help pare down the list. We are very close now, and I think it important we not lose the decorum we have exercised through a long day. I thank my colleagues for that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is quarter to 6. We are still working to try to get the list agreed on of what we are actually going to need to vote on. We still have probably 24 or 25 amendments that we still have to vote on--maybe more. But we are working to get that down. In order to get this completed, we need to really start to get rolling on these votes. We have been having them every 10 minutes. The Senator from Alaska is in the Chair. He knows how to do it. I urge Members to stay in the Chamber. We can move these along a lot faster. From here on they will be gaveled to a close after 10 minutes.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to update my Senate colleagues on an important piece of legislation enacted in the last Congress. The bill, now a law, was about regulatory reform of a segment of the energy community, namely natural gas pipelines. As DOT begins the rulemaking process required by law, they do so with improved regulatory reform guidelines. 
Although this law only affects one statute and one agency it is real regulatory reform. It is the government and industry working together to make each more efficient and effective. It is government being held accountable for its rulemaking and regulatory decisions. 
This law, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, passed the 104th Congress, bringing with it provisions that strengthen risk assessment, cost/benefit analysis and peer review. Last week the Department of Transportation announced its first participant in a demonstration program where the rules will be flexibly applied and pipeline safety will be improved. 
The Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act has two important elements which make it unique. First, all new pipeline safety regulations must undergo a risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis. This is crucial, because it ensures that new regulations and limited public resources are focused to maximize public benefit. This is real regulatory reform. 
The second notable element of the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act is the risk management demonstration project. Intended to move the agency beyond the old `command-and-control' style of regulating, this project allows individual pipelines to propose their own safety procedures to DOT for review and approval. This type of risk management takes us to a higher and more sophisticated level of safety regulation. Once again, the agency is encouraged to direct limited resources towards activities that provide maximum safety to the public. This, too, is real regulatory reform. 
The Office of Pipeline Safety, has received a number of applications from pipeline companies that want to participate in the risk management demonstration project. One company has been approved and five other applicants are close to approval. These proposals have bolstered innovation in safety policy, and have encouraged pipeline companies to think beyond simple compliance with existing standards. The government is learning to think `outside of the box' and to consider creative industry solutions. This genuine reengineering partnership illustrates the fruits of real regulatory reform. 
The demonstration project illustrates a commitment by a number of DOT civil servants to the principles of this law. Three key staff deserve recognition for rapidly implementing the law: Kelley Coyner, Rich Felder, and Stacey Gerad. These civil servants ensured that the American public gets greater safety and environmental protection when industry is given flexibility. This law is a bargain for America. 
The Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act has restored trust between regulators and the regulated community. This new found trust will permit the sharing of research information that can be translated into improved pipeline safety technology. This trust has maximized both government and private dollars. 
Enacting this legislation is a formal recognition that there is a valid role for risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis in federal rulemaking. These steps must be taken when regulating, not simply as a check off or to satisfy requirements of transparency, but to genuinely incorporate the results into how the rules are made. Cost is an essential factor and cannot be dismissed by rulemakers. 
This regulatory reform is the law of the land for a small sector of our federal system. 
This incremental effort changed a public policy by establishing a new level of confidence among stakeholders. It did not create a cloud of legislative doubt and confusion. To the contrary, it received overwhelming support from both chambers of Congress. This initiative is indeed a genuine bipartisan regulatory reform approach. 
Regulatory reform should be incremental and fully bipartisan. If this Congress considers just one element of the regulatory process this year I believe it should be risk. There is a clear consensus among our colleagues that changes must be made to the rulemaking process. Risk is the basis for every rule, and should be the center of our next legislative correction. 
I frequently draw a comparison between risk and a dog's ear. As you wash a dog, it has a tendency to want to shake the water and shampoo off. Because a dog starts shaking at the head and will not stop until the final flick of the tail, holding the ear will stop the shaking. Just as the dog's ear is the starting point of a shake, risk is the starting point of the rulemaking process. Without a risk, there can be no rule. Without a free ear, a dog cannot spray water everywhere. The water and shampoo will be effectively applied to the desired subject, and not wasted by going everywhere. Get risk right and the regulated industry will have respect for the rulemaking process. Ignoring risk and working on anything else is like holding the dog's tail --you will get soaked as the dog shakes from the head down to its tail. Unnecessary rules and regulations will abound. 
I want to thank my colleagues for their attention. Regulatory reform is a passion in which I have invested six years. It is an area I will remain engaged in because more legislative changes are needed. It may take years of incremental efforts, but only this step-by-step approach will generate the confidence and comfort necessary to reform the rulemaking process. Current regulations were enacted during the years when the philosophical approach was one-size-fits-all. This is no longer operative. These rules and procedures should be updated in a deliberate but incremental manner to reflect today's modern approach--an approach that permits innovative technology and offers flexibility. 
Mr. President, the approval of this demonstration program is a validation of today's modern approach. Safety will not be jeopardized and environmental protection will not be compromised. It is a recognition that regulatory reform, when done incrementally and with the goal of producing effective regulations, can have a real impact on government's rulemaking.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to announce that students from the great state of Mississippi, and from a number of other states, are participating in the Leadership Training Institute for Youth. This year the program will be held in Missouri. 
This invaluable program reaches out to our nation's most important resource, our children. As you know, ensuring safety and effectiveness in schools is an important priority for this Congress. This privately funded initiative helps Congress fulfill its fundamental goal of providing our nation's students with the best education in the world. 
The Institute, headquartered in Arkansas, brings together students from communities throughout the nation and from families in all walks of life. It is important to recognize that the young people selected for the program might not have this kind of leadership opportunity available to them in their local communities or even in their home states. 
The Leadership Training Institute instills in our youth a sense of purpose, belonging, spirituality, patriotism, and strong moral and ethical character. The Institute's teaching philosophy centers on biblical principles and the tenets espoused by America's founding fathers. Students learn that real leaders are people of faith, integrity, conviction, and moral fiber. 
These high school and college age students are given hands-on experience in dealing with compelling political, social, and ethical issues. These students work with experts from a wide range of disciplines to examine leadership competencies, civic responsibility, community and family values, as well as a number of other topics important to America's youth. 
During the program, these future leaders will explore such issues as how to: achieve a smaller, more effective government; reduce the burden of taxes on America's working families; reform the IRS; improve education and expand learning opportunities; and, combat violence and drugs in schools. 
Mr. President, this sounds like our Senate's agenda. 
These students will also meet with local, state, and national leaders to reflect on issues that truly matter--such as family, faith and freedom. As you know, family, faith and freedom must be the cornerstone of our public policy. 
Mr. President, I think this is an outstanding initiative and commend the efforts of the Leadership Training Institute for offering this model program to Mississippi's youth. 
These young achievers are our nation's future business executives and public officials. It gives me great hope for America's future to know that these young minds are being exposed to the challenging programs being offered by the Leadership Training Institute. I firmly believe that each student who graduates from the Institute will posses the strong, solid moral and value driven foundation needed to guide our nation into the next century. 
Again, I want to express my deep appreciation to the Leadership Training Institute for Youth for conducting this exemplary program.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is not aimed at any Senator or group of Senators, but it is so that we will all be on notice. In order to be able to complete this budget resolution, we are going to have to stick to the 15 minute-votes. I realize that there are markups going on and Senators have a lot of commitments, but for the remainder of today--Senator Daschle and I have talked about this--we think it is important we begin to stick to 15-minute votes or 10-minute votes if we have in a group stacked votes, so we will start sticking pretty close to the time that is allocated.

Mr. LOTT. Would the Democratic leader like to make a comment before I make the UC? 
In order to ascertain the remaining workload then ahead of us to bring the budget resolution to conclusion, I now ask unanimous consent that all first-degree amendments must be offered by 6 p.m. this evening. I further ask that at 5:40 p.m. this evening the minority manager be recognized to offer any amendments necessary for the minority side of the aisle, and at 5:50 p.m. Senator Domenici be recognized for up to 10 minutes to offer amendments necessary at that point for the majority side. 
I further ask that following the scheduled 2 p.m. vote today, all first-degree amendments be limited to 30 minutes, all second-degree amendments be limited to 20 minutes, with any votes ordered on any remaining amendments to be stacked in a sequence to be decided by the two managers. I further ask that the first vote in the stacked voting sequence be limited to 15 minutes and all remaining votes in the sequence be reduced to 10 minutes in length. 
We hope they will stack as many as three and four in those groupings. But it will be up to them, after, of course, consulting with the leaders, to make sure we are taking into consideration other things that may be going on. 
I finally ask that all time consumed during rollcall votes be counted against the overall statutory time limit and the new time restraints on first- and second-degree amendments expire 
at the conclusion or yielding back of the overall time limit.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to rise and take this opportunity to say farewell to an outstanding Non-Commissioned Officer of the Mississippi Army National Guard, First Sergeant Charles W. Parker, upon his retirement. Throughout his military career, First Sergeant Parker served the people of Mississippi with valor and distinction. It is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the Mississippi Army National Guard and the Nation for the past 32 years. 
First Sergeant Parker enlisted in the Mississippi Army National Guard in August 1965, and served as a federal technician from October 1971, until February 1981. He then began an active duty career in the Guard as a Training Non-Commissioned Officer from February 1981, until his retirement in April 1998. He served the majority of his military career with Company B, 223rd Engineer Combat Battalion, in Calhoun City, Mississippi. During his 32 years of service, First Sergeant Parker was activated three times to provide relief due to flooding, ice storms and tornadoes. 
First Sergeant Parker served the Great State of Mississippi with honor. He received the Army Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal (4), Reserve Components Achievement Medal (5), Armed Forces Reserve Medal (3), National Defense Medal (2), Army Physical Fitness Award (14) and achieved the highest score in his company, battalion, group and brigade on more than one occasion. 
During his 32 years of military service, First Sergeant Parker led his men selflessly by continuously putting his subordinate soldiers before himself. He is known by all throughout the State of Mississippi in National Guard circles for helping young people get into the Guard and continue their education. 
Most importantly, First Sergeant Parker is also a loving husband and father to his wife Sandra, sons Brent and Kent, daughter Vanessa. While he missed valuable time away from his family during his military career, he must look forward to spending many wonderful years with them in retirement. 
I know his family and the Mississippi Army National Guard are proud of his many accomplishments. My colleagues in the Senate join me in wishing First Sergeant Parker well upon his retirement. The Great State of Mississippi and the Nation are indebted to him for his many years of distinguished service.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 created procedures for judicial review of employment discrimination claims throughout the Congress to govern cases arising after the requirements of the law took effect on January 23, 1996. The Senate's antecedent process for review of discrimination claims in Senate employment, which was created by the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, continues to govern older cases. The cases of William L. Singer versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices and Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, now pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arise under the 1991 Act. 
These consolidated cases present the Federal Circuit with two petitions for review of the same underlying order. The first petition was filed by William Singer, a former member of the Capitol Police. After Officer Singer filed his petition for review, the Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Officer Singer's `employing office' under the statute, filed its own petition for review. Both petitions seek review of a ruling of the Select Committee on Ethics concerning Officer Singer's request for reimbursement of attorneys' fees incurred in an underlying employment discrimination action. 
Under the Government Employee Rights Act, a final decision of the Ethics Committee is entered in the records of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, which is then named as the respondent if the decision is challenged in the Federal Circuit. As petitions for review in the Federal Circuit challenge final decisions of a Senate adjudicatory process, under the Government Employee Rights Act the Senate Legal Counsel may be directed to defend those decisions through representation of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in court. 
Accordingly, this resolution directs the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in the cases of Singer versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices and Office of the Senate Sergeant at Arms versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in defense of the Ethics Committee's final decision.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, momentarily I believe that the minority leader will be in the Chamber. We have a unanimous consent agreement that we want to enter into with regard to the Coverdell education savings account bill. I think everybody knows it has been one we have gone back and forth on for a week. I think what we have come up with is a fair process, if I can describe it while we wait on Senator Daschle. 
Basically, it would be in order, under the unanimous consent agreement, that we go to the Coverdell A+ bill as has been amended with the prepaid college tuition issue and the deduction for employer-provided education benefits, as well as the school construction bond issue. 
It would make in order, I believe it is 17 amendments, 12 that would be offered by identified Senators on the Democratic side, 5 on the Republican side, but all amendments are education related, all of them are subject to second degree and they would be debated 30 minutes each on the first- and the second-degree amendments. 
I think it is a fair agreement. If we were able to achieve cloture, which we might have been able to do on the next vote, we still would have had 30 hours that could have been spent on it. 
I think to have a good healthy debate on education is long overdue. Democrats have some ideas; Republicans have some ideas. But the important thing is, what can we do to help the quality of education in America, what can we do to deal with violence in schools? We saw just this past week what happened in Arkansas, and it has happened in my own State of Mississippi, and it has happened in Kentucky. There are growing incidents of children coming to school with guns or knives. It is good to have a healthy discussion on both sides of the aisle and consider each other's ideas. 
I have looked down at the list of these amendments, and I see amendments on both sides of the aisle that look attractive to me. I think it is not only good, I think it is long overdue. I know it has been a long process, difficult for the leaders on both sides, but I think it is a good agreement, and I would like to enter into it now. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote scheduled for later next week be vitiated, and on Monday, April 20, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ savings account bill; that it be considered under the following agreement, with each amendment to be offered in the first degree subject to education second degrees, except that no second-degree amendment relative to IDEA uniform standards be in order, and the time on the first degree be limited to 30 minutes, except for a time limit of 1 hour on the Moseley-Braun amendment, and second-degree amendments limited to 30 minutes to be equally divided in the usual form.

In view of the time that is necessary under the budget law for the budget resolution, I thought that it was more important next week that we stay focused on that. Also, because this does provide for second-degree amendments, I think Senators on both sides of the aisle would like to either adjust their first-degree amendments or prepare, thoughtfully, second-degree amendments. So I thought the best thing for us to do would be to move this and have it the pending business, and go right to it when we come back from the recess. I thought that the Senator----

Many of them were not education related on both sides of the aisle. There will be other opportunities to do that. I think this will be a fair way for us to have an equal debate on both sides. Some of these amendments, as I indicated, may actually wind up being accepted and we may not have to go through each one of them in a second degree. I think it is fair. 
Before the Chair rules, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement may be vitiated by the majority leader only at no later than 12:15 on Monday, March 30.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have just indicated the Senate will be in a period of morning business then for 1 hour when we come in on Monday, and then we will resume the budget resolution. 
For the information of all Members, per the agreement reached during today's session, of the 50 hours under the statutory limit for the budget resolution, as of Monday there will be 44 hours remaining, and as of the close of business on Monday there will be 34 hours remaining on the resolution. 
There will be no rollcall votes conducted during Monday's session. However, the managers do expect amendments to be offered during that day. And the next rollcall vote will occur then on Tuesday morning at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader. 
Therefore, Members can anticipate votes on amendments to the budget resolution on Tuesday. As always, Members will be notified as to the time of those votes. I should indicate that we will certainly find a way to have a vote at about 9:30 on Tuesday morning so we can get things moving right along. 
In addition, the Senate may consider Executive Calendar or legislative business cleared by the Senate. 
In regard to the balance of the week, we are expected to complete action on the budget resolution and the supplemental appropriations conference report, if available, prior to recessing for the Easter holidays. I do believe that we will be able to act on the supplemental appropriations to its final conclusion either late Tuesday night or Wednesday, giving the conferees, hopefully, time to act on the conference before we go home and to complete action on the budget resolution. We need, again, to make Members aware now that we must do those two items next week before we leave. 
As a reminder, the next rollcall votes then will occur on Tuesday. 
Does the Senator wish to speak further?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators--I think they already know this by now--this last vote was the final vote of the evening. A rollcall vote now will occur at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning on a judicial nomination. We are having it at that early hour so that we can accommodate some Senators who have commitments, and also so that we can turn relatively quickly tomorrow to the opening debate on the budget resolution. Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, the managers of the legislation, will be available, and they will begin the debate. And we hope to use at least 6 hours of that time tomorrow. 
Following that vote at 9 o'clock on Friday morning, the Senate will begin the budget resolution, which has 50 hours of time under the statute. We will return to further debate on it on Monday and have a considerable amount of time for debate then. 
I think by the close of business tomorrow we will have had a productive week. I thought we could finish things earlier. It took about 3 days longer than I thought on the supplemental, but we have gotten the supplemental down to final action by the Senate. And we could not pass it with the final vote anyway until the House acts. So sometime Tuesday then, assuming the House acts, we would expect to complete the final action on the supplemental appropriations bill. 
We have, I think, made progress on the Coverdell education savings account bill. And we will get that issue resolved as to how we take it up one way or the other by or before Tuesday morning. In addition to that, we will have taken up some nominations, and we will have had about 6 hours of time on the budget resolution, as well as the vote on Mexico decertification. 
Now, there still remains an awful lot to do to get through the budget resolution. It is quite an experience. We hope to have a more orderly process this time so that we can avoid the final night `vote-rama' where we have 10, 20, 30 votes or more in a row. But that will take a lot of cooperation from Senators. And certainly it will take direction from the managers of the bill. 
It appears at this time, because of the agreement that has been worked out on the budget resolution, that we will not have a recorded vote on Monday at 5:30 as had been earlier anticipated. I want to check further with both sides of the aisle to make sure that that is agreed to and is acceptable. I think it is important we tell Members as early as possible, but it will give us then more uninterrupted time to work on the budget resolution. 
Again, as a reminder to all Members, the next vote will occur tomorrow at 9 a.m.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just a little history. Before I do that, I know that I certainly have tried to work out something that Members on both sides could live with. I believe Senator Daschle has, too. But we have Senators on both sides who have very strong feelings about amendments that are suggested on both sides. There are amendments on the Democratic side that other Democrats have problems with, and it is the same thing over here. There are Republican amendments that other Republicans have problems with. So we have made a sincere effort. 
I remind you that we started this effort on the 13th. Maybe there is a significance to that. On Friday, March 13, we started working on this. The problem is, if you want a good, healthy debate on education, fine, let's have it. I will not play second fiddle to anybody when it comes to my concern about education. 
By the way, I am a product of public education; so is my wife and both of our children. But I am worried about the quality of education and the violence and drugs in schools. But the difference is, I don't think the answers are here in Washington. Some people say, let's have everything paid for and run everything from Washington. We have tried that ever since the 1960s. The scores are going down and violence is going up. 
I care about this mightily. Let's have a debate about education. We are going to have a debate about education this year--not one, but probably two or three. But some Senators say, let's open it up and have debate, let's have amendments of all kinds. That is what was going to happen. We were going to wind up debating cows. And I don't want to go off on cows because cattle are important in Mississippi. I love beef. We were going to have welfare debates and debates about everything imaginable. 
That is what has happened the whole year so far. On every bill that comes up, every Senator takes advantage of his or her right and says, `I have my amendment or amendments,' and they just grow like Topsy on everything. 
Supplemental appropriations--a bill we should have done Friday afternoon--is still sitting around here. I am not blaming that on one side or the other. I am saying `Senators,' not one 
side or the other. Both sides don't seem to want to get serious about resolving the supplemental appropriation bills that we have now combined into one. 
But the problem has boiled down to the fact that we still have Senators insisting--`We went through this process. We don't want second-degree amendments.' Some say, on the one hand, `We want to do the regular order.' When we say `second-degree amendments,' you say, `but not that regular order.' You continue to insist on amendments that don't relate to education. Senators object to that. I have been told that we must have Senator Kerry's amendment but we cannot have Senator Gorton's amendment. I don't understand that. Senator Gorton's is education related; Senator Kerry's was not; his was on child care. We will debate that another day. 
Talk about fairness. I have bent over backward, until my back is almost broken. Remember, the base bill is three-fourths a Democrat bill. I don't care because those three-fourths that the Democrats came up with are pretty good ideas--prepaid tuition for college, yes, I am for that; deductions for higher education employer-employee arrangements, hey, I am for that. That was promoted by Senator Breaux from Louisiana, Senator Moynihan from New York, and Senator Graham from Florida. We have the school production bond issue thing in here, plus what we sent back today is our final offer. There were 12 amendments for Democrats, 3 for Republicans. I mean, how far can I go? I was told, yes, only three. But you say, `We don't want Gorton in there.' So I tried. I think Senator Daschle has tried. It is time that we have a vote on cloture. Maybe I made a mistake by not saying let's do it earlier, and Senator Daschle might say the same thing. 
But I think the record speaks for itself: 3 out of 4 provisions in the bill, Democrats; 12 out of 15 amendments, Democrats. I mean that is in most games--whatever it is--more than fair. 
But we tried. Let's have a vote on cloture. This is a vote to get a good debate on the education provisions which Senators on both sides support. And we will see what happens and take it from there. 
Mr. President, I believe we have 2 or 3 minutes remaining. I yield the remainder of the time to Senator Coverdell, who has done a great job working through all of this.

Mr. LOTT. In a moment the Senate will resume consideration again of S. 1768, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I remind my colleagues, this is supposed to be an emergency, urgent supplemental. We began it in the winter. It is now spring, and I hope we can finish it before summer. But the Senate will resume work in its inimitable way, and eventually we will get to a conclusion. I have to wonder if Senators are serious at all about this emergency legislation. I think maybe as majority leader I have learned a lesson. I will not be able to ever plan again on the emergency supplemental taking a day or two. I think I will have to plan on a week or two. 
Last night we reached a unanimous consent agreement limiting amendments to the bill. It is my hope--and I know it is the chairman's hope as well--that most amendments will not be offered that are on this list. We want to finish this important legislation early today so we can move on to other issues. Those of you that do have amendments on the list, if you are serious, I urge you to come over and offer those amendments this morning. The chairman is ready to proceed. Looking down the list and thinking about the time that will be needed, if Senators are reasonable, we should be able to complete this legislation sometime in the early afternoon, I hope, at the least. 
Under the order, at 10 a.m. the Senate will resume 50 minutes of debate on the Enzi amendment regarding Indian gaming. It is my understanding that amendment may not need a rollcall vote, but we will have to clarify that momentarily. However, there are other pending amendments that will require rollcall votes. Surely there will be votes throughout the morning and the afternoon. 
We are still hoping to reach an agreement on the Coverdell education savings account bill today. Senator Daschle and I continue to exchange suggestions. Sometimes we get very close, and then it seems to go back the other way. But we very well could have the second cloture vote sometime during the day. In addition, of course, we will consider any executive and legislative items cleared for action, including the Mexico decertification legislation which we will have to do this week. We must do that under the law before the end of the month. Sometime today, I hope under a reasonable time limit--I hope not more than 2 hours--we could complete the Mexico decertification. 
I remind Senators, there will be votes on Friday morning, so they need to plan their schedules accordingly, but there will not be votes after 12 noon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1768, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, with a hope of concluding action on the bill during today's session. Hopefully, we can do it by noon. In a moment I would like to address some questions to the manager of the bill, Senator Stevens, and get a feel for kind of where we are. 
As a reminder to all Members, the second cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education savings account bill, was postponed yesterday and will occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader, as always, and we will notify the Democratic leader when a decision is made on that. And, as always, all Members will be notified when that vote will occur. It is still hoped that an agreement can be worked out with respect to an orderly handling of that bill. I expect we will not have the cloture vote until after we complete the supplemental appropriations, assuming we can get an early completion of that bill. 
Members can expect a busy day of floor activity, with votes to occur at least on the cloture and on the supplemental appropriations, perhaps on amendments to either one of those, and also the Senate may consider any executive or legislative items cleared for action.

Mr. LOTT. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's see if we can find some way to complete the supplemental appropriations bills. They are emergency appropriations for defense and disasters. Of course, the IMF issue is a separate issue, and I realize there are some disagreements about it and how it should be handled. I personally think that we should find a way to provide the funds, but only--only--if strong conditions are in place to make sure that the American people have confidence these funds are not being misused and we have a chance to see how they are being used. 
We have to draw this to a conclusion. We still have a conference to go through, and we have other issues that we desperately need to take up. So I would like again to ask for cooperation on both sides of the aisle so we can complete this legislation.

Mr. LOTT. I thank the distinguished manager of the legislation and urge him to keep up his good efforts. At some point I hope he will do as he has been known to do, get very aggressive and help bring this to a conclusion. 
I do want to say to the Senator from Texas and others who may speak on Bosnia that I think this is a very important issue and, frankly, I hope it will not be just kind of set aside or swallowed up by the supplemental appropriations bill. The supplemental appropriations bill is urgent. It is for 1 specific fiscal year. The Bosnia issue really is broader than 1 year's emergency appropriations. I agree with the Senator from Texas that we need to get a clearer understanding about what is our mission in Bosnia: Is there a mission creep occurring? How much is it going to cost? I do not think we can just give the President a time period with no end in sight, just an interminable presence. I saw one prediction the other day we might have to have troops in Bosnia for 10 years. Not with my vote. 
So I do think we need to have a full discussion about this. I try very hard to be bipartisan--nonpartisan on foreign policy issues. But in Bosnia I have never felt comfortable with what our situation is there, and I still do not. 
So I understand what she is trying to do. I hope we can work together to find a time when we can have a full debate on this issue this year. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I rise to personally commend Senator Hatch, my colleague and friend, for his leadership in helping obtain the passage of the National Tartan Day Resolution. 
Last week, the Senate passed the resolution by unanimous consent. This was no easy task and I want to acknowledge his efforts to ensure that the contributions of Americans of Scottish ancestry are recognized. I, along with many other Scottish-Americans, were very pleased with the passage of this legislation. 
I also want to thank the national and state associations which represent citizens of Scottish ancestry for their efforts to get the word out. They made sure that the members of the Senate were fully informed on the merits of this legislative initiative. They were active in obtaining cosponsors. They certainly made a difference in the legislative success of Senate Resolution 155. 
Mr. President, Scottish Americans have made many great contributions to our country. They work in many different fields and professions. They add to the very essence of what is known across the globe as the American character. Let me name a few of the more prominent Scottish-Americans: Neil Armstrong, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, William Faulkner, Malcolm Forbes and Elizabeth Taylor, just to name a few. Today many Americans of Scottish ancestry continue to make an impact. 
Mr. President, National Tartan Day is more than a recognition of Americans with Scottish ancestry. National Tartan Day is about liberty. It is about the demand of citizens for their freedom from an oppressive government. Freedom is the significance of April 6th. On this day nearly seven hundred years ago, a group of men in Arbroath, Scotland asserted their independence from the English king. These Scots declared `We fight for liberty alone.' These are powerful words that should not be forgotten today or in the future. 
These were daring words. These Scotsmen were claiming liberty as their birthright. These were enduring words, like the mountains, hills and stones of Scotland. These words still ring true. 
The words and thoughts of those long-ago Scottish patriots live on in America. Liberty has been good to their descendants in the United States. 
Beyond all the accomplishments of Scottish-Americans are those words of strength, courage and perseverance: `We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his life.' 
By honoring April 6, Americans will annually celebrate the true beginning of the quest for liberty and freedom. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues who joined me in supporting this resolution; so that we may never forget, so that the world, in some small way, may never forget, far-away, long-ago Arbroath and the declaration for liberty.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the anniversary of the tragic and frightening natural gas explosion that occurred four years ago near Edison, New Jersey. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, that accident was caused by a gouge in a major natural gas pipeline from unreported external damage during excavation. This dramatic accident caused Congress to focus on underground damage prevention. 
Mr. President, I knew then that we needed to act to prevent future damage to the American underground infrastructure. I started working with Senator Bradley and Senator Lautenberg to develop `one-call' legislation to improve state laws so as to require excavators to call before they dig, and facility owners to mark their underground facilities accurately when notified. In spite of the clear need to act to reduce the number of dangerous and disruptive accidents at our underground facilities, the consensus needed to pass a one-call bill has eluded Congress for four years. This Congress is going to be different. 
Mr. President, the Senate has twice passed a one-call bill in this Congress. The Senate has made a great start. The Senate has a bipartisan bill. The Senate has a bill passed by all 100 members. The Lott-Daschle one-call bill (S.1115) passed the Senate unanimously. In the House, the Baker-Pallone one-call bill (H.R. 3318) is moving ahead. I believe this legislation is a compatible component for the ISTEA bill. There is an overwhelming logic that as this Congress deals with the surface infrastructure it should deal with our underground infrastructure. ISTEA is the right legislative vehicle for one-call. 
I promised my good friend, Bill Bradley, when he left the Senate that I would continue the legislative effort. This Congress is not going to let another anniversary pass without enacting a one-call bill into law. This Congress will not turn its back on Edison, New Jersey. This Congress will not turn its back on a common sense safety procedure. This Congress will not allow future Americans to be subjected to the tragic consequences of an avoidable natural gas explosion.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, first, I want to congratulate the Senator from Georgia for the leadership he has provided on this issue and so many other issues, and for his persistence in coming to the floor and engaging in the discussion with the Senator from Minnesota and others. 
One of the things that comes to my mind is: What are you afraid of? What is it about this that causes you great concern? I am a product of public education from day one all the way through college all the way through law school. I really care about public education. I daresay a lot of our colleagues here in the Chamber can't say that. They went to one private school or another; one special school or another. Not me. I went to public schools in Mississippi from the first grade--in fact, even a little pre-first grade program right on through law school. When I was in elementary and in high school, my family didn't have a lot of income. My mother was a schoolteacher. My dad was a shipyard worker. They could have used an opportunity to maybe save a little money to help with our education--my education needs when I was in high school, or when I got ready to go to college. 
So look at what we are talking about here: an education savings account. Who is disadvantaged by this? Shouldn't we encourage parents and grandparents and scholarship groups to save for their children and their grandchildren's needs? Maybe that is something that they would need in high school, or maybe even elementary school, as has been pointed out, whether it is computers or uniforms. Some schools are going to need uniforms or tutors. That is something that I think really could be very helpful. 
But also in this package are some other things that would have been helpful to me and my family. And that is, prepaid tuition opportunities that would allow people to save a little to begin to invest for tuition costs when their children get ready to go to a trade school, or community college, or college, or a university. 
Then also there is the very attractive provision that would encourage employers to have, as a part of their agreement with their employees, paid higher education provisions. Shouldn't we encourage that? Isn't that something that would be good for employers to do for their employees? 
What is it that our colleagues here are afraid of on these programs? 
Also, on the bond program for private organizations to build public schools, I have had some reservations about it. But in a State such as California, or a State like Florida, if some private company wants to participate and be a part of this bond opportunity to build public schools to help school districts, shouldn't we encourage that? 
So I am really astounded at some of the opposition I hear about this legislation. I think it would help children to have options. Yes, it might allow parents and children to be able to escape a violent school, or a dangerous school, or a drug-infested school to go someplace else. Shouldn't there be some provision to try to help them do that? 
Remember this: Everything in this bill, except the school construction fees, has already been voted on and passed by the Senate. 
I address a question to the Senator from Georgia. As I recall last year, the Senate passed the Coverdell education savings account with a very substantial vote. What was it?

Mr. LOTT. Fifty-nine Senators voted for this provision in the 
1st session of the 105th Congress. 
The other provisions--I believe the prepaid tuition and the employer-paid higher education provisions--were those both in the budget tax bill last year?

Mr. LOTT. I believe they were. And I believe they were advocated in the Finance Committee--at least one of them, if not both of them--by the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, because I remember in conference defending these programs. And they were objected to at that time by the House conferees. We didn't get them through. But they have been supported on a bipartisan basis. So I am really at a loss to understand the resistance to these, particularly since three of the four provisions have already been adopted by the Senate. I just wanted to have the Senator confirm for me my memory with regard to the strong vote that occurred. 
Should we have other amendments on education and tax provisions that would help education? Sure. Is this going to be the end of the debate this year on education? Probably not. I would imagine that Senators are going to have a number of provisions. Hopefully, we may even have another bill that would address the number of questions. I would like for us to consolidate some of the myriad of Federal programs that provide funds to education into a block grant. I understand there are some 750 Federal education programs of one sort or another, and almost 39, I think it was, different agencies, bureaus, or departments. 
Couldn't we consolidate some of those and send them back to the States without strings and let the States decide if they want to use that money for school construction or for a merit pay for star teachers? But let the people at the local level decide how that money would be spent without it being directed by some Washington bureaucrat saying that you have to spend it here, or you must spend it there. 
So I wanted today to take the floor. I ask my colleague, Senator Daschle, to encourage my Democratic colleagues to work with us on some sort of agreement for the consideration of the Coverdell education savings account bill. 
On Friday, March 13, I offered an agreement that would provide for a minority substitute to be debated, and voted on first, prior to a cloture vote occurring, if one was necessary. Late last week I offered a second agreement that would provide for nine education amendments to be offered by Members of the minority, I believe it was 5 by the majority, for a total of 14 education taxes that would benefit education amendments with 9 going to the minority side.

I would not want to be the Senator on either side of the aisle who stands in the way of this major piece of education legislation.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Madam President, first of all, I want to respond to several questions that have been asked and comments that have been made. I would be glad to talk to the minority leader any time he would like about trying to work out a list. I was willing to do that Friday. I was willing to do that today. I hadn't really heard any suggestions or movement since we last talked on Thursday, and I thought it was important to come out here and show that we are willing to make movement. 
For instance, on the school construction issue that you just mentioned, I believe that one of the additional amendments that I listed here, the one by Senator Moseley-Braun, would deal with that issue. So we are not prepared to try to--we don't want to duck that issue or other education and taxes-for-education-related issues. 
I will tell you what we would like not to do. We would first like to stay on and talk about education and how to improve education in America. We would like the amendments to relate to improving the quality of education. What we would prefer not to do is debate amendments on this bill that have to do with the sale of livestock. That is one of the amendments that I understand somebody wants to offer--to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude gain or loss for the sale of livestock from computation of capital gain net income for the purposes of the earned income credit. That is something I might be for, but I don't think it relates to education and an education bill. 
You talk about let us have a good debate about education. Do we want to get off into cows? And there are several others. Senator Wellstone wants to debate welfare reform on an education bill, food stamps on an education bill. There will be other times where those amendments can be offered. But I think to agree to a reasonable list of education amendments or tax amendments related to education, to have that kind of debate is fine. I think we can work that out if they are education related. But I don't think getting into all these other issues serves the purposes of getting a focused debate on education and getting this bill to a conclusion so that we can go to other, even emergency, pieces of legislation. 
Let me take, for example, the bill Senator Dodd just mentioned. He is right. I have, over the years, worked to try to support the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. But I note that the administration flat-lined that program. They did 
not provide the funds we promised, did not provide for increasing funds in that area. Yet, the Budget Committee this past week voted to add $2.5 billion over 5 years to get the funding up for that program. So you can be assured, as the year goes forward, that we are going to have a debate about how much more money is needed for IDEA. 
But what we don't think we should have is what the Senator from Connecticut is proposing, which is to turn that program into another entitlement program--mandated appropriations, which would be an entitlement program. We need to face up to the fact that this is an important education program that, quite frankly, is having real difficulties now because we have not provided the funding we said we were going to give. What it really has to do with is, we should not make it mandatory or an entitlement; we should live up to what we said we were going to do.

Quite frankly, if it was directly related to education and a tax provision, I would be inclined to say, yes, let us debate and vote. I don't think we ought to vote on cows and welfare reform. Where will it end? I don't really think that you want us to be able to get a process that gets us some amendments and votes and gets to a 
conclusion. 
I yield to the Senator from Georgia.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I see the chairman of the Appropriations Committee here. He has some work he needs to do, amendments he needs to work on between now and 5:30. I believe we have an amendment to be offered around 5 with a vote to occur at 5:30. I see that Senator Daschle may want to respond more. I will run down two or three points, and perhaps we can wrap this up. 
As far as a move to try to block amendments, I remind the body that when this bill was called up, the motion to proceed was filibustered, objected to--not even to get to the substance or get to amendments, just the motion to proceed was filibustered. We had to have a cloture vote on even proceeding to the point where we might get to the substance. No amendments. I have suggested here 16 amendments, I believe it is, plus a substitute. If we need to give or take some, I am willing to work on that. Now, as far as whose willing to go along with this agreement, I remind my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle that 55 of our Senators, every one of them, voted for cloture last week. And as far as regular procedure around here, regular procedure is that after you have talked for a while, cloture motions are quite often filed. I have watched Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole and Senator Byrd file cloture after cloture. I note to my colleagues that I have had to file clotures 43 times in the 105th Congress, and we have had to actually vote 31 times. Tomorrow, if we don't get this worked out, it will be 32 times to stop the talk and get to the substance. Also, you need to remember that postcloture doesn't mean you can't have amendments. They have to be germane amendments. There would still be amendments. I think there were maybe 14, 15, or 16 amendments filed that would have probably cleared the postcloture vote. 
So, who is being cut off here? I think the average American sitting out there listening to this is saying, `I don't understand. You mean you are going to have 14 amendments on an education bill and you don't think that is enough?' 
What is reasonable? I have tried to be. I will continue to be. If the Senator from South Dakota has some specific recommendation of how we can get to an agreement and not have to go through another cloture vote, I would certainly be more than glad to entertain that. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I know we are faced with a time problem, but since a separate extraneous issue was raised, I must respond to this question of judicial nominations. 
First of all, when I go to my State or around the country, the last thing I hear people clamoring for is more lifetime-tenured Federal judges. There is no clamor out there in the real world for more Federal judges. 
But, so the record will be clear, the number of Clinton appointments to the Federal judiciary as of that date is 252. The total number of Clinton nominees confirmed by the 105th Congress--that is last year and the first 3 months of this year--48, 9 for the court of appeals, 37 for district courts, 2 for the USIT; 36 in the first session and 12 in the second session. 
There are currently 81 vacancies in this very large Federal judiciary, and of that 81, 41 of them have not had nominees. It is pretty hard for us to consider nominees if we do not have them even presented to the Congress. 
I have been hearing this now for months about, `Oh, why don't you move more?' Maybe the administration ought to consider moving a little faster. They can't send them up here and immediately start complaining that they are not considered in the next week or even the next month. But half of the vacancies do not have a nominee pending. Plus, there are only six pending on the calendar, and we will probably consider a couple of those this week. So there will only be four pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for judicial positions. 
Then let me make one other point. Should we take our time and look at these people who are nominated to be Federal judges for life and hold sway over us in ways that exceed the imagination--and certainly I don't approve of--right down to trying to run our schools at the local level? 
Should we take our time, look at them carefully when they are received in the committee, have hearings on them, ask them a lot of questions, then send them to the floor and have them checked once again? 
Yes; and I will give you exhibit A of why we need to do that. 
Just look at the one that was withdrawn last week--Frederica Massiah-Jackson, a nominee for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who used profanity from the bench, had identified undercover policemen so that they could be recognized by the criminal element, a whole raft of things that came out, and, by the way, much of it after she was nominated, after she was reported by the Judiciary Committee and had been pending in the Senate for months. 
Finally, the local district attorney--I might say, a Democrat--and the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association came out in opposition to this nomination, and, after it had been reported by the Judiciary Committee, held on the floors for weeks and months, the administration, realizing she was going to be defeated, withdrew her nomination. Should we take our time on these Federal judges? Yes. Do I have any apologies? Only one: I probably moved too many already. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment providing $5 million for overt political support and $5 million for the establishment of `Radio Free Iraq.' 
This is a bipartisan amendment. I am joined by Senators Lieberman, Gregg, Hollings, Kyl, Stevens, Helms, and Brownback in support for this start to a political approach to changing the regime in Iraq. 
This emergency appropriations bill contains over $1.3 billion for U.S. military operations in Southwest Asia. Our military deployments to the Persian Gulf are very expensive. They are necessary to keep pressure on Iraq. 
But I believe that a new policy goal is necessary as well. I have publicly advocated an approach that has an explicit goal for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power. I expect to continue to examine how such a policy can be developed and implemented. I will continue to work with the Administration to explore ways we can develop a Iraq policy that is more effective and more sustainable. 
The amendment today is intended to be a first step in a policy reappraisal. It is drawn from a provision in the State Department Authorization Conference Report. Section 1814 authorizes $38 million for a number of purposes, including political support and creating `Radio Free Iraq.' 
The amendment today would appropriate the money. It would be non-offset--designated as an emergency. It seems reasonable to me to put a modest $10 million for political efforts when the underlying bill has more than $1.3 billion for military efforts. 
I would also like to note what the statement of managers on the State Department Authorization Conference Report says about the Iraqi opposition: `The Committee further notes that disparate Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni groups have in the past been willing to set aside their differences and unite under the umbrella of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) to challenge Saddam Hussein.' 
This amendment requires the Administration to submit their proposal to spend these funds within 30 days. Congress will review their proposal very carefully--especially what groups the Administration plans to work with. 
I understand there is some division within the Administration about the INC. I know you can always find reasons for not undertaking a difficult policy. In my view, the Iraqi National Congress should be front and center in any efforts to develop a strategy for a democratic Iraq. There may be other opposition groups deserving of support but I do not know of any that have been as effective as the INC was until the fall of 1996. 
Along with the other sponsors, I intend to keep pressing on various elements of this strategy during legislative action on fiscal year 1999 bills. 
I thank the co-sponsors for their support and look forward to the unanimous adoption of this amendment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1768, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. As earlier announced, a vote will occur today at 5:30, hopefully with respect to an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill, but if that cannot be arranged, or if there is not an amendment available at that time, then the Senate will be voting with respect to an Executive Calendar item. Therefore, Senators should be on notice that a vote will occur at 5:30. 
It is my hope the Senate can make good progress, if not complete action, on the supplemental appropriations bill, since it is an emergency. It is the funds for our activities in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, as well as for natural disasters. I hope we can get it completed, certainly prior to an anticipated cloture vote at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday. That cloture vote would be on H.R. 2646, which is the Coverdell A+ Education Savings Account Act. Perhaps we will be able to work out a unanimous consent agreement on a limited number of amendments and how those amendments could be handled so that cloture would not be necessary, but if not, we will have cloture at 5:30. And I assume and hope that that cloture motion will be agreed to. 
So I ask all Members who must amend that important legislation to notify the managers of their intentions. Senator Stevens will be coming here later, and he will be looking for notification of any amendments that might be necessary. 
As announced earlier, consideration of the NATO treaty has 
been postponed, to occur at a later date, possibly even after the Easter recess. The Senate has several very important emergency items we have to consider prior to the recess, including, probably on Thursday of this week, the Mexico decertification issue. The rules require that we have to act on that before Saturday, and I believe the rules also provide for up to 10 hours of debate. So we have to do that Thursday, we have to complete the supplemental appropriations, and we have to complete the education bill. So we just do not have the time to have the necessary focused debate that we need to have on NATO enlargement. It may be after the Easter recess before we come back to that. A number of Senators have asked that we have the final debate and votes after the Easter recess, so we may have to do that. 
So we will have a vote at 5:30 this afternoon on the supplemental appropriations bill, an amendment perhaps, and then we will have the Coverdell education bill tomorrow. I hope that we can find a way to work together and not spend the whole week with filibusters and cloture votes, but if not, we will go with the cloture votes and take up the emergency issues we have to deal with. I hope we will get cooperation. I thank the Senators for that. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. I emphasize on the supplemental that we have now just 2 weeks before the Easter recess period. I am under the impression that there is some increased urgency for this particular bill because of the impact it has on the Department of Defense. These funds would go to replenish the expenditures for the Bosnian operation, and for activities in the Persian Gulf, as well as the natural disasters. 
Recognizing that, I thought it would be important that we go ahead and try to get this legislation up, considered, and passed, or ready to be passed, so that when the House acts, they can go to conference immediately. This is at the request of Chairman Stevens. I know that he has been working very closely with the ranking member, Senator Byrd, on this legislation. 
I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 on Tuesday the Senate proceed to the cloture vote with respect to the Coverdell education savings account bill. This will only be necessary if an agreement cannot be reached in the meantime for an orderly procedure for consideration of the education bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will lay aside the NATO treaty and begin consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill on Monday. A vote will occur on Monday at 5:30, hopefully, with respect to an amendment on this supplemental appropriations bill, if some are available. If that cannot be arranged, then we will be voting with respect to the Executive Calendar item--at least one. Senators should be on notice that a vote will occur at 5:30 on Monday, March 23. 
I hope the Senate can make good progress, if not complete action on the supplemental appropriations bill, by the 5:30 cloture vote on Tuesday. 
I really believe that we should be able to finish that bill in just a few hours, actually. I urge all Members who must offer an amendment to restrain themselves and make sure that it 
is a very important amendment and that it relates to the subjects we have included in this supplemental appropriations. 
As Members can determine from the various agreements and announcements I have outlined here, the NATO treaty has been postponed to occur on a later date. Perhaps we can return to it next week. But it depends on what we can get done on the supplemental appropriations and on the education savings account. 
For instance, assuming we get cloture, there still could be 30 hours that could be eaten up after that. So rather than continue to go back and forth, I thought we had reached a point where we need to get focused on doing these two bills, and then we will go back to NATO enlargement at a later date. 
It could actually now not be back for a concentrated debate and amendments and votes even until after the Easter recess. I had hoped we could have gotten it done earlier. I had hoped we would have it done by now. But we have not received cooperation on any bill that has come up this year, and I can only do so much to try to get the Senate to focus and complete action. If they do not, then I have to turn to other emergency matters. 
So once a determination is made that we want to get this work completed, then we will go back to it. But until the Senate indicates a willingness to stay focused and we get a little cooperation and don't have a filibuster fight and a cloture vote on every bill, then it will just have to come up later because I do have Members on both sides of the aisle asking me to delay it. And yet I have tried to go forward with it because I thought it was the right thing to do, and I am willing always to try to do the right thing for our country but not if everybody else is going to be playing games. 
So we will just go with this schedule and hopefully next week with cooperation we can complete the Coverdell education savings account bill, the supplemental appropriations, NATO enlargement perhaps even, and then turn to the budget resolution next. Hope springs eternal. I hope it will apply to next week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is a clear, strong majority in the Senate who want to pass the Coverdell-Torricelli education savings account bill. It is bipartisan; I want to emphasize that. I believe every Republican is going to be for ending the debate. They are not dragging this out and having a full-fledged filibuster. I think there are several Democrats who agree we should get to the substance, too, and I hope we are going to have a broad--and I believe we will--a majority will vote for this legislation when we get to final passage. And there is a reason for that. 
The legislation would benefit some 14 million families who could use the education savings accounts. I have said it before and I emphasize it again, I think one of the problems with elementary and secondary education in America today is there is no opportunity for financial assistance, no way to save your own money to help your children a little bit. It does not have to be $2,000 a year; it could be $200 a year or less. But that money then could be accumulated and get the tax benefits and then used to buy uniforms or books or computers or to choose another school. 
So I think this is a major step in the right direction in dealing with the problems of elementary and secondary education in America. 
This bill would help 1 million students with tax relief on their State prepaid-tuition plans. This is a good idea. We ought to allow people to be able to pay in advance for the impact of tuition when they go to college. This is something that is being advocated very aggressively by a number of Democrats as well as Republicans. 
This bill would benefit a million workers, including 250 graduate students, whose employers would be better able to provide education assistance for them. Shouldn't we encourage that? Shouldn't we encourage employers to help their good workers who want to better themselves to advance their education? Of course we should, and this would do that in the best possible way. 
Now, Mr. President, this day is day 6 of the delay and obstruction against getting this education reform. Is it all we need to do? No. Is it a major step in the right direction? You betcha. We ought to do this. And we should not keep delaying it and dragging it out. 
For 6 days some Members of this body have taken turns standing in the schoolhouse door barring the way to a quality education for children who, quite often, need it the most. 
I want to thank all the Senators who have been involved on both sides of the aisle who have been willing to put aside partisan considerations and do what is right for American families. 
It would also benefit hard-pressed localities that could build new public schools with the bill's $3 billion in tax-exempt private activity bonds. This is in there because of the continued efforts of Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Feinstein who worked on it, and Senator Coverdell who was for this. Some of us have some reservations about this. I am one of them. But if you think about it, if Disney World would like to help build another school in the Orlando area and this would help that happen, because in the public schools it might not happen, should we allow that opportunity through the taxing of bond activity? Maybe so. That is in this bill. 
In short, this is one of the most important pieces of consumer rights legislation that the Senate has considered since the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration, I believe. And it is being blocked systematically and cynically by those who do not want, apparently, middle-income or low-income families to have the same choice in education that is available to all wealthy families. 
My family did not have that option, couldn't afford it. I went to public schools all the way--proud of it. I think they did a good job. But I don't believe my kids got as good a public education as I did, and they went to public schools all the way, too. But I still think we should have other choices. 
I think it is ironic--no; maybe it is tragic that in the midst of this filibuster, of this delay, the administration is today boasting of its record on school violence, that we have safer schools. I do not know where they have been. The schools are the most dangerous in America today than they have ever been in history, probably. 
I mean, I used to worry about chewing gum in school. Now kids bring guns to school and shoot their classmates. You have to go through a metal detector to get into schools. Where are these programs that have been helping with that? I don't see them. But it is a curious gesture, to me, to wring your hands about the violence in classrooms while you block the exits so that children cannot escape from unsafe drug-ridden schools. That is what this would help do. 
I think it is just pretense, really, to deplore violence on the playground and in the school corridors while you force those endangered boys and girls to stay right where they are. And that is the fact of the opposition that we see to the Coverdell-Torricelli bill, because we are trying to give them some options. We are telling our children, oh, yeah, we want more classrooms and whatnot, but they have to stay in the back of the education bus and they have to stay in these dangerous schools. 
So if the classrooms are smaller, smaller classes, but still dangerous and infected with drugs, you are not getting a good quality education, and because the teacher can't pass a test himself. I do not think we have done what we need to do. 
Do we trust the parents or not? That is one of the questions here. I do not trust a Federal bureaucrat in Washington to make the right decision for the children in my hometown schools. I trust the parents and the teachers and the administrators at the local level to make the right decision for their children. 
So I think that this is something that we should bring to a conclusion. We need to find a way to get this bill considered, amendments to be offered. So I say here today--and we have just 
sent notification to the Democratic leader--that we wish to make a full effort once again to find a way to bring it to a conclusion so we can consider education and education needs and education amendments. 
I have another proposal. Keep in mind, last week I proposed that the Democrats should have a substitute bill, or could have, if they want to do it, and put anything they want to in it, debate it as long as they want to, and have a vote; and then we would go to the Coverdell-Torricelli bill. Well, for good reasons, I presume, we could not get an agreement on a substitute. 
So then we said, well, what about if we have a couple of amendments on each side that are education related, and we have time to debate the amendments offered by Democrats, time to offer the two amendments offered by Republicans? That did not work and, once again, partially because there were more than two on each side; there were a number of them. 
Well, I have a new proposal. I have a way to bring us to a conclusion that I believe everybody would feel is fair and we could get a good debate on education. I understand that there are some 14 amendments that have been filed that relate to education--education. Five of them are Republican; nine of them are Democrat. 
Now, there are some others that have been filed that do not relate to education--clearly do not relate to education. So I propose here this afternoon that we say, OK, we are going to have agreement that those 14 education amendments that have been filed can be offered, debated for an hour each, and voted on--five Republican, nine Democrat--but they have to be the education amendments; and then we go on to final passage based on whatever the condition of the package is at that point. 
Now, if we have to go to cloture--and when we get cloture --we still could have 30 hours of debate after that, and amendments would be offered or could be offered. We probably would take at least 14 or 15 hours or more post-cloture. So I would like to--I am not asking for an answer now, but I am suggesting it to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and for the children of America, that maybe this is a way to make sure that Senators are able to offer amendments to education in addition to what is in this bill, and also to be able to offer ones that might not be germane post-cloture. 
This is a way to get it done. And we could set up a process of when we would begin on those amendments. We would have the 14 hours of debate, the votes would occur, and we could bring this to a conclusion, and I believe that instead of having a talkathon, we would have an A+ bill, a bill with input from Members on both sides of the aisle, a bill that would help education in America. And I think the American people would say we have not just been talking about what we are going to do, but they would then see the truth, that we really do want to be a positive force in improving education in America and we found a way to do it. 
And it would add this additional benefit. It would allow us to bring it to a conclusion within a foreseeable period of time. It would allow us then to focus on having debates only on NATO enlargement, and get that to a focused debate and a focused conclusion, and then to go perhaps--even next week, if we could get all this lined up--to a vote on one or both of the supplemental appropriations bills. 
Now, that would be a week and a half of production that would stagger the minds of men, particularly when it comes to education. But we would have done education, we would have done NATO enlargement, and we would have done supplemental bills that will affect the defense of our country because of the funds for Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, for IMF, and for disasters. We could do all that in 1 week. I think it would be a monumental accomplishment. And I invite the Democratic leader to respond and to think about this offer, because I think it is a fair one that a lot of Senators would feel good about. 
With that, I would be glad to yield since I see Senator Daschle is here.

Mr. LOTT. The timeframe is--you know, we do not have to lock into that. I just thought, since you are talking about 14 amendments here, that an hour probably would be enough. If we needed more on some of them, less on some others, we could work through that. But part of the reason why I was having hopes that we could, after about 20 hours or so, finish this up and then get to a focused-on debate on only NATO enlargement and get to a vote on that--that was part of the thinking. But the time could be flexible. Generally speaking, I think some of these amendments probably could be debated for less than an hour maybe. 
So you understand I will not ask this now, just so you can think about it, between now and when we get to the cloture vote I could ask consent notwithstanding rule XXII, regardless of the outcome of the 5:15 votes, the following amendments be in order postcloture. One of the reasons that is also important, because some amendments might still be in order postcloture that would not be on this list, and that we would work on how much time we have on each amendment, and that there would be nine education-related amendments offered by the minority side, filed amendments 2020, 2026 through 2028, 2031 through 2033, 2040 and 2041; and five education-related amendments offered by the majority side, 2021, 2022, 2024 through 2025, and 2035. 
That is a suggestion of a UC we could ask for, or if we could work out some other unanimous consent agreement on education-related amendments. I know the Senator was talking about maybe having a crime bill. I know when he is having a crime bill he would rather not have to deal with a fisheries' amendment. I understand the minority wants to make sure they are not precluded from offering amendments important to them. I think he also understands the majority has some rights and desires not to have to vote on amendments across the board, from one end of the spectrum to the other, when we are trying to get an education bill completed that is very important to education in America and children in America, so we could then get to a very important national policy issue, NATO enlargement, that I had the President call about just last night. 
I am looking for a way to be fair so we can consider education amendments and identify a way to bring it to an end.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in keeping with trying to start the vote on time at 5:15, I will also be brief. I want to emphasize that this is the sixth day that we have had this legislation before us. We have had opportunities to try to come to some agreement. I have offered to agree that there would be a substitute offered by the minority. Then I suggested that there be a substitute and a couple of amendments on both sides. Then there was an indication that, well, if we could get other amendments that are relevant to education, maybe that would be a good idea. So I suggested that we go with the 14 education and tax-related amendments that were actually filed, 9 of which were minority amendments, and 5 would be offered by the majority. The indications are that that is not acceptable. The leader indicated it didn't include the substitute. We would be flexible in doing that. 
What I am interested in doing is finding a way to get us to a conclusion on the very important issue of education, and there is support on both sides. We have had a cloture on the motion to proceed. Now we are going to have two votes on cloture on the bill itself. There is a question of how long we can continue this. We have other business we need to do. So I urge my colleagues, if those of you that are with us on a bipartisan basis really want the Coverdell savings account for children in America, if you want prepaid tuition to be available with the tax benefits, if you want employer education benefits to be available to your college students, this is the opportunity. 
So I understand that the minority leader wants his Members to stick with him. But this is an important issue. We need to get to the substance. Then, even when we get through the cloture vote, when we get cloture, we could still work out an agreement for some other amendments that would not be in order postcloture, unless we agreed to. 
But, as I told Senator Daschle a couple of days ago, I am interested in getting this bill done. I am willing to be flexible to agree to some amendments on education. I do not want to run far afield. I don't think we ought to be shifting amendments, or health amendments, or things that are not related to education and taxes in this bill. There will be other opportunities. This is not the last day. We have a budget resolution coming up. We have a supplemental coming up. 
So I will be glad to work with Senator Daschle, and will continue to work with him on that. 
I urge colleagues, if you support savings accounts and these other issues, the time is now, vote for cloture. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Now, that will be the last vote of the night, then. There will not be recorded votes tomorrow, although the Senate will be in session for debate on the NATO enlargement and, hopefully, on an amendment, with a vote on that amendment scheduled for probably 5:30, around 5:30 on Monday. The reason we did this, there is a serious effort underway, on a bipartisan basis, of those who support this legislation to work with the leaders on both sides of the aisle to get a process where we can have a fair consideration of this bill and amendments that are important to the Members, and get to a conclusion on the whole process by late Wednesday afternoon. I think that is fair. I think that Members on both sides would like to do it. But I do think, as is the tradition in the Senate, the leaders on both sides need to work with their Members to develop a process that they can be comfortable with. I think I have shown a willingness to do that, and I believe Senator Daschle is going to be working on that with me and the bipartisan supporters of this legislation. Thank you for your effort. I will see some of you tomorrow and the rest of you Monday afternoon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me observe, first, that I have had the opportunity off and on during the day to listen to some of the debate on the NATO enlargement issue. I have to say there have been some excellent speeches and some very thoughtful observations about the importance of this legislation and what we should do. I am glad we have gone ahead and taken it up. It has given Members notice that we are moving toward a period where we will have the final debate on amendments and a vote on this issue. But I have been very impressed with the quality of the speeches that I have heard today. We will continue on until, I think it is quarter till 5, this afternoon on NATO enlargement. We will continue to have debate on NATO enlargement until we get something worked out on the Coverdell education savings account legislation and conclude that, and then we will go to the final round of debate and amendments on NATO enlargement. 
The way we are doing the debate, the dual track of both the education issue and NATO enlargement, is not intended at all to diminish either. It is intended to raise up both of them and the awareness and consciousness of the American people and give Senators an opportunity to make their positions known on both these issues. We will do them in a way where we will get a focus on the issue and have a good debate in the final analysis.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, as well as Senator Coverdell, for crafting such a bipartisan amendment. As always, while it may not always have the vote of the ranking member, he is always cooperative and considerate in how he deals with legislation coming out of the Finance Committee. So I really appreciate the work done by Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Coverdell, and Senator Torricelli, in getting this bipartisan initiative to this point. 
The amendment includes three major Democratic initiatives that are also supported by a majority on this side of the aisle --those being the school construction section that has been aggressively pursued by Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Feinstein of California, and others. A lot of work went into that by Senator Coverdell and Senator Roth, once again. It also includes the State prepaid tuition initiative in which I believe Senator Breaux, Senator Graham, and others have been interested. I also have been supportive of that initiative in the past. I believe Senator Moynihan also has had an interest in that. Finally, it also includes the employer-paid higher education provision. This is something I believe is referred to as section 127, which Senator Moynihan talked about. 
I think that anything we can do to make it possible for parents, grandparents, and supporters of scholarships in education to be able to be more involved and to save for their children's education, not only higher education, but K through 12, elementary and secondary, to be able to take advantage of a prepaid tuition initiative so that that can be done to help children get into college and deal with what quite often is a pretty high tuition cost when they first go in, or deal with the 
costs of their graduate education and those expenses should be done. These are all good things because we need to do everything we can in America to make it possible for our children to get an education, whether that's elementary and secondary, higher education, or trade school training, vocational education, whatever it is. So we need to look at all of those across the board. 
I continue to be concerned about the poor test scores of our children at the elementary and secondary levels. I continue to look at the fact that our higher education is the best in the world and wonder why that is true when our elementary and secondary education levels are quite often very low. In fact, I saw one statistic recently that we are 19th in the world. Why? Why can't our children write in the fourth grade and read and understand basic science when they are in the eighth grade? I think this Coverdell A+ program will help with getting tutoring, or getting computers for children in the fourth grade or eighth grade, or make it a choice to go to a different school, and being able to save a little bit for that option. 
So I think all of these programs are good. I think it will be good for us to spend some time talking about education in America, thinking together about how we can improve it. I think one of the problems with education in America at the K through 12 level is that we have been thinking it has to fit in this box, it has to be done this way, without choice, without financial assistance, and without teacher testing, and without really dealing with the drug problems. We need to begin to ask ourselves, can we do it differently? Can we offer other options? Can we provide financial assistance for parents with children in the eighth grade who have special needs? I think 
this legislation will begin to take us in that direction. 
So I am proud that we are reaching the point, hopefully, where we can get into debating the substance of the legislation. I understand there are some colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle who are interested in offering amendments. That is fine. I hope they will offer amendments when we get to the substance of the bill that relates to education. I understand that some of these amendments would be nongermane, which would be in extraneous areas not related to this. We will have other opportunities--in the budget resolution and in appropriations bills--to have amendments on Social Security, and there are a lot of good thoughts going into the Social Security area now. The Senator from New York made a presentation this past week that is very interesting and thoughtful. We ought to get into that. But we should not do it on this education bill. Let's have some talk about education and how we can improve education in America. 
Now, I had offered, last week, the idea that the Democratic leader would perhaps want to develop a substitute, an alternative to this package, in the education area. I think he gave some thought to that. But he concluded that maybe it could not be done last week. So I called him again last night and said, `Would you like to do a substitute and have that considered on Wednesday or Thursday, and then we would go to the substance of the bill on Friday?' The indication was that he did not want to do the substitute. I even talked about, `Could we do some process where we would have a limited number of amendments that relate to education?' Again, he indicated that he didn't think he could do that. 
So before I file cloture today, I want to offer, once 
again, to do it that way, have a substitute. I have discussed that with several Democrats who are supportive of the Coverdell bill. They thought that would be a fair way to proceed, to have an alternative package, debate that and vote on it, and then go to the Coverdell A+ education savings account proposals with these additions. But I understand that can't be agreed to. I wanted to make the offer not once or twice, but three times, to have a substitute or even have some limited amendments relating to education. 
If I could ask the ranking member, on behalf of the leader, who is unavoidably detained at this time, is it not possible for us to get an agreement that would allow us to go to the substitute arrangement or some limited number of amendments related only to education at this time?

We would be willing to work to see if we can get an agreement with the minority leader on getting that vote on Thursday afternoon. If the first cloture vote is not successful, then a second cloture vote would occur on Friday, or on Thursday, if we can get that arranged.

Mr. LOTT. I want to reiterate again, first of all, Mr. 
President, under the proposal that I have suggested of a substitute amendment, any or all of these proposals could have been offered. We even thought about the possibility of having some agreed-to limited number of amendments that were educationally related. But Senator Daschle indicated, I believe, that he didn't think that was the way that he would like to proceed. 
With regard to postcloture, assuming cloture is invoked, it depends on, I guess, how the amendment is offered. There certainly would be a debate on the contents of this package. That does include the school construction bond issue for public schools. And it is conceivable that germane amendments could be offered to that to strike it. But, if you tried to strike it and add a new program under the rules, I presume that would not be possible under the cloture arrangement. 
Again, with regard to other issues, including the Boxer amendment that the Senator described, in postcloture that probably would not be eligible. But I emphasize again. We could have worked, or could work, out an agreement where a limited number of amendments, or a substitute, could be considered. 
With regard to the California issue, I want to emphasize that Senator Feinstein was very interested in getting the language included--that could be helpful in any State, but particularly in States like Florida and California--and in providing additional new public school construction. She had quite an interest in a provision that was eventually added to the bill. I might add it was a close vote in the Finance Committee. I think I cast the deciding vote to provide for that. 
So I think it is important that we find a way to get to the substance of this bill without it being indefinitely delayed so we can have a full debate about education but not have it get off into all kinds of other unrelated issues that would tend to dilute, I think, the debate on a discussion on education and the very important provisions that we have put together in this package in a bipartisan way. 
Senator Daschle has come to the floor. We have been having a discussion about how to proceed. Senator Moynihan on his behalf has indicated that he didn't think the minority would be prepared to agree to my offer to have a substitute amendment, or some limited number of education amendments. And we were responding to questions from Senator Kennedy. I have filed a cloture motion and indicated that we would talk about whether or not we would have those cloture votes on Friday morning, or even Thursday afternoon, at the request of some Senators on both sides of the aisle. I want to talk to the minority leader about that. We were, quite frankly, hopeful that the Senator would be able to arrive and respond to the present situation. 
I would be glad to respond to questions or comments from Senator Daschle. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, I would like to indicate that this is a bipartisan package. The Finance Committee reported it out by a substantial vote. We have already included three major Democrat proposals in this package. In fact, there are only four components to it. Three of them were principally sponsored by Democrats. In fact, I think probably the cause of the bill is probably well over two-thirds--80 percent--based on the Democratic amendments. But it didn't make any difference. They were Democrat, or Republican, if they made sense. If they will help with education in the elementary, secondary, or higher education level, they deserve serious consideration. And if they are meritorious, the committee added them. We considered other issues, I might add, in the Finance Committee. Point No. 1. 
No. 2, with regard to not wanting to delay things, I should note that the discussion on this package began with a filibuster on the motion to proceed. I had to file a cloture on the motion to proceed--and not getting to the substance of even proceeding to consider the bill. It took us, I guess, 3 days to get that, although when we got to the vote, to the credit of both sides, it passed overwhelmingly. Seventy-five Senators said, Yes; we should cut off the filibuster on the motion to proceed. 
With regard to the other issues, I did not want to spend 5 days on the Reagan Airport; 5 hours or 5 minutes would have been fine. But I thought that it was something we ought to think about. Some Senators had reservations, you know. It looked like we were having a filibuster on that. It shouldn't have taken 5 days. It should not have taken 4 days on cloning. I think that is an issue that has consequences serious enough that we ought to think about it carefully. It didn't have the votes. We pulled it back. We will see what the committee comes up with. But a doctor, Bill Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, is working with others to come up with a package on this very important cloning issue. I thought that deserved some thought and some concerns, especially when you have a doctor saying we will start cloning human beings. I don't know whether I am all that excited about that prospect. 
But, at any rate, I understand Senator Daschle's position. He has to be responsive to his Members, and I have to be responsive to mine. We have to work together to try to find a way to get to a conclusion on the education savings account bill, with the additions, and also to begin to continue to have debate on the NATO enlargement. 
A lot of Senators want to talk about that. We understand maybe a Senator has a key amendment that he would be willing to offer this afternoon. I am not sure that that is true, but I think maybe Senator Warner would be willing to go ahead and offer his amendment, which is one that is a critical amendment, on the NATO enlargement. So this time will not be wasted. This is good time. And I invite Senators to come forward to talk about and think about in a public forum with the American people this very important question of enlarging NATO. 
And by the way, with regard to double-tracking these issues, this is something that is done all the time. I used to watch Senator Byrd do it, Senator Mitchell do it, Senator Dole do it. So the idea is, while we are letting the procedures go forward, we can take up another very important subject. 
So as a reminder to all Senators, under the provisions of rule XXII, all first-degree amendments must be filed at the desk by 1 p.m. on Thursday and all second-degree amendments must be filed 1 hour prior to the cloture vote.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just two final observations with regard to Senator Daschle's comments. I feel very strongly about this Coverdell A+ bill. I think it is going to be helpful for children in America. My mother was a schoolteacher. I went to public schools all my life. I worked in placement and financial aid. I think it is high time we give parents and grandparents and people who care about kids in elementary and secondary education an opportunity to save for those kids and help them get an education. That is one of the reasons why I think education is not as good as it ought to be in elementary and secondary. 
So I am determined we are going to get this bill up. We are going to consider it without a lot of extraneous matters. And I do want to observe that, as majority leader, I do still think the majority sets the agenda. I get to call up the bills, not somebody else. It has been developed over a period of many years that majority leaders call bills up, and I am not going to be dictated to by others who have a different agenda. 
You can say you are going to do this and you are going to do that. If you want to have a fight over it, we will meet and fight on this one, because I am standing with children in elementary and secondary education in America. And I might also just say now I am willing to do what is right for our country. I have stood at this point and taken some tough stands when I thought it was important that it be bipartisan, nonpartisan, for our country. And I won't even repeat them, because I received a lot of flak. But right now I have Senators saying, don't go to NATO enlargement, delay it, delay it until after the Easter recess, delay it until June; do it never. 
I do not think that is right. I am willing to cooperate and work on some of these issues that must be bipartisan. But in return, from this administration and from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am going to look for a little help and a little cooperation on issues that I think are important also. 
So I hope that we can find a way to do that, and I believe we will. But it does take cooperation as we get through these 
difficult shoals on education, on NATO enlargement, on the budget for the year, on the emergency funding, the supplemental appropriations bill for Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, for disasters, and maybe even for IMF. Some of these issues I don't even agree with, but I feel an obligation to call them up. 
So since there has been an objection, I now move that the Senate----

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I would like to recognize the professional dedication, vision and public service of Lieutenant Peter Olson who is leaving the United States Navy to join the staff of Senator Phil Gramm. Lieutenant Olson, has served with distinction for the past 9 years in Naval Service. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb service he has provided this legislative body, the Navy and our great Nation. 
Lieutenant Olson is a graduate of Rice University and the University of Texas School of Law. After passing the Texas Bar Examination, he attended the Navy's Aviation Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, Florida, and was commissioned an Ensign in May 1989. He proceeded to flight training where he received his `Wings of Gold' and was designated a Naval Aviator in March 1991. 
Lieutenant Olson received training in the P-3C `Orion' Maritime Patrol Aircraft with Patrol Squadron THIRTY-ONE, at NAS Moffett Field, California. He reported for duty with the `White Lightnings' of Patrol Squadron SEVENTEEN (VP-17) stationed at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, where he made deployments to Misawa, Japan, and Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territories. 
Among his shore assignments, Lieutenant Olson has served with distinction at the Navy's Bureau of Personnel in the Enlisted Advancements Division and as an intern with the Logistics Directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Lieutenant Olson joined the Navy's Senate Liaison team in March 1996. During his service as a Navy Liaison Officer, he provided members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and personal staffs, with timely support regarding Navy plans, programs and constituent casework. He has helped maintain the best trained, best equipped, and best prepared Navy in the world. 
Madam President, Peter Olson, his wife Nancy, and daughter Kate, have made many sacrifices during his 9-year Navy career. He has served proudly with a dedication and enthusiasm that only comes from our Nation's best and brightest. Among Lieutenant Olson's many awards and decorations are the Joint Service Commendation Medal and the Navy Commendation Medal. He is a great credit to both the Navy and the country. The Nation and our military are indebted to Lieutenant Olson for his many years of distinguished service. As he now departs to begin a new career with Senator Gramm, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him `fair winds and following seas'.

Mr. LOTT. So then tomorrow the Senate will be in the morning business period from 9:30 until 11:30. Under the previous consent, then at 11:30 we will go back to the NATO expansion treaty. All Senators with amendments to the treaty are encouraged to contact the managers of the treaty with their amendments in hopes of making considerable progress on the treaty during Thursday's session. I want to emphasize the bulk of the day tomorrow, from 11:30 until 5:15, that entire time, will be devoted to discussion or debate on the NATO enlargement issue. We hope that amendments can be offered. We want to give the Senate ample time to think about this issue and debate it, have amendments and to have votes. 
We are double-tracking it now, while we await the cloture votes on the education bill, but that is quite often done. It is in no way intended to diminish the importance of NATO enlargement. It is, in fact, intended to begin the process for Senators and the American people in every way possible to think about this issue, make sure we are doing the right thing. And I think it is the right thing to have the NATO enlargement. 
Then, when we complete the education bill, whenever that comes, we will meet with interested and involved Senators on both sides, see how much more time is needed, what other amendments are pending, and then we would stay on it until it is completed. I hope we could get that done by a reasonable time next week, hopefully Wednesday or Thursday. But it is a very important issue and we will continue working on it until we are convinced that Senators are satisfied they have had their say. Then we would go to the recorded vote. 
Also, under the previous consent, then, at 5:15 the Senate would debate H.R. 2646, the Coverdell education bill, for 30 minutes prior to the previously scheduled 5:45 cloture vote on the bill. 
We may actually move that time a little bit so that we can have an earlier vote. As a matter of fact, Madam President, I will change my earlier unanimous consent request and ask consent that the cloture votes previously ordered on H.R. 2646 now occur at 5:15 p.m. and the debate time earlier agreed to actually occur now at 4:45.

In addition, the Senate may consider other legislative or Executive Calendar business cleared for Senate action. We do have some Executive Calendar items I hope we can take up before the end of the week. 
So Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout Thursday's session with the ones that I have already mentioned scheduled for sure to occur at, I believe, 5:15 now.

Whereas, John McCain's A-4E Skyhawk was shot down over Hanoi, North Vietnam, on October 26, 1967, and he remained in captivity until March 14, 1973; 
Whereas, John McCain's aircraft was shorn of its right wing by a Surface to Air Missile and he plunged toward the ground at about 400 knots prior to ejecting; 
Whereas, upon ejection, John McCain's right knee and both arms were broken; 
Whereas, John McCain was surrounded by an angry mob who kicked him and spit on him, stabbed him with bayonets and smashed his shoulder with a rifle. . .; 
Whereas, historians of the Vietnam war have recorded that `no American reached the prison camp of Hoa Lo in worse condition than John McCain.' 
Whereas, his North Vietnamese captors recognized John McCain came from a distinguished military family-- 
I might add, a family from my great State of Mississippi-- 
and caused him to suffer special beatings, special interrogations, and the cruel offer of a possible early release; 
Whereas, John McCain sat in prison in Hanoi for over 5 years, risking life from disease and medical complications resulting from his injuries, steadfastly refusing to cooperate with his enemy captors because his sense of honor and duty would not permit him to even consider an early release on special advantage; 
Whereas, knowing his refusal to leave early may well result [or might have resulted] in his own death from his injuries, John McCain told another prisoner, `I don't think that's the right thing to do. . ..They'll have to drag me out of here.' 
Whereas, following the Peace Accords [in Paris] in January 1973, 591 United States prisoners of war were released from captivity by North Vietnam. . .; 
Whereas, Senator John McCain of Arizona has continued to honor the Nation with devoted service; and 
Whereas, the Nation owes a debt of gratitude to John McCain and all of these patriots for their courage and exemplary service: Now, therefore, be it

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Farm Credit Opportunity Act of 1997, a bill that will correct an inequity in the Farm Service Agency's (FSA) Guaranteed Loan Program. Currently, this program has upper limits on the amounts that can be guaranteed by the FSA. Specifically, the two types of loans administered under this program--farm ownership loans and operating loans--have caps of $300,000 and $400,000, respectively. The farm ownership loan cap was adjusted to its current level in 1978, while the operating loan cap was last raised in 1984. That is 20 years ago for one and 14 years ago for the other. A great deal has changed. Prices have gone up and inflation has eroded the value of the caps. Back then, farm ownership and operating costs could be adequately financed within both of these cap limits. Not anymore. It is time for a cap correction. 
Given today's larger and more capital-intensive farming operations, the limits must be raised in order to realistically meet the needs of those seeking financing through the Guaranteed Loan Program. For example, in my home state of Mississippi, poultry is a growing industry. In the early 1980's a typical poultry house cost approximately $65,000. Today the same poultry house can cost up to $125,000. However, most banks will not finance a beginning poultry farm with less than four poultry houses. That makes the initial costs $500,000. It is easy to see that a minimum of four poultry houses at a cost of $125,000 per house exceeds the farm ownership cap level of $300,000 in the Guaranteed Loan Program. This is just one example of how the upper limits on loans can eliminate qualified applicants. This type of problem exists throughout the entire agricultural community, not just the poultry industry. 
To address this problem, I am introducing the Family Farm Credit Opportunity Act of 1998 which would raise the cap limits on both the farm ownership loan and the operating loan to $600,000. 
Mr. President, this is the companion bill to the one introduced by Representative Chip Pickering from Mississippi. He saw a problem and he has proposed a responsible fix. The poultry example displays how much agriculture has changed since the caps were last amended twenty years ago. In fact, while the increase in the cap limits may seem substantial at first, neither increase reflects the increase just caused by inflation. We should at least keep up with inflation for a program that has served as a vehicle of opportunity for the small family farmer. In today's budget-minded era, I believe we must find solutions that will not only correct problems that have 
been developing over the years, but find solutions at a relatively low cost to the taxpayer. That is why my bill increases the cap limits to specific amounts ($600,000) for the coming year, but also includes a provision to index both caps for inflation beginning in year two. This last provision will allow the caps to automatically adjust for inflation, which will provide a long-term fix to assure that the family farm does not again outgrow the upper limits of the farm ownership loan or the operating loan over time. 
I would like to point out that my bill will not guarantee acceptance of applications submitted to the FSA. Farmers would still have to go through the vigorous application process, but if the individual is eligible and accepted he or she would have the opportunity to receive adequate financing through a farm ownership or operating loan. 
Mr. President, we must preserve the family farm and continue America's tradition of promoting family farmers. Congress must provide a mechanism which enables family farmers to receive the necessary funds for ownership and operation of a farming business. 
Congress appropriates money for the FSA Guarantee Loan Program each year. Congress should put this money to its best and most efficient use. We should take a step back and take a good look at what a family farmer in 1997 really is? It is not the 1978 farmer with 1978 costs. Of course these programs should be run as efficiently as possible. 
Mr. President, as for the `family farmer,' they still exist and are successful, but they aren't the same as they were 20 years ago. Why? Well, let's look at some of the changes that have occurred over this period. 
First of all, markets have become global. Not only do our farmers have to compete with each other, but also with farmers around the world--farmers in China, Japan, Russia, Canada, Mexico just to name a few. Technology and research have both been overwhelmingly successful in allowing America to increase its production with less land. We are now able to idle environmentally sensitive land that is less productive and therefore ensure that we never revert back to the `Dust Bowl' days of the 1930's. Today farmers live in a capital intensive world. In fact, we cannot talk about agriculture today without mentioning how the industry has drastically shifted from a labor-intensive industry to an industry dominated by capital. 
Twenty years ago, who could have imagined that farmers would be using satellites to level their land or to tell them exactly where chemical applications are needed? Who could have imagined that biotechnology would yield such complex seed developments? 
Who could have imagined that farmers would have the technology to so closely monitor the growth of animals or that farmers would have the ability to specifically and scientifically regulate diets in order to achieve faster growth with less fat? 
Mr. President my point is that agriculture has changed and so has the family farmer. The Guaranteed Loan Program was designed to help the family farmer. Let's make sure it is big enough to do just that. In order to continue this goal, we must address the needs of today, not of 1978 by providing the capital necessary to compete and be successful in 1998. 
The family farmer is a larger operator relative to 1978 standards. We need new cap limits that reflect this change. 
Mr. President, I want to truly help the family farmer. Mr. President, Mr. Pickering, my colleague in the House wants to truly help the family farmer. 
Let's fix a program that has been successful in the past in helping this critical sector of our country. Let us not stop the progress of our family farmers. Congress should not deny any eligible person in our nation the opportunity to own and operate a family farm in order to pursue their idea of the American dream.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I would like to officially notify the Presiding Officer on a change in the status of the nomination that was to have been debated today, that being the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson. The nominee has written the President of the United States asking her nomination be withdrawn. 
It is my understanding the President has withdrawn her nomination and, therefore, the Senate will not be conducting a rollcall vote relative to her nomination tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. 
Again, it is my hope the Senate can consider today the resolution relative to human rights in Kosovo and conduct a vote regarding that resolution at 5:30 p.m. I understand there may be some objection to bringing up that resolution, but I cannot understand why any Senator would object to a timely consideration of the human rights considerations with regard to what has been happening in Kosovo. At the appropriate time, when we can get an agreement on the wording of the resolution, it will be my intent to bring it to the floor. If some Senator objects, he or she will have to appear and do so. 
If not, the Senate should be prepared to consider the nomination of Susan Graber to be a circuit judge, with that vote occurring at 5:30 p.m. today. Susan Graber is a nominee from the State of Oregon to be on the circuit court in that region.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, back to the withdrawal of the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson, I note that this is at her request in writing, and the President has, therefore, officially withdrawn her nomination. I think it is the right decision on the part of the nominee, and I think certainly it is the right decision for the President to accept that withdrawal and notify the Senate. This nominee had been given a considerable amount of time to clarify the record with regard to the objections that have been heard by the district attorney in the Philadelphia region in which this judge would have resided, and also from the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. Clearly, this nomination was in jeopardy. It probably would have been defeated. I think that would have been the right vote. All concerned have been spared further problems by this withdrawal. So, I am pleased that the nomination has been withdrawn.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 12 noon. At noon, the Senate will proceed to executive session to begin up to 6 hours of debate on the nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be a district judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, with a vote occurring on or in relation to that nomination on Tuesday at approximately 2:15. As was announced on Friday, we do expect to have at least one rollcall vote today beginning at approximately 5:30. We will be voting on an Executive Calendar nomination or on a Kosovo resolution if language can be worked out. I understand the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, is working on that with the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. We hope they will get the language worked out so that we can have discussion and, hopefully, a vote on that important resolution. I think it is timely. As always, we will alert Members as to precisely when that vote is scheduled for and what it will be on. 
Today, with regard to the Massiah-Jackson nomination, there are up to 6 hours of debate and 3 hours and 15 minutes on Tuesday. Following that debate, at 12:15, the Senate will proceed to a vote on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill. Therefore, Senators can expect at least one vote today at approximately 5:30, as well as a vote on Tuesday, at 12:15 on cloture on the motion to proceed to Coverdell, and then the vote on the Massiah-Jackson nomination. 
We are still hoping to clear for passage the Texas low-level waste legislation and the international shipping bill. Senators can therefore expect that to come up. Once we can get an agreement worked out, I think, on the low-level waste issue, hopefully the vote will not be a rollcall vote and it can be worked out and we can have a voice vote. Also, the shipping bill has been through a long process over the last 2 years. Senators on both sides of the aisle have worked on that important issue. Senator Gorton has indicated he would have just one amendment and he would agree to a 1-hour time agreement. But that bill is being held up now by, I believe, the Senator from Illinois because of some judicial nominations. Perhaps that can be worked out some way this week. 
When you consider the nominations that will be voted on this week, the possibility of the low-level waste legislation and international shipping, as well as the Coverdell A+ education bill, we are going to have a busy week. If we can finish the Coverdell A+ issue without filibusters on the motion to proceed, as well as going to the substance of the bill, instead of just being able to get started on it Thursday, then we can go to NATO enlargement. If we don't get some cooperation on the education bill, which is very important for families and children in America and their education needs, then that will push off the NATO enlargement bill until sometime next week. 
Now, the Appropriations Committee is scheduled to mark up the two supplemental appropriations bills beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. So we will have one or both of those available as soon as the House acts, although that could still be a couple of weeks, as I understand it. We will be ready to go in the Senate. The Budget Committee is marking up the first concurrent budget resolution on Tuesday as well. So we can expect those two issues also to come up within the next 2 weeks, or certainly before we go out for the Easter recess. 
Mr. President, I am looking forward to cooperation this week and a very productive week on behalf of the American people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:20 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session, with 10 minutes of time to be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and an immediate vote then occur after that time on the confirmation of the nomination of Executive Calendar No. 530, which is Susan Graber, of Oregon, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. I further ask unanimous consent that following the vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and that the Senate then return to legislative session.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to Calendar No. 227, H.R. 2646, the education individual retirement accounts bill, and it be considered under the following agreement. 
Before I make this request, I do want to say again how much I appreciate all the cooperation we had on the ISTEA, bill. I think it is an example of what we can do when we work together on important legislation in a bipartisan way, and also across the aisle, the bipartisan support we had on the China human rights resolution, and on the resolution naming Saddam Hussein as a war criminal. 
This has been a very productive week. I hope we can find a way to do the same thing again next week. I would like for us to find a way to consider in the fairest possible procedure this very important education bill, the Coverdell A+ bill which does include, in addition to the Coverdell A+ provisions with regard to saving for your children's education, a special provision for a prepaid tuition deduction, and for a deduction of graduate education expenses. Those last two items were requested by a bipartisan group. We have other important matters that I believe will be bipartisan, including dealing with NATO enlargement. So I hope we can find a way to come to an agreement on how to proceed on these bills. 
So I would like to now go through the agreement that I have been seeking. I understand that Senator Durbin will have some reaction once I get to the end of this. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the reporting of the bill by the clerk, the chairman of the Finance Committee be recognized to send an amendment to the desk reflecting the Finance Committee action on the Coverdell bill. I further ask unanimous consent that following the ascertaining of this consent, Senator Daschle be recognized to offer his alternative amendment--I understand he had been working on a substitute; and I thought it was a good way to start off the debate to have the minority offer their alternative amendment--and that no other amendments be in order prior to a vote on or in relation to the Daschle amendment. 
I further ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to send a cloture motion to the desk to the Finance Committee amendment and that the cloture vote occur on the committee amendment at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after notification and consultation with the minority leader, but not before the vote in relation to the Daschle amendment. So the cloture motion would not even be filed under this request until after the Daschle substitute had been considered and dealt with by a vote. 
I further ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived and that first-degree amendments be filed 1 hour after the cloture vote, with second-degree amendments to be filed within 24 hours of the cloture vote. 
Before the Chair puts the question to the Senate, let me summarize this consent, which I believe is fair and provides for an orderly consideration of the education A+ bill. 
The agreement, if agreed to, is that the Senate would now begin consideration of this bill. The chairman of the Finance Committee would immediately be recognized to offer the Finance Committee action. Then Senator Daschle would offer his substitute, whatever version that he would like to have, of the legislation. We would have an agreed-to period of debate. And then we would have a vote, without any encumbrance, on that amendment. 
Then following that vote, we would have a cloture vote, and then the time for that would be determined by mutual agreement. If cloture should be invoked, the remainder of the consideration of the bill would be governed under the provisions of Rule XXII. If cloture is not invoked, the bill would be open to further amendments, with no limitation as to time or subject matter. 
If this agreement is agreed to by the Senate, I would, of course, give Members ample notification as to when the two votes would occur, those being a vote with respect to the Daschle amendment and the cloture vote. 
So I will now yield the floor for the Chair to put the question on this. I urge all my colleagues to agree to this.

Mr. LOTT. I do want to say to the Senator from Illinois, I am very much aware of these two judicial nominations. As I promised I would do yesterday, I did talk to Senators from our side of the aisle that have some objections. It goes back to last year. The Senator knows all the details. I appreciate the fact that he did not object to judges that the administration sent here from Texas earlier this week, and I hope that we can continue to work to see if some agreement can be worked out as to how and when they might be considered. 
And I know that the Senator, perhaps, has some objection to us proceeding with the ocean shipping legislation; we have worked out an agreement on how to proceed on that. This is a bill we have been working on for a couple of years, in a bipartisan way, again. Senator Breaux from Louisiana has been involved; Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who has some objections and has an amendment on it; and also, of course, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is the chairman of the subcommittee. 
You have a bill that you have a hold on. Am I clear that you are objecting to proceeding with this agreement because of the hold on the two Illinois judges? Or are you objecting on behalf of the minority leader or the minority? I don't think you want to leave the impression that you are objecting to this bill because of a couple of judicial nominations that have not yet been moved. Is that accurate?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret the objection. I think this agreement is immensely fair and provides for an orderly process, again, for this very important legislation. 
American people care about education in this country. When I go around this country and back to my own State, other than being worried about crime and being safe in their schools, having safety in their neighborhood, safety in the schools and education are right at the top. People are saying, Why is elementary and secondary education not working in America? We are spending more and more money, and the grades are going down. Why is higher education in America the best in the world and elementary and secondary ranks something like 19th in the world? They want better quality education, they want more choice in education, they want safer schools, and they want zero tolerance for drugs in schools. 
This is the first opportunity this year where we have a chance to really begin to move toward that by allowing people--parents, and grandparents, and people that want to provide for scholarships to deserving children--to give an opportunity to choose a different school or get a computer for an eighth grader or tutoring for a fourth grader. I know it will have bipartisan support. I have to admit that Senator Torricelli has been very helpful to the Senator from Georgia in moving this legislation forward. 
So as a result of the objection, then, I have no option but to go ahead and move toward the calling of the bill and then filing a cloture motion. I want the American people to know that the objection is to the motion to proceed, not even on the bill, to even proceed with this very, very important education legislation. 
I am not sure, really, that I understand why there is this objection. I do think it is unfortunate. But at this point we will start the process, and I will file the cloture motion at this time. I must also note, though, that it does tend to delay legislation. There are those that are going to say, Why doesn't the Congress do more? Well, this is exhibit A, because it has gotten to where in the Senate we have to file cloture to stop a filibuster on almost every bill. 
This month, we need to complete this education bill, take up the NATO enlargement legislation, take up a budget resolution so we can get it done before April 15--which is what the law requires, I might add--deal with the supplemental appropriations request for natural disasters in this country, the cost for our defense, and for Bosnia and Iraq, how do we deal with IMF; we have to have, under the law, a vote on the Mexican decertification issue, again with relation to drugs; and we want to get IRS reform done before we leave to go home for the Easter recess. Every time something happens that delays another day, it shoves all of this down the line. 
I must add, I am being asked by Senators like Moynihan of New York and Smith of New Hampshire to delay the NATO enlargement until at least after the Easter recess or maybe even until June. Any time a Senator of either party makes that kind of request to the majority leader, you have to think about it, you have to take their request in consideration--have they had enough time? Will more time be helpful in the discourse? I personally think we should go forward with the debate. I will give the details why I think that later on, but this delay affects everything else down the line.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional dedication, vision, and public service of Mr. George T. Singley, III. He is retiring after 33 years of military and civilian service in the Department of Defense, most recently, as Acting Director of Defense Research and Engineering [DDR&E]. A native of Delaware, and a long time Virginia resident, Mr. Singley is a nationally and internationally renowned technology leader. As both Deputy and Acting Director of Defense Research and Engineering, he has guided our nation's Science and Technology (S&T) defense effort for several years. 
His extraordinary vision and strong leadership have dramatically enhanced the defense S&T program. This contribution significantly improved our efforts to field a force whose technological superiority remains unchallenged, now, and well into the next century. He has focused the defense S&T program on developing capabilities necessary to achieve the goals of future joint warfighting, as expressed in the Chairman's Joint Vision 2010. 
Before coming to DDR&E, Mr. Singley served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research and Technology. He was responsible for the Army's entire S&T program. This program, spanning 21 laboratories and centers with approximately 10,000 scientists/engineers had an annual budget of $1.4 billion. Mr. Singley also was the chief scientist to both the Secretary of the Army and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and Acquisition. As a Program Execution Officer in the Army, he led five helicopter program offices. He pioneered the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program, better known as Comanche, which became the Army's first stealth helicopter program. A truly remarkable career. 
Mr. Singley is Chairman of the Executive Board of the American Helicopter Society. He served as their President from May 1996 through April 1997. He is a past Vice President of the Army Aviation Association of America, and a member of the Association of the United States Army. His numerous awards include: 
Meritorious Executive Presidential Rank Award (twice); 
Secretary of Defense Meritorious Civilian Service Awards; 
Secretary of Defense Award for Excellence; 
Distinguished Executive Presidential Rank Award; 
American Defense Preparedness Association Firepower Award; 
University of Delaware College Distinguished Engineering Alumnus; 
Exceptional Civilian Service Award; 
Meritorious Civilian Service (twice); 
Department of Army Staff Badge; and 
American Helicopter Society Grover S. Bell Award for Rotorcraft Research; 
He has more than 20 technical publications and numerous technical articles to credit. 
I know that Mr. Singley's wife Maxine, and his children, George, Kristine, and Dean, and the Department of Defense are proud of his accomplishments. My colleagues join me in wishing George `fair winds and following seas' as he pursues many new and exciting challenges in the private sector. The Nation and our military are indebted to you for your many years of distinguished service.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, did an outstanding job in managing this legislation. I think it is quite an achievement that actually in about 9 days we were able to get this bill through the Senate. 
There were some bumps along the way, but we were able to work them out without acrimony or regional bias. I think really they did a magnificent job. The Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, worked very closely with the chairman of the committee, but it took cooperation with Senator Warner of the subcommittee, and Senator Gramm was involved in some key negotiations, and obviously Senator Byrd, who always provides direction and leadership that is very important. 
To all the members of the committee, I thank you for this. I think the Senate has really provided leadership and given a marker to our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to take up this important legislation, get it to conference, and get it agreed to by May 1, when the extension will expire. 
So I think this was certainly a good couple of weeks' work, and I thank the Senate for its cooperation. This can be an example, I hope, of what we can do on other bills, how we can work together and work out problems that appear to be insurmountable. If we had taken this legislation up the first week we were back, it would probably have been a lot messier and we might not have come to the good result that we have fashioned here in this bill. So thanks to one and all. I appreciate it very much. 
I mentioned Senator Baucus. He has certainly been a very important part of this. 
Would the distinguished Democratic leader like to comment at this point?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Senator Burns for his efforts in obtaining passage of the Utility Service Vehicle amendment to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. Senator Burns' support and leadership on this issue has been instrumental in reaching an important compromise that provides state and local officials with much needed flexibility in emergency situations. Essentially, the emergency can be dealt with at the discretion of the appropriate local official who has first hand expertise in understanding the needs of their communities. More importantly, this clarification enhances public safety. It is our hope that the U.S. Department of Transportation will take advantage of the flexibility provided by this amendment and fully implement the transportation pilot programs authorized by this legislation. Again, I want to commend Senator Burns for his efforts in coordinating the bipartisan compromise needed to ensure that the public's well-being in emergency situations is fully protected.

I also appreciate the fact that he is willing to bring it up in such a fashion where he can make this points and we can move on to a vote on a motion to table. A number of Senators on both sides could come over and speak at great length on this subject. But in the interest of trying to begin to move toward a conclusion and getting within, hopefully, a short period of time, the final 
votes before we would have the cloture vote so we can see what is exactly left to be done on this bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for raising this important issue on the ISTEA bill. I completely agree with his statement about the need to reform the NEPA review process as it pertains to transportation projects. In fact, the National Environmental Policy Act as a whole needs to be looked at for possible improvements. I fully support the goals and intent behind NEPA, but I also believe that States are capable of carrying out NEPA's requirements when planning and reviewing various transportation projects within their borders. 
While I agree with my friend that S. 1173 makes good progress toward streamlining the environmental review process, I share his concerns that it might not go far enough in resolving this problem. It is clear we need a more effective environmental coordination process that results in less staff time and expense for all the agencies and stakeholders in the NEPA process. 
If we are successful in this effort, we will hopefully reduce the time it now takes in reaching final decisions and receiving project approvals and permits, saving resources and lives. Therefore, I congratulate my colleague on his efforts thus far and encourage him to pursue additional improvements to the current NEPA review process. At this time, Mr. President, I yield back to my friend from New Hampshire.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement on March 10, I will ask the clerk to report the cloture motion. But before he does that, I want to announce to all Senators that this will trigger the cloture vote that was postponed from Monday's session of the Senate. Assuming cloture is invoked then, all Senators will have an additional 4 hours to file with the clerk any additional first-degree amendments. Due to the lateness of the hour, we will amend the request in the closing remarks to reflect a new time of 10 a.m. tomorrow morning for the deadline on filing the amendments. I thank all Senators for their cooperation, and I particularly congratulate and thank the Senators managing the bill, Senators Chafee and Baucus. They have made good progress. I think maybe when we get this cloture vote, we can begin to see what amendments we have to consider and we can begin to bring this to closure. 
This will be the last vote of the evening. There will be another vote in the morning. This one will be on the McCain amendment, probably sometime between 10:30 and 11 o'clock. 
Therefore, I make that request.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate, as I said, will be in morning business for 2 hours because of requests we have had from Senators to speak, and also so some drafting can be done with regard to an amendment that will be offered later on in the day. At 11, the Senate will go back to the highway bill. It is hoped that the donor amendment will be offered at 11 a.m., to be followed by the finance title. Following the adoption of the Finance Committee title, it will be the majority leader's intention--and I have consulted with the minority leader and he agrees--that we should move to the cloture vote that had been postponed by consent from Monday afternoon. So we could have the three issues dealt with then in the morning: the donor amendment, the Finance Committee title, and then a cloture vote. 
In order to ever get to a conclusion on this legislation, we do need the cloture so we can identify what amendments are serious and are pending out there. We are still hopeful we can complete this legislation either Wednesday at some point or Thursday--certainly this week. But we will not have a true feel of what the prospects are on that until we get a cloture vote and we identify the amendments that are then pending that are serious. So Members should anticipate a busy day voting tomorrow, with votes all during the day, in the afternoon and into the early evening with the probability of at least three votes, and it could be four or five before the day is out.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today I have the pleasure to announce that Senator Susan Collins of the great State of Maine, the current Presiding Officer, is the latest recipient of the prestigious Golden Gavel Award. 
Since the 1960s, Senators who preside over the Senate in excess of 100 hours are recognized with the Golden Gavel. The Golden Gavel has long served as a symbol of appreciation for time these dedicated Senators contribute to presiding over the U.S. Senate--a privileged and important duty. 
With respect to this particular Presiding Officer, two words describe Senator Collins as she presides over this Chamber: reliable and punctual. Senator Collins takes her presiding responsibilities seriously and is someone who can always be counted on to serve. We now take the opportunity to extend our thanks to her for her commitment to the fine way in which she presides. 
I must say, she has received one of the highest compliments that can be received from the Senate itself. Senator Byrd has commented about what a good job she does in the chair and that she presides fairly and she pays attention to what the Senators are saying. 
I congratulate her and thank her on behalf of the U.S. Senate for her time.

Mr. LOTT. Now, to explain briefly just what we have done, and it is with the concurrence of the Democratic leader and the managers of the legislation. I do feel that we should get cloture. We should begin to move toward a defined list of amendments and try to bring this very important legislation to a conclusion. 
But the biggest complicating factor we have right now is that the titles from the Banking Committee and Finance Committee have not been offered and have not been adopted. I hope now that the two chairmen of those committees will be prepared, later on today or tomorrow, to have those titles included and will give the managers more time to work with Senators who still have some questions that need to be answered. So it seemed, after talking with Senator Daschle, Senator Baucus, and Senator Chafee that it was the proper thing to do at this time. 
But let me say, again, we need to begin to think about what are the important amendments; how do we bring this matter to a conclusion. I had indicated last week that it might be necessary, if we cannot find some way to begin to bring it to a close by Wednesday, for us to begin to think about Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday sessions. I know that a lot of Senators have conflicts and would prefer that we not do it that way. But we will need everybody's cooperation in order to avoid that. 
This is Monday. I have faith that we are going to make progress this afternoon and tomorrow. And we will do another assessment then about exactly when we have this cloture vote. I remind Senators that we do have a recorded vote scheduled at 5:30, after 20 minutes of debate on the Intelligence Disclosure Act. 
I yield the floor, Madam President. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 1 p.m. At 1 p.m., under a previous unanimous consent agreement, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation, which is the surface transportation bill. As a reminder to all Senators, all first-degree amendments must be filed by 1 p.m. this afternoon, and all second-degree amendments must be filed by 5 p.m. today, as under the previous order. We need to find out what amendments are pending out there, make a list, and then make some determination as to how they can be brought up and begin to move toward a conclusion of this very important legislation. 
It is hoped that we will be able to consider some of the numerous amendments which have been offered and filed in regard to the surface transportation bill throughout today's session. So, if Senators do have some amendments that they think perhaps can be debated briefly and maybe accepted or put in some sequence to be voted on, that will certainly help us move the bill along. 
Also, under a previous unanimous consent agreement, at 5:10 p.m., the Senate will set aside the ISTEA legislation and begin 20 minutes of debate on S. 1668, the intelligence disclosure bill. At 5:30 p.m., the Senate will proceed to a vote on the cloture motion on the modified substitute amendment to the ISTEA bill, to be followed by a vote on the intelligence disclosure bill. Therefore, the first vote today will occur probably in back-to-back fashion at 5:30. 
In addition, I hope the Senate can work out some sort of consent to deal with the transit provision and the Finance Committee provision, both of which need to be offered to the pending highway bill. So we will be working with Chairman Roth and Chairman D'Amato on those provisions as to how we can get them up and have them considered so that those concerns by Senators who will be affected by these provisions can be taken care of. I will be working with the minority leader throughout the day in an effort to resolve these two important titles and will update the Senate as to progress later on today. 
Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Wyoming wishes to speak momentarily. But for now, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, it has already been announced informally that that is the last vote of the day. I thank the managers of the very important surface transportation legislation for their efforts this week. I think some good progress has been made. Several amendments have been disposed of. This was one that required some 8 hours, I believe, of debate. 
Now that we have voted on that, we want to continue to make progress to complete this legislation. I think Senators on both sides believe that good progress has been made. I really appreciate, once again, the effort of Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Byrd, Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm and others, in coming up with the formula change that I think generally is agreed to on both sides of the aisle. But we need to begin to think now about how we conclude this so we can deal with the other very important issues that are awaiting, including the NATO enlargement issue and the Coverdell A-plus education issue. We have a couple other bills we are looking at considering on Monday, including possibly a resolution with regard to Saddam Hussein being a war criminal, and an intelligence bill. 
But at the request of the chairman and the ranking member of the Environment Committee, our respective hotlines have asked that all Senators come forward with their amendments. 
We are developing a list and we need to know the ones that are serious. I know there are a lot of them out there still that Senators are contemplating offering, but we need to begin identifying the ones that really are serious. For instance, the list we have from the hot line is 250 amendments, with two Members on one side of the aisle having 100 amendments; just two Senators have 100 amendments. I must say, on our side of the aisle, there are 75 amendments. That is ridiculous. We need to identify the ones that we really are going to offer. We need cooperation in order to get that done. 
We have been considering the bill really since the last session. Everybody has had a chance in the committee. Last year, we spent about 2 weeks talking about it. We had four cloture votes. We have had a total of 14 days on it. 
There are several other issues that are important that we are going to have come up and will vote on, but I think now we need to get serious about bringing this to a conclusion. After looking at the list of amendments and consulting with the Democratic leader, I think we do need to go ahead and get a cloture vote so that we can eliminate the amendments that are not related directly to this bill and then begin to narrow the list.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have Senators interested on the floor. 
Once again, I regret having to address the Senate regarding the lack of cooperation that we have been getting on the part of some Members with respect to trying to find a way to bring the highway bill to a close. We need to do that. I think Senators have had enough time to analyze what is in the bill and offer amendments during the week. We debated it last year, and even with the cloture vote, we still would have a considerable amount of time next week to consider it and have relevant amendments in order. 
Senator Daschle, for instance, this morning said: 
This is the time to move this legislation forward. I am hopeful that we can have a good debate on other amendments on Monday and have that vote on cloture on Monday night so that we can complete our work some time by the middle of the week. 
That is Senator Daschle's comments. I share the sentiment that he expressed and thought all Members were in agreement with regard to the fact that the Senate needs to complete action on this bill as soon as possible in order to go to other pending bills. 
In order to achieve that goal, a successful cloture vote must occur in order for the managers to ascertain their remaining work load, what amendments they will have to deal with, and know what time they are talking about. 
As I discussed with the minority leader, and with Senator Harkin, there are two additional issues, however, that the Senate must consider prior to the passage that are vital to the bill. Those are the Banking Committee transit title and the Finance Committee title. It was my understanding we would make other arrangements for consideration of those two issues outside the parameters of rule XXII. 
With that in mind, I now propound a unanimous-consent request that is necessary to do that. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the invoking of cloture on the Chafee substitute the Banking Committee title and the Finance Committee title, and relevant amendments thereto, still be in order.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the comments of the Senator from Michigan, first of all, I don't think you can find a Senator more sympathetic to donor States' concerns and desires than this Senator. My State has been very badly underfunded and mistreated over many, many years on a lot of things but on the highway trust fund formula, in particular. 
We have been getting much less than an 85 percent return on the dollar here. We are the poorest State in the Nation, a big State, so don't get me started on donor States. I am sympathetic with what the Senator is saying. 
I know he will continue to work with the chairman and the ranking member to see if there is a way to work this out without causing a blowout on the other side. This is a very delicately balanced bill. None of us is totally 100 percent happy with it. There are a number of things that came out of the committee that I just detest, but I realize there has to be a balance. There has to be a blend between regions of the country--big States, small States, donor States, donee--and I think they have done about as good as they could to this point. 
I know you will work with Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus to see if your concerns can be worked out, but also I think that most of the amendments that you might want to offer to help solve your problem really would be available. Now, maybe not every one that you can think of--and I know you don't want to give up anything, but I think you also understand, as the majority leader, this tends to make people focus. We kind of gloated all week; the managers are doing the best they can and they made some good progress. The Senate really hasn't been paying attention. Just now they are beginning to say, `Wait, what does this mean, what exactly do I get--90.07 or do I get 91.2 cents back on a dollar?' 
So, by doing what I have done, this tends to make people say, OK, the train is leaving. It also limits the debate. If we get cloture, in 30 hours we are finished with this bill. So I understand what you are doing, and I hope you understand what I am doing. Try to work it out if you can. 
I urge all Senators to vote for cloture so we can begin to move toward bringing this to closure. I think it will put pressure on the other body to act. Remember, funds are going to be running out on May 1. I have made extra efforts and have met with a lot of Senators to try to get this bill done because I don't want to be blamed when May 1 comes. I don't think anybody would want to do that. We better find a way to make this happen. 
The cloture vote will occur at 5:30 on Monday. I hope Senators will vote for cloture. I will continue to try to obtain a consent that allows the Senate to consider these two issues in a fair and orderly fashion. And, certainly, on Monday when we are back, we will get right back to this and see if we can move it along.

Hopefully, we can work their concerns out, and then we would be able to get permission to add the Banking and Finance Committee provisions at that point. But that might be Wednesday of next week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning I am very pleased to join Senator Frist of Tennessee, who is an outstanding Senator, and also a doctor, who has been very helpful to me, and a lot of Senators, since he joined this body, in introducing legislation entitled `The Women's Health Research and Prevention Act.' 
The bill authorizes and reauthorizes a collection of first-class research and prevention programs in the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women between the ages of 40 and 55. About one out of every eight women in the United States will, unfortunately, develop breast cancer during their lifetime. And so the Frist-Lott bill reauthorizes breast and ovarian cancer research and education programs at NIH. 
Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile and more likely to break. My wife is beginning to confront this particular problem. As women age, they lose bone mass and are at risk of debilitating accidents such as fractures. This bill extends osteoporosis research and education programs at NIH. 
Women's health, though, means more than just health issues specific to women. Heart disease, for instance, the No. 1 killer in the U.S. of women, of course, also affects men in great numbers. Hypertension, a leading cause of heart disease, is two to three times more common in women than in men. 
In addition to these three key research areas, our bill continues programs in the Centers for Disease Control, including the National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Early Detection Program for breast and cervical cancer. 
Senator Frist, the Senate's only doctor, and an outstanding heart surgeon himself, provided the details of the bill. Senator Frist is chairman of the Senate Public Health Subcommittee of the Senate Labor Committee, and is one of the Senate's key leaders on all of our health issues. 
I am pleased that he is also serving on our Medicare commission that had its first meeting yesterday, including a meeting with the President. 
I have often turned to him for advice and guidance on health matters, and will continue to do so in the future. I believe that just this morning Senator Frist attended a meeting regarding Medicare, and that will be helpful in this effort. I know it will be a bipartisan effort. 
I encourage colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this important legislation. 
This morning I was made aware that Senator Mack is a cosponsor, and Senator D'Amato. We are inviting all Members to join us in this very serious and very important issue that we need to act on in order to reauthorize some of these programs and authorize new ones. 
I thank Senator Frist for his leadership in this area, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, federal bureaucrats issued thousands of new rules and regulations last year, adding billions to the regulatory costs already imposed on American businesses and the economy. Whether you realize it or not, almost every aspect of our daily existence is regulated in some way by the government. 
That is not to say that the government should not regulate when it's necessary to protect human health and the environment. However, we would all agree that there are reasonable limits to how much protection we really need. For instance, cars are dangerous vehicles. If not properly operated, they can cause serious injury or death. It is certainly acceptable for the government to issue regulations ensuring that a vehicle is able to withstand anticipated impacts. But should we outlaw cars simply because improper operation can lead to death? Of course not. We all can see that the benefits of being able to drive a car far outweigh any risk of death. 
Mr. President, how do we separate true risks from inflated risks? How do we parcel out real problems from those created by fear or misinformation? How do we rank risks so that we attend to the most pressing ones first? 
I believe that the solution is to strengthen the risk assessment portion of the current federal law. It is about time that federal agencies focused on finding solutions to problems that present real risks, risks that are based on sound science. For too long, agencies have been allowed to use scant science and political windsocks to determine what should be considered a risk to human health or the environment. From an overblown analysis of risk comes irrational and ineffective solutions--some even more harmful than the basic problem. 
That is why I am introducing the Risk Assessment Improvement Act. 
Before an agency can issue a rule or carry out a cost/benefit analysis, it must determine that there is indeed a risk. Since risk assessment is the first threshold for issuing regulations, I believe that a targeted bill like this one would address the most important part of regulatory reform. 
Simply put, Mr. President, this bill ensures that there is no ambiguity about whether or not there is a risk. By requiring rulemaking agencies to follow a prescribed and stringent set of evaluations, the bill strengthens the current method of evaluating risk. In addition, the Risk Assessment Improvement Act states that risks must be reviewed in light of other risks. In other words, it would require agencies to rank risks from least to most severe, guaranteeing that the most serious ones are addressed first. This is not only smart regulatory and health policy, it is smart fiscal policy. We will be better able to allocate federal resources if we know ahead of time which risks are most pressing. 
I know that Senator Thompson has done his best to assemble a comprehensive regulatory reform package, and I certainly commend his efforts. But a comprehensive approach offers many complexities, both substantively and procedurally. That is why I am introducing a bill to deal with just one element of the regulatory process--risk. 
If you take a look at the language of my bill, you will find that it is identical to that in the risk assessment title of the original Levin-Thompson bill. The reason for this is simple: their language is both strong and well written. And it gets the job done. I hope that I can count on Senators Thompson and Levin's support in moving the bill through the Government Affairs Committee. 
In closing, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking an incremental and doable step towards real regulatory reform by supporting the Risk Assessment Improvement Act.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 12 noon on Monday, March 9, and immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and the Senate begin a period for the transaction of morning business, with the time equally divided between the two leaders. 
I also ask consent that at the hour of 1 p.m. on Monday, the Senate resume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation.

Mr. LOTT. In conjunction with the previous consent agreements, then, on Monday the Senate will be in for a period of morning business from 12 to 1 p.m. At 1 o'clock, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA bill. It is hoped the Senate will be able to consider some of the numerous amendments which have been offered and filed in regard to this legislation throughout Monday's session. And then, at 5:10 p.m., the Senate will set aside the legislation and have 20 minutes of debate on the intelligence disclosure bill. Under the previous order, at 5:30 p.m. the Senate will proceed to a vote on the cloture motion on the modified substitute amendment to S. 1173, followed by a vote on the intelligence disclosure bill. 
So, there will more than likely be two rollcall votes, back to back, on Monday, beginning at 5:30.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget Office delivered its preliminary report on the President's budget proposal. The news is both astonishing and disappointing. It raises the most serious questions about the President's credibility when dealing with the budget. 
Five weeks ago, in his State of the Union address, the President made a promise to the American people. I want to quote from his speech. The President asked and answered a very important question. He said: 
What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple, four-word answer: Save Social Security first. 
I thought to myself, that sounded like a pretty good idea. But that's not what the President's budget does. The President's budget spends $43 billion of the projected future surpluses. 
I invite my colleagues to look at the CBO report. It is right on page 1 of that report: 
The policies outlined in the President's budget will decrease the surplus in each year from 1999 through 2003. 
While the President says he wants to save Social Security first, instead, his budget spends the surplus first. Mr. President, what ever happened to preserving 100 percent of the surplus for this purpose? To me, 100 percent means reserving all of it, not all of it except $43 billion that you want to spend. What happened to saving `every penny of any surplus until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen Social Security?' Does every penny mean every penny except $43 billion? 
There is some other bad news in this report as well. I will let the chairman of the Budget Committee provide more detail, but I want to give just two highlights. The President's budget spends so much money that it goes into the red in the year 2000. That's right, after all of our hard work last year to balance the budget, and with a lot of help from a growing, booming economy, the President now proposes to send us back into deficits again that soon. If you are following along in the CBO report, that, too, is on page 1 as well. We have not gotten into the rest of it. That is really a depressing thought to me. It took us almost 30 years to get big Government on the wagon, so to speak, and now the President wants us to steer back to the saloon for one more round of spending. 
There is one more point that means a lot to people around here. A critical part of last year's bipartisan budget agreement, which the Speaker and I forged with the cooperation of Democrats and the President, was the creation of caps on discretionary spending. CBO tells us that the President's budget will break those caps by $68 billion over the next 5 years. What good is a budget agreement if the President immediately proposes to violate it? What good is balancing the budget if the President proposes to spend his way back into deficit? And, most important, what good is it to promise that you are going to save Social Security first, when the budget you propose redirects $43 billion of that goal? The President sent us a budget 6 days after his promise to save Social Security first. It took only 6 days for that to fall by the wayside. I have to ask the question, what's next, Mr. President? 
I yield the floor and I yield 3 minutes of my leader time to the chairman of the Budget Committee.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration now of S. 1173, the ISTEA surface transportation reauthorization legislation. As under the consent agreement, the Senate will conclude 1 hour of debate on the DeWine-Lautenberg amendment regarding alcohol levels, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the DeWine-Lautenberg amendment at approximately 10:30 this morning. Following that vote, it's hoped that the Senate will be able to debate an amendment dealing with funding levels. In addition, this afternoon the Senate will hopefully debate an amendment to be offered by Senator McConnell. Therefore, Members should be prepared for votes throughout today's session. 
As a reminder to all Senators, the first rollcall vote today will occur at 10:30 a.m. 
I urge the Senate to work hard to make progress today. If we can have this debate and vote at 10:30 and go to the funding level resolution and hopefully find a way to complete that today and move on to the McConnell amendment and hopefully get to a vote on that, a great deal can be accomplished today and we can move the bill along considerably. 
Mr. President, I would like to yield myself leader time so that I may comment on the Lautenberg amendment briefly.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I understand the amendment, it would require States to enact the .08 alcohol content legislation instead of the present, I think, .10 level of alcohol to be considered drunk. That has to be done by September 30, 2000. Noncompliant States would lose 5 percent of highway funding on October 1, 2000, and then 10 percent thereafter. Currently, 15 States already have the .08 level of alcohol content to be considered drunk in drunk driving cases. 
Mr. President, I think we should encourage people not to drink. We should encourage all people not to drink excessively. We should do all that we can to get the States to pass the lower level of .08. I support that. We need to combat the problem of drunken driving. 
I understand the tragedy and the ravages of people that drink and drive. My father was killed in just such an accident. So this is not an issue that I take lightly. But I will oppose this amendment. This is a typical Federal Government attitude--not to encourage you to do right, not to say if you do the right thing, there will be incentives in it for you; no; you do it our way, or we will punish you; you will lose funds if you don't do it the way we say. Some people say President Reagan did the same thing. Yes, and I opposed it then, too. 
I am very much opposed to alcoholism and drinking and driving. But for us to stand here and pontificate about how you must do it our way, that this is the solution, or we are going to take your funds away, what about poor States like mine where people are killed every week because of bad roads, potholes in the roads, dangerous bridges? What about safety? If a State, for whatever reason, by mistake or obviously for the wrong reasons, doesn't do it, we take a big chunk of money away from them. Is that going to save lives? No. As a matter of fact, it may lead to more lives being lost. 
So while I know this is well-intentioned, and while I support the intent or the goals of this legislation, the idea that we are going to punish States because you don't do it our way I think is the wrong thing to be doing. I hope my colleagues will think about this very, very seriously before they cast a vote in favor of this amendment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since the 1960s, the Senate has recognized those dedicated Members who preside over the Senate for 100 hours with the Golden Gavel Award. Today, we add to the list of Golden Gavel recipients the current Presiding Officer, Senator Pat Roberts of the great State of Kansas, whose presiding hours now total over 100 hours, effective as of today. 
I want to say this, too: I have found that, as Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts is reliable and enthusiastic. He maintains order, sometimes running the majority leader from the floor of the Senate Chamber if he insists on talking when not properly recognized. He maintains order with a firm hand, but, most importantly, he is consistently willing to come to the Chamber and preside over the activities here in this Chamber. He is able to handle problems that arise in an appropriate way and without hesitation. So it is with sincere appreciation that I announce the newest recipient of the Golden Gavel Award, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. 
I have already determined that when we have moments of really important legislation, and when rulings of the Chair are going to be necessary and need to be made rather quickly so we can complete the business of the day, we have a new suspect that can assume the position as Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts of Kansas. Thank you very much for the job you have done in helping us to preside and keep the Chamber in order. 
[Applause.]

We need to do those issues, plus the Coverdell A-plus education issue. There is no way we can do all of those in March without a much more aggressive schedule than we have had so far. So it is my intent to do that, and I believe I have the cooperation of the Democratic leader in that effort.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. At 2 p.m., the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation, which is the surface transportation authorization bill. 
As was mentioned on last Friday, many Members had lobbied for floor consideration of this very important legislation. I know that the chairman of the committee and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia had been urging that we move forward. Now we have the opportunity, but we are having difficulty getting Senators to come to the floor and offer amendments. We need those amendments to be offered today. I believe we have had one amendment that has been offered and accepted, but we need others. We need to make really good progress this week on this important legislation. Beginning on Wednesday or Thursday, we will also, hopefully, be able to take up the funding or financing amendments that may be offered. 
We do have some items--only a few--but we have some items left on the Executive Calendar that could be considered. Therefore, a rollcall vote is possible today. I had hoped that it would be on the bill itself. I understand now it may not be. So I am looking for an Executive Calendar nomination or two that might require a vote that we can take up. 
I want to make it clear to the Senators, once again, there will be votes on Mondays and there will be votes on Fridays so that we can get the ISTEA bill done and the other important legislation we must get done in March. 
Mr. President, I see Senator Kyl is here to seek recognition to talk on an issue that is very important to me and the country with regard to how we deal with the situation in Iraq. So I yield the floor at this time.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for an amendment to the Federal highway bill that is simple and straightforward. 
The amendment improves the environment and it saves federal highway dollars--two worthy goals. 
The amendment establishes a preference for the use of wetlands mitigation banks to offset impacts to wetlands caused by the construction of highways funded under the federal highway program. 
The amendment is not a mandate. It provides only that mitigation banking is the preferred alternative for mitigating wetlands impacts where there is a bank in the area of the highway project. 
The amendment is an incentive-based strategy for environmental protection that enjoys bipartisan support. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle know that this is the only real way to achieve compliance. 
The amendment is sponsored by my friends and colleagues Senators Christopher `Kit' Bond and John Breaux. 
Mitigation banking refers to a large wetlands restoration effort where a `bank' of wetlands, usually 100 acres or more, is undertaken to compensate in advance for future wetlands losses from nearby development. The best sites for restoration of wetlands are often lands that used to be wetlands but were drained in order to plant crops. Mitigation bankers take a number of steps, such as breaking up drainage tiles, in order to reintroduce water to the site. Sometimes mitigation bankers replant native species, but often existing seed banks revegetate the land naturally once the water has been restored. Before long, a large, fully functioning wetlands ecosystem has been reestablished. Under federal guidelines, `credits' are generated based on the acreage and quality of the restored wetlands. The credits may then be sold to those who must restore wetlands to make up for those they have been allowed to disturb in order to build their school, office park, or other nearby project. 
In the context of highway construction, mitigation banking works as follows: a state department of transportation building a highway project that affects wetlands near a mitigation bank may buy credits from the mitigation bank. The state DOT fulfills its mitigation requirement by purchasing sufficient credits from the bank to offset the loss of wetlands from the project, and the bank sponsor assumes full responsibility for maintaining the restored wetlands site. 
Of course, the current federal highway program already allows federal funds to be used to mitigate adverse effects on wetlands caused by highway construction. But small, isolated, on-site mitigation projects are expensive and costly to maintain given the many small wetlands affected by a typical new highway project. In contrast, mitigation banks consolidate small, isolated wetlands mitigation efforts into large, high quality, diverse wetlands habitat. As a result, mitigation banks provide greater environmental benefits than piecemeal mitigation. 
The Bond-Breaux amendment provides simply that mitigation banking will be the preferred alternative for wetlands mitigation efforts paid for with federal highway money where there is a bank in the area of a highway project. Banks must be approved under the federal guidance on mitigation banking. 
In addition to benefiting the environment, use of mitigation banks will save federal highway dollars that can be made available for more highway construction. Experience has clearly demonstrated that private mitigation bankers can restore high quality wetlands at significantly less cost than state departments of transportation, as my colleague from Missouri has pointed out. 
This amendment is supported by the Corps of Engineers, EPA, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, and numerous state departments of transportation. Even my own State of Mississippi believes this is a smart environmental idea and a smart highway idea. 
It doesn't surprise me that this amendment is sponsored by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, Senator Bond's creative mind has produced an innovative answer to this thorny environmental policy. All Americans know the value of wetlands and recognize the contributions of an effective transportation infrastructure. Mr. Bond has found a way to balance the problems and provide a smart solution. 
Mr. Bond has provided a win-win solution. His amendment encourages the investment of private sector resources and technology in wetlands restoration. It establishes a policy that rewards doing the right thing for the environment. I congratulate the Senator for his foresight, good judgment, and leadership. 
I am also not surprised to see the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Breaux, joining Senator Bond in sponsoring this amendment. I citizens of Louisiana know what wetlands are because most of their state is classified as one. They know this type of public policy is a smart way to do highway business. I also commend my friend from Louisiana for his leadership on this amendment. 
Mr. President, in closing, this is an excellent amendment that will save federal highway dollars, benefit the environment, and allow federal highway projects to go forward more quickly and with more certainty. It has my strong support, and deserves that of my colleagues.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 10 a.m. Following that, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation, which funds our Nation's surface transportation infrastructure. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to make good progress on this important legislation during today's session of the Senate. Therefore, Members with amendments to the legislation should contact the managers of the bill to schedule floor time. 
In addition, we may consider executive or legislative business cleared for floor action. I believe we cleared four items off the Executive Calendar last night. So, rollcall votes are still possible in today's session, but unless we see more activity than we saw yesterday afternoon, I don't know that we will get to a recorded vote. But we will have some announcement on that at the earliest possible time after I consult with the managers of the bill and the minority leader. 
Let me say again, there have been a lot of speeches made on the floor, both last year and earlier this year over the past month, about how important this legislation is, how anxious Senators are to get on this legislation. I have a half dozen to a dozen letters on my desk from Senators saying, `Let's get started; this is so important.' 
Where are you? We need some amendments. Let's throw it up here on the wall. Let's get started. We are not going to be able to stay on this legislation indefinitely. At some point we are going to have to say OK, we are going to stay in at night, over the weekend, so we can finish this legislation and move on to NATO enlargement, the budget resolution, the Coverdell A-plus education bill, perhaps a supplemental which would provide funds for Bosnia, Iraq, IMF--in part or in whole. So, we have a lot of work to do. I have been saying that now for about a month, and class doesn't seem to be ready to go to work and take the tests. So, again, I plead with my colleagues, let's get some amendments started. I am expecting by late afternoon Monday, and certainly on Tuesday and Wednesday, we are going to be having amendments on a regular basis, and votes. 
Let me add this additional encouragement. We are not going to let this just languish. If we have to go to third reading--I have always had this real desire to go to third reading and end it. There are some 200 amendments pending out here. At some hour, some Thursday night, we are going to be scrambling around here trying to get an agreement on a list of 50 amendments which we will then have to vote on after 5 minutes of debate, or 2 minutes. That's ridiculous. 
It has been a nice 3 months, but it's time to go to work. I am going to be counting on some amendments very soon. If we do not have them by the middle of next week, I am going to start doing everything I can to cut off amendments. Because if they are serious, you will come to the floor and offer them. 
With that cheery note, Mr. President, observing no Senator anxious to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see that the distinguished chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over the surface transportation bill is in the Chamber. I believe that the ranking member is on his way. In fact, I see he has just arrived in the Chamber. 
So, I now move to proceed to S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to state at this point that I did consult with the leaders of the committee and with the Democratic leader about this issue. There are still discussions underway with regard to funding, whether or not some additional funds would be available, and how much. There will be meetings occurring on that, I am sure, later on this afternoon, tonight, and over the weekend. But there are a number of amendments that are pending to this bill that we can go ahead and take up that would take some time for debate and be considered and have debate and vote. It is my hope that we can get our colleagues to come on to the floor, offer amendments, and, hopefully, we could even have some amendments disposed of this afternoon. 
I have indicated to the Democratic leader that we have to expect votes on Monday and Friday in March, because we have not only this very important bill but a number of other important bills. We are just going to have to start having votes in order to complete this very ambitious agenda. 
Does the Senator wish me to yield?

But, again, we will consult and have some further announcement on this after we get a better feel of how it is going to go later on today or before we go out for the week. 
Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to withdraw all amendments and the pending motion pending to S. 1173, except the pending committee amendment, and it be further modified to be in the form of a complete substitute subject to further amendments.

Obviously, this is very important legislation. I believe progress has been made over the past couple of days in a bipartisan way to come to some agreements, although they have not been reached, that would allow us to complete this bill in a way that would be fair to most all Senators. 
I thank the Senator, and I thank Senator Baucus for his cooperation and particularly the chairman, Senator Chafee. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to report on the status of the Ocean Shipping Reform bill, S. 414. This bill is one of two very important bills in the Senate which are badly needed to reform America's maritime industry. The other such bill would implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. 
A few months ago, I reported that the Ocean Shipping Act was D.I.W: `dead in the water'. Down on my native Gulf Coast, that usually means the engines are broken. `D.I.W' doesn't mean you're sinking--it just means you've got some work to do. It means that everyone's got to roll up their sleeves, get down in the engine space, pitch in and get the problem fixed. 
And, I'm glad to say, that's just what the maritime industry has done. Rolled up their sleeves and fixed the engine of the Ocean Shipping Reform bill. 
I am pleased to report that staff members of the shippers, port authorities, ocean carriers, and labor unions--all rolled up their sleeves and have fixed this legislation. 
It was very important to get everyone working together on this bill. The maritime industry is very large and very complex. Given the many interests involved, it is not surprising it has required slow, steady, and difficult work to get this bill ship-shape and steaming along. 
But that work has been done--and I want to congratulate those who have done the heavy repair work. We are now prepared to move quickly to pass this legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, at approximately 2 p.m. today it will be my intention to move to proceed to the highway bill. If a rollcall vote is requested on that motion, then Senators should be prepared to vote on the motion by early afternoon. Regardless of that, Senators should expect votes with respect to the highway bill throughout the afternoon and into the evening. There is still the possibility of votes on Friday, and I hope there will be votes Monday. 
I hope that there will not be the necessity for a vote on the motion to proceed to the highway bill. Everybody understands it is very important. There are a lot of amendments pending we need to be working on in order to complete action in the Senate in a reasonable period of time so that we can have it done, and hopefully through the conference, well before the May 1 date. 
There are negotiations, discussions that have been underway. No agreement has been worked out. Any understanding that is worked out would still have to be, obviously, considered and debated and voted on by the full Senate. But I believe we are making good progress. The time that we have had for the last month has been, I think, beneficial, but it is time we go forward on this. 
I encourage Senators to get their amendments ready. There are a lot of amendments, other than funding amendments, that really need to be debated. I hope that they will be prepared to offer them this afternoon and on Friday. Let us get underway. 
With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it now appears that U.S. military action against Iraq will not be undertaken in the near future. All Americans, and I'm sure people all around the world, are pleased when military force can be avoided, when our men and women in uniform are not put in harm's way, and when innocent civilian lives are not put at risk. 
But we must be clear: We cannot afford peace at any price--peace that could lead to a much more difficult conflict later on down the road. 
It is always possible to get a deal if you give enough away. The central issue with regard to Iraq is whether an agreement furthers American interests. 
The deal negotiated by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan with Iraq does not adequately address the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. After years of denying that Saddam Hussein had any right to determine the scope of inspections or the makeup of inspection teams, this agreement codifies his ability to do both. It is, to quote one diplomat, `the beginning of the unraveling of the inspection process.' 
This accord sets up a new inspection regime under the control of the Secretary General of the so-called `eight palace residences.' He appoints `senior diplomats' to the group. He names the head of the group. 
And it is not clear to me, although others I am sure are getting clarification on this, who that person would be. Would it be one of the UNSCOM inspectors? Would it be some diplomat? 
The group will have its own rules. And we don't know exactly what they are because they have not yet been developed. I know questions are being asked about this by Ambassador Richardson. I know he is trying to get clarifications. I also know that he is concerned about what he is learning. 
The Secretary General is calling the shots. The United States is not. Secretary Albright earlier this week objected to my characterization of this episode as `contracting out U.S. foreign policy.' With all due respect, I stand by that comment, because it appears that in fact is what has happened. 
Because of the central role of the U.N. Secretary General, it is important to understand his approach and his conclusions. 
Before and after his mission to Baghdad, Secretary General Annan stopped in Paris. He briefed the French government before he met personally, as I understand it, with any senior U.S. official. I find if of great concern that the French are, frankly, accorded a privilege denied to the United States. 
The Secretary General has now briefed the Security Council and the press on his trip. 
Let's look at what he has said. `Saddam can be trusted.' `I think I can do business with him.' `I think he was serious.' These are all direct quotes. The Secretary General told reporters he spent the weekend building a `human relationship' with Saddam Hussein. 
The Secretary General thinks that he can trust the man who has invaded his neighbors, who has used chemical weapons ten times, and who tried to assassinate former President George Bush. This is folly. I cannot understand why the Clinton Administration would place trust in someone devoted to building a `human relationship' with a mass murdered. 
According to the Washington Post, Secretary General Annan described UNSCOM inspectors `as `cowboys' who had thrown their weight around and behaved irresponsibly.' He also `passed along without comment on Iraqi complaint--denied by [UNSCOM] as a paranoid delusion--that some of the most aggressive U.N. inspectors were seeking to hunt down Iraqi President Saddam Hussein so he could be assassinated . . .' 
The Secretary General of the U.N. starts describing the inspectors as `cowboys,' when, as a matter of fact, I had the impression, and it was universally agreed, that they had been very professional. These are people with expertise on biological and chemical weapons. These are people that have come from the international atomic agencies. They know what they are doing. Mr. Butler, the Brit, was in charge of the inspectors, has been very diligent, and very circumspect. As a matter of fact, I understand that one of the most aggressive and most effective inspectors is a Russian. Why in the world would the Secretary General use this kind of wording? Why would he come up with, or even pass along, this ridiculous suggestion that they were being used to hunt down Saddam Hussein? 
These comments are outrageous. They reflect someone bent on appeasement--not someone determined to make the United Nations inspection regime work effectively. 
The Secretary General has greatly harmed the credibility of the United Nations by cutting what appears to be a special deal with the most flagrant violator of United Nations resolutions, probably in history. Instead of standing on principle, he sat with the unprincipled--and gave him what he wanted. 
The United States has not yet formally announced its support for the deal negotiated by Secretary General Annan. It is not too late to reject a deal if it leaves Saddam Hussein rejoicing and leaves UNSCOM out in the cold. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11:30 a.m. We had a number of Senators who requested time to speak on several important issues, including, hopefully, some comment about the Iraq situation. 
As under the previous agreement, at 11:30 the Senate will debate the veto message to accompany H.R. 2631, the military construction appropriations bill. Members are reminded that while there is a 2-hour limitation on that veto message, the vote will occur later in the day in order to accommodate those Members attending the funeral of former Senator Ribicoff, and, I believe, there is at least one other Senator attending another funeral. We always try to honor requests from Senators to accommodate the votes, the demands of their schedule, especially when it involves a personal matter, like a funeral of a loved one. Senators will be notified when a vote is scheduled. We hope to have the two votes stacked at around 6 o'clock. We are working on that. We are trying to clear it with all of the interested Senators. 
Following the debate on the veto message, we will resume debate on S. 1663, the pending campaign finance reform legislation. Therefore, a vote on that, also, is likely this afternoon on the pending Snowe amendment. We hope that would be the second vote that will occur this afternoon. 
I remind my colleagues that three cloture motions were filed during yesterday's session of the Senate, so there is a potential for three back-to-back votes to occur on Thursday morning. Again, I will notify all Senators as to the timing of those votes, following consultation with the minority leader. 
I might note that we are having meetings at this time in my office down the hall to see if we can come to some agreement as to how we can proceed to the very important ISTEA, transportation bill. We have a bipartisan group meeting, and we are anxious to get that legislation ready for consideration because it will take some time. There are some 200 amendments that have been suggested on this bill. I am sure 20 or more of them will have to be debated and voted on. We will need the time that it would take to get that legislation complete so it will be ready for conference when the House does act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the Senator from Illinois for the statement which she just gave. I couldn't help but smile throughout the entire remarks. 
Harry Caray was truly a person of passion and devotion, a baseball idol of the whole country, not only in just St. Louis but Illinois. When I was growing up as a kid going to college at the University of Mississippi, he was the voice of the St. Louis Cardinals. We didn't have any other southern teams. We grew up listening to him and loved him the way he called the game. And he truly is a national treasure. He will really be missed. He made the game something really special. 
So I thank the Senator from Illinois for calling to the attention of this body the contribution that he made.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate is now in a posture where the tree is filled with respect to the pending campaign finance legislation. Senator McCain has offered his substitute amendment and we have had a very good discussion about the issue prior to the motion to table, and the time for the vote was agreed to and that occurred, of course, at 4 o'clock. The motion to table did fail, although I think we should note that it was the identical vote that we had on this same issue last year. 
Now our colleague, Senator Snowe, has offered her version of paycheck protection to the McCain-Feingold amendment, and I intend to file a cloture motion on that today. However, it is my hope that cloture votes on the Snowe amendment could occur Thursday morning, but after we have had debate tonight. She is prepared, I believe, to talk about her amendment. 
There also are a number of Senators who are very interested in talking about the second-degree amendment, or the amendment I offered to her amendment. I know Senator McCain feels very strongly that the FCC should not impose the requirement of free broadcast time. Senator Burns had indicated he wanted to speak on this. We had been hoping he would be here momentarily, and I am sure he will be, and he will want to speak on that issue, too. 
So, after a debate on this issue, we expect to have a time set for a vote. But I will consult with the minority leader and also with the sponsor of the amendment and the second-degree amendment before we announce a time on that. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 1647.

I think probably the answer may be yes, but I would like to make sure we have had a chance to talk it through. I am not making a commitment at this point. 
I think it is important that we have a full discussion on the FCC effort and we have a full discussion on our amendment. That will give us time. I presume she is not interested in having a vote this afternoon, so we will have some time tonight to talk about that and then tomorrow, after the funeral services for Senator Ribicoff, and then after the vote on the military construction appropriations bill, we will come back to this issue around, I guess, 3:30. Then, hopefully, we will have a vote sometime tomorrow afternoon, probably around this time or a little earlier. We will talk about what order that would be in prior to that.

Mr. LOTT. I agree with the chairman of the committee. I feel very strongly the FCC should not be doing this. I would like to inquire, does the chairman of the committee intend to have some hearings on this and maybe move this as an amendment or as a part of another bill at some point? Perhaps this year?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the appointment of three individuals to the Amtrak Reform Council--the ARC: Mr. Gilbert E. `Gil' Carmichael of Mississippi, Mr. Joseph Vranich of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Paul M. Weyrich of Virginia. All three have years of rail transportation experience. All three understand and respect Amtrak's contributions to the American economy. All three are truly committed to genuine railroad reform. All three will serve for five years. All three will examine the fiscal performance of Amtrak. 
Each of these appointees bring many years of experience to this challenging railroad issue. Each brings his own particular approach to this transportation job. 
I've known Mr. Gil Carmichael for many years. He is a dedicated public servant who has already served our nation as Federal Railroad Administrator for President Bush and served four years on the Amtrak Board of Directors. He also has an impressive depth and breadth of knowledge on all facets of transportation--it was Gil who sponsored the first World Railways Congress. It brought together senior rail officials from around the world. so Gil knows the rail business from the bottom up, and he brings to the ARC that good old every-day, common sense approach that we Mississippians are so proud of. 
Mr. Joseph Vranich helped create Amtrak while serving as the Executive Director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers. He is a specialist on high-speed train travel, and literally wrote the book on so-called `Supertrains.' Just late last year, he published the most important new book on railroads, `Derailed: What Went Wrong and What to Do About America's Passenger Trains.' Mr. Vranich brings to the ARC a broad vision of passenger rail service, what it was, what it was meant to be, what it can be. 
And Mr. Paul Weyrich has over 30 years of experience with rail and mass transit issues. He also served on the Amtrak Board of Directors during the Bush administration, and has published numerous works on the subject. Mr. Weyrich brings the hard-boiled sensibilities of a newspaperman of the old school, a newspaperman good at digging for the facts. Just the facts for the ARC. 
The selection of these three reflects my desire to bring managerial expertise to Amtrak's oversight. The ARC will ensure that Amtrak spends the taxpayers' money wisely. The ARC's first loyalty will be to the American taxpay--not to the nostalgic sound of passenger trains going down the tracks. 
Gil, Joe and Paul are executives who will take a good, hard look at Amtrak, and I expect them to exercise courage and leadership. The ARC has the responsibility to offer sound judgment as they advise both the Administration and the Congress. 
I have no doubt the ARC will have a key role in shaping Amtrak's future. 
I'm pleased to announce that today the Speaker will also identify his three selections. These selections together will constitute the majority of the ARC. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues who gave me such a rich list of candidates to select from. The choices were difficult. 
The Amtrak Board of Directors, the other managerial oversight body for Amtrak is to be renominated this summer. I hope to see new faces, a fresh look and a fresh approach. This would help Amtrak successfully deal with the cultural shift required by the new reauthorization statute. The combined synergy of a new board and the ARC will make a profound difference to the way America's passenger rail service will enter the next millennium. 
I look forward to seeing ARC getting started on its important task. America's passenger rail service will be well served by the ARC.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m., as under the previous consent order. At 10:30 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1663, the campaign finance reform bill. Also, under the previous unanimous consent order, the time from 10:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the opponents and proponents of the legislation. 
In addition, by consent, from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m., the Senate will recess for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. Following those luncheons, at 2:15 p.m., the Senate will resume consideration of the campaign finance reform bill, with the time then going until 4 o'clock being equally divided between the opponents and proponents. 
Following that debate, at 4 p.m., the Senate will proceed to a vote in relation to the pending McCain-Feingold amendment. Therefore, the first rollcall vote today will occur at 4 p.m. Senators can also anticipate the possibility of additional votes after that vote on the McCain-Feingold amendment. But we do not have a definite time agreement on that presently. Before the 4 o'clock vote, we will notify Senators about the schedule for the remainder of the day. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to talk for just a few minutes about a long-term goal of many Senate Republicans, and I think most Americans. And that is fundamental tax reform. 
Our Tax Code contains the accumulation of 85 years of various special interest provisions, and provisions that have just been added through one tax bill or another. And it has become more complicated, more difficult, and more unfair with every passing year. 
Since the Federal Government first started taxing Americans' income, the tax beast has grown, and the power of the tax collector along with it. That is why we need IRS reform, and why we will have an IRS reform bill on the floor of the Senate by the end of March so that we can pass it before April 15th of this year. It certainly is overdue. But we have found a lot of the problems that we have suspected really do exist and in many ways are worse than the worst horror stories we have heard. 
We now have a system in which the Federal Government takes one dollar out of every five dollars that you earn. And the IRS uses its coercive powers to pry into every aspect of financial life and personal life. It has gotten totally out of control. 
The copy of the Tax Code that I have here contains thousands of pages in very small print, and weighs 6 1/2 pounds. How could the average working small businessman, farmer, rancher, or individual be expected to cope with and understand all that is in these two very large volumes? 
The IRS has an annual budget now of $7.7 billion. We spend five times more to pay tax auditors to harass hard-working citizens than we spend to clean up Superfund waste sites. 
It really doesn't make sense. 
It is important that we in Congress admit that we are part of the problem because every time we have good intentions we pass another tax bill that reduces taxes--hopefully, in most instances. But it doesn't make it simpler. In many ways it quite often makes it more complicated. 
The Congress writes the tax law. And almost every time we pass a tax bill we make the code more complex, increase the burden on the taxpayer, and make it harder to enforce. 
For all of these reasons, America needs fundamental tax reform. 
Incremental tax cuts are good. And I hope we can have some this year. And I am glad we were able to take a small step toward reducing the taxpayers' burden last year in the very critical areas of capital gains, estate tax, and families with children. 
To go where we really need to go, however, we must force the Congress to act. 
To make fundamental tax reform happen, we need a `forcing event,' a deadline. 
I firmly believe that Congress will never commit itself to replacing the Tax Code with something simpler, flatter, and growth-friendly, unless we create our own deadline. 
For that reason, I want to announce today that I will ask Budget Committee Chairman Domenici to put a sense-of-the-Senate provision in this year's budget resolution that the current Tax Code should be terminated as of December 31, 2001. 
I am also an original cosponsor of Senator Hutchinson's bill, S. 1520, The Tax Code Termination Act. 
In addition to the sense-of-the-Senate provision in the budget resolution, we will vote on legislation like Senator Hutchinson's bill this year. 
It creates the deadline to force Washington and the American people to make some hard choices but to make the right choices. 
We will then be able to see who is serious about replacing our rat's nest Tax Code, and who wants to defend the current tax system. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, spring has come early to Washington this year, and the Senate's return to the subject of campaign finance will strengthen the impression that we have already entered the television rerun season. The evening news, I fear, for the next few nights will seem like a replay of events from last fall when two irreconcilable points of view met on the Senate floor and reached a stalemate. 
We agreed to try again at some time before March 6, and so, pursuant to that agreement, I have laid down a bill that embodies the most important campaign finance reform of all: paycheck protection. The bill, S. 1663, is at the desk. 
It is as simple as this: No one should be forced to make a political contribution. That is pretty elementary, and overwhelmingly Americans, including union members, agree with that. No one should be compelled by a union or a corporation or a Congress to give their hard-earned dollars to a candidate or a campaign. And yet, millions of our fellow Americans are held up like that, not at the point of a gun but through misuse of their union dues. 
I am the son of a shipyard worker, a pipefitter, a pipefitter union member, and even, as I understand it, temporarily a union steward. I grew up in a blue-collar family. I grew up with my father going to work in a shipyard, and I am very sympathetic to how they work--the conditions they used to have to work in and the fact that those conditions are better now. 
But I know my father would have objected strenuously to his union dues being taken and used for political purposes with which he did not agree. Diverting workers' earnings to campaign coffers of some favorite politicians in some other part of the country, that certainly is a legitimate concern. No matter who does it, we shouldn't be allowing that to happen. 
If we are serious about reforming the Nation's campaign finance laws, this is the place to start, by protecting workers' paychecks. 
This bill before us, which is largely the work of my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, is the gate through which campaign finance reform must proceed if it is to proceed at all. Whatever our respective views on other aspects of the campaign finance debate, support for paycheck protection is a litmus test of whether we are serious or whether we are credible. 
Opponents of paycheck protection have created quite a stir about other problems they perceive with campaign finance reform. They remind me of the overly zealous policeman writing a ticket for a car parked just 3 inches too close to a fire hydrant while a brutal mugging takes place right behind his back. In fact, the workers of America are mugged every time they are forced to contribute to candidates and to causes they do not support. 
The bills that have thus far been called `campaign finance reform' would not do a thing about that, but, golly, they would sure write parking tickets. 
This Senate over the past 2 years has been able to reach consensus on a lot of difficult issues. It hasn't been easy. We have worked hard reaching consensus, agreeing to welfare reform and last year the budget agreement and tax reductions. It took weeks, it took months, it took sacrifice, it took give and take. That atmosphere has not developed with campaign finance reform. You would think we could reach a consensus, but the consensus is not there yet. Both sides have to want consensus, and a consensus would have to do five things: 
First, respect the constitutional rights of every American to engage in the political process as those rights were enunciated by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo. We don't need less participation by Americans at all stages of life and in all avenues in elections; we need more participation. We shouldn't be trying to restrict their expression; we ought to be encouraging it to take advantage of every opportunity to express themselves and express their views on issues and, yes, on candidates, and not sometime far off removed from an election when people are not paying attention. As a matter of fact, I think one of the things we ought to do is shorten the length of 
campaigns and compact them if we can, but there is a little problem with that, too. That would be my desire, but how do you do it constitutionally? 
Second, encourage greater participation by citizens in the political process. 
Third, ensure that any and all contributions to a campaign are absolutely voluntary. 
Fourth, restrict the power of Government officials to meddle in campaigns and to intimidate citizens who participate in them. 
And fifth, and last, safeguard America's elections from foreign influence. 
All of us should be able to rally around those very basic principles, I think. Unfortunately, though, many in this Chamber don't seem to want a consensus. What they want is an advantage, an unfair advantage for some candidates, some special interests, and some contributors, but not for all. 
Sure, let's be real honest. Democrats would like to limit contributions from groups that support Republicans, but if you talk about any kind of fair restriction on their supporters, oh, no, that's not fair. They want to tilt the Nation's campaign laws and, in the process, discourage citizen involvement in Government. Their legislation would make it more difficult for Americans to hold accountable their elected officials. That is hardly the way to restore trust in government or respect for those who lead it. 
More rules and regulations will not do the job. Our elections are already swamped with rules and regulations. They are so complicated that virtually every congressional campaign now needs a battery of election law attorneys to guard against inadvertent violations. 
Every campaign now has to have a CPA to make sure you get all these filings done properly and that you get the addresses and the employment. You better have some good legal advice and you better take every possible precaution to make sure that you are dotting every `i' and crossing every `t,' because there are going to be some people who will be pawing through everything you do. 
I have voted for some of the campaign finance laws in the past. I voted for the FEC, thinking maybe it would get better, and it has gotten worse. We have been limiting participation. We have been making it more difficult for candidates to be able to raise the money to get their message out, and there are a lot of people I figure who would like to really put elections in the control of the national news media, the national broadcasters, certain limited organizations. 
I have said here before, if I were at the mercy of the major newspaper in my State and the biggest television station in my State, I would be trying lawsuits in Pascagoula, MS, and making a lot more money, but I was able to get out and get my message across in spite of the opposition of the establishment, the courthouse gangs, and the news media with their prejudices. 
I was able to go directly to the people. Would the proposal that we have heard--McCain-Feingold--help that? No. It would cut that off. 
All the laws already on the books did not prevent, by the way, the most blatant, the most egregious, the most offensive disregard of the law in the last Presidential campaign. I mean, this idea of `stop me before I do it again,' I do not think should sell. 
The first thing we should do with our campaigns in America is to comply with the laws on the books. That is where the problem was. The last election, you know, did not have problems because we had people who were doing things that we could stop with this bill; they were violating the law. That is what caused the problem. 
Foreign contributions are illegal. Many of the problems that we saw in the last election were illegal. Now some people say, `Well, we've got to stop the efforts of people to help the parties.' I thought we were supposed to help the two-party system in America. We should encourage the two-party system. We should encourage parties to get voters to turn out to the polls. We should encourage groups to support candidates of their choice--not discourage it. 
The outcome, of course, that we had from the last Presidential campaign was a morass involving everything from Vice Presidential phone calls and Native American casinos to illegal fundraising at religious institutions. All of those things were probably against the law anyway. 
When key Democratic fundraisers flee the country to avoid questioning, it is no wonder their beneficiaries would like to change the subject away from the enforcement of current law. But enforcing current law is precisely the way that we should begin the debate on this campaign finance reform issue today. 
If current law needs to be streamlined or clarified or simplified, let us do it. But let us do it while encouraging greater participation by more people in politics, and let us do it constitutionally. 
The amendment that will be offered by Senator McCain and Senator Feingold will take us in the wrong direction, in my opinion, toward more controls, more restrictions, and less accountability. We should go the other way. We should try to replicate on a national scale the spirit of a town meeting in which every person is free to speak, free to complain, and free to hold accountable those in positions of power. 
The bill I have presented advances that goal by protecting workers' paychecks against political abuse. Let us agree to do this today and then explore other possible accords. If we can take this one step, this modest step, it could be the one that would break the dam and allow us to do some of the other things that we probably could agree to. But, no, it is said that this is a poison pill--a poison pill--when the American people know it is the right thing to do, when union members support it overwhelmingly, when what we are really talking about is voluntarily agreeing to have your money used. 
That is a very American thing we are trying to do, I think. We should stop the confiscation of workers' earnings for the benefit of politicians. Then we can finish campaign finance reform in a true sense and move on to other matters the American people want us to deal with. 
Let me just say that we are going to have a full debate on this today, tomorrow, Wednesday; and there will be votes on it as we agreed to last year. But I want to remind my colleagues that after this, we have pending some really important issues, including issues involving education in America, highway construction in America, NATO enlargement, a budget resolution, supplemental appropriations to provide funds for the situations in Bosnia and Iraq, and to make a decision about how to deal with IMF. 
We are talking about Internal Revenue Service reform, maybe even some tobacco settlement legislation. All of that, and it has to be done before the end of April. We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do on issues that people really care about. Education is a perfect example. A decent infrastructure is another example. In my own State of Mississippi, we have gotten an unfair share of the highway funds for 40 years. It is time we changed that. 
We should give this debate fair time. And we can do that this week as we promised. But we have a lot of really important issues that we need to take up that will directly affect people's lives in America for years to come. I hope that after a reasonable time, unless we can find some broader consensus that I do not see that would include paycheck equity for workers, then we should move on to other very important issues.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe that Senator Daschle will join me on the floor shortly because he and I would like to, in effect, have a joint statement with regard to Iraq because we want the message to be unambiguous, very clear to America and to our 
allies around the world, and to Iraq about our attitude and what our intentions are with regard to this very important matter. 
I just had a call from Senator John Warner, who is in Russia today along with Senator Carl Levin. They are escorting Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. They have already been to six countries since they were in Germany. I believe perhaps even the Senator from Arizona, the Presiding Officer, was there. They have gone throughout the Arab world, and now they are in Russia. 
He tells me that he believes that when they return, Secretary Cohen and the two Senators will bring a great deal of helpful information to the Senate and to the American people about what they have heard in the Arab world and what they have heard from our allies in those areas' meetings. They believe that they will be able to answer some of the very important questions that Senators have been asking. 
So we will look forward to their return. 
I had hoped that we could get to the point where we could pass a resolution this week on Iraq. But we really developed some physical problems, if nothing else. Senator Warner and Senator Levin would like very much to be a part of the discussion about what the situation will be and how we should proceed on Iraq. They would like to be here. And other Senators are necessarily not going to be able to be here beyond this afternoon. 
So we have decided that the most important thing is not to move so quickly but to make sure that we have had all the right questions asked and answered and that we have available to us the latest information about what is expected or what is going to be happening with our allies in the world. 
I was noting, I say to Senator Daschle, that I just talked to Senator Warner in Russia, and he was telling me that Secretary Cohen and Senator Warner and Senator Levin are looking forward to coming back and giving us a full report on their trip to the Arab world. Now they are in Russia today. 
Mr. President, I have no doubt that the entire world is watching the current crisis between Iraq and the international community unfold. This is another showdown caused by Saddam Hussein. 
The Iraqi dictator has decided that his weapons-of-mass-destruction program is more important than the welfare of his own people. At a time when we have been getting reports--in fact, we have seen children suffering from malnutrition--this dictator has been building $1.5 billion in additional palaces. He has already endured 7 years of sanctions so that he can develop biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons --and the means to deliver them. 
This is a very serious matter. For some time we--and I mean America and our allies--have been working to develop a resolution on Iraq that has broad bipartisan support and also one that would bring the situation under control there by diplomatic efforts hoping to avoid military action. But that has not happened yet. 
I believe we are moving toward a consensus in the Senate on a number of the key issues that must be addressed as we look to the future. And here they are. 
First of all, Saddam Hussein does pose a real threat to the region and to the entire world. I believe the Senate recognizes that. I hope that the American people recognize that. This is not a hypothetical danger that has been dreamed up by some armchair strategists. There is a long track record in this area of actions by Saddam Hussein. He poses a clear and present danger without equal in the post-cold-war-world. He is dangerous. He is a threat to his neighbors. He is a destabilizing force in the whole region. And, yes, he is actually a threat all over the world including the United States. This is a man who has already invaded two of his neighbors. Iraq has used chemical weapons inside and outside its borders. It has launched missiles against Saudi Arabia and against Israel. Hussein tried to murder former President George Bush in 1993. 
Now, we should not make any mistake and think that a military action, if it comes to that, is going to rehabilitate Saddam Hussein or even eliminate him. He does not have any desire to join the civilized world, apparently, and he has shown that he can survive even when the whole world has concerns with his conduct and has taken unified action to stop his aggression. 
Second, I think there is a consensus in the Senate that military force is justified if diplomatic actions fail in responding to the threat that Saddam Hussein poses. The threat is serious and our response must be serious. 
Now, any military force that is used does entail risks, to our military, to our allies and even to our country if there is an attempt at retaliation. The American people need to understand that, and we need to think about it carefully. And we need to talk about the risks that are involved. That is one reason why, when we bring up a resolution, if it is necessary--and I assume it will be--we must make sure that every Senator who wants to be heard can be heard. 
I remember when we had a similar debate back in the early nineties. I think some 80 Senators spoke. Now, this time we won't have 500,000 troops amassed on the ground ready to go in, but it is still a very serious matter, and I want to make sure that we don't try to restrict Senators. In fact, we could not. Senator Daschle knows if we asked unanimous consent to bring this resolution up today and vote on it in 4 hours, we would not get it; the Senate is known for its deliberate actions. And the longer I stay in the Senate, the more I have learned to appreciate it. It does help to give us time to think about the potential problems and the risks and the ramifications and to, frankly, press the administration. I feel better this week than I did last week because of the responses we are getting about how this is being thought out and what would be the military action and what will be the long-term plans to deal with Saddam Hussein. We are beginning to get some answers now. I believe the administration is thinking harder about what those answers should be because the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, has raised these questions, not in a critical way, not in a threatening way, but in an honest way of saying, have you thought about this? What about this approach? Can we do more? I think that has served a very positive purpose. 
Some people have said to me, even back in my own State, `This is not a threat to us. Let them deal with that over there.' Who? Who is going to deal with it? If America does not lead, who is going to lead? Nobody else. 
Now, our allies can, should, and, I believe, will join us if action is necessary. But we are going to have to lead the way. We are going to have to make the tough decisions. And people need to understand that this threat could even apply to us. While it may be a direct threat of a Scud missile in the region with a chemical warhead even, it could very easily be a threat to Paris or some city in the U.S. involving anthrax that's been produced by Saddam Hussein. 
These are terrible things to even think about, but you are dealing with a person who has already used terrible actions against his own people. And so he is not so far removed. We are the ones who have to provide the direction. And we have to make sure people understand it is a threat to the whole world. 
In my view, the decisive use of force against Iraq coupled with the long-term strategy to eliminate the threat entails less risks in the long run than allowing Saddam Hussein's actions and ambitions to go unchecked. You cannot do it when you are dealing with a situation like this. In the words of former Secretary of State Jim Baker, `The only thing we shouldn't do is do nothing.' We cannot allow that to be the result or what we do is nothing. 
The administration has agreed with us that funding for the operations in and around Iraq require supplemental appropriations. We had very grave concerns by the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and Senator Domenici about how much will this cost? How is it going to be paid for? We cannot continue to say `just take it out of your hide' to the Pentagon; it is having an effect on morale, quality of life, on readiness and 
modernization. We already have a very high tempo for our military men and women in the Navy and Air Force. We are satisfied that they now have made a commitment that they are going to come up and ask for funding for both these purposes, in Bosnia and, if necessary, in Iraq. And these will be emergency requests so it will not come out of necessary improvements in barracks or spare parts for aircraft, which are very important. 
There is a consensus on seriously examining now I believe long-term policy options to increase the pressure on Saddam Hussein. The administration and Congress and our allies all look forward to dealing with a post-Saddam regime. But the question is how to get there. 
That is intended not to be a threat or say we should violate the law; it is intended to start the discussion, start the thinking about how can we increase these pressures. And we have to have a strategy to deal with whatever comes after the military option. Many things have been suggested. Toughen sanctions--not loosen sanctions, toughen sanctions. What about an embargo, what about expanding no-fly, no-drive zones? What about the support of opposition forces? 
There is a long list of suggestions, some that I will not even put in the record here, but they are worth thinking about. Our model should be the Reagan doctrine of rollback, not the Truman doctrine of containment in this instance. And I don't mean that as critically as it sounds. It is just that there are two different doctrines, and the doctrine here should be rollback, not containment. 
Despite our areas of agreement that we have clearly reached--Senator Daschle and I have been working together making sure every word is sanitized in the potential resolution--it is obvious we cannot get it done this week for physical reasons as much as anything else. And I remind my colleagues and the American people it was 5 months after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, 5 months before Congress passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to expel him. In this case, we have a bipartisan effort, trying to make sure that the right thing is going to be done and that the right language is developed. Unlike what we had in the early 1990's when the Speaker and majority leader were working to defeat the administration's policy, you now have a Speaker and a majority leader and the Democratic leader and the minority leader in the House all working together with the administration to make sure that the language is right and that the actions are right. 
Yes, more time may be needed for diplomacy and more time to think about the long-term plans, but a point will come when time will run out and action must go forward. When that comes, when U.S. Armed Forces are sent into harm's way, by the President of the United States, they will have the backing of the Senate and the American people. If the President makes the decision to deploy military force against the threat posed by Iraq, America will be united, united and praying for the safety of our men and women in uniform, united in hoping casualties are kept to a minimum, and united in hoping for and supporting a successful effort. 
I just want to make that point clear today. Nobody should interpret the fact that we don't vote on a resolution today as meaning that we are not united in the fundamental principles. We are. But we want to make sure that when we do take military action, we have thought about all the ramifications and the resolution that we come up with will have the involvement of 100 Senators, with 100 Senators being present and voting, and that every word is the appropriate word that reflects the best interests of the American people. 
So I am pleased to stand here this afternoon and make this statement and to assure my colleagues that I will continue to work with every Senator on both sides of the aisle to make sure we take the appropriate action, if it is necessary, when we return week after next. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I am looking forward to hearing Senator Daschle's comments on this subject. 
Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum momentarily.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to call attention to a Federal permit program that is causing problems in Mississippi, in the Southeastern United States and, indeed, in the entire United States: the Federal Section 404 `wetlands' permit program. This program has its roots in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, but has been designed primarily by the Federal courts and the Federal agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and not by the elected officials of this Nation. 
Twenty years have passed since the Congress of the United States has addressed this program legislatively. Currently, a Federal appellate court decision, two pending appellate court cases and a new proposed rulemaking by the Corps of Engineers are stirring up controversy about this program. No one should be surprised. This program is held together by baling wire and string and pieces are beginning to fall off all over the place. 
I encourage the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to bring to the full Senate legislation that makes meaningful, common sense changes to the Section 404 permit program. Review of this program is long overdue. Mr. President, I hope that this Congress can take meaningful action on the Section 404 program in 1998. 
One basic controversy about this program is the issue of the areas that are regulated as wetlands. The Federal agencies have interpreted their jurisdiction to extend to the farthest reaches of the Commerce Clause, and, I think, even beyond, including those isolated areas that merely `could affect' interstate commerce. Specifically, to some agencies this means those areas where a migratory bird `could' land. To make this grab for jurisdiction worse, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 75 percent of all Section 404 regulated areas are on privately owned property! 
On December 23, in Wilson v. United States Corps of Engineers, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturned the criminal convictions of an individual, a corporation and a partnership for violating the Section 404 program in Charles County, Maryland. The individual had been sentenced to 21 months in jail and the three defendants had been fined a total of $4 million. The Fourth Circuit overturned the convictions and remanded the case to the district court, finding that only those areas that are either connected on the surface to navigable waters or are proven to be in interstate commerce could be regulated under the Section 404 program. Specifically, the court held that: 
Absent a clear indication to the contrary, we should not lightly presume that merely by defining `navigable waters' as `the waters of the United States', Congress authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to assert its jurisdiction in such a sweeping and constitutionally troubling manner. Even as a matter of statutory construction, one would expect that the phrase `waters of the United States', when used to define the phrase `navigable waters' refers to waters which, if not navigable in fact, are at least interstate or closely related to navigable or interstate waters. When viewed in light of its statutory authority, (the regulation), which defines `waters of the United States' to include intrastate waters that need have nothing to do with navigable or interstate waters, expands the statutory phrase `waters of the United States' beyond its definable limit. 
Accordingly, we believe that in promulgating (the regulation), the Army Corps of Engineers exceeded its congressional authorization under the Clean Water Act, and that, for this reason, (the regulation) is invalid. 
At long last, this case begins to limit the reach of the bureaucracy onto privately owned property under this program. 
A second area of controversy is a regulation issued by the Clinton Administration in September, 1993, that broadly expanded the definition of activities that are regulated under the Section 404 program. As many of you know, this permit problem was never designed to be a wetlands permit program, but rather evolved in that direction through judicial rulings and agency interpretations. The activities in `wetlands' that are regulated under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act are the `discharge of dredged and fill material' into the `navigable waters'. On the face of it, the statute does not cover other activities that could degrade wetlands, such as `draining' or `excavating' wetlands. Obviously, if we are going to have a wetlands regulatory program and protect valuable wetlands, the program needs to cover `drainage' and `excavation.' 
In September 1993, the Clinton Administration issued a rulemaking that expanded coverage of the Section 404 program to include activities like drainage and excavation. Many of us noted that this might be good public policy, but this expansion exceeded the statute, and legislation would be necessary to expand the program to cover these activities. 
On January 23, 1997, a Federal district court in the District of Columbia struck down this regulation, called the Tulloch rule, as exceeding the statutory authority of the Clean Water Act. On January 9, 1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments in this case. The Federal government had a rough day in court. I am told that the judges suggested that the agency interpretation of the jurisdictional reach of the Section 404 program went as far as `land that might be wet someday'. One of the appellate judges asked the government attorney whether riding a bike through a wetland, where dirt accumulated on the tires and then fell off into the wetland during riding, would be an activity regulated under the Section 404 program. The government attorney answered yes, but the regulation was not aimed at this activity. The judge answered correctly, `Not yet!' 
This brings me to a recent Corps judgment on Nationwide Permit 26 that was attacked on the front page of the Washington Post on Saturday, January 31st. 
With the Corps and the EPA interpreting almost every activity as one covered by the Section 404 program, the Corps has adopted a series of Nationwide Permits that cover routine activities and prevent the necessity of proceeding through the costly and time-consuming normal permitting process. One of these permits, Nationwide Permit 26, which covers certain areas up to 3 acres in size, is scheduled to expire in December 1998. The Corps is developing a series of `replacement permits'. These `carve outs' are essential 
if the Corps is to be able to manage this program without enormous delays in permit processing times. This is particularly true as the bureaucracy continually expands the types of activities that are regulated under the Section 404 program. Yet, some interest groups are attempting to pressure the Administration to reject these replacement permits. If they are successful, I am convinced that the program will fall into disarray, prompting calls not only for the reform of the current program, but the repeal of the whole thing. We will all have to keep an eye on this development. 
Finally, a case is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit styled Resource Investments, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In this case, the Corps used its Section 404 regulations to overturn the judgment of a county government in a public bid process regarding the location of a new solid waste disposal facility. I can assure you that it is not this Senator's view that the mission of the Army Corps of Engineers is to make judgments that historically have been within the purview of local elected officials. 
Mr. President, this is just a quick survey of some of the judgments that are being made by Federal agencies and Federal courts regarding the Section 404 program. These judgments sometimes expand and sometimes narrow this program. What is missing--and has been missing for 20 years--is the judgment of elected officials about fundamental aspects of this regulatory program that defy common sense and so often intrude on privately owned property, local economic activities and governmental infrastructure decisions. It is long-past time for the committee of jurisdiction over this program to bring forth legislation that proposes meaningful and responsible adjustments to this awful program. 
By the way, Mr. President, I should add one more thing. The current President of the United States, when he was the Governor of Arkansas, chaired the Lower Mississippi River Delta Development Commission. The statutory charge of this Commission was to study the seven-state Lower Mississippi River Delta region and to develop a ten-year regional economic development plan. This is a particularly troubled region economically. Both my state of Mississippi and the President's state of Arkansas contain portions of the Lower Mississippi River Delta. 
In May, 1990, the Commission filed its report, which was submitted to Congress over the signature of the current President. That report specifically addressed the problems of Federal wetlands regulation, stating:  
The national wetlands policy has caused significant problems for agriculture, aquaculture and commercial and industrial development. * * * * * 
Current definitions do not adequately differentiate the quality of wetlands. * * * * * 
Current interpretations of the national wetlands policy have placed major limitations on the Delta's economy because commercial and industrial development is being impaired. (all quotes from page 80 of the report) 
The report then made a number of recommendations, including these two from page 81 of the report: 
Congress should direct appropriate federal agencies to establish minimum-sized wetlands for regulation. * * * * * 
Congress should assign the responsibility for identification and maintenance of a wetlands inventory to one agency, and require consultation with other affected agencies. 
Mr. President, the President of the United States seems to have forgotten what he learned as chair of the Lower Mississippi River Delta Development Commission. The current Federal Section 404 permitting program regulates all wetlands regardless of size and is administered by two Federal agencies: the Corps of Engineers and the EPA. The President was correct with respect to these recommendations in 1990, but now that he is in a position to act, nothing has happened. I would hope that the President of the United States would submit at least these meaningful changes to Congress for our consideration in 1998.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a contract dispute, pending as a civil case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, between a subcontractor and the prime contractor constructing a Department of Labor Job Corps facility in Charleston, West Virginia. Prior to the litigation, the subcontractor, a West Virginia firm, sought assistance from Senator Byrd's and Senator Rockefeller's offices in contacting the Labor Department regarding the firm's difficulties over payment for its work on the project. In the civil lawsuit that has ensued between the two contracting firms, the prime contractor has now requested that the offices of Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller produce from their files copies of documents concerning the West Virginia Job Corps project. 
The constituent subcontractor firm has advised, through the Senate Legal Counsel, that it has no objection to the release of its correspondence with the Senator's offices. Thus, the usual principle of constituent confidentiality is not implicated here. However, as is often the case when a constituent reports difficulties in dealing with an executive agency, Senator Byrd's office and Senator Rockefeller's office have advised that their constituent's communications regarding this matter informed the Senators' consideration of potential alternatives to address the problem, including undertaking legislative or oversight action regarding the Labor Department's construction program and procurement procedures. In order to protect Senators' ability to undertake their legislative responsibilities free from interference and questioning, the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution privileges from compelled production in court proceedings materials from Senators' files relating to the legislative sphere. 
Nevertheless, Senators Byrd and Rockefeller are willing to provide to the parties in this case copies of documents reflecting their offices' role, to the extent that they may properly do so without impairing the important interests underlying the Senate's constitutional privileges. In view of the subcontractor's lack of objection, the Senators also have no objection to furnishing copies of their correspondence with the subcontractor. In addition, both Senators would like to provide the records of their communications with the Labor Department regarding this matter. Consistent with the overriding importance that the Constitution recognizes in fostering unimpeded communications between Senators and their staffs concerning matters of potential legislative action, the Senators will not waive their legislative privileges for their offices' internal records and work product. 
Accordingly, this resolution would authorize Senator Byrd's and Senator Rockefeller's offices to produce documents in this case, except where a privilege or objection should be asserted. The resolution also would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent employees in Senator Byrd's and Senator Rockefeller's offices, should such representation become necessary to protect the Senate's privileges in connection with this matter.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity now to discuss this nomination with Senators on both sides of the aisle and those who did support her and certainly those who are opposed to this nomination. I think that we should not go forward to a vote at this time since there are very serious allegations out there. I am convinced they are true; I am convinced this nomination should not go forward; and I would urge at this point the President withdraw this nomination because clearly this nominee has very serious problems, conduct on the bench that is certainly inappropriate and a number of concerns about the nominee's attitude toward prosecutors and toward law enforcement. Clearly this is the type of nomination that should not be confirmed. But so that some of these articles, some of the cases, some of the suggestions that are now in the public arena can be properly looked into, I thought the best thing to do at this time would be to not go forward with a vote and allow time for the committee to have a hearing on the problems that have been identified. I don't think it can be disposed of in the near future. 
Having said that, I understand the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will be conducting an additional hearing on the nominee sometime when we return from the recess we are about to go into at the close of business on Thursday or Friday. So we can see what that hearing turns up. But I think that no further action can be taken at this time. I thank all Senators for their consideration and will yield the floor to the Senator from Missouri. I appreciate him yielding me this time. And I know that the Senators from Pennsylvania will both seek recognition so that they can comment on the present status of this nominee. 
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I rise today to recognize an important day in the history of this nation--a day that may intrigue some of you who are not familiar with Southern history. Tomorrow is the 299th anniversary of the landing of D'Iberville on the shores of present-day Mississippi, and the beginning of the French colonization of the American South. 
Madam President, my colleagues are familiar with the English landings in Jamestown and Plymouth, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Some may recall the Spanish settlements up the eastern seaboard or the missions in the far West. But I suspect few of you know of the French colonization of the deep South and the frontier of the future United States, and the deeds of men like Pierre Lemoyne Sieur D'Iberville, the French military officer who began that colonization. 
However, down home, all along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, we know and we remember. We remember how D'Iberville's band of French soldiers, hunters, farmers and adventurers began the exploration and occupation of the lower Mississippi valley. We remember that this landing eventually gave birth to towns as far-flung as Biloxi, Natchez, Mobile, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Memphis, St. Joseph, Detroit, and Galveston. 
My native Mississippi Gulf Coast is a place of year-round beauty, romance, and charm. It is easy to understand why the French chose to found their first colony there. 
We are throwing a party today, in Biloxi, Mississippi, where D'Iberville landed, 299 years ago tomorrow, and in Ocean Springs, where he built Fort Maurepas. As I am sure you have heard, we know how to throw a party. But next year, on this very day, will be the 300th anniversary of D'Iberville's landing. And I especially want to invite every one of my colleagues and you, Madam President, to attend that celebration. 
All along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, from my native Pascagoula west to Pass Christian and Bay St. Louis, hundreds of volunteers are already planning and preparing a vast array of festivals, parties, national sporting events, educational activities, and cultural exchanges with French cities, working to make our 1699 Tricentennial a truly wonderful celebration. 
In conjunction with next year's festivities will be the Mardi Gras Celebration in all the coast towns, from Texas to Florida. I believe all of my colleagues are familiar with Mardi Gras. 
But the Tricentennial celebrations are more than just festivities. They are celebrations of how really diverse we are in the deep South, how wonderfully varied and multi-cultural our Southern heritage, our American heritage really is, and how much we've accomplished over the past 300 years! 
Come to the Gulf Coast next year with us, and help us celebrate that diverse culture, and our hard-won economic prosperity. You might be surprised. You'll find that whether we are of French, Scottish, Irish, Spanish, Yugoslavian, Vietnamese, English, African-American or Native American ancestry, or a little of everything, we are all fair, honest, hardworking, and friendly to a fault. And we can all cook!! And we all talk with this accent!! 
So come down and join us, if not this year, certainly for the big Tricentennial celebration. A lot of faces and names will be familiar to you: Brett Favre, the great NFL quarterback, astronauts Fred Haise of Apollo XIII and Stuart Roosa, and the works of great American painter Walter Anderson and potter George E. Ohr. And the places to see!--the beautiful home of Jefferson Davis, the beaches, the southern way of life, the unique nightlife, the Mardi Gras, the 1699 celebrations and re-enactments. 
Madam President, I invite all my colleagues to come down to the Gulf Coast next year and join us in the wonderful celebration of our Tricentennial.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning as previously ordered the Senate will resume debate on the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to S. 1601, the cloning bill, with the time until 10 a.m. equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. 
Also, as previously ordered, at 10 a.m. a rollcall vote will occur on the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to S. 1601. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will debate the motion to proceed to the cloning bill. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate can be expected to resume debate on the Massiah-Jackson nomination and then, at approximately 4 p.m. today, the Senate can be expected to begin debate on the nomination of Margaret Morrow, of California, to be U.S. district judge. 
I want to emphasize that even though we are going back to debate on Massiah-Jackson, that does not mean we will stay on that nomination all the way until 4 o'clock. We will probably have some announcement later on this morning about that matter, and how we would expect to handle it. Additional votes can be expected to occur during today's session of the Senate. 
As a reminder to all Senators, at 10 a.m. this morning a vote will occur on the cloture motion and we probably will have a vote late this afternoon on the Morrow nomination. It appears at this time that would occur probably around 6 o'clock, even though we have not advised everybody that that is our intent, or gotten an absolute commitment, but I believe there will probably be a vote about 6 o'clock on the Morrow nomination. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, under a previous consent, the Senate will debate the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon General until 11 a.m. At 11 the Senate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination. Under the agreement that we reached last week, if cloture is invoked, a second vote will occur immediately on the nomination itself. Therefore, Senators should be aware that there may be two consecutive rollcall votes beginning at 11 a.m. 
As under the order, from 12:30, then, to 2:15, the Senate will recess for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. Following the luncheons, the Senate may begin consideration of the nomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Therefore, further votes can be expected to occur following the one or two votes at 11 o'clock. 
Also, I want to give Senators a reminder that a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the cloning bill will now occur Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this and I urge they pay particular attention to this cloning issue. The Senate needs to make a decision on whether or not we want to allow human cloning to go forward. There is a lot of concern about that. The President has indicated he is opposed to it and we need to take this issue up. 
I urge the Senate to at least vote to go to debate on the substance of the bill itself. The cloture motion is on the motion to proceed. I think we ought to have a beginning of a full discussion about this, see where there are disagreements and where maybe we can come to agreements. If we do not do that, this process will be allowed and there are going to be serious, I think, scientific, medical, ethical and moral questions that are going to be left dangling in the wind. If Senators have additional ideas that they would like to offer in the form of amendments to this human cloning issue, that is the way we should proceed. 
I urge the Senate to begin to pay close attention to this issue. The alternative is, perhaps, to do nothing, and I think that would be a very dangerous thing in this very important issue. 
Mr. President, I see a Senator seeks recognition. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. This morning the Senate will be in a period for the transaction of morning business until 12 noon. At noon, as previously agreed to, the Senate will proceed to executive session to debate for up to 6 hours the nomination of David Satcher to be the Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of HHS. 
As a reminder to all Members, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. However, the next rollcall vote will occur on invoking cloture on the Satcher nomination Tuesday at 11 a.m. If cloture is invoked on that nomination, then a second vote would occur immediately on the confirmation of the nomination. 
In addition, a cloture motion has been filed, on Thursday, on the motion to proceed to the cloning legislation. Therefore, a cloture vote will occur on Tuesday also. We will announce the exact time after consultation with the minority leader. This cloture motion is on the motion to proceed. 
Once again, I would like to note I do think this is an issue on which we should go forward. It is a complicated bill. There are some legitimate concerns that need to be addressed, or discussed at least. When Senators become familiar with the bill that has been crafted by Senator Bill Frist, who certainly knows the subject matter of medical research and science and the cloning issue, and then when they hear from Senator Bond and Senator Gregg and are able to be involved in discussion and debate, I think Senators will feel comfortable with what we are doing here and we should move this cloning legislation forward so that we will not have even the threat of human cloning. 
Also this week the Senate may consider the nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district judge in California and the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be a district judge in Pennsylvania. We will continue to work with the administration and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle with regard to a resolution on Iraq. 
As a reminder to all Members, the next rollcall vote then will occur at 11 a.m. on Tuesday morning to invoke cloture on the Satcher nomination.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the Senate has already had a healthy debate on the cloning legislation and I thank Senators Bond, Frist, Gregg and others for their leadership on this issue. I find it unfortunate that our democratic colleagues have chosen to block consideration of legislation at this time, even a motion to proceed. 
Clearly, this is an issue that has America's attention. The idea that so much progress has been made in the cloning area, and that we have doctors or scientists already threatening to clone human beings, is a very serious matter from a scientific, medical, moral and ethical standpoint. I don't think we can afford to set this issue aside without some immediate consideration and some immediate attention. 
I am very pleased that the Senators that are involved on both sides of the aisle are obviously very concerned, very thoughtful, and would like to get an agreement. 
I am particularly pleased that one of the leaders on our side of the aisle is Dr. Bill Frist of Tennessee, one of the Senators who knows the most about questions of science. He would never want us to sacrifice appropriate advancements in science and medical achievement in any way. The difference is he really knows what he's talking about. So, while there are some disagreements about how far to go, what would be appropriate, what would not be appropriate, a lot of good work has been done. 
It seems to me that the thing to do is to go forward. Let's have a continued debate in addition to what we have already heard from a half dozen or seven Senators or so. Let's have other Senators become informed, read the debate we have already had, think about this issue, study the bills, and make recommendations. If there are amendments by the Senator from California, I think they should be offered. Let's debate them and let's think about them. 
This is an issue whose time has come--maybe sooner than we would have ever dreamed, and maybe in a lot of ways we had not anticipated this. But if we don't act, what could be the result? Do we want to allow the possibility of human cloning to go forward? I don't think so. Leaders in the scientific and medical communities, and others, have already indicated their concerns about that. The President of the United States has made it very clear in an early statement that he wanted to make sure that this human cloning did not occur. So I urge the Senate--we can go forward with deliberate speed, which is always the case, but we should go forward and not have this pigeon-holed somewhere in the bowels of the building for weeks or months while time and events pass us by.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote occur at 11 a.m. on Thursday, February 10, with the mandatory quorum being waived and, further, that if cloture is invoked, the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on the confirmation of David Satcher to be Assistant Secretary of HHS and Surgeon General, all without any intervening action or debate. I further ask that following the vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.

Mr. LOTT. Once again, Mr. President, regarding this matter, I want to make it clear that there is no intent to rush to judgment here. This nomination has been pending for quite some time. There is strong support for this nomination on both sides of the aisle, and there are legitimate concerns about this nominee. I had indicated yesterday that we would not go forward to a vote until requested information from the Centers for Disease Control had been received, as requested by the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. I had FAXed that list to the Secretary of HHS, Secretary Shalala, and talked to her subsequently on the telephone. I had been told that there were seven items listed. One of them had already been provided, one was on the way, and the other five were being pursued. I believe that most of that information now has been obtained. If not, there is time for it to be received Saturday, Sunday, or Monday before we get to vote on Tuesday. 
I urge the White House, the Centers for Disease Control, and everybody involved, to make that information available. It was inferred that, well, it might be used against him. I don't know what the information is. It may be used against him. If it is out there and in the public record or should be in the public record, we need to know that, and we will make a decision. 
We have had time given to this nomination in that it has been pending a long time, and now we have had debate pointing out where the problems are and pointing out the assets of this nominee. I think we should not delay it any further. It would be my intent to vote for cloture, which I don't always do, but I think once you have had adequate time--in fact, I rarely do it, but I think this nominee should have a vote on his nomination. So if we in fact do come to a final vote on cloture, I will vote for cloture. That does not indicate how I would vote on final passage. I will make that final decision based on all the information made available before the vote occurs. But I think we should bring it to a conclusion.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to announce, for the information of all Senators, that at 3:45 the Senate will receive, on a bipartisan basis, the Secretary of State in S. 407 for a briefing on her recent visit to Europe and the Middle East. Then, also, a number of Senators and House Members will be meeting with Prime Minister Blair in the Rayburn Room on the House side at 4:30. So we would like to make sure that all Senators can attend the briefing at 3:45, and since we have such a large number of Senators that are going to be meeting with Prime Minister Blair, it would not be our intent to have recorded votes or further substantive business this afternoon. 
Obviously, we still have time for morning business speeches, if Senators would like to do that. That is why we are not scheduling anything else this afternoon legislatively, because these are very important meetings we have pending.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will not be in session tomorrow, but will convene on Monday, as I have just indicated, February 9--although no rollcall votes will occur on Monday--so that the debate can go forward on the Satcher nomination for the position of Assistant Secretary of HHS and Surgeon General. 
As a reminder to all Members, the next rollcall vote will occur then on invoking cloture on the Satcher nomination, if necessary, and I presume it will be at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, February 10. If cloture is invoked on that nomination, a second vote would occur immediately on the confirmation of the nomination. Also, a cloture motion was filed on the motion to proceed to the cloning legislation; therefore, that vote will occur on Tuesday as well.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in conclusion, before I take the Senate out following the statement of Senator Kennedy, I want to briefly comment on some statements that have been made today and yesterday here and in other arenas and forums. There are those saying we should immediately bring up the ISTEA highway bill. 
First, I want to remind the Senate that I urged the House and the Senate and interested parties to do this bill last year when it should have been done, because it expired last year. That is No. 1. No. 2, because it was not an election year and I knew, if we waited until this year, we would have less time and more pressure as we try to decide how $175 billion or more is fairly distributed across the country. 
I remind the Senators of that, and they know now and they knew then that I was right. I stood right here and filed not one, not two, not three, but four cloture motions to try to bring to a conclusion unrelated debate and delays based on pure politics, if I may suggest, but for an unrelated issue. I kept saying we need to deal with this bill, and others kept saying, `Until you agree to what we want on an unrelated issue, we are not going to let you bring up ISTEA.' 
That was a mistake. The Senate made a mistake. Now some of the same people not voting to bring it up last year are saying, `Where is it? Please bring it up,' demanding that it be brought up right away. 
Well, the world is different now. A lot has happened. For one thing, we find that we may actually have a little more money than we anticipated last year. There are very few Senators that have a longer history of having voted to spend the highway trust fund for the purpose it was intended--highways. There are very few places where I think the Government should be involved in spending money. Defense is one and budding infrastructure is the other. This is a place where people can't do it by themselves. The Government has to do its part. 
So I want this. I want more money. But I also have a responsibility as majority leader to look at this from the standpoint of how does it relate to the overall budget? How is it going to affect all these other programs? And what we did last year--we stood out here in the rotunda and said that we had reached an agreement with the President of the United States on a balanced budget, on how to control taxes and how to control spending. We entered into an agreement. We entered into an agreement in every category across the board. We said we will spend this much on transportation, this much on education, this much on housing, interior, energy, right across the board. 
Now, if we open the year up by raising spending, without looking at how it will affect everything else, we could break the dam and have another avalanche of spending. I am not saying it will happen. I am not saying how it should happen. I am just saying we should take our time and see what's going to happen before we charge forward. Why does the Senate need to do this when the House is not going to act? They are not going to act this month and not until at least the end of next month. I tried to get the Senate to show leadership and to lead and go first. The Senate would not do it. Now, let's act in concert. 
Let's work with the House. Let's do this together. Nobody wants to bring this up more than I do. But my responsibility as majority leader is to make sure that we have thought it through and know what the impact will be on a budget agreement that we gave our word to the American people on. I intend for us to keep it, and I will do everything I can to get that result.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me note that I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Missouri, and I certainly agree with him. When a U.S. Senator requests information from an agency or a department like the Centers for Disease Control about a nominee--I have looked over the list. This is certainly not an unreasonable request. It is one that should be able to be complied with very easily. That request has to be honored. I do have a call into the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Shalala, and will urge her to act expeditiously this afternoon to get that information to Senator Ashcroft. If that information is not forthcoming, then I certainly understand that there would be no way that this debate could be brought to a conclusion or a vote until all information that is requested by any Senator would be made available to this body. 
I thank Senator Ashcroft for not objecting at this time so we can proceed with the debate and make sure that all relevant information is available to the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to congratulate and express my appreciation to the Senator from Georgia for the leadership he has exhibited here. He kept calm and he got the job done. I think it was the right thing to do, and I am very proud that the Senate, in a very broad, bipartisan vote, voted to name this airport after former President Reagan. I had the opportunity to talk to a couple of colleagues here in the well as we were voting --Democrats who came up and remembered acts of kindnesses they had experienced from former President Reagan, and they voted for the legislation. 
I know some had reservations or misgivings, but I think it was the right thing to do and it was the right time to do it. I thank the Senator for his efforts; he did an excellent job. I thank one and all for their cooperation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, we begin the process of restoration. Restoration and renewal. Today, we look to our past, our history, as prologue of our future. We examine the events of recent years in the context of history in an effort to restore and renew our faith in this place we call America. They lynchpin of this process will be our restoration of what our flag--our American flag, the flag of these United States, the flag of what our founders referred to as `We, the People'--means to us as a people, as citizens, as people united in the common cause of Freedom. 
Our flag is no mere piece of cloth, even a brightly-colored piece of cloth--it is the symbol of our nation, and it stands for our ideals, our freedom, our hopes and dreams and, yes, our faith in our nation and in one another. 
Let's consider this common cause, freedom. Some may say that we need no symbols to embody this cause. I might agree with those people if I had no knowledge of our history or how the American flag is viewed by people around the world. 
For many, in this country and around the world, the American flag is the symbol of the freedom that they long for, that they strive to achieve and to preserve and that they honor. America has been called a `melting pot', where people of many cultures and nationalities come together to live, work and raise their families. Immigrants all, save those native Americans whose roots in this land we must also continue to honor and preserve, we recognize our fortune derived by living in a country where we don't merely talk about freedom, we practice and work to preserve it. 
Symbols such as our flag don't just appear and receive acceptance. The flag hanging at the Smithsonian didn't come to be so large by chance--those who made that flag wanted our people to see it waving in the breeze and take cheer and for our opponents to see it and beware. The flag was born in our struggle for independence, and continues to exist in our struggle to ensure freedom for all Americans and other peoples of this world. 
Our flag has survived burning and desecration in this country and in other countries. It will survive, as will our faith in our country and our freedoms, no matter the strength of our enemies. We who believe in this country must recognize that our symbols, such as our flag, are important and must be protected and preserved for they are the very embodiment of the ideals, hopes and dreams they stand for. We must protect our flag just as we would protect those ideals. 
In 1942, Congress recognized that the flag should be treated in a way more special than the way we treat any other symbol. That year, the Congress enacted the Flag Code to set requirements for how the flag should be 
displayed and honored. In that day and time, the question was not how to prevent destruction and desecration but merely to set rules for the care and handling of the flag. There was no thought given to doing what we propose to do today because it was beyond thought that conditions would exist in this country that would require such action. Even then, Congress recognized that with freedom comes responsibility. It is time that we recognize that responsibility again as our predecessors in the Congress in 1942 did. 
Mr. President, I will close by quoting from an address in 1914 by Franklin K. Lane, then Secretary of the Interior, to the employees of the Department of the Interior on Flag Day, commenting on what the flag might say to us if it could speak: 
I am song and fear, struggle and panic, and ennobling hope. 
I am the day's work of the weakest man, and the largest dream of the most daring. 
I am the Constitution and the courts, statutes and the statute-makers, soldier and dreadnaught, drayman and street sweep, cook, counselor, and clerk. 
I am the battle of yesterday and the mistake of tomorrow. 
I am the mystery of the men who do without knowing why. 
I am the clutch of an idea and the reasoned purpose of resolution. 
I am no more than what you believe me to be, and I am all that you believe I can be. 
I am what you make me, nothing more. 
I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color, a symbol of yourself, the pictured suggestion of that big thing which makes this nation. My stars and stripes are your dream and your labors. They are bright with cheer, brilliant with courage, firm with faith, because you have made them so out of your hearts. For you are the makers of the flag and it is well that you glory in the making. 
Mr. President, we made this flag as we made this nation. We can destroy this flag or we can protect and preserve it, just as we can destroy this nation or we can protect and preserve it. 
The choice is clear. The result is in our hands. As for me, I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
I urge the adoption and passage of this Constitutional amendment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business today until 10:30 a.m. Under a previous order, the Senate then will resume consideration of S. 1575, legislation renaming National Airport after former President Ronald Reagan. Under this consent that was entered into yesterday, there will be 4 minutes equally divided in the usual form before each vote on the remaining four amendments in order to S. 1575--amendment No. 1643 offered by Senator Robb, amendment No. 1641 offered by Senator Dodd, amendment No. 1640 offered by Senator Reid, and amendment No. 1642 offered by Senator Daschle--with a vote on final passage of S. 1575 following those votes. 
I guess it is possible still that there may be some change, some agreement on one of these amendments, at least where a recorded vote might not be necessary. But at this point we 
expect four votes on amendments and final passage beginning at 10:30. 
After that, the Senate will begin debate on the nomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon General. We do not know exactly how long will be needed for that debate, but at least the balance of the afternoon is anticipated, and it could actually go over until tomorrow. Senators will be notified if there are going to be additional votes today. There could be a vote on the Satcher nomination late this afternoon if we complete the debate and Senators are ready to vote; otherwise, it is anticipated the vote would then occur on the Satcher nomination tomorrow. 
We will consult with Senators about legislation that may come up tomorrow. We have a number of issues we are still working on, and we will make that announcement late this afternoon. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11:30. Under the order, the first hour will be under the control of the other side of the aisle and the second hour under the control of Senator Coverdell or his designee. 
At 11:30 the Senate will proceed to executive session for 30 minutes to debate and then to consider two judicial nominations: Carlos Moreno, of California, to be U.S. District Judge and Christine Miller, of the District of Columbia, to be a judge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. 
Following that debate, at approximately 12 noon, two back-to-back votes will occur on the confirmation of those nominees. And then after the first two votes at 12, at 12:30, by consent, the Senate will recess until 2:15 in order for the weekly party conferences to meet. 
It is my hope we will be able to consider and complete action on the Ronald Reagan airport naming bill. I will be consulting with the manager of that bill, Senator Coverdell, and others who have ideas of how it should be handled. I hope to be able to discuss it with Senator Daschle so we can work something out on that and then be able to complete it and move on to other bills or nominations that we had hoped to be able to take up. There is a possibility there could be another vote today, and I had expected that there would be a vote early on Wednesday morning, but we will not be able to determine that until we get something worked out on the Ronald Reagan airport bill. 
I do want to mention also as a reminder to all Senators that at 5 o'clock this afternoon, from approximately 5 until 6, in room S. 407 of the Capitol, there will be a briefing with regard to Iraq by Secretary Cohen and Sandy Berger, the National Security Council Adviser, and other military officials to bring us up to date on what is the situation in Iraq. 
We had hoped that Secretary Albright would be back and could attend that briefing, but she will not be present. I think it is important we go ahead with that briefing and then once she returns, maybe Thursday or early next week, we will ask her to come and brief us on what is happening and what happened during her trip to the Middle East and Europe. I think it is important we have close communication with the administration on what is happening, what they are finding from our allies and what their plans are so we can have input. So I invite Senators who possibly can to be in room S. 407 at 5 o'clock this afternoon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval officer, Commander Ray C. Simmons, upon his retirement from the Navy after more than twenty years of commissioned service. Throughout his career, Commander Simmons has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the Navy and the nation. 
Commander Simmons entered the United States Naval Academy from the State of New Hampshire in 1973 and was commissioned as an Ensign upon graduation in 1977. Since then, Commander Simmons has spent his career patrolling the world's oceans as a Naval Flight Officer and oceanographer. Following flight training, he began his service in Patrol Squadron Four in Barbers Point, Hawaii, making three deployments to the western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, including operations in support of the 1979-80 Iranian hostage crisis. In 1990, he joined the staffs of the United States Sixth Fleet and NATO Strike Force South, embarked in USS Belknap, homeported in Gaeta, Italy. During the Persian Gulf War, Commander Simmons, as Fleet oceanographer, served as a member of the TLAM cruise missile targeting team, planning strikes on Iraq from the eastern Mediterranean Sea. He also served as Flag Lieutenant and personal aide to the Sixth Fleet Commander. 
When not at sea, Commander Simmons has likewise served with distinction on the staffs of Patrol Wing Two and the Chief of Naval Operations, in the Naval Western Oceanography Center and as Aide and acting Deputy Executive Assistant to the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He served with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as the first Department of Defense liaison officer for joint NASA-Defense earth science applications programs. In 1995, he commanded the United States Naval Ice Center, with additional responsibility as Director of the joint Coast Guard, Navy and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration United States National Ice Center, and served as the lead Department of Defense lead technical advisor to the Russia-United States Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission Environmental Working Group. Among Commander Simmons's many awards and decorations are the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, four Meritorious Service Medals, two Navy Expeditionary Medals and the Southwest Asia Service Medal. He is both a qualified Naval Flight Officer and Naval oceanographer. 
During his more than twenty year career, Commander Simmons has served the United States Navy and the nation with excellence and distinction. He has been an integral member of, and contributed greatly to, the best-trained, best-equipped and best-prepared naval force in the history of the world. Commander Simmons's unflappable leadership, integrity, and limitless energy have had a profound and positive impact on the United States Navy and the nation. 
Commander Simmons will retire from the United States Navy on March 1, 1998, after twenty years and nine months of dedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Commander Simmons fair winds and following seas. Congratulations on completion of an outstanding and successful career.

One amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee regarding a commission; one amendment to be offered by Senator Dodd regarding a commission; one amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee regarding Dulles Airport naming; one amendment to be offered by Senator Coverdell, which is a technical change amendment; one amendment to be offered by Senator Reid regarding the FBI building renaming; one relevant amendment to be offered by Senator Lott or his designee; and one relevant amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee. 
I further ask that these amendments be the only amendments in order and they all be in the first degree and must be offered and debated prior to the close of business this evening, and any votes ordered with respect to the amendments or passage occur on Wednesday morning, at a time to be determined by the majority leader after notification of the Democratic leader.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for his comments. I think this is a fair agreement. Senators understandably want to be able to offer relevant amendments, and these amendments do pertain to this general area of discussion. I think that is reasonable. I think that is fair. I was concerned earlier on at the suggestions that were being made that we would wind up with just a litany of amendments making it impossible for us to bring this to a reasonable conclusion, and delaying other issues that we have already made a commitment to do. So I am pleased that we have this agreement.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further announce to all Senators that it will be my intention to call up and consider the IRS restructuring legislation no later than March 30, 1998. I have done that after consultation with Members on both sides of the aisle and, particularly, the chairman of the Finance Committee. He has assured me that he is very dedicated to getting this done. We found out last year in our hearings in the Finance Committee that, 
in fact, the abuses we had heard about were occurring. 
The House passed a bill that made some very positive changes and sent that over to the Senate right at the end of the session. We believe that we are finding out still other problems that exist, and that that bill can be strengthened. We have given our word, frankly, on both sides of the aisle, that we are going to deal with this issue and we are going to deal with it in a timely way. I think the Finance Committee may have another hearing or two, although I am not limiting it to that. I didn't ask the chairman how many more he wanted to have. We heard from the Secretary of Treasury last week and the new IRS Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti about their reorganization plans. We are still learning things that are happening in order to maybe try to change the culture at IRS, but at the same time we are continuously finding additional problems that have not been addressed in the bill that came across from the House. I believe we can have whatever additional hearings that we need to have and have a markup and have this legislation on the floor of the Senate by the end of March. 
The only reason why I didn't want to narrow it down more than that, frankly, is we have a number of issues we have to deal with in March, as Senator Daschle knows, such as NATO enlargement, the budget, supplemental appropriations, which I presume will involve at least a part, or all of IMF, as well as this issue. Now, I believe this issue may not take that much time. But we have to make sure that we have looked at the entire schedule for March and we have allowed appropriate time to consider this very important issue of restructuring of the IRS. I think this is a good agreement and we should move forward with it.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, we will be in a period of morning business from 12 noon until 1 p.m. to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. For this week's legislative schedule, it's my hope that the Senate will be able to complete consideration of the legislation renaming the Washington National Airport after former President Ronald Reagan. At this time, I am still hopeful that the other side of the aisle will allow the Senate to get a time agreement worked out so that we can complete that very, I think, appropriate legislation, in a reasonable time this week. Also, the Senate may consider a resolution regarding Iraq, as well as several nominations on the Executive Calendar, specifically, the nominations of Carlos Moreno and Christine Miller to Federal judicial appointments, as well as the nomination of David Satcher, to be an Assistant Secretary of HHS. 
As I announced last week, no rollcall votes will occur today. However, all Members should be prepared to be present and voting throughout the remainder of the week, with the exception of Friday. We will not have recorded votes on Friday. We will not be in session on Friday because of a conflict we have with a conference that a number of Members wish to attend. The first votes will occur as early as noon on Tuesday, February 3, with respect to the two judicial nominations. We had thought those votes would occur earlier, but we will have morning business first in the morning, and then we will have the two recorded votes probably right at noon. In addition, we will be in session next Monday, February 9. At this time, it is not anticipated that any votes will occur on that Monday, February 9. 
I thank all Senators for their attention. We will have, I suspect, a number of votes Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of this week. And then we will continue to move on to legislation that we have pending, which are very important to be considered before we go out for the President's Day recess. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join in extending my thanks to Dr. Neal Jones, and to express my appreciation to him for what he has meant in my own life and my family's life. 
He was a pastor at Columbia Baptist Church. My family and I attended there during the years that our children were in their teens, and it was a wonderful experience. As a matter of fact, he baptized our daughter, our son, and even my wife. So I have a special feeling in my heart for that church and for the pastor. We are delighted to have you here today. 
I, too, want to thank you for those little messages that I get at critical times in my life. Sometimes I am under certain pressure, and Dr. Jones seems to sense it. But he has a wonderful message always at the end: `No response necessary.' 
Thank you, Dr. Jones, for all you do.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request with regard to S. 1295, which is the naming of the National Airport the Ronald Reagan Airport. But before I propound that request, let me say I want to make some comments after we have this request, about why we are doing this, and put in the Record some of the history about what is involved. I have been talking to the principal sponsor, Senator Coverdell. I know he has been talking to Members on both sides of the aisle. Senator Daschle and I have talked about it. I don't think we have, it would appear, an agreement worked out as to how this is to be considered, but I hope we can continue to talk about why this is important, why we want to do it, and see if an agreement can be worked out. I think it is the right thing to do. 
One week from Friday is the birthday of former President Ronald Reagan. I think it would be a very good and a magnanimous gesture by the Congress and by the President of the United States if he could be able to sign this bill on President Ronald Reagan's birthday. That is why the timing is critical and why we want to go 
ahead and begin to talk about it. Because Senators on both sides of the aisle had conflicts today, we are not going to be able to vote on it today--or would not have been able to vote on it, probably, today, anyway. But it is my hope, my intent, that we could get it done next Tuesday and then complete the process so we could do this in recognition of this great President. 
I ask unanimous consent the Commerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1297 and further the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and further, that there be one amendment in order relative to the modification of the original bill, with total time for debate limited to 2 hours equally divided between Senators McCain and Hollings or their designees, and, following the debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the amendment, to be followed by third reading and final passage. I further ask that if a rollcall vote is requested in relation to the amendment or passage, the votes be postponed to occur on Tuesday, February 3, at a time to be determined by the majority leader after notification of the minority leader.

Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, for his comments. I know we will be interested in hearing the balance of his comments. I thank him for allowing me to explain a little bit about what is going on here, if I could. 
First of all I want to emphasize that the proposal is to name National Airport, which is commonly referred to as Washington National Airport, the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Washington National Airport was not named after George Washington. It was named after the District of Columbia, to denote a location, a physical location. I think everybody would understand that that would be appropriate, the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
This idea, as I understand it, originally came from the immediately-past Governor of Virginia, the State where this airport is located. That was the first time I ever heard it was from former Governor George Allen. 
The principal sponsor, Senator Coverdell, has worked in previous Republican administrations, has been committed to this and has been doing very good work in the preparation for this to happen. As for my personal situation, I had the clear impression that this was something that was supported by the family and friends of the President. 
But I also want to emphasize again something I noted earlier. The reason why we want to do it early is not just because we are looking for work, not just because we want to ram it through--I really thought it would go through, you know, on a shouted unanimous vote. It's because it is a special time in the life of a man who has meant so much to this country and to so many of us. 
In my 29 years in political life, this man, former President Ronald Reagan, has meant more than any other single person. I think history will show clearly he is one of the two greatest Presidents of this century, and in my opinion, the greatest by far. So I was very comfortable with moving it quickly, because of the birthday consideration. Keep in mind, now, this is a President, as you would expect from Ronald Reagan, who is sort of riding off into the sunset. He has been a credit to our country in so many ways, and since he has been President he has gone back to his beloved California and he has been battling a terrible disease that millions of Americans have to deal with, Alzheimer's disease. It is one of the programs, one of the diseases where we really don't fund adequate research. We hear all of these other things that are really looked into at NIH, all these other research programs, all these other problems, yet this one probably gets the short end of the stick. 
So I have been proud, and saddened, by the fact that he is afflicted, now in an advancing way, with this terrible disease. So I want, in any way we can, to say to him how much we appreciate him, what he has done for our country, and to his family and the sacrifices they made. Every President makes sacrifices to be President, and their families probably even more. So that is what is the driving force here. Who he is, what he is going through, what he has meant to this country, what he has meant to so many of us, and the fact that it is a special time in his life. 
The point is made, this is not an appropriate edifice. It is really not that pretty. It is new. 
Or that, `Gee, it may not even be here in 25 or 50 years. We need something, a monument, that will be there for 100 years, 200 years or 1,000 years.' I think there is some merit to that. 
Some people say, `We have this building down on Pennsylvania Avenue that is going to be named after him,' and that is fine. It is not as if we can only name one facility. I don't know how many Roosevelt monuments and memorials we have. That's OK, and I voted for memorials and monuments to a lot of Democrats. I don't think we vote on these things because they are Democrat or Republican. Once they become a former Secretary of State, like John Foster Dulles, or former President Kennedy, they are a former President or a former Secretary, and, in many instances, we owe them an awful lot. 
I even think somebody said, `Usually we wait until they have passed on.' I think it is a ridiculous idea. What good is it to them then? Do they have any idea how much they meant to us then? I don't think we ought to make it a practice to do it immediately or while they are still in office. But for special people and special occasions, I think it makes us a greater people. 
I would like to include some examples of memorials and monuments that in the past have been named for U.S. Presidents: John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, 1963; James Madison Building, 1965; Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Site, 1969; Harry S. Truman Dam and Reservoir, 1970; Lyndon B. Johnson Memorial Grove, 1973; Lyndon B. Johnson Manned Spacecraft Center, 1973; Lyndon B. Johnson Civilian Conservation Corps Center, 1974; Gerald Ford Building, 1977; Herbert Hoover Building, 1981; Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate System, 1990; Theodore Roosevelt Building, 1992; Ronald Reagan United States Courthouse, 1992; Woodrow Wilson Plaza, 1994; Ronald Reagan Federal Building and International Trade Center, 1995. 
I do believe that we want to do this in a bipartisan way. I know there are some in both parties in this country who are not all that excited about this--with good reason, I understand that. But I also know there are people on both sides of the aisle and all over the country who don't care about partisan politics who feel like this should be done. 
Maybe I am influenced in bringing this up by a speech I read just a couple weeks ago by Margaret Thatcher, another great leader in this century, a speech she made on December 10, 1997, at the Sheraton Washington Hotel.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just want to read some brief, selective passages from what Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of Great Britain, had to say: 
President Reagan is one of the greatest men of our time, and one of the greatest American Presidents of all time. If that is not fully appreciated today, and sadly it is not, it isn't really surprising. After all, so many people have been proved wrong by Ronald Reagan that they simply daren't acknowledge his achievement. . . 
But in my political lifetime I believe that it is fortitude or courage that we've most needed and often, I fear, most lacked. 
Today we are particularly conscious of the courage of Ronald Reagan. It was easy for his contemporaries to ignore it: He always seemed so calm and relaxed, with natural charm, unstudied self-assurance, and unquenchable good humor. He was always ready with just the right quip--often self-deprecatory, though with a serious purpose--so as to lighten the darkest moments and give all around him heart. . . 
Right from the beginning, Ronald Reagan set out to challenge everything that the liberal political elite of America accepted and sought [as gospel]. 
They believed that America was doomed to decline. He believed it was destined for further greatness. 
They imagined that sooner or later there would be convergence between the free Western system and the socialist Eastern system, and that some kind of social democratic outcome was inevitable. He, by contrast, considered that socialism was a patent failure which should be cast onto the trash heap of history. 
They thought that the problem with America was the American people, though they didn't quite put it [that way.] He thought that the problem with America was the American government, and he did put it just [that way.] 
In conclusion, and what I think is so beautiful a statement about our country and our world and about Ronald Reagan, she summed it up perfectly. She said:  
It is time to proclaim our beliefs in the wonderful creativity of the human spirit, in the rights of property and the rule of law, in the extraordinary fecundity of enterprise and trade, and in the Western cultural heritage, without which our liberty would long ago have degenerated into license or collapsed into tyranny. 
These are as much the tasks of today as they were of yesterday, as much the duty of our conservative believers now as they were when Ronald Reagan and I refused to accept the decline of the West as our ineluctable destiny. 
As the poet said: `That which thy fathers bequeathed thee Earn it anew if thou would'st possess it.' 
A great speech. I have just taken some portions from it. It meant a great deal to me. 
I hope we will honor former President Ronald Reagan in this way. I can think of a lot of Democrats I would be perfectly willing to name some building or some facility for. I think President Jimmy Carter has really been an example since he has been President. I don't know that we have named anything after him. I don't know that he sought it, or his family. I am not saying we should do it now. This is not partisan with me, but it is very emotional, and I hope that we will find a way, working together, to get this bill through in time for his birthday. I yield the floor. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will proceed to 2 hours of morning business with several Senators recognized for individual periods of time. 
At 12 noon it is my hope that the Senate can consider the Ronald Reagan Airport naming bill and/or the Senate concurrent resolution condemning Iraq's threat to international peace and security. It was my hope that the minority leader would be able to enter into a reasonable time agreement on both of these issues which would allow for the debate to occur today and any amendments and votes on those amendments and final passage to occur on the morning of Tuesday, February 3rd. I am now informed at this point that will not be possible. Therefore, those votes could occur today. 
Now, there are some ominous signs on the horizon that really bother me. This is the first week that we are back. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things. I understand that. I know Senators didn't expect a lot to occur in terms of votes this week. But already I have had numerous Senators come to me and say, `Oh, could we not have votes on Thursday? Certainly we will not have them on Friday and Monday, and, by the way, I can't vote on Tuesday morning.' 
There is a limit to how much the Democratic leader and I 
can cooperate with Senators in protecting their schedules. I certainly have a record that shows that I am sensitive to that. I would like for the Senate to work during the daylight instead of night, for instance, and we achieved that to some degree. But if every Senator thinks that he or she can inconvenience 99 Senators because they have some little bit they want to do somewhere, that is not the way it is going to work this year. They should not start out that way. 
So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, don't do this. Don't even come to leadership on both sides of the aisle and say, `Can you defer a vote on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday?' or, for that matter, late Monday afternoons or Friday mornings. We have legislative days this year that will probably add up to around 100 days and a lot of work to do--a lot of important budget issues, infrastructure issues, foreign policy issues that we can't ignore or delay. 
So I am not threatening. I am not complaining yet. This is the kickoff. We will get going here pretty quickly. But I am having difficulty getting Senators to be ready to go to work. I have at least four bills that we should consider this week or next week, and for one reason or another I am being told, `Well, we are not quite ready.' 
The recess is over. It is time for the class to get back to work, and let's work to do that.

Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation in this. This is not just on one side of the aisle. We are both working this problem. We will fulfill our obligation as leaders in ways that have not always been the case around here. 
Senators have already been told when they can expect to be in session or have recess periods for the whole year. We will indicate as far in advance as we can when we may not have a vote on Friday or Monday if we know for sure, for instance, that there is a conflicting conference. We will also try to have a legislative calendar that really shows the bills we are going to be dealing with all year. 
So we will give everybody as much advance notice as we possibly can, and then we would expect cooperation in return. 
On the Iraq resolution, this is an important resolution. This is a sensitive time. I think we should think about it carefully. There is no need to rush to judgment. We ought to talk about it. We ought to think about it. We ought to make it clear what our concerns are about Saddam Hussein and the fact that the inspectors are not in Iraq. We need to think about its ramifications not only for the region but the world. We need our allies to be with us--not just the British but the French, the Russians, and the Chinese, 
and everybody else because this is a threat to the whole world. We need to make it clear that the present situation will not stand. 
This resolution that Senator Daschle and I have been working on, as always you have to craft it with words of art. You have to make sure that you have the right words in there. And we do not want to go beyond what is responsible. But I think that it is timely. I think we would have been doing this resolution sometime in the first 2 weeks at the beginning of this year regardless of other events unrelated to this. This is something that the Senate usually does. 
So again, I urge Senators to look this resolution over. Let's do the responsible thing and let's do it very quickly. We need to have a full discussion. We need to do it today. And we can do it again on Monday. But we should vote on it on Tuesday. If not, it could be overrun by other events maybe not as important. But we already have the schedule set for Tuesday in terms of some debate and some votes on nominations. We have a couple of other bills that we are considering for next week. 
Senator Daschle will work with me. And let's just talk today about how we can proceed today and whether or not we know we are going to have votes today or when we can be assured we will have votes on Tuesday morning. 
Thank you, again, and I thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

I have spent some time with the distinguished Democratic leader. We have talked in general about bills we want to try to consider before the Easter recess in April, and of course we have gone over the schedule just for this week. We have a number of very important legislative items that we need to consider before the Easter recess, including, I hope, even a budget resolution. I think it is important this year that we not go after April the 15th to take up a budget resolution. I will be talking further to the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member and the leadership to make sure that we are all in agreement in that effort.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, no legislative or executive business will be transacted during today's session. Therefore, no votes will occur during the session of the Senate today. We will recess mid to late afternoon to reconvene at 8:30 p.m. this evening in the Chamber. All Members are asked to be in the Chamber at approximately 8:30 in order that we can go over as a body to the Hall of the House of Representatives to hear the President's State of the Union Address beginning at 9 p.m. this evening. 
During tomorrow's session we will consider three judicial nominations, those being Barry Silverman to be a circuit judge for the ninth circuit, Richard Story, to be a district judge for the northern district of Georgia, and Ann Aiken, to be a district judge in Oregon. We hope to enter into a time agreement of approximately 2 hours, with rollcall votes expected on each nomination. Therefore, there could be three votes tomorrow, Wednesday. In fact, I think the Members should expect that there will be three votes. 
Then on Thursday of this week we hope to consider the Ronald Reagan airport bill which is presently in the Commerce Committee. Amendments could be offered. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur on that item on Thursday of this week. 
The Senate will not be in session on Friday. Following the Senate's consideration of the Ronald Reagan bill, the Senate would proceed over until Monday, February 2nd. The schedule for Monday will be announced later in the week. However, no votes will occur during the session on Monday. We do expect votes, of course, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of next week. 
We will be talking to committee chairmen, sponsors of bills and with the Democratic leadership to decide exactly what bills could come up. We are considering possibly the PUHCA legislation, the Public Utilities Holding Company Act modifications. We are still considering a cloning bill that I believe could be considered. We have several others that we are considering, as well. 
Next week we expect to take up the FEC, the Federal Election Commission nominees, the nomination of Mr. Satcher to be the Surgeon General, and possibly two more Federal judges that are now going through the process of being cleared. 
I do want to say, again, Mr. President, I appreciate the year we had last year. I thought we had a good year. I thought we accomplished a great deal for the American people, most of the time with very little rancor. I want us to continue to be able to work together for the interests of the people and do it in a way where Members are not exhausted and they can do their work during the daylight instead of always at night. 
I want to thank those of you that work for the Senate here in the Chamber. You do outstanding work and we quite often don't thank you sufficiently for the way you help us keep things running smoothly doing the people's business here in the Senate. 
I do look forward to a very active year even though we may have around 100 legislative days--because of the necessity of adjourning early in October for the election. There are several things we need to do and we will do for the best interests of the American people. I look forward to working with the Senate and working with the leadership on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to recognize the work of a man who has been a real asset to this institution. He has many fans in this room, both here on the floor of the Senate and up there in the press gallery. His name is Maurice Johnson, Superintendent of the Senate Press Photographers Gallery. He is retiring this year after nearly 30 years. 
What a perspective--30 years of life in the Senate through a photographer's eye. Maurice has seen the entire range of congressional milestones, celebrations, inaugurations, investigations, and, of course, occasional legislation. He has taken part in sharing those events with the world, helping in many ways to ensure that the media coverage has run smoothly. No one has yet found a corner of the Capitol for which Maurice doesn't know the best angle and lighting. 
Maurice is a voice for all photographers who cover the Senate day to day. As liaison between the Senators and the photographers, he has been an effective adviser, advocate, and coordinator. 
He has been most helpful to my staff and to me over the past year and a half as we have adjusted to our leadership role. I thank him for his graciousness always under all circumstances. 
We should not forget that Maurice is an accomplished photographer himself. He captured history as he covered the administrations of Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. Many of the images that we have from national political campaigns and conventions are Maurice's work. Some assignments must have been less like work than others, though. Photography for him has included the Redskins games or the U.S. Open golf tournament. Sometimes it has been the Miss America pageant. It certainly seems to me he hasn't exactly always had a tough day at the office. It sounds like it has been fun. 
His talents have been rewarded by a steady stream of awards that have names like `Best Picture of the Year' and `First Prize.' He has been honored nationally for single photos, for his work in the Senate Photographers Gallery, and for the entire span of his career. 
At a recent reception in Maurice's honor, the room overflowed with colleagues, friends, and family members who conveyed their affection and high regard for him. Now, as the session draws to a close, I want to take the opportunity to let Maurice know how much we in the Senate appreciate him and his work. I am sure my colleagues join me in thanking him for his many years of dedication. We wish him, his wife Lanny, and their children, Keith and Maureen, well. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. It is hoped that during today's session the Senate will be able to complete its business for the 1st session of the 105th Congress. I just talked to the Democratic leader and we agreed to push to accomplish that today. In fact, I read over the weekend a quote from General Eisenhower. When he was President he said, `There are many problems in Washington, but one of the main reasons is we have too long been away from home.' So I'm hoping that we will honor his admonition and go home at the close of business today for the balance of the year to be with our constituents.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- N O T I C E   Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on the 31st day after adjournment in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.   All materials for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices responsible for the Record in the House or Senate between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday (until the 10th day after adjournment). House Members should deliver statements to the Office of Floor Reporters (Room HT-60 of the Capitol) and Senate Members to the Office of Official Reporters of Debate (S-123 in the Capitol).   The final issue will be dated the 31st day after adjournment and will be delivered on the 33d day after adjournment. None of the material printed in the final issue of the Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any event, that occurred after the adjournment date.   Along with signed statements, House Members are requested, whenever possible, to submit revised statements or extensions of remarks and other materials related to House Floor debate on diskette in electronic form in ASCII, WordPerfect or MicroSoft Word format. Disks must be labeled with Members' names and the filename on the disk. All disks will be returned to Member offices via inside mail.   Senators statements should also be submitted electronically, either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to the Official Reporters of Debate at `Record@Reporters'.   Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by contacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the Government Printing Office, on 512-0224.   By order of the Joint Committee on Printing.   JOHN WARNER, Chairman.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
As Members are aware, the House passed both the District of Columbia appropriations bill and the foreign operations conference reports last night. It is hoped that the Senate can voice vote those bills during today's session as we await House action on the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations conference report, and I expect them to accomplish that before late in the afternoon. In fact, I expect it to be in the early afternoon. 
If a voice vote is not possible, then Members will be notified as to when we might have a rollcall vote or votes. Again, I think it would be in the best interests of the Senate at this time if we could do this with a voice vote. The so-called controversial positions in the District of Columbia bill and the foreign operations conference reports have been removed, and I believe an agreement has been reached with the administration on Commerce, State, and Justice with regard to items in that bill, as well as the provisions with regard to census. 
If there are rollcall votes, I emphasize we will try to notify Members with at least a 4-hour advance notice and the time span that that vote might occur in. If we can't complete today with just voice votes then there is a possibility that we would have to go over until tomorrow if there is going to be a rollcall vote because I do think Members are entitled to significant advance notice so they can be sure to be here. Or, if we can't get it done in a reasonable way today or tomorrow, there is always next week, which would really begin to stretch what President Eisenhower had warned us against. In order to avoid that, we are going to need a very good attitude and a lot of cooperation. I think that is possible. 
We are still working on the few remaining Executive Calendar items. There are only 15 or so nominations left on the calendar. We are hoping to clear some of those today, and then those that would require some debate or recorded votes would be scheduled early in the session when we come back next year. 
Again, we need cooperation of the Senators that are here today, and between the leadership on both sides of the aisle so we can complete action. We accomplished a great deal over the weekend by voice vote and in our wrap-up. We passed a lot of really good bills. We still have a chance to get a conference report from the House on Amtrak, with only one major change, as I understand it--one I think the Senate could live with. That is the makeup of the board of Amtrak. 
I remind our colleagues that we did pass and send to the President a fix with regard to the ISTEA transportation bill, that we did pass and send to the President the FDA reform package, as well as the foster care and adoption bill, and earlier had sent the Labor-HHS and education appropriations bill. So we are down, really, to these three final bills. There could be a fourth bill sent separately that would include the State Department reorganization, U.N. arrearage, IMF funds, as well as some language with regard to the Mexico City population control issue. If that bill could not be brought up or was objected to or filibustered, of course, we would not be able to get to a final vote on that. But the three key bills we need to bring up today are the three appropriations conference reports and we will notify Members when we will act on those and if any recorded votes are necessary. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Daschle for his comments and the accuracy of the years of service. I note that the President pro tempore is working now as we are commending him. He is diligently tending to his duties as the real leader of the Senate. 
I want to note also that throughout the year, whether we have come in early or the middle of the day, whatever it might be, he was unfailingly waiting at the door, ready to call the Senate to order, and a couple times instructed the younger Member--the majority leader--that I was cutting it mighty close and we needed to start right on time. We were supposed to start at 9 or 9:30, and he expected me to be present and accounted for. 
But I want to join Senator Daschle in expressing my admiration and great appreciation to Senator Thurmond, for the tremendous job he does for his people in South Carolina and what a credit he is to the Senate and what a great job he does for our country.  
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Our word has been good to each other. While on occasion we disagree on substance and sometimes we are a bit testy in our remarks, I think overall over the past year and a half since I have had the honor of serving as a majority leader our relationship has been a healthy one and good for the overall atmosphere in the Senate and I hope we can continue that relationship as we go into the second session of the 105th Congress.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are a couple of matters yet to be completed tonight, including the Amtrak reform package that should be coming momentarily from the House. Senator Daschle and I want to notify the President we are moving toward completion of our work tonight. 
Later on, when we have the final announcement, we will advise the Senate that it would reconvene, the 105th Congress, second session, following a live quorum the morning of January 27, and there would be a live quorum which would proceed morning business until 2 p.m. on that day, and on Tuesday night, January 27, at 9 p.m., we would have the President's State of the Union Address. So the Senate will convene, then, that night at 8:30 in order to proceed to the body of the Hall of the House of Representatives to hear the address. 
There will be no legislative business on Tuesday, January 27 except for those actions that may be cleared for unanimous consent. Therefore, no votes will occur during the session on that Tuesday. 
Senators should be aware that the following items are expected to be considered during the early days of the second session of the 105th Congress: The ISTEA transportation infrastructure bill; juvenile justice; the nomination of Margaret Morrow of California to a judgeship; and the nomination of Ann Aiken, prior to the end of the first week. 
I do want to thank my colleagues for their cooperation throughout this session of Congress, and especially on the Executive Calendar. I know there has been a lot of effort made there on both sides of the aisle and we leave just a very few on that calendar. I note we have confirmed this year 36 judges. I believe we will act on at least four or five others very quickly in the beginning of the next session. We had three reported today by the Judiciary Committee, all of which I understand were noncontroversial, but it was late in the afternoon and we did not have the time to give Senators proper notice that we would proceed. 
So I expect that we will do those the first week back, also. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on Tuesday, January 27, when the Senate reconvenes the 105th Congress, second session, following a live quorum, the Senate will proceed to morning business then until 2 p.m. 
Tuesday night at 9 p.m. is the President's State of the Union Address. Therefore, the Senate will reconvene Tuesday evening at approximately 8:30 p.m. in order to proceed as a body to the Hall of the House of Representatives to hear the address of the President. There will be no legislative business on the 27th except for those items that may be cleared for action by unanimous consent. Therefore, no votes will occur during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, January 27. 
Senators should be aware that following that day, on the 28th and after, we will be expected to call up early in the session the ISTEA transportation bill, juvenile justice, the nomination of Margaret Morrow, and the nomination of Ann Aiken, both to be considered for judicial positions, and the nomination of Ann Aiken will be taken up prior to the end of the first week. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for their cooperation during this session of Congress.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to address the status of the Ocean Shipping bill and the implementation of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement in the Senate. These are very important bills which are badly needed to reform America's maritime industry. 
A number of my Senate colleagues joined me in working very hard this year, in a bipartisan way, to get these two bills done. The legislation and amendments reflected a balance among the concerns of all affected parties. However, I must report that a few Senators have held up each bill. This minority of Senators wants more than most of us believe is do-able. Given the waning hours of this session, the Senate will not be able to consider and pass either of these bills this year. I am deeply disappointed. 
Mr. President, maritime issues are very important to me. I grew up in the port town of Pascagoula. I still live there. My father worked in the shipyard. I have spent my entire adult life working on maritime issues. So I am very concerned by the Senate's inaction on these two pieces of legislation. 
The Ocean Shipping Act is D.I.W: `dead in the water', at least for this year. The incremental Shipping Act reforms have been stopped because some want to inject new issues into the legislation. Issues that should be resolved at the labor-management negotiating table. Issues not directly related to making America's container ships more competitive in the international marketplace. 
Mr. President, the bill's sponsors have made it clear on several occasions that we are not trying to undo or inject the Senate into the collective-bargaining process for port labor agreements. These concerns can and should be addressed in a fair and even-handed manner at the bargaining table. 
Despite my efforts to work through this issue this past weekend, some Senators on the other side of the aisle have chosen to stop the Ocean Shipping Reform bill. 
Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform bill is necessary. 
Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform bill helps U.S. exporters in every State of this nation compete with their foreign competitors. 
Without Ocean Shipping Reform, the Senate keeps 50 states D.I.W. for a small organized group. 
Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform bill helps America's container ships and exporters. 
When we take up this bill early next year, each Senator will be asked to choose between helping the thousands of workers in his or her State or harming them. 
Mr. President, the second piece of important maritime legislation I would like to see passed is the implementation of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, signed nearly 3 years ago. This legislation, I am disappointed to report, is also D.I.W. 
Senators on two committees worked very hard this session, in a bipartisan manner, to address the legitimate concerns of our nation's largest shipyards. U.S. participation in this agreement is essential, but it must be based on the firm understanding that the Jones Act and national security requirements regarding vessel construction will not be restricted by other countries. What America desires is a level playing field, without compromising our national security interests. 
I believe that S. 1216, with the Lott-Breaux amendment, addresses these principles in a good faith effort to resolve the issues identified by Representative Bateman. I would not support any legislation that didn't respect these principles. 
Let me be clear. I am a Jones Act supporter, period. And I believe the amendment protects the integrity of the Jones Act. 
But once again, a few Senators have stopped this vital legislation in mid-ocean. Another D.I.W. bill. 
This minority of Senators wants to include additional exceptions to the OECD Agreement's limitations on commercial vessel construction subsidies and credits. I am concerned that this attempt will scuttle the entire Agreement. This is counter-productive. This would force U.S. shipbuilders back into a subsidy race that the U.S. cannot afford to win. This small minority of Senators are not just stopping this legislation in mid-ocean, but scuttling it--sinking it. And I believe that, no matter how well-meaning they may be, they will eventually jeopardize the very U.S. commercial shipbuilding industry they are trying to protect. Our commercial shipbuilding industry needs a worldwide, level playing field. We need it now. 
Mr. President, it is time for these few Senators to set aside narrow regional and partisan interests and take up an oar and start rowing with the rest of the Senate. The Senate needs to get the Ocean Shipping and OECD bills moving. I intend to put these bills to a Senate vote early next year. 
In the meantime, the Senate has left two vital pieces of maritime legislation stranded in the middle of the ocean, for a long winter. D.I.W. Dead in the water. This is not good for America's maritime world. This is not good for America.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend my congratulations to the Senator from New Hampshire for his work on this very important appropriations bill. I should note it is the 13th and final appropriations conference report, the last one across the line, but a big one and an important one--Commerce, State, and Justice and related agencies. It also became a vehicle for a number of Senators to attempt to address problems, as it was the last conference report to go through the Congress. 
It was quite a struggle, but an important one. I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his good work. I should also note the cooperation he received from the ranking member, the Senator from South Carolina. I thank the Senator for his work. I am glad we had our colleagues from the other side of the Capitol also work with us on this effort, which was a very interesting experience.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it would be my intention. Of course, we would need to confer on that with the committee leaders. But I believe that Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus would like to take it up early. I talked with Senator Daschle about it. That is something I would like to maybe begin on the next day after the State of the Union but right at that first part. So we can go ahead and do our work and, hopefully, the House will follow our leadership. 
One other issue that could come up early next year would be the juvenile justice bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee. I believe there is some language in the omnibus bill that we passed that would provide funds for it, but those funds are fenced until we do authorization. So that is something that could come up. And before we go out for the President's Day recess, we would also take up the Morrow nomination for a judicial position.

Mr. LOTT. Throughout the day yesterday, meetings were occurring between the House and Senate leadership on the highway bill. We had passed in the Senate, as the Senator will recall, a fix which allowed flexibility so that some funds could be moved between accounts, if necessary, to keep the Department of Transportation employees working. I think there was a transit accommodation. So I think it had about four parts. 
During the day yesterday, they were meeting with their counterparts in the House. I was led to believe last night that they had come to an agreement and that agreement, whatever it is--I just can't give you the total outlines of it now--would be attached to either the omnibus appropriations bill or one of the appropriations bills that would be going to the President for his signature.

Mr. LOTT. I am not sure. As I said, I don't know what they came up with, but necessary actions to provide for safety, transit funds, and flexibility over some additional funds depending on what they agreed to, which I assume would take us to May 1. 
But I do think, again, it is very important we have some deadline on this. Otherwise, we will never bring this very important but very difficult issue to a conclusion.

Mr. LOTT. Absolutely. 
Do I have time? 
If the Senator will allow me to respond--and I will yield the floor if you would like me to--the Senate, I believe, has acted very responsibly on this in terms of the package we had before us, the 6-year package within the budget. Obviously, there will be some important amendments to be offered. 
As the Senator is aware, it got tangled up on an unrelated issue, but that issue will not be hanging over us on this bill when we come back. 
What has me worried is I believe there are people really kind of interested in dragging this out because they want to keep the formula as it now is. I think the existing formula is fundamentally unfair to States like my own, and so I am very anxious for the Senate to keep the pressure on to move a 6-year bill that comes up with a fairer formula but also lives within budget constraints.

Mr. LOTT. That is absolutely the case. But the problem they had in the House--we both served in the House; we know what it is like--highway infrastructure and transportation funds are very, very important in every State. This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue that divides us, some not really even by regions; States side by side can have a different view of the formula. And I think they pushed the 6-month proposal because they could not get the votes for anything else right then. But I think if the Senate does not show leadership and keep the pressure on them, we will never get this issue resolved. 
That is why I had not wanted to do anything akin to 6 months. I wanted us to have some basic flexibility so States could reprogram, move funds around and make sure we had the safety fund but keep the heat on. 
But I think the best thing that we could do on that right now is to make sure there is not a short-term problem with availability of funds, realizing that in the colder States you need to do contracting in December and perhaps early January to have those programs underway in the spring. 
But again, it is my intent for the Senate to go ahead and take up this issue and address it early to put pressure on the House and also so that whenever they do get their act together and vote, we will be ready for conference. But I do think it is irresponsible for a Member on either side of the aisle, whether he or she be a chairman or not, to say they are not going to go to conference with the other body if the other body doesn't pass a bill that they like. We have feifdoms around here, but I believe we should not have that type of attitude or we will never bring this important issue to a reasonable conclusion. 
That is all I am pushing for. That is why I have tried to push this bill all this year. Frankly, in our own body I think our colleagues made a mistake by letting it drag out to this fall. I thought it should have been done last spring. I had a tentative schedule for the Senate to take it up in April of this year, last April. I know they had a hard time working it out in committee, but to their credit they worked it out and brought out a good, broadly bipartisan bill. 
It will be a focus that we need to work on and we need to do it earlier in the year, because if we wait until next September right before elections, there will be no way we can do it.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution designating April 6 of each year as `National Tartan Day,' not only to recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by Scottish-Americans to the United States, but to better recognize an important day in the history of all free men, April 6. 
It was nearly 700 years ago, on April 6, 1320, that a group of men in Arbroath, Scotland, enumerated a long list of grievances against the English king of the day, asserted their independence in no uncertain terms, and claimed that they, the people of Scotland, had the right to choose their own government. They wrote, `We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his life * * *' 
These were daring words, because the Scots who wrote those words lived in dangerous times. Violence ruled the world. Wars were fought for property, for conquest, for great tracts of land in far away countries. 
But the Scots who met on that cold April day, perhaps in the rain, were not fighting for property or conquest or estates. They wrote, `We fight for liberty alone.' This was all they fought for. Liberty. 
These were daring words--dangerous words--words that could bring certain death to them and their families. These Scotsmen were claiming liberty as their birthright. They were claiming they were born free men--and no king, no baron, no landlord with his troops could take this liberty from the men in Scotland. 
These were words that lasted, long after kings and buildings had fallen into ruin. These were words that endured, like the mountains, hills and stones of Scotland. 
These were words that reached across the years, the centuries, across the ocean. Over 450 years later, a group of men stood in a building in the British colony of Pennsylvania, on a hot summer's day, debating and then signing their own declaration of independence. They used the Arbroath Declaration as the template for their own thoughts, their own words. This was natural--many of the men in that room in Philadelphia, almost half, were of Scottish ancestry. The draftsman of the document was Thomas Jefferson--one of his ancestors had signed the Arbroath Declaration, all of those centuries before. The words of the Arbroath Declaration meant something to those men--they were daring words--words that would not be quiet, that would not lie quiet and still on some forgotten Scottish hill. The men in Philadelphia that day remembered those words--`We fight for liberty alone'--and the men in Philadelphia signed their own declaration of independence. 
The words and thoughts of those long-ago Scottish patriots live on in America. Liberty, true liberty, has been good to their descendants in America. Scottish-Americans have helped build this nation since the beginning. Three-fourths of all American presidents can trace their roots to Scotland. The contributions of Scottish-Americans are innumerable: Some of the great have included Neil Armstrong, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Alva Edison, William Faulkner, Malcolm Forbes, Billy Graham, Alexander Hamilton, Washington Irving, John Paul Jones, John Marshall, Andrew Mellon, Samuel F.B. Morse, James Naismith, Edgar Allen Poe, Gilbert Stuart, Elizabeth Taylor, to name only a few. 
But beyond all of the accomplishments of Scottish-Americans, beyond all the wonderful inventions like the telegraph and telephone and electric light, all the works of literature, all the great businesses and charitable organizations founded by Scottish-Americans, beyond all of those accomplishments, are the words. `We fight for liberty alone * * * We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his life.' 
Those are haunting words. Those are words that haunted the men who passed them down for generations, wherever men dreamed of being free, words that haunted the men who rewrote them in Philadelphia on that hot, steamy day, words that have haunted generations of Americans. Words that have lived inside men, unspoken, as they marched to Yorktown, as they lined up quietly behind the cotton bales in New Orleans, marched to Mexico, sailed to Cuba and the Philippines, and Europe and the Pacific and Korea and the Persian Gulf. These are words that live inside all of us Americans, and especially inside our veterans: `We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his life.' And how many have lost their lives for our freedom. 
It is appropriate that we honor April 6 as National Tartan Day. The Scottish clansmen who met on that cold day and declared their independence were our clansmen, no matter what nation we hail from. They were our brothers. 
Mr. President, I ask all my colleagues to support this resolution, so that we may never forget, so that the world, in some small way, may never forget, the beginnings of freedom in far-away, long-ago Arbroath.

Also, I want to thank their staffs for the work that they did well into the night last night. I know their names have already been mentioned, but I just want to add my commendations because I know that they really worked hard to get an agreement. 
Of course, this was just a preliminary bout of what will be a major fight next year in getting the big long-term bill done.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in conjunction with the previous consent, Wednesday the Senate will be in a period of morning business from 12 noon to 12:30 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate may consider and complete final action on the following items, all in an effort to adjourn the first session of the 105th Congress. Those items include: Additional motions if necessary with respect to the omnibus appropriations bill; the adoption-foster care legislation; and any legislative or Executive Calendar items cleared for action. 
As previously announced, no rollcall votes will occur during Wednesday's session of the Senate, with sufficient notice being given to Senators if votes are necessary on Thursday, November 13. 
So we could have a vote on an omnibus appropriations bill or it could be that we would have to have votes on the separate appropriations bills, and that could be as many as three. It will just depend on how negotiations go between House and Senate conferees and the leadership over the next couple days. Senators will be notified as soon as a decision is made concerning possible votes on Thursday. 
The Senate will not be in session on Tuesday of this week in observance of the Veterans Day holiday.

Mr. LOTT. This morning the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate intends to consider and complete action on the following: A continuing resolution which continues funding through Friday, November 14; adoption of the foster care conference report--I am very pleased that we have been able to bring that very important matter to a favorable completion because it certainly needs to be done, and I think it is going to be a great help in getting children in foster care into adoption--and any other Legislative or Executive Calendar items that we can get cleared. However, no rollcall votes will occur in today's, Tuesday's, or Wednesday's session of the Senate. Of course, that is in observance of Tuesday, which is Veterans Day. Members will be given sufficient notice if any votes will occur on Thursday. 
At this point there is a possibility of a couple of votes on Thursday, that is, Thursday, November 13, and there are some items that we would have to deal with yet, either an omnibus appropriations bill or the appropriations bills separately, if they wind up coming back to us in that way. But those would be the final items that we probably need to do before we adjourn for the first session. 
The House has recessed until Wednesday, November 12, with the intention of concluding the appropriations process on that day. It is hoped that a few other remaining items can be considered by voice vote during Wednesday's session of the Senate, although I emphasize again no recorded votes. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say at this time exactly what we can expect on Thursday. As the Members are finding out now, the House did not get to a conclusion on fast track. While we have not had enough time yet to discuss what happens next on that issue with the House leadership or with the administration, Senator Daschle and I have talked this morning. I have talked to the President's Chief of Staff. They will be having meetings this morning, and we would have some further announcement to make perhaps today or later on this week on what further will happen on the fast-track trade issue, if anything. Also, because of the energy and time that went into the fast-track efforts to come up with the votes in the House late last night, the House was not able to take up, of course, and deal with the appropriations bills. We will be working on that today and Wednesday.

After consultation with many, many Senators and especially the Democratic leader, I now ask that the Senate turn to the D.C. appropriations bill, H.R. 2607, and Senator Stevens be recognized to offer a substitute amendment and that there be 2 hours of debate to be equally divided in the following fashion: 30 minutes between Senators Stevens and Byrd, 30 minutes between Senators Faircloth and Boxer, 30 minutes between Senators Gregg and Hollings, 30 minutes between Senators McConnell and Leahy. 
I further ask that no other amendments or motions be in order, and following the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the amendment be agreed to and the bill be advanced to third reading and passage, and all occur without further action or debate. 
I further ask that following the adoption, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees, all without further action or debate. 
I ask unanimous consent that in the event that H.R. 2607 is sent to the President without a conference, the Committee on Appropriations, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking member, be permitted to file in the Record within 2 days of final passage and to print as an official document of the Senate a report on the final version of H.R. 2607 as enacted by the Congress. 
Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of H.R. 2607, the Senate proceed to S. 1502 regarding D.C. scholarships, the bill be read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without further action or debate.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I talk about today's schedule, I do want to commend a number of Senators who have been doing yeomen's work over the past 2 days. Even though we haven't had a lot of recorded votes, we have been making good progress. I remind the Senate that we did come to an agreement after actually at least 3 years of going back and forth on a bipartisan Amtrak bill, which passed on Friday on a voice vote. That now will be in conference, and I think there is even a chance that we could get an agreement on that conference report before we go out. If we don't, it will be something we should reach early agreement on in conference when we come back after the first of the year. 
Also, the Senate did agree to pass a fix with regard to ISTEA, or the highway infrastructure bill, which is now before the House for their consideration.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ N O T I C E   Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on (the 31st day after adjournment), in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.

JOHN WARNER, Chairman.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The Senate yesterday passed by an overwhelming vote of 91 to 4 the very large and important Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill conference report, and just last night we reached an agreement after a lot of good work by a lot of Senators, including Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Roth, Senator Grassley, Senator Craig, who really did the great work in bringing the divergent parties together, Senator DeWine and others, on the foster care-adoption issue. I think this will be, frankly, one of the things that we will be most proud of when this year is concluded. We did that last night. Once, again, after a lot of hard work and good cooperation, that passed last night on a voice vote. 
Today, continued effort will be made to get an agreement in conference for the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. Probably 12 or 14 times we reached agreement and closed the conference, all to find that something was misplaced along the way or the agreement was not what others had thought it would be, and so it is still alive. I talked again to interested Senators this morning, and they will be working on it today. This, again, is something we need to do before we leave. So there is a lot happening in terms of Senators meeting; in the case of FDA reform, the House and Senate Members meeting on the conference report. I am looking forward to that agreement being reached. 
Later on today, there is a good possibility that we will consider an omnibus appropriations bill to be offered by the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. We do not now have a fixed time agreement, and there is no certainty whether or not there will be a rollcall vote or when that would be. There is still some discussion going on with regard to that bill. But in any event, once a decision is made on that legislation, if a rollcall vote is required, Senators will be notified 1 hour prior to that first vote. 
We are also continuing to work to see if we can get an agreement to move the District of Columbia appropriations bill through the Senate on a voice vote and through the House, so it can go down separately for the President's consideration to sign or veto it or to line-item veto the scholarship portion of it, which I think would be a big mistake. That still could come up either on a voice vote or perhaps a recorded vote would be required on that, as well as the omnibus appropriations bill. 
In addition, the Senate could expect to consider other Legislative or Executive Calendar items. The Executive Calendar now is down to just a very few nominations. Several of them are being held at this time because of holds on other nominations. Today is the day when Senators need to consider if, in fact, they want to hold these nominations up for the remainder of the year and over into next year. We have worked very assiduously with interested Senators on both sides of the aisle. The administration tried to clear as many of these as possible, and we will do so 
again today. 
The House of Representatives is, at this point, scheduled to consider the fast-track legislation late this afternoon or early evening. I have spoken to House leaders. There is no certainty at this time as to when that vote will occur. It looks to me like it will certainly be late afternoon or into the night. Therefore, the Senate can do nothing more really on fast track other than await the action in the House. If they should not pass the bill, then it would be my intent, and I believe it would be agreed to by leaders on both sides of the aisle, not to go further in the Senate with fast track. If it passes, then we have to make an assessment as to how we can bring it to a conclusion in the Senate. That could be tonight, it could be Monday, or it could be something else, which I don't even want to mention at this point. 
We also have the three remaining appropriations bills--Commerce, State, Justice; District of Columbia; and foreign operations. All of those still have an item or two that are in contention. We don't know whether we will move on the omnibus appropriations bill or whether the House will decide to go ahead and act on the bills separately and send them to us. But we will be working throughout the day to try to ascertain when we will get those appropriations bills and in what form. 
I think then the bottom line is, we do not expect a recorded vote any time soon. Senators will be notified 1 hour in advance should a recorded vote be required this afternoon. All Senators should be aware, and they need to keep their schedules clear, so that we can perhaps still have an opportunity to conclude this year's session today or tonight. 
I now ask that there be a period for the transaction of morning business----

Mr. LOTT. I have used those exact words, I might say, `fish 
or cut bait.' 
I will note again, we made tremendous progress in the past week on appropriations bills and other issues. I mentioned Amtrak, the highway bill, FDA, adoption and foster care, and I believe even on appropriations bills basically everything has been worked out but one issue. Obviously, we concluded an acceptable compromise on the Labor-HHS appropriations conference report involving the testing language. 
I believe we have an agreement worked out with regard to the census language that would be incorporated in the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill. 
I believe the two remaining issues for the year boil down to this: Can the House get the votes for fast track, since the Senate has already spoken overwhelmingly with votes of 68 and 67 for cloture motions to limit the debate so we can get to final passage, and the other one is the foreign operations bill, which includes a number of very important issues. Obviously, it involves the funds for our foreign operations; it involves the agreement with regard to how much would be paid for the U.N. arrearages; it involves the State Department authorization and reform and reorganization bill; it involves funds for the International Monetary Fund. But the one issue that is holding it all up, basically, boils down to whether or not the taxpayers' dollars will be used to promote and encourage foreign governments to encourage abortions. The bill that I thought we had agreed to provided a waiver where the President could waive that, but it would affect the funds. 
It has gotten down to a very narrow issue. You are right, we are not going to come to an agreement that every Senator will agree to, but I think we are close enough on that issue that we ought to be able to reach agreement and bring the foreign operations appropriations conference report to a conclusion. And if we can get that agreement and fast track, we will have completed the year on a very high note and one that the American people, I think, will be proud of and of which we could be proud. 
The taxpayers of the United States have had a pretty good year. We would like to end up with agreements on these important issues. Certainly, it won't be perfect, as the Senator has said, but we have tried compromise after compromise after compromise. So far, none of them have taken hold. But I have faith that on Sunday, we will find a way to do that. Certainly, I do think that senior Members and leaders have to step up to these challenges and get the job done.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in the dozen or so weeks between the end of this congressional session and the start of the next, members might profitably encourage their staffs to pursue a matter of great importance to the preservation of the Senate's institutional memory. I refer to the archiving of senators' noncurrent office files and personal papers. 
I recognize that most of us have enough to engage our attention thinking about the demands of today and tomorrow, without worrying a great deal about the records of yesterday. That's why the intersession recess offers a useful opportunity to address this important housekeeping matter. Our records deserve professional attention--not just in the final days of our Senate careers--but throughout our entire service here. The current proliferation of records in electronic formats makes this updating particularly urgent. Whether on disks, tapes, or paper, these records, if properly managed, will take their place as vital historical resources in the decades ahead. By planning now, senators can minimize preservation costs while maximizing research value at the time these records are opened for research and other educational purposes. 
Many senators have already made commitments to home-state educational institutions for staged transfer of their non-current records. For those who have not, I urge you to seek the assistance of the Senate Archivist within the Office of the Secretary of the Senate. What better way could there be to join those who have come before us in preserving and enriching the documentary resource of this great institution.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last year, after years of legislative consideration and debate, Congress enacted into law the Line Item Veto Act. For the next several years, this act gives the President authority, within carefully circumscribed limits, to cancel particular items of appropriation, direct spending, or limited tax benefits. The President must send Congress a special message reporting his cancellations within five days after he approves the bill containing the spending or tax provisions, and Congress may then consider, under expedited procedures, whether to pass a new law disapproving the President's cancellation. 
Congress delegated this responsibility to the President as a means of furthering our goal of balancing the federal budget. Congress's enactment of the Line Item Veto Act followed vigorous debate in the Senate, in which some opponents raised doubts about the law's constitutionality. All Members recognized that these constitutional questions likely ultimately would be resolved only in the Supreme Court. 
Last January, the day after the law took effect, in the case of Byrd v. Raines, six of our colleagues filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. On January 22, 1997, the Senate directed the Senate Legal Counsel to appear on behalf of the Senate as amicus curiae in Byrd v. Raines to defend the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. In June the Supreme Court dismissed the case on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to bring their suit. The Court did not address the constitutional question. 
In August, the President began using the Line Item Veto Act's cancellation authority for the first time. As a result of the President's cancellations, three new actions have recently been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia again challenging the constitutionality of the Act. The plaintiffs assert that the Act violates the lawmaking provisions of Article I of the Constitution by authorizing the President to nullify the effect of portions of recently enacted laws. These challenges call into question the full range of cancellation authority provided by Congress in the Act, as the three cases address direct spending, discretionary appropriations, and limited tax benefits, respectively. 
Mr. President, as with the Senate's appearance amicus curiae in Byrd v. Raines, appearance in these cases as an amicus curiae would again enable the Senate to present to the courts its reasons for enacting the Lien Item Veto Act and the basis for the Senate's conviction that the law is consistent with the Constitution. Accordingly, this resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to appear in these cases in the name of the Senate as amicus curiae to support the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. 
The Senate would not take a position on questions about the legal standing of any of these plaintiffs, as it did not in the prior litigation. However, as in the earlier litigation, the Senate Legal Counsel will be expected to describe to the courts, in the course of supporting the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, the statutory limits embodied in the Act that constrain the President's use of this authority to the particular circumstances and conditions carefully prescribed by the Act. 
Finally, this resolution also would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to appear in the name of the Senate as amicus curiae to support the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act in any other cases challenging the constitutionality of the Act that may occur during the adjournment of the Senate, if authorized to do so by the Joint Leadership Group. This is the procedure the Senate has used in the past to protect its legal interests during adjournments.

Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to represent Members, officers, and employees of the Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony or document production relating to their official responsibilities;

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, there is a move to combine the three remaining appropriations bills into one bill and to send that document to the House. The Appropriations Committee intends to meet on this immediately following these announcements. Those bills are the D.C., the foreign ops and the State-Justice-Commerce bills. 
It is the hope of the leadership that we could clear this bill for passage without a rollcall vote. Senator Daschle and I will be working on both sides of the aisle to make sure Members understand what is happening here, what is involved, and it may take some time for us to determine that. That could be as much as an hour or so. If we could get it cleared, then that would be the way we would intend to proceed on these combined appropriations bills. Senators will be notified when the next vote would occur, if one should be necessary on this. 
Now, Senator Daschle and I were just talking. We think we should pass this by voice vote, and we will encourage Senators to allow this to happen. But if we can't get it cleared, one option we would have would be to have this vote occur, and I would need to consult with Chairman Stevens further before we do it, but one option, if we can't get it cleared in a reasonable period of time, would be to perhaps have a vote on that issue tomorrow around 1:30 or so. At this point we just can't tell you with absolute certainty how we are going to proceed on that bill. Again, we will pursue the voice vote, and if we can't get that done, then we will notify you when the actual vote would occur. 
Would the Senator like to respond to that before we go to these other issues?

Mr. LOTT. One option, if the Senator will yield back so that I can comment, Senator Stevens even suggested we might want to have another vote later on this afternoon or later on at 5, 6 or 7 o'clock. But we will try to avoid that, and when we can give you some further confirmation on when the next recorded vote will occur, we will let you know--hopefully within an hour. 
Now, I might also note that I am being told that an agreement 
has been reached on the FDA reform conference report, that papers are being done now, and hopefully Senator Jeffords is working with all the interested parties on that. Within an hour or so, we hope we could get those papers ready and get that done on a voice vote. 
The Senator is now saying we may have to have a recorded vote. If we do, then we might have to look at doing that later on or maybe even tomorrow. So we will have to consult on that. 
One other one we may try to do is adoption and foster care. We understand perhaps there has been agreement on that legislation in a bipartisan way. We are trying to clear that. 
So that answers part of Senator Dorgan's inquiry. We have a couple of issues that we may have ready to go here pretty quickly. That is why we would like to have the option to discuss with the Senator and others moving one or the other of these bills or the conference report.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to state my strong support for S. 621, and express my disappointment that a few Senators have prevented this body from considering the bill this year. A bipartisan majority of Senators supports PUHCA repeal, and I will bring it to the floor for consideration and passage early next year. 
Both Chairmen D'Amato and Murkowski, along with Senators Dodd and Sarbanes, deserve great credit for helping to move this legislation forward. It is unfortunate that their efforts on both sides of the aisle were unsuccessful this session. They know--as do the other 20 cosponsors of S. 621--that repealing PUHCA would remove an outdated regulatory burden that restricts the operations of a handful of electric and gas utilities. 
Mr. President, PUHCA was enacted in 1935 to eliminate holding company abuses of that time, and it was quite successful. In the last six decades, however, Congress and the States have enacted a whole spectrum of securities, antitrust and utility regulatory statutes that make it impossible for those abuses to occur again. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency tasked to enforce PUHCA, has said that PUHCA is no longer needed and should be repealed. 
Now, long past its usefulness, PUHCA stands in the way of competition. While some argue that PUHCA should only be repealed as a part of comprehensive restructuring legislation, I believe that incremental steps toward competition are responsible and realistic accomplishments for the 105th Congress. Repealing PUHCA should be the first incremental step. 
Mr. President, crafting comprehensive restructuring legislation requires Congress to consider a whole host of difficult issues--stranded cost recovery, State versus Federal authority, renewable resources, public power subsidies, environmental impacts. The list goes on and on. There is no consensus among Senators on these issues, but there is an overwhelming amount of support for PUHCA repeal. 
Instead of searching for the perfect total package, let's focus on the incremental steps toward competition that we can agree on. PUHCA is the biggest single Federal obstacle to the advancement of retail competition, and it should be repealed now. Several States have already adopted or are in the process of adopting retail competition plans without comprehensive utility restructuring legislation. We can't allow the Federal Government to block progress in the States. Without PUHCA repeal, retail competition in the States simply cannot flourish. 
Mr. President, now is the time for PUHCA repeal. Although the few opponents of S. 621 have prevented the Senate from considering the bill this year, I will bring it to the floor early next year. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in repealing this outdated and burdensome Federal obstacle to competition in the utility industry.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today is not simply he end of the 1st session of the 105th Congress. For me, this day is one that brings both new opportunities and old memories. Today marks the end of John Lundy's 7 years of service to me, first as my administrative assistant and later as my chief of staff. He has also served the great State of Mississippi. 
To truly understand John and his impact on others, we must go back to his roots. John was raised on a farm in the small, rural town of Leland, MS. This upbringing taught him the meaning of community and the importance of family. He is a proud Mississippian, and still refers to the Delta as `God's Country.' John graduated from Mississippi State University with a degree in agriculture--I guess he couldn't get into Ole Miss. 
He then moved to Washington shortly thereafter and found a job on the staff of the Mississippi delegation in the House of Representatives. He was single, young and full of ambition. Who would have guessed that he would be returning to Mississippi 7 years later with a wife, a new baby girl and a truck full of furniture? 
When I asked John to join my staff, I knew he would be a quick study. He was. He quickly jumped into the legislative fires with both feet. 
John also quickly became involved in the demands of Washington's political world, but he never lost his Mississippi style. Or his Mississippi perspective. 
Mississippians have told me for years how much they enjoy coming to Washington to see John. He makes everyone feel comfortable--no formalities, no pretenses. John can comfortably sit next to a farmer from the Delta or a banker from the coast and listen to his or her concerns. Visitors from the State are delighted to have one of their own paying attention to their needs, knowing that the message is not going to fade away the moment they leave. Mississippians knew that John was an able steward of their concerns, that telling John was as good as telling me. 
There isn't a farmer in the State of Mississippi that doesn't know John Lundy, either personally or by reputation. John's knowledge of our State's many agriculture communities is unmatched in Washington. He is respected for his understanding of the issues and his dedication to finding a fair and equitable solution for all. 
Mississippi's agriculture community was indeed fortunate to have John Lundy in Washington during the 1996 farm bill debate. I found that, although John was my staff member, other Senators had adopted him as their key advisor on this bill. His tireless work on this very difficult and complex legislation brought him the respect of both the State and national agriculture community. 
Most importantly, John has always put Mississippi first. No matter what the situation or how high the stakes, the needs of the State came first. We all know how easy it is to get caught up in both the glitter and the rat race of Washington, DC, but John's focus has always been hundreds of miles south of the beltway. 
Mississippians brought him problems, and he found them solutions. Many years have gone by since John joined my staff, but my admiration for him has grown with each passing day. 
Now the time has come for him to return to Mississippi, to take his young family back home. This past summer, he and his beautiful wife Hayley was blessed with a baby girl, Eliza, who John says `was born to be in Mississippi.' 
As the Lundy family makes their way back to Mississippi, I would like to thank them for being such an important part of my life. I cannot thank John enough for his many years of hard work and dedication. He certainly leaves big shoes to fill. His quiet humility and generous spirit will be missed by my entire staff. I will miss his guidance and friendship. 
John, I wish you nothing but the best of luck in the future, May you and your family be richly blessed in the coming years.

I particularly want to thank Senator Inhofe for agreeing to do this. He came to the floor and offered his amendment. And it was accepted on a voice vote. Senators were aware of what was being discussed. But in a desire to be totally fair and making sure the proper notification was given, and to have opposition on the floor when action of that nature is taken, Senator Inhofe has been willing to agree to vitiate that action at this time. I thank him for his cooperation. 
This is a very important issue which will be debated in the Senate and which should be considered by the Senate. It is an issue that has support and opposition on both sides of the aisle. Senator Inhofe certainly is very committed to having this subject considered by the Senate either later on this year or next year. 
Again, I reiterate my thanks to him.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senate now is in a position to consider the Amtrak reform bill. The bill would then be agreed to after brief debate. 
The Senate would then conduct a rollcall vote on the nomination of Judge Christina Snyder. 
Following the confirmation vote, it is my hope that the District of Columbia appropriations bill will be ready to be considered. 
Therefore, votes will occur with the first vote occurring at approximately 2:15 today. 
I thank all Senators who have been involved in these other two bills, and we will update them further with information as to when votes may occur. It is possible that another vote will occur this afternoon. But it depends on action in the other body with regard to the appropriations conference reports.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today the Senate immediately proceed to executive session and a vote on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 255, Christina A. Snyder to be U.S. district judge for the Central District of California. 
I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to the nomination appear at that point in the Record, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we move to the Amtrak legislation, I want to say for the information of all Senators--and I will have more to say about this when we have a recorded vote at 2:15. I think at that time we should take the time to talk about the schedule for the remainder of the day and perhaps Saturday and Sunday. 
It is our intent to stay and continue working. I don't see the necessity for us to be late tonight. But we will be back in on Saturday, and again on Sunday. We hope that we will have appropriations conference reports, possibly the first one being the Labor-HHS appropriations conference report, perhaps even later on today or tomorrow, and the Commerce-State-Justice conference report we hope to have by tomorrow, and, if not then, on Sunday. 
We will continue to work on other issues, some of which may require votes, even on the Executive Calendar. And then when the House votes, of course, we would then proceed to act on fast track after the House has acted. Whether that is Saturday or Sunday now is not clear. But the House has postponed their action on fast track today. So that will not be taken up until Saturday or Sunday. 
So we could be voting on fast track--perhaps on final passage--later on this weekend. But, in the meantime, of course, when we complete these intervening actions, we will go back to fast track as it is now pending before the Senate, and amendments will be in order, and other amendments I am sure will be offered. We will consult with the interested parties about how to proceed on those amendments and what time votes would occur. 
But, again, I think that during the remainder of the day it is very likely that we will have a minimum of two votes, and maybe even three or four.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't know if we should at this time get consent in that we would have that time. I think they will have it and maybe more if they would like to have it, and we should not and will not complete the discussion on it until the Senators have been involved in working out this compromise are in the Chamber. 
I would like to say if I could at this point, I thank the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, Senator McCain, for his persistence on this matter, and Senator Hutchison, who is chairman of the subcommittee, for her efforts in bringing about this compromise. Senator Kerry from the committee as well as Senator Breaux have worked very hard in developing this compromise. 
I have been involved in this effort now for 3 years, having served as chairman of the subcommittee in the previous Congress. I think it is very important that we get fundamental reform of Amtrak so that Amtrak at least will have a chance to be able to provide good service and do it without depending on continuing subsidies from the Federal Government forever. They should be able to turn a profit, and I think this legislation will make that possible. They should be able to contract outwork. They should be able to advertise. There are so many basic private sector things that they could do and should have been doing before now that would allow them to actually make a profit so that we can keep a national rail passenger system. We need a passenger system that serves all the country, not just the eastern seaboard, and this is a major step in that direction. 
I want to emphasize, though, too, this is required in order to get the $2.3 billion that was fenced in the budget agreement for capital improvements. And those funds are only for capital improvements, not for operating subsidies, makeup of shortfalls in the past or salaries. That is not included in this legislation. 
I think we have a good bill. After trying to move it for 2 years, I am delighted that the work of a lot of Senators including the Senators here now in the Chamber and others that will be here momentarily will make this possible. I don't want to delay it any longer for fear somebody might have a good idea of one word that might be added.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the civil case of First American Corporation, et al. versus Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, et al., pending in the District Court for the District of Columbia, presents claims arising out of the former business relationships between First American Bank and the Bank of Credit and Commerce, International, known as BCCI. 
BCCI's business dealings were the subject of extensive hearings by the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations, of the Committee on Foreign Relations, between 1988 and 1992. Senator John Kerry, who chaired that subcommittee, and former Senator Hank Brown, who was the ranking member, prepared a lengthy report documenting their findings. 
The Foreign Relations Committee has received a request for a former counsel to the subcommittee, Jack Blum, to testify in this civil action about responses that the Subcommittee received to its requests for information in the course of its investigation. The Committee believes that it is appropriate to authorize the testimony requested on this subject. This resolution would accordingly authorize Mr. Blum to testify about this subject, but the resolution authorizes no other testimony by any Member or employee. 
The committee has also received a request for committee records in connection with this case. In keeping with prior Senate practice, this resolution will not authorize the wholesale production of committee records, but authorizes the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee to produce, on a case-by-case basis, copies of selective committee records from this subcommittee investigation, where a strong basis for the request has been shown and the Senate's privileges permit. 
Finally, the resolution authorizes the Senate legal counsel to provide representation in connection with the requests for testimony and documents in this proceeding.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate acted in a fully bipartisan manner to adopt meaningful and genuine legal, labor, and management reforms for America's national passenger railroad. It offers legislative solutions that could begin to restore the fiscal health of this failing railroad. 
American taxpayers have already invested over $20 million in this railroad. 
Let me be clear: the Senate is sending a bipartisan message to this railroad--the management and the workers must fundamentally change both their culture and operating methods. 
Amtrak cannot continue getting subsidies. 
The legislation adopted today is an amendment to the bill reported by the Commerce Committee earlier this year. It is the bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. The amendment was a joint effort of several members of the Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle. 
I want to personally commend the Senate's Commerce Committee for their leadership on this important transportation issue. 
I'm sure the nearly 2 million Americans who ride the commuter rail system every day want to also thank them. 
I also want to recognize the work of a number of dedicated staffers who have invested many hours, evenings and weekends to get the legislative language right. The work was intense, emotional and personal, but everyone maintained their professional manner and got the job done. The staff responsible for the details are: Ann Begeman, Clyde Hart, Amy Henderson, James Drewry, Lloyd Ator, and Penny Compton. 
Let me just take one moment and clarify one important issue within this reform bill. The current industry practice between Amtrak and other rail carriers is to allocate financial responsibility for claims. This makes sense and in fact many such contractual agreements exist today. The language in section 28103(b) of the bill is intended to confirm that such contractual agreements are consistent with Federal law and public policy. One should not construe this section as modifying such agreements. 
Today, the Senate has taken action to ensure America's passenger rail service will not be interrupted. And, the Senate also mandated reforms to assure a prosperous passenger railroad. 
Mr. President, this reauthorization reform for Amtrak is long overdue, but it is on the right track.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been talking about the rest of the schedule this afternoon. 
First, once again, I am very pleased that after 3 years of effort, we have a bipartisan compromise on Amtrak reform. That was a good day's work. It still has to go to conference, but I believe now that we have a good chance to get that legislation through. That would be very beneficial to maintaining a national rail passenger system that would pay for itself. 
I believe we are now prepared to go to the D.C. bill. We have worked out an agreement on that. Then later on this afternoon we hope to be able to have another vote. We hoped we would get something on the labor-HHS appropriations conference report. We don't know for sure, but that may not be possible. We still have the option to go back to fast track, and there are some amendments, I am sure, that are in the offing. But whatever votes we would have this afternoon, and it appears it would be a minimum of one more vote, but the last vote for today would occur not later than 5 p.m. this afternoon, and we would then come back in tomorrow at noon and get an assessment of where we are. 
We are still hoping there may be an FDA reform conference report agreement. There is a possibility. We have worked out an agreement on the adoption-foster-care issue. If either of those are ready, we would try to do those tomorrow afternoon. We also would get an assessment of what will happen with regard to the appropriations bills coming from the House and also see if there is any way we can take some action that would help to expedite some conclusion to the appropriations process. 
With regard to fast track, we will continue to go back to it and have discussion, debate, and amendments when they are ready. The House has delayed their taking a vote on fast track until Saturday or Sunday. They will not do it today. Of course, that will have an impact on what we do and when we do it. I don't think we can say anything beyond that until we see what happens in the House. 
We have been asked by our colleagues in the House and by the administration to stay and continue to work to see if we can resolve the outstanding issues on appropriations and be prepared to act on fast track, if and when the House does act. We will keep the Members informed. We will try to be conscious of schedules, but I think you should be prepared to have at least one more vote this afternoon, and there is a possibility that there would be a vote or two tomorrow afternoon and Sunday afternoon. 
Again, on Sunday we would not be in until probably 1 o'clock to give Members an opportunity to go to church. One of the reasons why we won't have votes after 5 o'clock tonight is because of the Jewish sabbath. We are trying to honor Members' commitments in that regard while still trying to move this process forward. 
There is a 50-50 chance, still, that we can finish all this by Sunday. There is one thing for sure: If we don't stay here and keep working, there is a 100-percent chance we will be here next Friday. Let's keep trying to get it to a conclusion. I believe it is possible. 
I thank Senator Daschle for collaborating with me on these issues. I wonder if the minority leader might want to add anything?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate is sending two very distinguished and qualified new Commissioners to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I am pleased that my good friend Curtis L. Hebert, Jr. of Pascagoula, MS, is one of them. 
Curt has served the State of Mississippi as a member of the Public Service Commission for several years. During that time, he has demonstrated the ability to balance the diverse utility interests in our State. This is no easy task. Mississippi is the home to both public and private power companies, PUHCA's and providers of all sizes. Curt has proven that he has the skills necessary to address the needs of each of these entities, while keeping the best interest of the consumer in mind. 
As a former member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I certainly appreciate the high standard that FERC nominees are held to during committee consideration. Throughout the nomination process, Curt has demonstrated that he has not only the knowledge, but the determination and skills to get the job done. He has been a responsible and able steward of the utility industry in Mississippi. I expect that he will serve the FERC and our Nation with the same enthusiasm and foresight. 
We all must recognize that electric utility deregulation is on the horizon. How and when a new system will be created remains to be seen. What is certain, however, is that the FERC will be instrumental in guiding Congress toward competition in the utility industry. I am confident that Curt has the experience and insight necessary to help us reach the right balance of interests. Most importantly, Curt understands what deregulation means on the State level. 
There is no industry as complex as the utility world--and none that impacts the lives of Americans more directly every day. The challenge ahead are great and must be tackled head on. There is no denying that the FERC Commissioners have their work cut out for them. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously confirmed Curt Hebert as a member of the FERC, ensuring that the future of the electric utility industry is in good hands. I congratulate him on this accomplishment and wish him the best of luck in the future.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will debate the nomination of Ronald Lee Gilman, of Tennessee, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the sixth circuit. At the conclusion of debate, at approximately 9:40 a.m., the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote on the confirmation of the nomination. Following that vote, the Senate will debate the conference report to accompany H.R. 1119, the Department of Defense authorization bill, for up to 4 hours, as under the previous order. So we assume then that vote will occur on or about 2 o'clock. Also under the order, a vote on the adoption of the conference report will occur at the expiration of time. Again, we assume that will be around 2 o'clock. 
Amtrak reform, D.C. appropriations bill, the FDA reform conference report, the intelligence authorization conference report and any other additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared will be taken up. I understand that we are just about ready to call up the D.C. appropriations bill. I think that there was an FDA conference report yesterday. Hopefully, they resolved their problems. After the DOD authorization bill, we then should be able to move to the intelligence conference report. We will also continue to try to move Executive Calendar nominations. I believe yesterday we moved about 20 nominations. We will have a vote this morning on Mr. Gilman to be a sixth circuit court judge. We should expect to have further votes during the day in addition to the two at 9:40 a.m. and approximately 2 o'clock. We will advise Members when a time is set for future votes. I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just a note. As we try to clear nominations on the Executive Calendar, there will be a necessity to bring up some of them for a unanimous-consent request or a vote. There will be objections sometimes on both sides of the aisle, but it is so we can make it clear that we are not just delaying some of these. This nomination affects another nomination, and it would be very hard for us to get those cleared, if there are objections. We will continue to move the nominations. We have several that we think we can clear tonight--most of the ambassador positions, and others--and I am working with Senator Daschle on that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in light of the objection of our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, the Senate will not be able to consider this very important public utility holding company bill prior to the end of the 1st session of the 105th Congress. I regret the objection. We will certainly try again next year to move it when we will call it up, and, if we have to have cloture votes, we will do so. We will certainly consider it when we get into the 2nd session of the 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are honored this morning to have had today's opening prayer delivered by Rev. Ron Schoenfeldt, senior pastor of the McComb Church of the Nazarene in McComb, MS. I am very pleased to have Reverend Schoenfeldt here today, because he is highly well-known and respected in McComb for outreach work, such as his monthly nursing home ministry and work with area athletic programs. 
I know Reverend Schoenfeldt wanted to open the Senate with a prayer on his 40th birthday. We are honored to have him do so. 
I thank the Chaplain for all the work he does and allowing us to have this guest. 
I thank Reverend Schoenfeldt for taking the time to come here today to pray for this institution and our country. I also commend him for his fine work in the McComb Church of the Nazarene and wish him continued success and happiness. Thank you very much, Reverend Schoenfeldt.

I believe by 10:30 a.m., we will have those problems resolved and that we can continue to consider the Inhofe amendment or the second-degree amendment to it and get the Amtrak legislation also cleared and other issues we will still be working on. 
Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will then be in a period for morning business from 9:30 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. The Senate may also consider and complete action on any of the following: Amtrak reform, the D.C. appropriations bill--even though there may be some problems with that now, we will continue to try to see if we can work through that--and any other additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared for action. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout Friday's session of the Senate.

And we will continue to work to see if we can find a way to complete action on the three appropriations conference reports. And, of course, we will be waiting to see what the House does on fast track. And depending on that, then, of course, we would proceed accordingly. 
But if it is at all possible that we can finish our work on Saturday or Sunday, which I still think we can, I would think we should stay here and get that work done. If we cannot, then we will have to consider the alternatives, but Members should begin to be aware of it. And the odds are now that we will be in session Saturday and even possibly Sunday.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding naval officer and good friend, Rear Adm. (select) Jay M. Cohen. For the past 4 1/2 years, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen has served with distinction as the Navy's Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided this legislative body, the Navy, and the Nation. 
A native of New York City, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen was commissioned as an ensign upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968. Since then, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen has spent the majority of his career patrolling the ocean depths as a Navy submariner. Following submarine training, he began his submarine service aboard U.S.S. Diodon (SS 349) in San Diego. Nuclear power trained, he has served in the engineering departments of U.S.S. Nathaniel Greene (SSBN 636) and U.S.S. Nathan Hall (SSBN 623), and as the executive officer aboard U.S.S. George Washington Carver (SSBN 656). In 1985, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen took command of U.S.S. Hyman G. Rickover (SSN 709) and skippered the ship on three deployments. 
When not underwater, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen has likewise served with distinction on the staff of Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, as senior member of the Nuclear Propulsion Examining Board and on the staff of the Director of Naval Intelligence. He also commanded U.S.S. L.Y. Spear (AS 36), a submarine tender in Norfolk, VA. Following this command tour, he reported, in April 1993, to the Secretary of the Navy's staff as the Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs. Among Rear Admiral(select) Cohen's many awards and decorations are five Legions of Merit and three Meritorious Service Medals. He is both submarine and surface warfare qualified. 
During his tenure as the Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen provided the Senate with timely support and accurate information on Navy plans and programs. His close work with the Congress and steadfast devotion to the Navy mission helped ensure that the U.S. Navy remained the best-trained, best-equipped, and best-prepared naval force in the world. Faced with countless challenges and a multitude of complex and sensitive issues, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen's unflappable leadership, integrity, and limitless energy had a profound and positive impact on the U.S. Naval Service. 
As a testament to his extremely valuable contributions to the national security of this country, the Navy recently selected him to flag rank and I am pleased to say that the Senate recently confirmed his nomination. The Chief of Naval Operations will pin on his star Friday, November 7, in the Pentagon. With this well-deserved promotion, Admiral Cohen will continue his outstanding service to the Navy and the Nation as he moves on to positions of even greater responsibility. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Rear Adm. (select) Jay Cohen fair winds and following seas. I know we will see and hear from him again.

I will be happy to respond to the Senator's questions.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. I can assure the Senator, most emphatically, that this will not happen. This is not a regulatory bill. The Lott-Daschle bill presumes that each State provides the legislative foundation for the one-call notification program in that State. Remember, all one-call programs are currently State programs, and this will remain unchanged. The sole aim of the bill is to encourage States to act voluntarily to improve their own State one-call programs by providing fiscal assistance for those States who want to do more. 
Furthermore, this legislation does not regulate through the back door by imposing a Federal mandate on the States to modify their existing one-call programs. Rather, it makes funding available to improve these programs. To be eligible for the funding, the programs must meet certain minimum standards, but even those standards are performance-based, not prescriptive. And States will be involved in the rulemaking which establishes these standards. No State has to apply for these funds if it doesn't wish to. 
The bill does not preempt State law. Let me repeat that; no State law will be preempted. States continue to their responsibility for the regulations for notification prior to excavation and for location and for marking of underground facilities. Nothing in this bill changes this. States prescribe the details of one-call notification programs. This not something the Federal Government should do or is able to do effectively. 
This bill is not intended to lead to a Federal regulatory program on the backs of small business. It is not intended to do this, and it will not do this.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. First, let me say to my colleague that I am very much in favor of encouraging Federal and State agencies put regulatory effort where the real risks are. We don't have so much money and so much desire to regulate that we can afford to spend our time and money regulating nonexistent risks. There is far too much regulating of fictitious risks going on in our economy today. So I think the emphasis on looking at actual risk is desirable. And the other side of it is that situations that pose a real risk should be covered, absolutely should be covered. We think the Lott-Daschle bill will encourage the States to look at risks that are not now covered and increase participation in one-call notification programs accordingly. 
In answer to the contractors' contention, I would reply to them that the intent of this bill is to strengthen State one-call programs and not to weaken them. This is what the Congress is saying to the States with the Lott-Daschle bill: `Strengthen your programs. Strengthen your programs, and you will be rewarded.' 
And the Department of Transportation, which will administer this program, is saying the same thing. I recently received a letter from Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater supporting the Lott-Daschle one-call notification bill. I put that letter in the Record of October 22. In his letter, Secretary Slater says, `safety is the Department of Transportation's highest priority.' 
Secretary Slater is not interested in weakening State one-call notification programs. A State that submits a grant application to the Department of Transportation with a weakened State one-call program is not going to see that application approved. The Department of Transportation will make sure of that. 
Finally, the Lott-Daschle bill does not provide for a one-size-fits-all Federal determination of what constitutes a risk. Under the bill the intent is that the determination of risk will be made at the State level, where local conditions and practices can be taken into account. 
This is another reason that I'm sure we don't need to be concerned about weakening State laws. States with strong laws are not going to undertake to weaken them in order to apply for a grant from the DOT under this bill. They know that DOT is trying to strengthen these laws. It just wouldn't make any sense.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. I believe the bill does attempt to be evenhanded. For example, finding (2) of the bill points to excavation without prior notice as a cause of accidents, but in the same phrase it includes failure to mark the location of underground facilities in an accurate or timely way as a cause as well. In truth, these are both causes of accidents, and the bill proposes to deal with both. 
Both excavators and underground facilities can stand to improve performance in the area of compliance with one-call requirements. There is no intent in this bill to blame one side or the other. If the Senator believes that the bill unfairly stigmatizes contractors, I would want to right the balance, because that is not what is intended. 
What we are trying to do is to set up a process where the States can address problems we all know are there. There are too many accidents at underground facilities. Let's see what we can do to improve that situation. Let's see what we can do cooperatively, underground facility operators and contractors, Federal agencies and State agencies. Let's use incentives rather than preemption and regulation. That is what this bill is trying to do.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for raising this issue. The letter and intent of the law concerning this program are not being carried out at all. 
The National Highway System Designation Act passed in 1995, and section 334 mandated the motor carrier regulatory relief and safety demonstration project. It required the Department of Transportation to implement this project no later than August, 1996. However, the Department of Transportation did not even publish Final Guidelines for the project until June 10 of this year--1 year later than required by law.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would add that, at this time, there is not a single applicant for the motor safety demonstration project. 
This has not kept the Department from heralding the project as a centerpiece of their so-called regulatory reform. For example, in the August 11, 1997 issue, of the industry publication `Transport Topics,' the Department's Associate Administrator for Motor Carriers, George Reagle, referred to the project as a key part of the administration's effort to `provide common-sense government * * *.' which offers `the opportunity to further regulatory reform'. Mr. Reagle further stated that `This early step toward reform will set the tone for our entire regulatory future * * *.' 
A centerpiece with no participants is an empty centerpiece. Words of self-praise are an inadequate response. The law was clear and implementation is overdue.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I fully agree with the Senator. I do not believe the Department has followed the provisions established under the National Highway System Designation Act. I am disappointed. 
The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation has been working to advance legislation expanding the Department of Transportation's use of pilot programs and regulatory exemptions. I will be working with the committee to help reduce, as much as is safely possible, some of the unnecessary regulations and paperwork imposed on the motor carrier industry. 
Given the Department's handling of the motor safety demonstration project to date, I am very concerned about the Department's sincerity in implementing such legislatively mandated programs. I will also be working very closely with the committee to ensure that the mandates we have already passed are complied with by the Department of Transportation.

Mr. LOTT. I do this, Mr. President, just so that Senator Daschle and I can explain what is transpiring. 
As you know, we are prepared now to go to the cloture vote on the DOD authorization conference report. However, the interested parties on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue involved, regarding the depots, wanted a few minutes to talk about what would be the situation beyond this, and so there are a lot of conversations going on now in the back of the Chamber. I would like to give them a few more minutes to discuss the various options. As soon as we then call off the quorum call, we would proceed to a cloture vote. 
It is my thinking that we would probably go to this cloture vote, but it is going to be a few more minutes before we can actually proceed to that vote. But we will not let it languish very long. The interested parties asked for a few minutes to talk. That is what we are doing. I realize Members have other commitments. But we will, probably within the next 15 or 20 minutes, have some final decision, and then we will know whether we will have a vote on cloture at that point or not.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I was informed that Mrs. Lisa D'Amato Murphy, daughter of Senator D'Amato, was chosen as `Community Leader of the Year' by the Island Park Kiwanis Club. Her significant volunteer participation in both civic and church activities is the basis for this distinguished award. It is important to mention that Lisa is the wife of Judge Jerry Murphy of the Island Park Village Court and the mother of five children. Yet, so strong is her commitment to others that she somehow finds the time to serve her community. While so many people bemoan the lack of hours in a day, Lisa clearly demonstrates that time for community service can be found--if it is a priority. 
On behalf of the entire Senate family, I extend our sincere congratulations to Mrs. Lisa D'Amato Murphy, Island Park, New York's `Community Leader of the Year.'

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the cloture vote on the Coverdell education bill will occur on Friday of this week. We will have consultation with the Democratic leader and will notify Senators as to exactly what time that would occur. We will give them that information on Thursday so Members can make plans for what time we would have that vote and, hopefully, what time they could then leave on Friday. 
In response to the Democratic leader's comments, first of all, this is a very, very important issue. I have found that any time that I explain what the Coverdell A-plus provision will do, people of all backgrounds and races and situations in education are very much attracted to it. We would allow people, whether it is parents or grandparents or even other groups, to be able to have savings accounts similar to individual retirement accounts. And those moneys can be used with tax benefit to help children with education, K through 12--kindergarten through the 12th grade. That may be for computers, or it could be for a tutor. It could be for supplies, or it could be to make some decision on their own as parents as to where their children would go to school. It is the sort of thing we have for higher education in America. 
I think one of the reasons we have very good higher education in America but much weaker elementary and secondary is because we don't have the same resource, the same opportunity, the same financial benefits available. 
So I think this is a bill that has a lot of support. We saw that here in the vote earlier this year in the Senate. 
I am glad that Senator Daschle indicates that they do not object to us getting to the substance of this bill. 
With regard to amendments, I certainly think it would be a good idea and would want amendments to be offered. I would like for them certainly to be germane amendments. After we get cloture on this issue then we would go to the amendment process. I am sure that Senators on both sides of the aisle would probably have some amendments that they would like to offer. 
I think, once again, it is very unfortunate that this matter would be tied up over the campaign finance reform issue. We continue to work to get some agreement that we can go along with. 
As a matter of fact, once again, just like last week, I had thought we had an agreement. We had a unanimous-consent agreement typed up. Senator McCain is now saying that is not what he meant, that is not what he wants, or he needs something different. But we will continue to work on it. Senator Daschle and I have talked. I have talked to interested Senators in trying to get resolution as to when it would be handled. 
I say, again for the Record, it would be my intent to call this issue up before the end of the first week in March. I don't intend to fill the tree up. I would like amendments to be in order. The problem is Senator McCain wants some specific extra provision as to what he might offer and how it would be voted on. That is what we are still working on. But we get very close, and then it slides back a bit. We will keep working on that because, again, I think it would be unfortunate if the Senate would continue to be tangled up on that issue while letting very, very important national issues like our national transportation infrastructure, highway improvement and educational opportunities in America--even fast-track trade agreements--because we can't get an agreement on this other issue. 
But as majority leader I am going to call these important bills up. And this one will get a cloture vote, and then hopefully we will proceed to the substance and relevant amendments that would be offered. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could just respond further, I think I have made it clear my commitments trying to get the ISTEA extension highway infrastructure bill done. Basically, the Senate spent 2 weeks trying to get on the substance of that bill. Because of the unrelated campaign finance reform issue, the highway bill has had to be pulled. I indicated more than once repeatedly that if we didn't get cloture and get on the substance the Members that were blocking that bill would have to bear the responsibility for it. For those Governors and those highway people that now would like some additional action, where were they a week ago? Why weren't they talking to the Senators that were opposing cloture that would allow us to get on to this highway bill? 
So, if they have any ideas now as to how to proceed, I urge them to talk to the chairman and ranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee and explain why they weren't involved a week or 2 weeks ago so we could get to the substance of this issue.

Mr. LOTT. Let me just say I have worked with this issue, as the Senator knows, and the other Senator from Texas, over the last 2 or 3 years. I know there are other Senators that have an interest in it and have different views. I know a mighty effort has been made on all sides. This is not a partisan issue. It is a difficult issue between some States, though, to try to resolve it. 
I really felt like we were never to bring it to a head until we get this legislation started. That is my intent here. We are going to get it started off. 
I have discussed with Senator Daschle the possibility that we at some point--we met this afternoon--we meet to see what else can be done. I am certainly willing to continue to work with both sides to try to find a resolution. 
But we are running out of time in this session. This is a very, very important bill for national defense and the security of our country. 
So I thought we should go ahead and get started. And hopefully that will cause us to try to find some way to resolve this one remaining--one remaining--very difficult issue to resolve. 
I thank the Senator for withholding so I could make that comment.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, just again for clarification of what we are doing here, there are very strong feelings and great ground for substantive disagreement on this issue. Before we start a series of procedural votes, I thought it made good sense for both sides, proponents and opponents of the position in the conference report, to sort of have a chance to lay out their positions. By doing it this way, the time will be actually controlled between the two sides. Then we will have some procedural votes. And it is my intent to also file cloture on this issue tonight. 
Beyond that, we will see what happens. So, for the next 45 minutes, then, we will have debate equally divided. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. I asked unanimous consent that we proceed to executive session to consider the Federal Reserve nominations on the Executive Calendar. I know the Senator from Iowa has been discussing these nominees already this afternoon, and I am advised that he is going to oppose a time agreement to get a vote on these nominations, so I was going to make note of the fact that my intention is to set the votes on these nominations for later today. 
If it is not possible, if there is objection to that, then I would have to say it would appear to me that these nominees could not get confirmed this session. We have a number of nominations we are trying to get cleared on both sides of the aisle. 
I had indicated to Senator Daschle we would try to move these nominees. We also have similar holds on the FCC nominees. But if we can't get those cleared in the next couple of days, it would be my intent to try to move those to a vote in the same manner tomorrow. So I am trying to emphasize that. I think these are important nominees. It would seem to me we need to have nominees to the Federal Reserve Board confirmed. These are the President's choices and his recommendations. This is, obviously, a very critical board. While I might agree with the Senator about some of his reservations and disagree with some of the actions they take and a number of things that have occurred over the years, I do think that unless there is a major objection to one or both of these nominees on the qualifications basis or experience or something of that nature, I feel an obligation to try to move them forward.

Mr. LOTT. I know he could talk at great length on this and other subjects, and there may be other Senators who would like to talk on them who are not here today. Quite frankly, I am not 
impressed that they are not here. We are in the final 2 or 3 weeks of the session, and when Senators say they can't be here on Monday and they can't be here on Friday, it sure makes it awful hard to do the people's business. But the Senator is within his right; certainly these are important nominees, but I believe that on these nominees as well as the FCC nominees and hopefully maybe even others, if the holds are continued on them, I need to call them up. 
If there is objection, as apparently the Senator from Iowa intends, I just want to make it clear why they are being objected to and who is objecting to them and we will move on. But I do want to make it clear to one and all that in view of the lateness of the hour in the session, the odds of being able to spend a great deal of time or to get these nominees called up again is not very likely because we have a number of urgent matters that are pending that we are going to have to take up this week and next week. 
And so I just wanted to put that on the Record so that the Senators here will know this is probably not a temporary delay; this is probably a delay until next year.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further on his reservation, if there are some gaps, we could have more talk about these nominees or other nominees later on this week. There may not be the large gaps that there might appear because we do have a number of appropriations conference reports that we think are going to be ready this week, plus the DC appropriations issue we believe we can resolve, although it will take a little time, 2 or 3 hours on that, plus Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens have indicated they would like to have the line-item veto disapproval which could take 10 hours. 
And that does not count regular bills. We have to do something about the Amtrak strike this week, one way or the other. So I think we are going to have a good bit of time that will be used. But I know the Senator will be glad to talk when the time comes, and I appreciate his comments.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, too often the media reports about a terrible mistake made or a crime committed by one of America's young people. But there are millions and millions of young people who we never hear about--young people who are doing the right things, young people avoiding the mistakes often made by their peers, young people working hard in school, young people participating in the civic activities of their town or city, and, sometimes, young people doing remarkable things. 
Mr. President, I want to tell my Senate colleagues about one special young person, Andrew Montgomery, from Crystal Springs, MS. 
On August 19, 1995, when he was only eleven years old, Andrew first proved himself. He came upon a crowd of people who had surrounded an unconscious woman near the seawall in Galveston, TX. No one in the crowd was taking action, so Andrew stepped forward and administered CPR and treatment for shock. Eventually, an emergency medical team arrived and transported the woman to a local hospital, where she recovered. 
Mr. President, 2 years later, Andrew Montgomery was again confronted with an emergency situation. On August 10 of this year, Andrew was riding with his family near Lafayette, LA, when they came upon a multivehicle wreck. A car and a pickup had collided, and the car came to rest in a ditch, with a heavy metal sign collapsed upon it. Andrew quickly rushed to the scene. The car was smashed and on fire. The driver of the car was dead, and a baby in the back seat, covered with blood, was in danger. Unable to immediately pull the baby out of the wrecked car, Andrew wrapped the infant in a beach towel, and protected the baby from the smoke and flames of the car fire. Andrew was then joined by his parents, Ann and Bill, Kenneth Puckett, a truckdriver, and Dr. Thomas Dewey. The group rescued the child and lifted the baby hand-over-hand out of the ditch in which the car settled following the collision. 
Mr. President, how many of us would have had the presence to do the same? Mind you, we're talking about a young boy. 
Andrew, I might add, knew what to do because he received training from both the American Red Cross and the Boy Scouts. Andrew's reactions were a direct result of this training. It saved two lives, and speaks volumes about how important organizations like the Red Cross and the Boy Scouts are to all Americans. 
Mr. President, as I said, too often we hear about the `bad eggs' among America's youth. And, we worry about America's future. But the story of Andrew Montgomery should remind us all how many of our youth are out there doing the right thing. 
We too often also hear about the broken families in America. But Andrew's story should remind us how many of our families are still out there doing the right thing. His parents, Ann and Bill Montgomery have good reason to be proud of their son. They raised a boy who is willing to make sacrifices, willing to work hard, and willing to act courageously. I want to also recognize his parents for setting a good example for their son, by being active in their community--as Scout leaders. 
Mr. President, I personally want to recognize Andrew Montgomery for being an outstanding example of America's youth.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, I have just filed the last cloture motion to the highway bill. This cloture vote will occur on Tuesday. If cloture is not invoked on Tuesday, I will have to ask the Senate then to move on to other items. 
Needless to say, I hope cloture will be invoked on Tuesday. I know there are some Senators who have voted against cloture three times who intend to vote for it if this is going to be the last one. I have, as majority leader, basically given 2 weeks to opening statements and a preliminary discussion about the highway bill while we tried to see if other issues could be resolved. But unless we can get cloture invoked and I can unstack the tree of amendments and allow us to go forward with full debate and amendments on ISTEA, if this matter is going to continue to be held up at the insistence of Senator McCain and Senator Feingold because of the campaign finance reform issue, then I have no alternative but to stop. 
I really think that is unfortunate. I think the Senate was showing leadership by moving on to the ISTEA highway bill. The Environment and Public Works Committee came up with a good bill. It was reported unanimously from the committee. I think we would show leadership to pass the 6-year bill whereas the House had only passed a 6-month extension. I think it would be better for the country if we did this bill now. I think it would be better for the Senate if we did it now. I think that next spring or next summer or, heaven forbid, next fall, if we are still working on the highway bill, it will get tougher and tougher and tougher as more problems are developed, more amendments are written and as we get closer to elections. Every State is going to believe it has to have a little bit more, a little bit more for highways and bridges. That is fine. We all need that. But we need some kind of closure on how we deal with the formula and what funds are going to be available to our States. 
I think this is very unfortunate. I do not see there is any process now for there even to be a short-term extension. Everything seems to be tied to something on campaign finance reform that we have not been able to develop yet. I want to emphasize to all Senators that yesterday I believed Senator Daschle and I had come very, very close to having an agreement worked out whereby we would consider this other, unrelated to the highway bill, campaign finance issue next March, by the end of the first week in March, and that amendments would be in order and that there wasn't going to be an effort to fill up the tree and that Senators could offer amendments, first degree, second degree, and motions to table would be in order. Everything would basically go the regular order. But for some reason, at the last minute, interested Senators could not agree to that, but a very good-faith effort was made by Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue, and it did not come about. 
I am willing to have the Senate have this issue before it and have one more cloture vote, but then we will have to move on. 
I also want to emphasize that next Monday we do intend to take up some important issues, including the Interior appropriations conference report we have finally completed action on. If we have to, we are going to call for a vote on the Federal Reserve nominees that the President has sent to the Senate and the Senate committee has now reported to the full Senate for action. And we are going to have to take up legislation dealing with the threatened Amtrak strike. 
So we will have a full plate of things to do Monday and Tuesday, and we hope other appropriations bills will be ready in short order next week. In fact, we had meetings this morning on two of them, the Labor, HHS appropriations bill--we think maybe some good progress was made there, I say to the Senator from West Virginia--and we are getting closer, I believe, on the foreign operations appropriations bill. So we have other business that we need to do and must do, and we cannot give the balance of our time to the delay of the ISTEA bill based on the campaign finance reform issue.

Mr. LOTT. As I just indicated, on Monday I hope the Senate will be able to take final action on the Federal Reserve Board nominees. We may still give some additional time to consideration of the pending highway bill. It is our intent to have the Interior appropriations conference report voted on following the vote on Judge Marbley at 5 o'clock. Also, the Senate could be asked to consider Amtrak reform legislation in conjunction with the strike legislation. 
Under a previous order, at 5 o'clock, we will conduct the one rollcall vote on Judge Marbley. Then it could be followed by as many as three other votes, and we will have to determine that during the day Monday. But a minimum of one and possibly a maximum of five votes. 
Another cloture motion was filed today, of course, on the highway bill, and that vote would occur on Tuesday.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I would need to consult further with Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and the Senator from West Virginia. But if they would agree, I think we should look for a time on Tuesday or Wednesday to take that matter up, because we are not sure exactly what will be our final days in session this year but it could be just the next 2 weeks. So I would like to go ahead and take this up at the earliest possible time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there is still some more debate on the ISTEA legislation or other actions that may be considered tonight. So we will not do the closing at this time. But just so Senators will know what the present situation is and what they can expect later on tonight, of course, we do not expect any further recorded votes tonight. It is our anticipation that at 9:45 in the morning, there will be a vote on the cloture motion relating to the ISTEA highway construction bill. I am still trying to find a way to clear this bill of the obstructions that have been placed in its path so that we will have safe highways and safe roads and get this major legislation through the Senate. We have had two cloture votes. The next cloture vote will be tomorrow at 9:45 a.m. 
We made a serious effort today by all concerned on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the issue with relation to the campaign finance reform matter to find a way to move forward, and I believe that Senator Daschle and I had basically reached an agreement, but then other Senators indicated that they wanted something more and we couldn't complete that agreement. 
I think that is really unfortunate. I thought what we had come up with was very fair, that we would take up campaign finance reform by the first week of March and that amendments would be in order. But we will continue to work on it, hopefully, because I do think this is very important legislation. I will have to make a decision as majority leader after tomorrow's cloture vote as to what to do at that point. If we get cloture, obviously, we will go right on with the amendments with regard to ISTEA, the highway transportation bill, and I believe we can get it completed next week even though we have a lot of very important amendments pending. 
If we don't get cloture, I have to make a call as to whether to spend another half of a week trying to cut off basically the filibuster that has gone on with regard to this legislation and move on to other matters. 
I think that would be unfortunate. I think this is important legislation that needs to be passed. 
On Monday, if we have not been able to clear from hold the Federal Reserve nominees, it would be my intention to move to debate those and get a vote on them. And we also are going to have to act early next week, in some form, with regard to the threatened Amtrak strike. 
Beyond that, we will consult with Members on both sides of the aisle and let them know what will be the legislative schedule next week. 
If we cannot get something worked out on ISTEA, we will move on to other issues. And, of course, I would like to continue to work on the Executive Calendar, but that takes cooperation on both sides of the aisle. And if we cannot get cooperation on committee meetings and on how we resolve campaign finance reform, I guess we will not get cooperation on nominations either. But we will keep moving forward and see if we can come to some reasonable agreement so we can get this very important legislation completed. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort by Senator Lieberman, as well as Senators McConnell, Reid, D'Amato, Boxer, Coverdell, Helms, Durbin, McCain, Brownback, Bennett, Campbell, Feingold, Mack, Shelby, Wyden, Hutchinson, Feinstein, Hollings, Mikulski, Nickles, Cleland, Inouye, Dorgan, and Bryan. 
This is very important legislation which addresses a serious threat, in my opinion, to American security: Iran's relentless efforts to acquire ballistic missile technology. There is no doubt that Iran is the major proliferation danger in the world today. Iran is committed to developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the means to deliver them. 
The consequences of Iran's ballistic missile development would be disastrous. Iran actively supports terrorist groups around the world. Earlier this year, a German court found Iran's intelligence services responsible for assassinations on German soil. There is a very real possibility that Iran was behind the murder of 19 Americans in the Khobar Towers bombing on June 25, 1996. 
News reports now indicate that Iran is developing two missiles with ranges of 800 or more than 1,200 miles. Such missiles would be able to reach American forces stationed in the Persian Gulf. They would be able to reach Israel. They would be able to reach our NATO ally, Turkey. They would be able to reach all the way into Central Europe, as a matter of fact. 
The terrorist regime in Iran has already demonstrated its willingness and ability to use bombings and hit squads to support its radical agenda in the Middle East and in Europe. We cannot sit back and allow Tehran to acquire ballistic missile capability that could hit even more targets with the push of a button, possibly even with nuclear warheads. 
This administration's track record on dealing with Iran is not encouraging. We are always anxious to work with the administration in these important foreign policy issues. In 1995, with great fanfare, the administration announced it was strongly opposed to the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to Iran and the issue would be handled in the commission headed by Vice President Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. In the intervening 2 years there has been no progress in halting that sale, or sales of this type. 
In 1995 the administration gave a green light to Iranian extremists who gained a foothold in Europe by arming the Bosnian Government. The residue of that green light still affects the situation in Bosnia today. So, there are problems, obviously, in this area. 
When the news reports in the Washington Times over the last month indicated that there were very serious concerns about Russian support for Iran's missile technology programs, many of us on Capitol Hill looked for action. Vice President Gore, we were told, would raise the issue with the Prime Minister when he was in Russia, but the response that he received apparently was to call the news report `stupid' and `not worthy of comment.' 
I think, after consultation with the administration, that this legislation is necessary because not enough has been done to address this Iranian missile development. I believe it is clear that existing United States law has been broken by Russian entities. Emissaries have gone to Moscow, information has been shared. Yet, no sanctions action has been taken by the administration. 
This legislation is necessary because it is time to act. Many have recently expressed concern about Congress imposing `unilateral' sanctions. My response is that Congress will step into a vacuum and take unilateral action when inadequate action is being taken in other areas. 
The legislation is quite simple. It requires the President to report in 30 days, and every 180 days thereafter, on entities that have transferred or attempted to transfer goods, technology, technical assistance or facilities that contribute to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop or produce ballistic missiles. 
The legislation requires three sanctions on any such entities: No export of American arms, no export of restricted dual-use items, and no American Government assistance. So it is a targeted sanction, aimed at the entities involved in these actions. 
Congress has established with successive administrations, special criteria in existing law for each of these three things. Our legislation simply says if you help Iran acquire ballistic missile capability, you will not get arms, controlled exports, or taxpayer-financed aid. 
Similar bipartisan legislation is being introduced in the House today. I refer back to my opening remarks. There are already, I believe some 26 Senators who are cosponsoring on both sides of the aisle, from all regions of the country and all philosophical spectrums. 
I hope the Senate will take action on this legislation before the end of the session. Certainly, it will provide, hopefully, some additional impetus for the administration to aggressively address this issue. A number of changes have been made in the legislation to meet policy and legal concerns of the administration, and I hope the administration will see the merits of imposing these serious and rapid sanctions on entities which aid Iran's efforts to threaten American forces and American allies. 
We cannot stand mute. We cannot ignore this very serious matter. We will continue to work with the administration and support any aggressive efforts that they care to use. But after serious consideration, and after consultation particularly with Senator Lieberman, I thought it was important that we go ahead and introduce this legislation today, and explain why we are doing it.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, under the provisions of rule XXII, the second cloture vote will occur immediately, unless changed by unanimous consent. We had the first cloture vote, which was not agreed to. Then we had the vote on the continuing resolution. I am glad we got that done now. 
My intent had been to have the second cloture vote later on in the day to give Members time to assess where we were on the ISTEA, and see if they would like to have an ISTEA bill and see if there is a way to sort of get things that are wrapped around the axle moved in such a way that we could go forward with this very important transportation infrastructure bill. But I understand our Democratic colleagues will not grant consent for the cloture vote to occur at 3 o'clock today. They want the cloture vote right now. I don't think that is wise. I think we need 3 hours here to sort of assess where we are, have some discussions, and then have a vote. 
So, with that in mind, I will shortly move to recess the Senate, then, until 3 o'clock today. Therefore, Senators can expect the next vote to occur at 3 p.m., on the second cloture motion with regard to the ISTEA highway infrastructure extension bill, and hopefully we will have some greater success there. 
If we don't get cloture--- and I had hoped we would on the second cloture vote--we have a cloture motion filed and we will have another cloture vote on Friday. I know some Senators have things they need to do. I know there will be some Senators absent and therefore it would be even more difficult to get the cloture vote to pass on Friday. 
If we don't get cloture then, as majority leader I have to make a call, after consultation with Members on both sides of this very important ISTEA transportation bill, as to whether we just pull it down and then next week try to move to other issues. We may have to have debate and votes on the Federal Reserve nominees. We have two Federal Reserve nominees that there is a hold on. It would be my intent to call those up because I don't think we ought to delay Federal Reserve nominees for any of our maneuverings around here. That could possibly be done on Monday. 
We also have a judge on the calendar that we have cleared, except a vote is going to be required. So we probably would have that vote on Monday at 5 o'clock. And again, I am not locking all these in. I am just trying to advise Members where we are. 
Then we could very well move to a variety of bills that are pending--they are very serious--that we would like to get done before we adjourn for the end of the year. That would include, of course, Amtrak reform, which we need very badly. A lot of good work has been done on it. We have, of course, a threatened Amtrak strike that we may have to act on. We have the juvenile justice bill. We have the adoption and foster care bill. I thought we had bipartisan agreement on that, but there seem to be some problems with it. But we will begin to look at bringing up other bills. Also, then, next week we hope to begin the fast-track legislation, with the intent of completing action one way or the other on fast track early the first week in November. 
So that is kind of where it is. I think my inclination now is, if we don't get cloture this afternoon and we don't get cloture tomorrow, then we would have to just say, well, campaign finance reform took down the very important ISTEA infrastructure bill. That is kind of where we are, and I am prepared now to move that the Senate stand in recess until 3 p.m. today.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. We have already had votes on the McCain-Feingold issue. It may not have been the way that some Senators would have liked to have had it, but we have had votes on it. There is not a consensus on what to do on campaign finance reform at this time that could get the approval of the Senate, which requires 60 votes. I mean, that is what the Senator from North Dakota has indicated he is going to force on the fast track. He's probably going to have a filibuster and we'll have to get 60 
votes on cloture to move on fast track. He may be successful in blocking fast track, which the President is very anxious to get and, in a meeting earlier this week, requested that I schedule it before we go out, and I want to do that. But he understands full well what the rules of the Senate are, and he's going to take full advantage of them, and that's his right. 
So, the same is applicable here. There is no consensus yet on how we can come together on campaign finance reform. This issue will come up again. I don't think it makes good sense for it to come up again this year. It will come up again in the future. I assume it will come up in a very different form in the future. Maybe not. Maybe in many different forms. I realize Senators are going to try to have it considered again at a later time and, as the majority leader, the floor leader of the Senate, it would be my intent to try to schedule it in some orderly way, where Senators will know when it is coming. I have already indicated, and Senator Daschle has indicated, that we would like to see some action take place on it by the first week in March, either during that week or earlier perhaps. But we would need to look at the calendar for the year and look at the President's Day recess and work around that. 
I don't see right now an agreement on how that would come up, because I just think the atmosphere, again, is not such that we can get an agreement worked out. Some people said, `Oh, well, let's just have it freewheeling and let everybody offer whatever amendment they want to and see what happens.' I'm not sure that's going to do us any good or the country any good, where we have a bunch of amendments where we try to pin each other's ears back and at the end of the day we have a filibuster and get nothing and we start off the year in a cranky mood and had a great roar and accomplish nothing. 
I am prepared to continue to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the issue and look to how that is going to be handled next year. I am prepared to say now that I realize it is going to come up and I will schedule it. But I have not been able to get an agreement as to how that would be done, and I don't think we are going to get that done at this time.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again I want to emphasize that on this campaign finance issue, the idea of adding more laws on the books on top of the laws that are already there that are already impossible to comply with in many respects, and certainly not without lawyers and accountants and advisers to make sure that you are complying with the already convoluted, difficult campaign law requirements, we had three cloture votes recently on the campaign finance bill and we had two other cloture votes on the paycheck equity. We have had five votes. Cloture was not achieved, and cloture is very important. Just like what are we trying to do on ISTEA? Get cloture. What am I going to have to do on fast track? I am going to have to try to get cloture to cut off an extended debate so we can get to the substance of the issue and bring it to a head. We have had five votes. It's not as if we have not voted on this. Consensus is not there. 
As far as picking up the paper and seeing the problems, yes, you can pick up the paper and see how the existing laws are being violated or maneuvered. Without saying who did it, which side, the fact of the matter is, what we need to do is to see if we can find ways to encourage people and get people to comply with existing laws before we start trying to add a whole bunch more on top of it that would limit free speech, that would limit people's abilities to have a fair shot at getting elected. That is what is at stake here. That is what I would like to be able to do, is maintain the ability to get my message across. 
In my State, if I cannot raise the money to get my message across, there are those who are going to try to get it across for me, some of those same newspapers you are talking about. Yes, if I had to depend on them, I wouldn't be here. So what you are talking about is trying to find a way where a guy like Trent Lott can't get an opportunity to get his message across to the constituents. I don't want to give that up. I think I have a right to be able to raise the funds to try to make my case to the constituents of my State. I don't think--we cannot limit advocacy. We can't do that. This is still America. 
But, again, to put it back in the calmer voice, we know it's going to come back up. Maybe someday we will quit trying to trump each other and try to see if there is some way maybe there might be some things that need to be done that we can agree on. I don't think we are there yet. 
I would be glad to yield to Senator McCain.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have said I know this issue will come up again, rightly or wrongly, and I would like to schedule it in a way for everybody to know when it is coming up. I think Senator Daschle and I can agree on that. What I can't guarantee the Senator from Massachusetts is a process that would match or fit his word `proper' or `adequate.' It is in the eye of the beholder. What you think might be proper may not be what some other Senator thinks is proper as to how it should be considered. And also, if you are talking about setting up a process where at the end you win on the McCain-Feingold version, whether it is the first or second one, we don't think that is proper. 
So if the idea is you have to have a process where we can have a great big fight, after which nothing happens, or whereby you can be relatively assured you are going to be able to win the issue, we can't agree to that.

Mr. LOTT. We tried to get the vote on the paycheck equity amendment, and cloture was defeated twice on that. The situation may be different 3 or 4 months from now. I think the atmosphere is charged now in a way that makes it difficult for us to define now what the process will be. By the end of February, the first of March, something that might appear impossible now we might be able to work out. We can continue to talk about how we would do that. 
Now, in the meantime, time marches on. The calendar is moving on. We are struggling to have committees meet that, by the way, need to meet so they can confirm Foreign Service or Ambassador nominations and judges. We are having trouble with that. We are trying to see if we can continue to move some of these people on the Executive Calendar. We have Members who are working on the highway transportation bill. Senator Chafee has been here now for a week and nothing has happened. Senator Byrd is very interested in this bill and has an amendment on which he has been working with Senator Gramm and others. Senator Baucus is very anxious to see if we can't get going forward. 
It is the usual process around here. Sometimes you get just completely bollixed. The only way you change that is you start moving--you move a little here, you move a little there. Senator Daschle and I have been trying to do that a little bit this week. We made a little progress here, a little progress there. If we can get these wheels creaking and moving forward, then who knows what will happen. 
As long as we are hunkered down, saying, `We've got to get this agreed to before we do that; if we don't get that, you don't get this,' and we wind up getting nothing. I hope that is not what we will do. We can see. I hope we can get cloture on ISTEA. If we got cloture this afternoon, we would still be performing a miracle if we finish this bill by next Thursday, and if we don't get it done next week, how do we get fast track where we have been assured we are going to have extended debate on that, and maybe other games being played with that one? 
I think we need to move the ball forward, get cloture, get on this bill, get some of these amendments offered that are very important and very critical to various States, the entire country. There are some other issues that will be hotly debated on this bill. We will still be here, and we will still have time to have meetings and talk about what we are going to do. 
I think I just saw probably the greatest exchange between my two great friends of Scottish descent, McCain and McConnell, a moment ago. Who knows what great things might happen once we start moving things forward?

Mr. LOTT. Senator Ford is correct. Thank you for focusing attention on this important safety aspect of the amendment. Our country increasingly depends on a reliable, safe, dependable underground infrastructure of pipelines and communications networks. To protect these facilities against damage from excavation activities, States have developed one-call programs. These programs notify facility owners of imminent excavation in the vicinity of those facilities. The owners can then mark the location of those facilities, protecting both the facilities and the excavator. My legislative goal is to augment and improve the effectiveness of these State programs. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19971022</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. The answer is an emphatic `no.' The legislation does not impose any federal mandate on the States to modify their existing one-call programs. The bill does not dictate the content of these programs from Washington. Period. The legislation does, however, encourage States to improve their programs, and it makes funding available for that purpose. 
To be eligible for the funding, the State programs must meet certain minimum standards, but even those standards are performance-based, not prescriptive. 
Frankly, legislation that contained a federal mandate for a one-call system was tried a few years ago, and it failed. There were endless fights over how the bill should be written precisely due to the fact that there are indeed 50 differing perceptions. Valid perceptions and experiences which match up to the many programs already in existence. This year, this mistake was avoided with this legislative approach--no mandates. And I am pleased to say that is why it enjoys broad support on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. LOTT. What I have found is that there is not one single one-call definition that applies equally to all 50 States. The various State laws on the books have certain elements in common, but there are just as many differences, and those differences often are appropriate. Montana will not need the same law as Mississippi. For that reason, the bill allows States flexibility by not mandating a single definition written in Washington.

Mr. LOTT. Again, I say to Senator Ford, the bill does not require States to change their existing programs. So it would not change the way railroads are treated under any existing State laws. I understand about 30 States laws now cover at least some railroad activities while about 10 specifically exempt railroads from coverage. The bill will not change the exemption in these States. Will not. The fact that 30 States have chosen to include railroads within their programs suggests that at least in these instances, State legislatures determined that some potential threat to underground facilities from railroad activity does exist. Again, this bill in and of itself will not require a change in how the railroad activity is treated. Will not. 
However, I want to reiterate that what is appropriate for one State may not be appropriate for another. To receive Federal assistance under the bill, a State must only demonstrate that its program covers those excavators whose action poses a significant risk to underground facilities. 
The State's decisions will not be measured and second-guessed against a national standard.

Mr. LOTT. Again, if States do not now require railroads to participate as operators of underground facilities, then there still is no provision in the bill that would change that status. Remember, no mandates. Most State programs do not require participation by persons whose underground facilities lie within their own property like a gas station. The bill in no way discourages States from continuing such common sense exclusions.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to report to my colleagues on the activities in the House to establish a new export policy on encryption. This is an issue that is still at the top of my list of legislation I hope this Congress can resolve within the next 2 months. The House's actions last month turned a spotlight on how this issue should ultimately be resolved. 
Let me briefly review the issue. Encryption is a mathematical way to scramble and unscramble digital computer information during transmission and storage. The strength of encryption is a function of its size, as measured in computer bits. The more bits an encryption system has, the more difficult it is for someone else to illegally unscramble or hack into that information. 
Today's computer encryption systems commonly used by businesses range from 40 bits in key length to 128 bits. A good hacker, let's say a criminal or a business competitor, can readily break into a computer system safeguarded by a lower-technology 40-bit encryption system. On the other hand, the 128-bit encryption systems are much more complex and pose a significant challenge to any would-be hacker. 
Obviously, all of us would prefer to have the 128-bit systems. And equally as important, we would like to buy such systems from American companies. Firms we can routinely and safely do business with. Foreign companies and individuals also want to buy such systems from American companies. They admire and respect our technological expertise, and trust our business practices. The United States remains the envy of the world in terms of producing top-notch encryption and information security products. 
However, current regulations prohibit U.S. companies from exporting encryption systems stronger than the low-end, 40-bit systems. A few exceptions have been made for 56-bit systems. Until recently, it has been the administration's view that stronger encryption products are so inherently dangerous they should be classified at a level equal to munitions, and that the export of strong encryption must be heavily restricted. 
While we are restricting our own international commerce, foreign companies are now manufacturing and selling stronger, more desirable encryption systems, including the top-end 128-bit systems, anywhere in the world they want. Clearly, our policy doesn't make sense. Just as clearly, our export policies on encryption have not kept up to speed with either the ongoing changes in encryption technology or the needs and desires of foreign markets for U.S. encryption products. 
My intention is neither to jeopardize our national security nor harm law enforcement efforts. I believe we must give due and proper regard to the national security and law enforcement implications of any changes in our policy regarding export of encryption technology. But it is painfully obvious we must modernize our export policies on encryption technology, so that U.S. companies can participate in the world's encryption marketplace. The legislative initiative on this issue has always been about exports, but this summer that changed. 
During the past month, the FBI has attempted to change the debate by proposing a series of new mandatory controls on the domestic sale and use of encryption products. Let me be clear. There are currently no restrictions on the rights of Americans to use encryption to protect their personal financial or medical records or their private e-mail messages. There have never been domestic limitations, and similarly, American businesses have always been free to buy and use the strongest possible encryption to protect sensitive information from being stolen or changed. But now, the FBI proposes to change all that. 
The FBI wants to require that any company that produces or offers encryption security products or services guarantee immediate access to plain text information without the knowledge of the user. Their proposal would subject software companies and telecommunications providers to prison sentences for failure to guarantee immediate access to all information on the desktop computers of all Americans. That would move us into an entirely new world of surveillance, a very intrusive surveillance, where every communication by every individual can be accessed by the FBI. 
Where is probable cause? Why has the FBI assumed that all Americans are going to be involved in criminal activities? Where is the Constitution? 
And how would this proposal possibly help the FBI? According to a forthcoming book by the M.I.T. Press, of the tens of thousands of cases handled annually by the FBI, only a handful have involved encryption of any type, and even fewer involved encryption of computer data. Let's face it--despite the movies, the FBI solves its cases with good old-fashioned police work, questioning potential witnesses, gathering material evidence, and using electronic bugging or putting microphones on informants. Restricting encryption technology in the U.S. would not be very helpful to the FBI. 
The FBI proposal won't work. I have talked with experts in the world of software and cryptography, who have explained that the technology which would provide compliance with the FBI standard simply does not exist. The FBI proposal would force a large unfunded mandate on our high technology firms, at a time when there is no practical way to accomplish that mandate. 
Rather than solve problems in our export policy, this FBI proposal would create a whole new body of law and regulations restricting our domestic market. 
This and similar proposals would also have a serious impact on our foreign market. Overseas businesses and governments believe that the U.S. might use its keys to computer encryption systems to spy on their businesses and politicians. Most U.S. software and hardware manufacturers believe this is bad for business and that nobody will trust the security of U.S. encryption products if this current policy continues. In fact, this proposal appears to violate the European Union's data-privacy laws, and the European Commission is expected to reject it this week. 
So, the FBI proposal would: Invade our privacy; be of minimal use to the FBI; would require nonexistent technology; would create new administrative burdens; and would seriously damage our foreign markets. 
This is quite a list. 
Mr. President, the FBI proposal is simply wrong. I have learned that even the administration does not support this new FBI proposal. So why does the FBI believe it must now subject all Americans to more and more surveillance? 
This independent action by the FBI has created confusion and mixed signals which are troublesome for the Senate as it works on this legislation. Perhaps the FBI and the Justice Department need to focus immediately on a coordinated encryption position. 
Mr. President, I congratulate the members of the House Commerce Committee for rejecting this FBI approach by a vote margin of more than 2 to 1. 
I am sure all of my colleagues are sympathetic to the fact that emerging technologies create new problems for the FBI. 
But we must acknowledge several truths as Congress goes forward to find this new policy solution. People increasingly need strong information security through encryption and other means to protect their personal and business information. This demand will grow, and somebody will meet it. In the long term, it is clearly in our national interest that U.S. companies meet the market demand. Individuals and businesses will either obtain that protection from U.S. firms or from foreign firms. I firmly believe that all of our colleagues want American firms to successfully compete for this business. Today there are hundreds of suppliers of strong encryption in the world marketplace. Strong encryption can be easily downloaded off the Internet. Even if Congress wanted to police or eliminate encryption altogether, I am not sure that is doable. 
So, let's deal with reality. Clamping down on the constitutional rights of American citizens, in an attempt to limit the use of a technology, is the wrong solution. The wrong solution. This is especially true with encryption technology because it has so many beneficial purposes. It prevents hackers and espionage agents from stealing valuable information, or worse, from breaking into our own computer networks. It prevents them from disrupting our power supply, our financial markets, and our air traffic control system. This is scary--and precisely why we want this technology to be more available. 
Only a balanced solution is acceptable. Ultimately, Congress must empower Americans to protect their own information. Americans should not be forced to only communicate in ways that simply make it more convenient for law enforcement officials. This is not our national tradition. It is not consistent with our heritage. It should not become a new trend. 
Mr. President, I would like to establish a framework to resolve this difficult issue. I hope to discuss it with the chairmen and ranking members of the key committees. I especially look forward to working with the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Subcommittee on Communications, Senator Burns. He was the first to identify this issue and try to solve it legislatively. His approach on this issue has always been fair and equitable, attempting to balance industry wants with law enforcement requirements. 
I believe there are other possible ideas which could lead to a consensus resolution of the encryption issue. It is my hope that industry and law enforcement can come together to address these issues, not add more complexity and problems. The bill passed by the House Commerce Committee included a provision establishing a National Encryption Technology Center. It would be funded by in-kind contributions of hardware, software, and technological expertise. The National Encryption Technology Center would help the FBI stay on top of encryption and other emerging computer technologies. This is a big step. This is a big step in the right direction. 
It is time to build on that positive news to resolve encryption policy. 
Mr. President, there is an op-ed piece which appeared in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, September 26. It is well written and informative, despite the fact that its author is a good friend of mine. Mr. Jim Barksdale is the president and CEO of Netscape Communications and is well-versed in encryption technology. Mr. Barksdale's company does not make encryption products; they license such products from others. They sell Internet and business software and, as Jim has told me many times, his customers require strong encryption features and will buy those products either from us or foreign companies. 
Again, let's deal with reality. The credit union manager in Massachusetts, the real estate agent in Mississippi, the father writing an e-mail letter to his daughter attending a California university, each want privacy and security when using the computer. They will buy the best systems available to ensure that privacy and security. And, in just the same way, the banker in Brussels, Belgium, the rancher in Argentina, and the mother writing e-mail to her daughter in a university in Calcutta, India, each of these people also want privacy and security. They also will buy the best systems available to ensure that privacy and security. And they want encryption systems they trust--American systems. That's what this debate is about. 
Mr. President, if Congress does not modernize our export controls, we run the real risk of destroying the American encryption industry. And we risk giving a significant and unfair advantage to our foreign business competitors.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC] for doing the right thing about Japan's ports. This action was not unexpected by the Japanese carriers, but I am sure many were surprised with the FMC's dedication to seeing this through. During the past few days, the Nation watched as a long running dispute between Japan and those countries whose ships call on Japan's ports appears to have been resolved. 
Japan's ports are widely known as the most inefficient and expensive in the developed world. Additionally, Japan's port system discriminates against non-Japanese ocean carriers.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this firm action has had the desired effect. 
An agreement between the United States and Japan on the port issue has been reached. The FMC's order will not have to be carried out, but it was vital to ensuring that Japan's discriminatory port practices are ended. International trade only works when trading partners treat each other fairly. Diplomatic solutions only work when both sides live up to their commitments, and this only occurs when nations know there are genuine consequences to inaction. 
The FMC's active role in the port dispute ensured that United States ocean carriers will be treated fairly in Japan. I want to personally recognize Harold Creel, the Chairman of the FMC, and FMC Commissioners Ming Hsu, Del Won, and Joe Scroggins for their efforts to resolve the Japanese port dispute in a firm, yet fair, manner. 
Clearly, the FMC has both the responsibility and the authority to take the action. And, the Commissioners approached their decision in a thoughtful and measured way. 
I also want to thank the other members of the negotiation team, in particular, the Maritime Administration which provided much needed maritime expertise.

Mr. LOTT. I would also note that the authority under which the FMC took these actions, section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, and the independence of the U.S. Government's international shipping oversight agency would be preserved under S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997. Under this bill, the action would be carried out by the U.S. Transportation Board, an expanded and renamed Surface Transportation Board. To those who expressed concerns that this multimodal board would be unwilling or unable to be an effective regulator of the maritime industry, I tell them to look at the Surface Transportation Board's record of making tough decisions with regard to the mergers of the largest railroads in the United States. When provided with similar maritime expertise, this combined board will certainly have the ability and willingness to protect the interests of the United States in international maritime disputes.

Mr. LOTT. Tomorrow, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 12:30, after coming in at noon. At 12:30, we will go back to the ISTEA legislation. It is hoped that the Senate will make some progress on this important legislation which authorizes the funding for transportation projects and safety programs so essential to the transportation infrastructure of this country. 
As a reminder to all Senators, a cloture motion was filed this afternoon on the ISTEA legislation. Therefore, all second-degree amendments must be filed prior to the vote on Thursday. In addition, a cloture vote will occur on Thursday, with the exact time to be announced later, with the mandatory quorum being waived. 
In addition, the Senate may turn to appropriations conference reports that become available at any time and, of course, Members can expect votes during the day tomorrow. 
I know Senator Chafee, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, would like very much to get on with the substance of this bill. I believe it is important legislation and that there is a growing desire to work together on this bipartisan issue, and I believe and hope that we will get cloture on Thursday. If not, then we would have another vote on Friday, so that we could get to the germane amendments and deal with this issue in a serious way. 
It is my intent to continue to work with the members of the committee--they have done good work on this legislation, it was reported out of the committee unanimously--and complete action on it next week so we will have this 6-year bill completed in the Senate. Then we can see what might happen at that point. Then it would be my intention, shortly after that, whenever that may be, late next week I hope, to go to fast track legislation. 
This is ambitious, but these are very important bills that I believe most Senators want us to act on. The President of the United States today personally asked me to try to move both of these bills, and I will continue to work with Senator Daschle and other Senators to try to find a way to move this process forward. We did have some good faith exhibited today. Our committees were allowed to meet. We did move some nominations that are required, needed for the administration in order for it to be able to do its work. I hope we can continue in that vein. 
So far we have not been able to get everybody to agree to a process whereby we can move on to important, substantive legislation like ISTEA and fast track and Amtrak and adoption and foster care legislation. But it is certainly my intention to do everything I can to get to these serious issues.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Committee on Rules and Administration has received requests from various law enforcement entities for copies of committee records related to the committee's inquiry into the 1996 Louisiana U.S. Senate election. The committee anticipates future similar requests. 
In accord with standard Senate practice, this resolution would authorize the Rules Committee to provide committee records in response to these requests.

Mr. LOTT. The Senator from Texas is correct. Amtrak is an important part of the national transportation system, not just for the Northeast Corridor, but for the entire interstate passenger rail system. This summer, in the Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress provided Amtrak with a secure source of funding for capital assets--some $2.3 billion for infrastructure. I worked hard for those funds, against considerable opposition, as did the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation. 
Rail transportation will continue to play a critical role in the American intermodal passenger system through the 21st century. However, rail transportation of passengers cannot be done without federal and state funding. It simply cannot be done. Just as commercial air transportation of passengers would have never gotten off the ground without federal and state assistance, rail transportation of passengers will not progress unless Congress provides infrastructure assistance. 
Congress is willing to support Amtrak, on the condition that Amtrak be reformed. That is why we insisted that not one dime of that $2.3 billion be spent until a reform package is approved by Congress. 
If Amtrak is to survive, it is critical that we complete our work on the authorizing legislation. However, the Senate still has some colleagues who are holding up the authorization bill over labor provisions. These provisions are essentially identical to language that labor supported just last year. Now some of our colleagues find them unacceptable. Organized labor has joined the Administration in creating a moving target. If this continues, Amtrak may never get the capital we provided. 
Mr. President, there will be no capital, I repeat, no $2.3 billion in capital funds provided until an authorization is enacted. 
I support a national rail system, but I will not support continued inefficient use of taxpayers money. 
If Amtrak is ever going to operate like a business, it must have flexibility. It needs freedom from federal laws that tie its hands at the collective bargaining table. Amtrak's labor rules must be the same as the private sector's, just like in other transportation modes. Labor's unwillingness to negotiate makes it appear that severance packages are more important than rail passenger service. 
Mayor John Robert Smith, of Meridian, Mississippi, has noted that rail labor's message seems to be that they are more willing to allow Amtrak to go under and sacrifice all 23,000 Amtrak employees to unemployment than to allow collective bargaining in the reform bill. Like me, he is appalled that the rail union leadership, supposedly representing its workers, would abandon them for its own purposes. Equally amazing is the fact that the Amtrak reform language is language that the union leadership itself once drafted, supported, and came in my office to ask me to support. And I did.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't have a complete schedule yet, but I believe we are ready to go to the HUD-VA appropriations conference report. We are trying to get clearance to go to Transportation appropriations conference report after that. We are still working with Senator Daschle so that we can outline the schedule for the remainder of the day. We are arranging for some debate time. We are also working on clearing some Executive Calendar nominations. Hopefully, within the next few minutes, we will be able to make some further specific announcement and try to get a UC on all of that. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, following 1 hour of debate, a vote will occur on the motion to invoke cloture with respect to the campaign finance reform bill. If cloture is not invoked, a cloture vote will then occur on the Lott amendment dealing with paycheck protection to S. 25. Therefore, Members can anticipate two back-to-back rollcall votes at approximately 1 p.m. I will notify Members as to the rest of the day. We are working now with the Democratic leader to see if we can get some understanding as to how we will proceed throughout the remainder of the day and, of course, how we will conclude the week's schedule. 
It is hoped that the Senate will be able to vote on the VA-HUD appropriations conference report. I believe that is pretty well agreed to. We are also hoping we will be able to get the papers and have a vote on the Transportation appropriations conference report, if a recorded vote is required. And we hope to have some discussion today on the ISTEA authorization bill. We have requests from Senators for a block of time around 4 o'clock. But we are trying now to get an understanding of how we will proceed through the remainder of the day. Once that is worked out, we will notify all the Members. Of course, we could have some action on the Executive Calendar, in addition, before we go out tonight. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, this exercise, unfortunately, is necessary to keep the Senate's focus on the vital legislation to reauthorize our Nation's surface transportation programs for the next 6 years. 
Really good work has been done by the Environment and Public Works Committee. In fact, I believe it was reported by a vote of 18 to 0--unanimous. While there are obviously some concerns--at any time you have concerns on a major transportation bill of this magnitude, there will be Senators on both sides of the aisle who will have amendments that will need to be offered and debated and voted on. And I am sure they will have support on both sides of the aisle. 
In accordance with all Senate rules, I have now completed the amendment process with relevant and needed changes to the bill. It is the intention of the manager to eventually have these necessary amendments agreed to by the Senate. However, in the meantime, these amendments will remain pending and the manager will agree to a consent that will lay aside amendment No. 1312 at any time any Member desires to offer a relevant transportation amendment. 
We have been in touch with Members who have relevant amendments they would like to offer. We will have Senators prepared to begin offering amendments this afternoon, and we will continue on that tomorrow. 
I look forward to making progress on this bill prior to our recess at the end of the week. I thank all colleagues for their cooperation. We do have cooperation from Senator Baucus, who has been working on this with Senator Chafee from the committee and Senator Warner and others on both sides. 
I know that there has been an agreement reached on some amendments coming up later on after we come back from the religious holiday and the Columbus Day recess, but we will have full time for debate. 
I think this is perhaps the most important bill left that we need to get done before we go out for the year sometime later on this month or early in November. So my intent would be to stay on it and try to make progress. 
I do not intend for this to become a campaign finance reform forum. There will be votes on that issue tomorrow. They are already scheduled. There will be other opportunities to debate this issue. But I think that the transportation bill is a very important bill, and we have a limited amount of time. The Senate is leading the way on this legislation, so we need to go ahead and get the process underway. I am prepared to give as much time as it takes to try to get it completed. 
Now, I might say for the information of all Senators, there is the possibility of at least one more vote. I had hoped we could clear the HUD-VA appropriations conference report. The chairman and the ranking member are ready to go but don't have the papers yet, so apparently we are not going to be able to do that tonight. We hope to do that tomorrow. Then, if we cannot work it out, we may even have to have a recorded vote to go out for the night. 
Now, we do not know exactly what time that would come. But I presume around 6 or 6:30. Perhaps it will not be necessary. But the Members should be on notice there is at this point the likelihood of one more vote tonight. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just respond. I am glad to hear the minority leader's comments. As the leader of the Democrats, certainly he has an obligation to represent their views. 
I agree this is certainly important legislation, and we should continue to look for ways that we can have it freely debated and amended and move forward. We will keep talking, and maybe we will find a way to do that. It is my preference to have every Senator have a chance to make his case. 
I would like to get out of the process we are in, but I want us to stay on the transportation bill and not have this become another debate on campaign finance reform. There are other ways that will be done. There are other opportunities that I am sure will come along, but we are trying to keep the focus on the highway bill. 
I have discussed with other Senators amendments they have in mind. I am going to do everything I can to assure every Senator, he or she, who has an amendment will be able to offer it. I would prefer it not be done in this process, if we can work out some kind of arrangement whereby we would not go with this, where any Senator, as is usually the case, can get up and offer an amendment. 
I know Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm, and others are working on an amendment that there will be a lot of interest in. I want to make sure that amendment has a freestanding opportunity to be fully debated and voted upon. I do not think we can ever complete this legislation without that occurring. I would like for a lot of other amendments that you have--this is important to every Senator. Every State will be affected by this, by the formula and by various parts of this bill--urban mass transportation. It is not something that is partisan. It is not something that is regional. It cuts all kinds of different ways. 
So if we can come up with a way over a period of time--I am not rushing to judgment, but I do want us to get on--I promised the chairman and the ranking member a week ago or more--and we had met earlier--that we would begin this bill today, the 8th of October. So I am trying to fulfill that commitment. I think we will find a way to get it done in a way that will allow us to complete our work, and then hopefully the House will follow our leadership on this. 
I would be glad to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the minority leader for doing that so that I can respond to his comments. First of all, let me tell Members where we are on this. The D.C. appropriations bill would be the pending issue. We do have a cloture motion that we filed on that. We would have a vote on that not before 4 o'clock. There is still a chance we would get an agreement between Senator Mack, Senator Gramm, and Senator Graham of Florida on the immigration issue, and then we would have one other pending amendment. I believe it is the Coats scholarship amendment for the District of Columbia. 
I believe those are the only two pending issues we would still have to dispose of on the D.C. appropriations bill, and then we would be able to go to final passage. That would be the last of the 13 appropriations bills, and then we could go on to conference on that and, hopefully, get all of these conference reports done before the continuing resolution runs out on the 23d, I believe, of this month. I wanted to make sure Members understand what we are trying to do here--go back to the D.C. appropriations bill. 
Now, with regard to the issue that we have been debating and the votes we just had, those two cloture votes that we just took, in my opinion, put an end to campaign finance reform at this time. They end the drive for phony reform, the kind that rigs the law in favor of one side or the other. They end the partisan game plan that treated the Constitution and the right of free speech guarantees as technicalities to be gotten around. That was the worst aspect of this year's effort to rewrite Federal campaign law, this willingness to abridge one of the fundamental freedoms of the American people. 
Earlier this year, to my amazement, 38 Senators actually voted to change the first amendment so that the Congress or a Federal agency could limit free speech. I never thought I would see that day arrive. Now, those 38 Senators have been joined by others who 
would not explicitly repudiate the first amendment, but they would in fact change it. I think that is a very serious challenge to the Constitution. 
What we have here is an effort to change the subject, to change the laws, where the laws we have on the books have already been broken. We do not have a consensus yet on how to proceed on this issue. We will be back on this issue some day. But I want to say again that until we do something about the paycheck equity issue, allow people to have some say over how their dues are used, and make sure that all campaign contributions are voluntary, I don't see how we can ever resolve this issue. So I feel good about what we did today. I think we did the right thing for the American people, the right thing in protecting free speech. Now we can move on to other issues, and we can continue to have other debate and other votes on this on other days. 
But as for now, I think we did the right thing. I am proud the Senate didn't turn its back on the Constitution. Just yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that you cannot limit free speech, you cannot limit advocacy issues in campaigns. We may not like it, but in America you should have a right to say how your monies are used. You should have the ability to express your position on an issue or on a candidate. 
So I hope that we can mend some of the problems that have developed and go on and do our work on a lot of important issues, and perhaps some day we can find a way to have an opportunity to come together on this issue. 
I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a question, without losing my right to the floor.

Mr. LOTT. I think that is an accurate description of what is happening parliamentarily. We have had parts of 7 days of debate. We have had two votes on this issue. As I said, it is obvious that a consensus has not been reached. We have other important issues that Members want to come up and debate. I accommodated advocates of the campaign reform bill, and we have had the debate they wanted. It came up early, not later. 
Now we have other issues we need to deal with. We need to deal with the District of Columbia appropriations bill, so that it can go to conference and hopefully go down to the President. A lot of work has gone into that bill this year to try to help the people in the District of Columbia. Do we want the District of Columbia appropriations bill to die here and be folded in some form or another in some CR at some point? 
I know the Senator from Massachusetts would like to see us do Amtrak reform so that, as a matter of fact, the funds we have identified, a flow of funds for Amtrak, can go forward. If we don't get the reform authorization language, the money will not be released. That is going to get to be a serious problem. We see 
the possibility, or even the probability, of a strike facing Amtrak later on this very month. It seems to me that we need to address some of those issues so that we can have adequate funding for Amtrak. I know the Senator from Massachusetts wants that. 
The President of the United States indicated to me through top staff officials on Monday morning that they hope we will vote on this issue and then move on to other issues, including the fast-track trade agreement. We have a lot of important work to do. I just said a moment ago that I don't think this is the last time we are going to talk about campaign finance reform. Maybe some day we can sit down and see what we might agree on. We are certainly not going to agree to a situation that gives up any American's right to free speech and that forces other citizens to pay, against their wishes, for campaigns they don't support. 
So you are right that our purpose here is to get off of campaign finance reform for now and go to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. I believe if we can do that, we could probably finish today. The next order of business I would like to try to go to is the ISTEA transportation infrastructure bill. That, too, is a bipartisan issue that Senator Daschle and I have talked about. Senator Max Baucus is working on it, along with Senator Chafee. There is a bipartisan group, and they are ready to go. In that case, the Senate needs to provide a little leadership because the House hasn't been able to pass a bill. They passed just an extension. We can pass a 6-year bill with a formula that would be fairer overall. There will be some disagreements on that. Until we get started, we are never going to resolve them.

Mr. LOTT. Well, when we have a solution even in distant sight that would be fair and would not restrict Americans' ability to participate in the election process, a system that is a fair one, then certainly I am always amenable to talking further. My record is replete with examples where I said, I think there is hope, let's work. But on this issue at this time, that hope is not there. There has been no real movement in that direction. So I don't foresee that happening. 
The Senator from Massachusetts was one of the ones who said, `Are you going to bring this up early, or are you going to wait until the last day of the last week of this session?' I said, no, I didn't want to do that because I didn't want us to end up on this issue without having the time to talk about it. I thought about it and I said, as a matter of fact, let's go ahead and get started because I thought there was a window of opportunity in here to have the debate, which we did for some 23 or 24 hours, on campaign finance reform. So I said, let's do it now. But I think it would not be good faith, after all that, to want to do it again next week, and every day we are in session, and the last day we are in session. I don't think that is in good faith either. That will wind up affecting everything else we need to do. 
We have had a good debate. We know that right now there is not a consensus. But if we begin to move toward one that is not partisan, that is fair and does not limit free speech, I am always willing to see what we can agree to.

Mr. LOTT. I cannot help but be reminded of some of the speeches I heard the former majority leader from Maine, Senator Mitchell, make on this floor. When a Senator would object to his procedures, he would reply that the Senator understands how the Senate operates; the Senator understands that in the Senate it quite often requires 60 votes, not 50 or 51 votes, to take action; the Senator understands that being deliberative doesn't mean having multiple votes. 
We could have had amendment after amendment after amendment and be on this subject for the rest of this month. But there was no consensus. There is no consensus. The truth of the matter is that the other side feels that, if they do not limit free speech, the bill is not worth having. We, on the contrary, feel that if people can't have control over how their contributions are used or their dues are used, the bill would not be fair. 
But, as I have said before, we will keep working on this. And I am always amenable to suggestions. I have been talking to Senators this very morning about that. 
I yield to the Senator, if I can. Let me yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, then I will come back to this side, for a question.

I believe, in answer to the Senator's question, that the majority of the Senate thinks there should be an opportunity for workers to be able to take time to be with their children, or to do whatever they might need to do--for the PTA or for their own health reasons. The U.S. Senate could, by a majority vote, allow that to happen, but instead the bill has been filibustered. Since we have not been able to round up 60 votes, it still is pending on the calendar.

Mr. LOTT. I know there has been a lot of interest by the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, about that. And I know he had problems with the Food and Drug Administration reform package, which, by the way, passed with a bipartisan vote, overwhelmingly, to cut off his filibuster. We voted, I think, twice to cut off the filibuster, and I understand it passed 98 to 2. It took us a month to get it done.

Mr. LOTT. That legislation to allow for voluntary contributions to campaigns so that workers are not required to pay dues as a condition of employment and then have those dues used for political candidates. Our amendment to fix that problem has been opposed by the union bosses. But yet the union members in the country, when they find out that their dues are being used for political purposes without their permission and without their knowledge--the ones I talk to--are irate. They say, `I want the opportunity to decide. I may want to give permission. I might want to check it off and say this is fine.' 
But in America shouldn't you have the ability to say that? Shouldn't you have the choice about how your own moneys are used as a condition of employment?

Mr. LOTT. I said in my speech a week or so ago that what really bothers me here is people saying, `My goodness, the laws which we wrote have been broken and, therefore, we should change them.' And what new laws do they propose? Laws that restrict free speech, in the McCain-Feingold proposal as it now stands. There are provisions in that with regard to advocacy, or advocating an issue, or advocating even a candidate. The Supreme Court just yesterday refused to review the lower court which said you can't limit that. 
Our paycheck protection amendment has been called a `poison pill.' Since when is it a `poison pill' when you have an amendment that says the American people should have a say about how their money is used? 
I think that is a very strange description of a very fundamental freedom and right I thought we still had in America.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for allowing us to have this discussion to go back and forth, but I want to point out to the Senator from North Dakota that the same rationale that he used also applies to the amendment that I had offered, the paycheck equity amendment; 52 Senators voted to invoke cloture so that we could go ahead and get a vote on that issue, as a matter of fact. So a majority of the Senate feels very strongly about that.

Mr. LOTT. It seems to me that sometimes maybe even the White House knows more about the rules of the Senate than some of us around here. 
As a matter of fact, when the White House spokesman, Mr. McCurry, was asked about how the vote would come in the Senate, he was asked, `Well, what if there is a filibuster?' 
Mr. McCurry said, `Well, then there would be a filibuster and there would be a cloture vote and then they would move on.' 
`But if they don't get 60 votes, that wouldn't be a vote.' 
`It would be a vote. That's the way the Senate rules work. What else?' 
`Does the vote of 60, is that considered a vote?' 
`Mr. McCurry. A vote to limit debate by invoking cloture is considered a vote under Senate rules, yes, the last time I checked.'

Mr. LOTT. In response to the Senator's question, as a matter of fact, I had been indicating all along that we would have full debate on this, we would have cloture votes. If cloture was achieved, then we would move on from there. If it was not, then we would go to other legislative business. 
As a matter of fact, I had to file the cloture motion last week, I guess it was last Friday, so we could have these cloture votes. As a matter of fact, as to morning business, I have lots of Senators who come in and say: We have very important issues we want to talk about. Can you set aside an hour or some time, even 2 hours, for morning business? 
Yesterday afternoon I came down to the floor. No Senators were waiting to speak on campaign finance reform. One Senator was waiting to speak on another issue, and so we went into morning business where Senators could speak up to 5 minutes on any other subject they wanted. 
So if I could go on at this point, does the Senator from Utah have a question he would like to ask? 
I yield for a question.

Mr. LOTT. That is absolutely true, a little point that seems to be ignored in many circles around here. As a matter of fact, I don't think any worker, whether he or she is a union member or nonunion member, should be compelled to have their dues or fees or assessments or in any way have to pay without their permission for 
politics or for a political candidate. I think it should be applicable to workers at all levels. And so I purposely included that. 
Some people say, `Well, you went beyond the Beck decision of the Supreme Court.' Yes, that is one of the key places where I did go beyond the Beck decision. I said this voluntarism should be applicable to all employees, all workers. So clearly that is a part of the amendment as it now stands.

Now, there are those who have been saying, well, you never know how the courts are going to rule until they look at the specific language or until they have in fact ruled. Right in the middle of the debate on McCain-Feingold, the Supreme Court spoke clearly, once again, and said you cannot limit people's speech. You cannot limit advocacy. You cannot limit groups that want to take a position on an issue. It was really interesting that ruling did come just yesterday of this week.

Mr. LOTT. As I said here last week, I think protecting citizens against forced political contributions should be the litmus test for the sincerity of this debate. Anyone unwilling to do that cannot be taken seriously as an advocate for reform. The fact is that the advocates of McCain-Feingold decided that legislating about campaign finance reform was less important than maintaining the system of compulsory campaign contributions by employees. And, so, rather than allow their own legislation, the present form of McCain-Feingold, to go forward, they brought down the roof of the whole temple on their own bill. At least Samson had reason to wreck the place. But I don't think that should be the case here. They are so determined to limit workers' ability to say where their dues or their fees are going to be used, and how, that they are willing to have the whole issue set aside. 
So we stand here, now, in the midst of this scuffle, but maybe the things we are finding out this very day about what happened in the 1996 campaign will have some future effect on what we decide to do. Belatedly, now, we see these videotapes brought forward, showing White House coffees. Even more belatedly, we understand, now, that there is an audio track of the President's meeting with John Huang on June 18, 1996. Where have these tapes been? Why haven't we known about this before? 
When it comes to campaign finance, the administration gives a whole new meaning to the term `technical problems.' Only a few days ago, while those White House videos were not available--or maybe people weren't aware of them--the Attorney General had been moving away from an independent counsel, not toward it. 
So, I once again have serious problems with trying to detect who is serious about legitimate campaign reform. What we have here is not a lack of restrictive campaign laws. In fact, I think that is a big part of the problem. We already have more laws, more restrictions, more regulations than the mind can contend with. I think we have been making mistakes over a period of years in the writing of campaign laws, where now it takes lawyers and CPA's and FEC experts to try to make sure that a candidate for office, of either party, is complying with the law. What we have is a lack of enforcement of the existing laws. So, the push has been to say, well, there may have been some problems, maybe some laws were broken, so what we need is new laws. I respectfully disagree with that. 
We are not going to go forward in a way that is unconstitutional. We are not going to go forward in a way that 
does not deal with this problem of the taking of dues from workers and using them for political purposes. 
I just came across an interesting quote attributed to former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes. This is actually a quote from Michael Louis, in the New York Times magazine. He says that the Deputy Chief of Staff will tell you, point blank, that President Clinton does not care about campaign finance reform, that he is using the issue for his own purposes, none of them altruistic. I think that sums up what is going on here and I think the American people should not allow themselves to be fooled by the debate that we have been hearing over the last week. 
I yield further to the Senator from Kentucky for a question.

Mr. LOTT. I would like to make another point. Perhaps the Senator might want to respond with a question on that, or comment. 
I didn't just dismiss the McCain-Feingold bill out of hand. I sat down with the Senator from Arizona and we went over what was in his bill. One of the problems with it is how he deals with this paycheck equity issue. His bill, as I understand it--maybe you can correct me--says, in effect, that after an election is over, if a member decides that he or she would like to get their dues back because the money was used in some way he or she didn't agree with, then they could get it back. 
Great. You have already had an election. Somebody has already been bombed with millions of dollars of money that is used against union members' permission, and then they can say, after the fact: If you are mad, you can get your money back. I don't understand the rationale for that thinking.

Mr. LOTT. First, I apologize to my colleagues for having to take this time right now before the cloture vote. However, the last couple of weeks have been somewhat hectic in the scheduling of floor action, with the end of the fiscal year, appropriations bills, fast track and ISTEA legislation brewing, all looming over the Senate schedule. And I wanted to address the Senate before these votes occur. 
Having said all that, I think all of my colleagues understand that one of the major roles of the majority leader is to set the Senate schedule during each day's session and during the week. Conversely, yesterday I watched with dismay as the minority leader filed a cloture motion to the pending campaign finance reform bill and further announced it would be his intention to continue that practice for the remainder of the week. Unfortunately, since I was not notified of the minority leader's intention, I could not be on the floor to respond. 
I will say now that my response was really one of dismay. All Senators know that filing a cloture motion does affect the Senate schedule. Needless to say, if cloture is invoked, if more than 60 Senators voted to limit the debate, then the Senate must remain on that clotured item until disposed of, regardless of what the majority leader might have had in mind for the schedule for floor consideration during those few days. 
So I say to my colleagues that I do regret the action, but I understand how these things happen. Sometimes we just can't get in touch with each other and there is miscommunication. But prior to that event, the Senate had basically conducted what I think has been an interesting debate, an informative debate, and I think a fair and constructive debate. As of yesterday afternoon at approximately 7:30 p.m., the Senate had been considering this campaign finance reform bill for parts or all of 6 days. The debate had exceeded 22 hours and has been basically evenly shared by both sides of the issue.

Mr. LOTT. So I understand, especially in this case, though, there is a wish by the minority to try to control the Senate schedule. However, there are other pressing items that are pending on the Senate's calendar that require Senate consideration. Some of those include, but are not limited to, fast-track legislation, remaining appropriations conference reports, ISTEA, Amtrak, adoption and foster-care legislation and, hopefully, perhaps others. 
In closing, I hope that all Senators understand that I will have to move to proceed to other legislative items after these two cloture votes if cloture is not invoked. I am announcing to my colleagues now, so that no Member will be surprised by my actions. For the record, I have held up my end of the bargain by making the campaign finance issue the pending business prior to the October recess. It was suggested we were going to delay it until the end of the week, or the end of the month, or the end of the session. I said at the time I had no intention of doing that. I thought we should have debate early and we should have every opportunity for Senators to express themselves. The Senate has been provided more than adequate debate on this bill, and I think that the important thing now is to go ahead and have these cloture votes. It appears to me that there is no consensus at this time on this issue. I will have more to say about this after the votes, and I hope that we can move on to other issues that need to be done before the close of the session. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 25, the pending campaign finance reform bill. As announced last week, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Senators who desire to speak with regard to the pending amendment or bill are encouraged to do so during today's session. We should be able to get 5 hours or so of debate in today if the Senators are willing to speak. 
I also remind my colleagues that a cloture vote is scheduled on the pending amendment regarding paycheck protection at 2:15 tomorrow. Also, under the provisions of rule XXII, Members have until the hour of 1:30 today in order to file timely amendments to S. 25. In addition to the cloture vote on the pending amendment, a cloture vote may occur on Tuesday on the underlying campaign finance reform bill. 
On Friday, a cloture motion was also filed on the Mack-Graham amendment on immigration to the D.C. appropriations bill. So it may be necessary to have a cloture vote during Tuesday's session on that also if an agreement is not reached. The Senators are working together. I have spoken with them and I am still hopeful that an agreement can be worked out. 
There are some other pending amendments on the D.C. appropriations bill, but we think maybe we will be able to reach a conclusion on those if we can get the immigration amendment by Senator Mack worked out. Therefore, it is possible that we could complete action on the D.C. appropriations bill tomorrow. 
This week, the Senate will also be considering other available appropriations conference reports. I talked to the chairman, Senator Stevens, on Friday. We think maybe there could be as many as three that would be ready in the next couple of days that we can bring up for consideration. We intend, also, to begin consideration of the ISTEA transportation infrastructure legislation, and we hope to be able to go to that on Wednesday or Thursday and spend the remainder of the week, except for interruptions for votes on the conference reports, on that. 
I believe we will be in session on Friday and will probably have votes up until around noon. But we will get more information on that as the day progresses. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, first and foremost, I want to apologize to the Senator from Oregon for not being able to respond last week to his request that we engage in a colloquy 
regarding his amendment which is pending to the D.C. appropriations bill. He was generous enough to be understanding that we had a number of other issues we were dealing with late last week, including the campaign finance reform issue, as well as a number of other issues that are very pressing at the end of the fiscal year with the appropriations bills. So I am glad he was willing to allow us to do the colloquy now instead of last week. I appreciate his attitude on that. 
I think also I should note that he has been talking with me over the past year and 4 months that I have been majority leader about his concerns in this area. I appreciate the fact that you noted, Senator, I have tried to be more open and more communicative with Senators about the procedures around here, trying to open up, trying to make them clearer and more understandable. As a matter of fact, I sent out a long letter clarifying to Members what is the process and what is the proper way to exercise a hold. I did feel that it had sort of evolved into a situation that was not fair and was not intended. 
I continue and want to continue working to have a fair system around here and one that everybody understands. I am sure the Senator also has learned to appreciate, as a Senator, the importance and the significance of the hold. It is a unique creature in the Senate and it is one that is used, I think reasonably and responsibly most all of the time, and can serve very positive purposes. 
For instance, I believe you noted in your comments that you used it earlier, or last month, with regard to the confirmation of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to get an issue addressed that was important to you. You didn't do it secretly. You were pretty open about your hold. It led to some accommodations that I believe will be helpful to the families there in Oregon and satisfied the Senator. 
We want to be careful how we change things around here. When you come over from the House to the Senate you really have a lot of questions about how this place operates: What are the rules? This seems like an archaic way to do things. Then you begin to understand it better, then you begin to think to yourself, no, I don't want the Senate to be the House. You begin to appreciate the traditions and the rules and the procedures around here. You have an opportunity to talk to Senator Byrd, as the Senator from Oregon has, or in my case, to Senator Stevens or Senator Helms. If you go to them and say, why is this important? Why has it been done that way? Then you begin to have a whole different view about the institution and the tradition and how things are done. 
So, I will continue to move in the direction, I think, that the Senator is seeking. I want a clearer understanding and I like doing things in the daylight, not in the dark of night. I don't like secrecy generally on anything, as a matter of fact. I like sunshine. 
But it is a problem for the majority leader and for the Senate to make this kind of change on the D.C. appropriations bill. I think to change the standing orders of the Senate in this way is something that is troublesome to some Senators. 
For instance, I have not had an opportunity yet to sit down and talk with the minority leader about this. I had thought that the better place to do this would be at the beginning of a session when we meet, between the two leaders of the two parties, and we have knowledge and input from both sides of the aisle and that you do it at the beginning of a Congress when you have the 
organization of the Senate. I think that path would have been much preferable or is preferable to this approach. 
I assume that the minority leader has some reservations of the use of any Senator to effect the so-called standing orders with an amendment on an appropriations bill. 
So I say to my colleague, then, that I understand what he is trying to do and I am not unsympathetic to that, but I do have problems with doing it in this way on an appropriations bill. 
I will continue to listen to all Senators. I will sit down. This has caused me to find a time--and I am not complaining--to sit down and make sure that senior Senators understand what we might be thinking of doing. Are there problems with it? I don't know that there will be. I really think that any Senator who feels strongly enough about an issue to put a hold on it ought to be prepared to come to the floor and explain it. I have indicated to Senators on both sides of the aisle, sometimes when holds have been placed and have not been removed in a reasonable period of time that they better be prepared to come to the floor and object and debate because I was prepared to call up the issue. 
However, I also feel a real appreciation for the way the Senate is considerate of every single Senator--if she or he has a problem, I like to give them time to work through it, whether they are Republican or Democrat, regardless of philosophy, religion, or anything else. Sometimes there may be a good reason why they would not want, in a specified period of time, 2 days, for instance, to explain all of what is going on. 
I guess that is a long explanation to the Senator's comments and questions, but I understand what he is trying to do. I hope we can find a way to continue to work on it and come to a conclusion that would benefit the Senate as a whole.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will begin 60 minutes of debate on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations conference report. Senators can, therefore, expect rollcall votes Wednesday morning at approximately 11 a.m. or earlier if debate time is yielded back, and it could be yielded back, so the vote could be shortly before 11 o'clock. Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the DC appropriations bill. It is the intention of the majority leader to finish action on the final appropriations measure. In observance of Rosh Hashanah, no recall call votes will occur after 1 p.m. tomorrow. Therefore, all Senators' cooperation will be appreciated in allowing the Senate to conclude action on the pending bill. I should note that we will continue to try to get an agreement to clear conference reports, and we probably will be in session until about 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, but there will be no recorded votes after 1 o'clock.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 25, the pending campaign finance reform bill. 
As a reminder to all Senators, no votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. The next vote will occur 11 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30, on the motion to invoke cloture on the Coats amendment regarding scholarships. That amendment is to the District of Columbia appropriations bill, which is the last appropriations bill that we need to pass through the Senate for this fiscal year. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to complete action on the D.C. appropriations bill on Tuesday, although there are still some amendments that are being negotiated that could require more time, maybe even another cloture vote. I hope it will be worked out, though. Also during Tuesday's session of the Senate, the Senate will consider the continuing resolution. As Members are aware, we have been able to make good progress on the appropriations bills, so it is hoped that the continuing resolution and the remaining appropriations conference reports can be acted upon in a timely manner. We don't know of any problem with the continuing resolution. We think and we hope that it will be a clean CR, with a limited amount of time for debate, although we have not worked out those details yet. I will discuss it with the minority leader and we will advise the Members as to how much time would be required there. 
With those things in mind, Members can anticipate votes throughout the day on Tuesday. With regard to the pending campaign finance reform bill, I encourage all Members to come to the floor and participate in this important debate. We will have time throughout this week, even though we will, of course, be affected, regarding how much time we can use toward the end of the week on this debate, by the Jewish religious holiday. We still need to work with those that would be needing leave to go to their respective States, as to how we will deal with that on Thursday and Friday. We will work that out. 
As I announced last week, there will be no votes after 1 p.m. on Wednesday in observance of the Jewish holiday. However, the Senate will remain in session as is necessary in order for Members to fully debate S. 25. Still, we will need to talk about exactly how we will do that to make sure we are not inconveniencing any Senator that would need to be away for the Jewish holiday who would also like to be involved in that debate. We will work that through as the week goes on. 
Mr. President, I believe now we are ready for the reporting of S. 25 by the clerk and the modification by Senator McCain.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield so that I may make a comment on that, I hope, first, that we will have some time on Tuesday of this week, before or after, during some of the votes that may be occurring on the continuing resolution, as well as the appropriations conference reports. I hope that most of those won't take a lot of time. We will have some time for debate tomorrow. But until we see exactly what will be available and how much time is needed on the CR, we won't know for sure. But we will find that out, hopefully, today and we will confer with the leadership on both sides of the aisle, as well as the Senators interested in this bill. 
I had hoped that we could also have some debate on Wednesday afternoon, even though we would not have any votes after 1 o'clock. But we would still have debate up until about 4 o'clock, and then Thursday is open. We don't want to, in any way, infringe on the religious holiday. So we will need to talk that through. We could have some debate on Thursday and, of course, we can, and I assume will, have some debate Friday. We want to talk that through to make sure everybody is comfortable with that. 
My hope is that we could continue debate on Monday the 6th and begin having votes on Tuesday, and the possibility also on Wednesday. But, again, we need to go and get started with debate and see how that is going to stack up, and we will talk about that. It is a little bit broken up because of the religious holiday, but we want to have full time for debate, and we will start votes after that. That was my thinking.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to explain what just transpired. 
Mr. President, Senate procedure can be sometimes confusing. So let me take a moment to go over what are the amendments that were offered and what is pending. 
Under the unanimous-consent agreement reached last week, Senator McCain modified his original McCain-Feingold bill. I was then recognized to offer an amendment. 
The amendment I offered--the Paycheck Protection Act--will not wipe out the underlying McCain bill, if it is adopted. On the contrary, if adopted, this amendment would become part of the bill. 
The other amendments I just offered were part of the process which is informally known as `filling up the amendment tree.' This is a fairly standard procedure to ensure opponents of an amendment cannot gut it by offering yet another amendment.

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-23-19970929</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, also, I note that this is done two or three times a year and certainly is not unprecedented. 
I hope no one will characterize this amendment as a `poison pill' for campaign finance reform. It is so fundamental to fairness in the campaign process. Shouldn't workers in America be able to have some say about how their fees, assessments, or dues are used in political campaigns? I think the answer truly should be yes. 
Some of our colleagues may not want to expose, much less vote on, one of the worst campaign abuses that exists--compulsory business or union dues--but that is no reason for them to suddenly change their position on campaign finance reform as a whole. 
Most Americans would be shocked to learn that some workers in our Nation are forced to contribute to a candidate or campaign they don't support or do not know anything about. They have no way of directing where those funds go. 
Because of that abuse, this amendment, the Paycheck Protection Act, is an essential element to genuine campaign reform. It requires that all political contributions be voluntary. 
The McCain-Feingold bill places restrictions on political parties, bans soft money, and curbs the activities of grassroots organizations. But it contains a giant loophole: It allows corporations and unions to confiscate money, for political purposes, from their employees' and members' paychecks without getting their permission. This loophole must be closed. 
Senator McCain himself stated that he `personally supports much stronger [Beck] language.' He said he `believes that no individual--a union member or not--should be required to contribute to political activities.' This was on a floor statement of September 26, 1997. 
The McCain-Feingold bill limits what people can voluntary contribute for political purposes, but it does not protect people from being forced to contribute involuntarily to political campaigns. 
We must require unions and corporations to get a worker's permission before taking money out of his or her paycheck for political purposes. 
As I have said before, my own father was a union member. This amendment is not targeted at unions. It is, as a matter of fact, directed at affecting both unions and corporations as well. 
No worker--whether union or corporate business, large or small--should be forced to contribute against his or her will, as a condition of their employment. 
Many workers don't want to pay and be involved in campaigns or in politics, and many of those don't want to be told what they have to do and don't want to have their funds taken from them without their permission. 
A recent poll of union members revealed that 78 percent did not know they had the right to stop paying for politics. 
A 1996 poll of union members found that 62 percent opposed the AFL-CIO's expenditure of over $35 million--and probably much more--of their money in a campaign to control Congress. 
No worker should be forced to pay for politics that they do not support. As such, I hope Senators will support my amendment. 
There will be plenty of time to debate this amendment and other amendments, and then we will design a process to have some votes to see where the Senate stands on this and other issues. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today the Senate begins to formally debate what is probably the most discussed and least understood issue before the Nation, campaign finance reform. I have made clear, for the last several months, actually, that the Senate would, in due time, after finishing its work on the budget and the 13 appropriations bills, move to this matter. I indicated all along that I knew this issue would come up, that it should come up, and it should be debated. And, therefore, I have kept that commitment and we will begin our debate. We will have a full debate, and we will have some votes. Maybe not the votes that everybody would like to have, but critical, key votes on assessing where the Senate is. 
Are we near a consensus yet? Are we prepared to stop trying to claim an advantage here or an advantage there and see if we can come together in a consensus in this area? I have my doubts that we have reached that point yet. But we begin the debate, I hope, in a respectful and thoughtful way. I trust no Member of this body doubted my intention to do what from the very beginning I said we would do, in terms of calling this legislation up. 
We are taking up this issue now under a unanimous-consent agreement identical to the one I propounded a few days go and to which the minority leader did not at that time agree. So at the outset of this debate, I want to make this clear. President Clinton's standing on this subject of campaign finance reform is a case study of the problem, not an exemplar of the solution. Indeed, it would take the Senate, and the House too, staying in marathon session all the way through Christmas, just to trace the appalling campaign finance practices that were so large a part of President Clinton's reelection effort. 
Just today I understand from WTOP radio news this morning, the President is in Houston after last night calling, trying to get Senators ginned up to come in here and speak on this subject. But what is he going to be doing in Houston? I have his whole schedule, off the wire service, as well as the remarks made this morning on WTOP. I will put it in the Record.

Mr. LOTT. Among other things he will be doing in Houston today is attending a fundraiser tonight, where it is estimated they will raise $600,000, some of which if not much of which is exactly the kind of money that he has said, `Oh, we ought to stop.' What is he saying here, `Oh, please stop me before I do it again?' 
So, I think we need to start off making it clear what is going on here. A lot of what is going on is an effort to change the subject. `Oh, gee whiz, the Governmental Affairs Committee has come up with some things that are a real problem. Gee, why won't the Attorney General appoint independent counsel? We have to have another subject on the griddle here.' But that's OK. That's fine. Finally we will, maybe, shed a little light on what is going on here. 
It seems that much of what will need to be done with regard to violation of the laws--before you start changing laws to try to see if you can fix problems, wouldn't it help if the laws already on the books were obeyed and enforced? Wouldn't it be better if we found out how people violated the laws last year? Who did it? What do we need to tighten it up with regard to illegal foreign contributions, direct and indirect? 
But it seems that much of the task of what really went on will be left to others, unless the Attorney General can discover still more ingenious reasons for delaying what increasingly seems inevitable, the appointment of independent counsel. 
For us here, we will do what we are going to do anyway, before Mr. Clinton's unnecessary and irrelevant letter. We will at least have the opportunity to lay before the American people the pros and cons of various proposals for campaign finance reform. 
In the process, I think it will become clear that in campaign law, as tax law, there is no bad idea that cannot be made presentable by taking on the label of `reform.' This is our chance to see more closely some of the ideas that have been presented and whether or not they will really work--or not; whether they will be fair; and whether they will encourage discourse and expression of views and opportunities for candidates to go directly to the people instead of being filtered by the news media. 
Let me offer this comparison. On the issue of campaign reform we have been like a customer in a used-car lot. The salesmen have been talking about this little beauty's wire wheels and leather upholstery, and it has all sounded pretty good. But now we get to look under the hood and find out why this deal looks too good to be true and, in fact, probably is. 
Before we launch into the details, though, I want to pay tribute to those of our colleagues who have worked on this issue at great length and in good faith. Some of them I agree with and with others I disagree. And, hopefully, we will disagree without being disagreeable. But all those who have pursued this issue out of personal conviction, rather than political expediency, merit our commendation. My disagreements on this matter with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold are well known--and may well become more emphatic in the course of this debate. But I recognize the sincerity of their views and I thank them for their cooperation that has enabled us to take up other legislation without being intercepted or interrupted or heckled. They have been responsible. They deserve the right to talk about their bill and we deserve the right to point out where the problems are. And I think we have set up a way to consider this legislation in an orderly manner. 
Senator Mitch McConnell more than anyone else has argued against their position. Entirely apart from the part that I agree with him, he stands today as an example of political courage, someone who is willing to challenge the prevailing wisdom because it is incorrect and because it would violate or restrict the fundamental rights of Americans. 
Legislation is never considered in a vacuum and this legislation is no exception to that rule. The Senate will be 
debating campaign finance reform against a background of lurid exposes about the campaign of 1996. All summer long the Nation has heard news about people ignoring the law, fleeing the country to avoid the law, explaining away the law, refusing to testify about their actions and the law. From all that, some may conclude that we need more laws. Others may wonder why we don't enforce the laws we already have concerning campaign finance, and let the personal chips fall where they may. 
The fact is, this country already has so many campaign laws and campaign regulations that to avoid breaking the law most congressional campaigns have to hire a battery of legal experts just to avoid fines and censure by the Federal Election Commission. No longer do you sit down, like I did in 1972, and fill out my campaign finance reports, you know, in longhand, and try to make sure it adds up, send it in and struggled to get it in on time. Nah. Now you have to have legal advice, you have to have a CPA, you have to have somebody familiar with the FEC laws. It becomes one of the burdens of elections. Why don't we, instead, go with freedom, open it up, have full disclosure and let everybody participate to the maximum they wish. 
But, no, no, no, no; we keep tightening down, tightening down, tightening down. Do you know what really is involved here? There are a lot of people who don't want the people involved. They want the news media to dictate, through their editorial columns and their editorials in their news articles, who will be elected. 
Boy, I know how that works. I have had to deal with that in my State. If I hadn't been able to get the money to get my message across, how could a conservative Republican be elected in the State of Mississippi, where the courthouses were all owned and operated by Democrats almost entirely, so I had the so-called court house gang fighting me and the biggest newspaper in the State bashing me regularly in its editorials and in its news stories in the form of editorials. You know, I took basic 101 journalism in high school and I know the difference between a news story and an editorial. But my friends in the print media quite often get that a little confused. As well as the largest television station in the State, which regularly took my head off any way they could. 
So, how did I win? Because I had the opportunity to take my case to the people, raise the money to get my message across over the head of the opposition, and the people gave me the opportunity to serve in this body. 
The fact is, today's political campaigns are forced to operate within a web of campaign law first devised almost a quarter century ago. No matter how unworkable some of them are, how out of date some of them are, instead of pulling back and clearing away, the temptation is always to add on. 
That is what happened with the IRS. Can you believe it? The U.S. Senate Finance Committee, with jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Service, this week had its first ever oversight hearing on the violations, abuses, intimidations, and threats from the IRS. We are partly to blame. We have been hearing about these problems for years. What did we do about it? More laws. We kept adding on. We kept putting on more pressures. Unfortunately, too often we added more taxes. 
The same is true here. The temptation is to restrict and limit free speech. Add on another restriction, one on top of another, with regard to campaign spending or the ability to raise money. Add on another reporting requirement. Add on another financial incentive, often from the taxpayer's purse, for campaigns to behave or advertise in a certain way. 
Remember now some of the things that have been advocated along the way, I believe, in the campaign finance reform bill proposed originally by Senators McCain and Feingold--a form of public financing of campaigns. People don't support that. Great; we are going to have the U.S. Treasury dollars go to candidates with a system of incentives and punishments and voluntary do this, don't do that; oh, by the way we will give you free broadcasting. The American people know there ain't nothing free. Somebody is going to pay. But that is kind of what the push has been. 
I hope the debate we are starting today will break us out of that regulatory rut. We now have a chance to go back to square one and to reconsider the fundamental principles of what all along has been taken for granted. 
For example, with today's computer technology--so rapid and so revealing beyond the imagination of the lawmakers of 1974 when the present law was enacted--perhaps the public good would best be served, not by restricting donations to campaigns, but by promoting them, with full disclosure--full, total, and immediate disclosure. 
I wonder what would happen if every donation to a Federal campaign had to be logged onto the Internet as it was received by the campaign. Anyone interested in the integrity of that campaign, the identity of its donors, the possibility of undue influence or corruption, would be able to track the campaign's revenues dollar by dollar as they come in. Maybe we could agree on that. 
Then let interested Americans donate as they will, for this one overriding reason: Because spending money to advance your own political views is as much a part of the right of free speech as running a free press. 
I think the whole problem can be summed up in this one example. Suppose a distinguished surgeon feels strongly about a particular issue, whether it is Government control of health care or environmental policy or our entanglement in Bosnia. Her work is her life. She is saving lives every day. She has no time to devote to politics. Instead, she donates to candidates who agree with her views. 
But her college-age son, on the other hand, has plenty of time, and he disagrees with his doctor-mother on just about everything, which wouldn't be unusual for a young college student to disagree with his or her parents. So he cuts back on his classes and volunteers 40 hours a week for the candidates who oppose her candidates. In the process, he saves those candidates a considerable amount of money doing for free what they otherwise would have to pay for. 
Now, which of those two is a good citizen: 
The wealthy physician who writes checks to campaigns, or the pugnacious young man who gives them his time and labor? 
My answer is both of them. Our campaign laws ought to encourage both their public spirit and their political involvement. 
But our laws don't do that. They don't advert at all to the student volunteer or, for that matter, to the Hollywood personality whose donated performance brings in, say, $1 million for a Presidential campaign. For some reason, campaign contribution limits seem to stop right outside the gated driveways of some of the richest and most influential personages of the land. 
But those laws do apply to the doctor and to everyone else who sits down to write a check, to put their money where their views are. I have made no secret of the fact that we need more such people, not fewer, and that our present campaign laws should be reformed so that they don't discourage citizen involvement of any sort. 
That is especially important with regard to issue advocacy by the whole range of public policy organizations, left or right, liberal to conservative. The inclination by Government to regulate speech--or expenditures that are the equivalent of speech--is hard to contain. 
It starts with the understandable wish to discourage slander and libel in campaigns. It proceeds to various schemes to review and control the content of campaign ads, and it ends up in attempts to restrict the essential right of private citizens to expose the records of candidates and reveal where they stand on crucial issues of the day. 
Do I like this? When I am the brunt of some of that, no, I don't like it, and we can probably get bipartisan agreement that some of the negative aspects of it are not good. We don't like it. But how do we tell a private citizen that he or she can't pick a billboard and say, Congressman X or Senator X voted wrong on an issue? I think we need to think long and hard about that. 
I hasten to add that, in its current form, the legislation before us does not do all of those things. I have been speaking more generally about various proposals that have won considerable credence in the media which, come to think of it, is the very last place those proposals should be tolerated. After all, once we lower the bar between Government and free expression of political ideas, we imperil that expression for everyone. 
I am not suggesting that every aspect of campaign financing is so clear or so simple that all well-meaning persons will inevitably come to the same conclusion about it. They won't. But there is one campaign finance issue about which that is the case, about which all persons of good will should, indeed, reach the same conclusion. 
That is the principle that no person should be compelled to financially support a political campaign, especially a campaign with which he or she does not agree. Surely we can agree on that. 
Our instinctive reaction is to say, `Oh, that's out of the question; you can't be compelled to contribute to a candidate or campaign you don't agree with or against your will; it couldn't happen in America.' 
Well, it does. It happens all the time, and it is happening now. I am referring to the great scandal in American politics, what is to my mind the worst campaign abuse of them all: The forceful collection and expenditure of business fees or union dues for political purposes. This is not something that is aimed at businesses or at unions because I am unduly critical of them. We want more business. We want jobs. We want them to be involved in the political process. I am the son of a shipyard worker, a pipefitter, who was a union steward for a while. 
I think we should encourage union members to be involved and active in politics. My own father was and so were my grandfathers on both sides of the family. So I have made the point over the years to go into plants and mills and stand at the gates and go into union halls--yes, union halls. I have had some interesting times there, because I quite often ask union members, `Do you agree 
with these things?' and run down the list. They don't agree with them; they agree with me. It is the union ratings of who is voting right or wrong. The local union members in my hometown more often agree with me than they do with the union bosses in Washington. 
Sometimes, by the way, I think businesses do this, too, that somehow you have to contribute fees, or some process is used to get your money and put it in campaigns. The individual should have the final say and total control over how that happens. They should either have to write out the check for a specific purpose or give specific approval before those dues or those fees could be used. 
I have heard complaints from union members about how disgruntled they are about the way their dues are mishandled by the national union officers. I have heard their anger and frustration knowing their unions are financially supporting a candidate whom they oppose. When they ask me why this is permitted, how am I supposed to answer? `Well, the law just allows that.' 
The courts are saying that shouldn't happen, but, buddy, you are going to hear a lot of screaming and hollering on the floor of this body about, `Oh, we can't have that opportunity for members or employees of a business or a union to direct where their contributions go, where their dues go.' I think that is going to be pretty hard to defend for the average blue collar working man and woman wherever they are. 
Should I tell them those who wrote our earlier campaign laws deliberately slanted those laws to hurt certain interests and advance others? Should I tell them that much of what passes for campaign finance reform today would only worsen those deliberate inequities? 
As far as I am concerned, righting that wrong is the price of admission to campaign finance reform. If a Senator is willing to free employees and union members from that compulsory contribution of their hard-earned wages to political campaigns, then I can accept that Senator as a legitimate participant in the campaign reform debate, whether or not I agree with his or her views on the rest of the subjects. At least we know they want fairness, an opportunity for people to have some say where their dues, their fees, will go. 
But anyone who is not willing to take that essential first step to protect the earnings and consciences of employees and union members against the political diversion of their fees or expenses or union dues, that person, in my mind, has no standing in the debate we are beginning today. 
Madam President, I never deceive myself into thinking the American people follow every word that is spoken on the floor of the Senate. I hope not. They usually are too busy making America better by pursuing their own individual dreams. But this debate, I think, will catch and hold their attention for a while, and I think they are going to be interested in what they hear. 
They may not have been able to read both sides in some of the news media, but hopefully they are about to hear it from me and from others and from the media that will tell both sides of the story and tell what the options are. At the end of what I think we are going to see this debate deliver will be a sea change in opinion as the public rethinks the role of candidates, of donors, of volunteers, of issue advocacy groups, and of Congress itself, whose track record on legislating on this issue has not been stellar. 
In the past, the Supreme Court has had to overturn patently unconstitutional campaign reform legislation. Let us do nothing now to force a repetition of that rebuke. As a Member of the House and Senate over the years, I have heard, `We can't worry about that; we don't know what they will do. Let's just do what we want to do and then we will see.' I don't think that is very responsible. You can always argue what is constitutional and not constitutional, but free speech is pretty easy to discern, and it ought to be hard to limit. 
In the very recent past, there were 38 Members of the Senate who were willing, on the record, to amend the Constitution to give 
a Federal agency, the Federal Election Commission, the power to limit the first amendment rights of individual Americans. That, I trust, is an idea whose time has come and gone and will never come again. 
In closing, Madam President, I would like to recall a line from what was probably the first drama written and performed in America. It was called `The Candidate, or the Humours of a Virginia Election.' In it, a seasoned older candidate advises a younger one that when he makes promises he knows he cannot deliver, he should say, `upon my honor,' otherwise they won't believe you. 
Well, thus far, in the national debate about campaign finance reform, much has been said `upon my honor.' Now comes the real test of ideas, so the American people can decide for themselves whom to believe and whom to trust about this matter that goes to the heart of their personal rights and their political liberty. 
I yield the floor, Madam President.  
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. I apologize for the delay in starting the votes that we have scheduled, but we were having some very important discussions that will affect the schedule for the next several days that I wanted to discuss with the minority leader and with the interested Senators. 
For the information of all Senators, these next two votes will be the last votes for the week. The next vote will occur at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30, on a motion to invoke cloture on the Coats amendment to the D.C. appropriations bill regarding scholarships. 
Following these votes, I encourage the managers to remain on the floor for any additional amendments Members may want to offer to the pending D.C. appropriations bill. I believe perhaps there is a Senator that is waiting that will have an amendment that he could offer tonight, and have debated, if it is not worked out in the interim. 
On Friday, tomorrow, beginning at 10 o'clock a.m., the Senate will begin consideration of the campaign finance reform legislation. I expect a full day of debate on that issue. However, no votes will occur during Friday's session of the Senate. 
On Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of the campaign finance reform bill. Again, however, no votes will occur at that time. 
On Tuesday, September 30, I expect that following the 11 a.m. cloture vote the Senate might be in a position to complete action on the last remaining appropriation bill, the D.C. appropriations bill. It will depend on what happens, of course, with the vote on the Coats amendment, and there are a couple of other key amendments that are still pending. Also, since Tuesday is the end of fiscal year, the Senate will consider the continuing resolution. We believe we have a continuing resolution agreed to that will be clean, and with a date that I discussed with the Democratic leader and with our leadership on the other side of the Capitol. Therefore, votes will occur throughout the day on Tuesday, and of course the pending business at that time will still be campaign finance reform. 
Wednesday, October 1, is the start of the Jewish holiday. Therefore, votes will not occur past 1 p.m. However, the Senate will be considering the campaign finance reform bill for debate as long as Members want to remain into the evening. On Thursday, October 2, there will be no rollcall votes in observance of the Jewish holiday. 
I expect the Senate to resume consideration of the campaign finance reform bill on Friday, October 3. However, no votes will occur. Again, with regard to the 3d, we want to talk with all the interested Senators to see whether we want to have debate or not. Then we will continue on campaign finance reform the next week but we would like to reserve further commitments on time or identification of when votes might occur until we 
have had time to get started with the debate and see how things go. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation and remind Senators following these two back-to-back votes there will be no further votes today, and the next vote will occur 11 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30.

Mr. LOTT. I might say, Mr. President, continuing with my leader time, I met with the committee leaders and discussed legislation on both sides of the aisle--for instance, the ISTEA, or the highway infrastructure bill--as to when they would be ready with that legislation to go to the floor and how much time that might take. We also have been looking at fast-track trade legislation, when that might be available. 
It was obvious to me that we had a window here in the next few days that we could take up the debate on campaign finance reform, but as we got on into October we would need to have time for the highway bill and the fast-track legislation. 
I do think it is important that we continue our effort to get a 6-year transportation bill that is within the budget. I have been discussing this with the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. They agree. So we intend to go forward somewhere around the 7th or 8th on the highway infrastructure bill. 
I just wanted to give that explanation as to why this decision was made.

Mr. LOTT. In light of the earlier consent with respect to debate time on the FDA bill--I believe Senator Jeffords got the unanimous-consent request agreed to a few moments ago--there will be no further votes this evening. The Senate will begin, now, up to 4 hours of debate on the FDA bill. The concluding 4 hours of debate will begin at 12 noon on Wednesday. Therefore, final passage will occur at approximately 3:45 on Wednesday, of the Food and Drug Administration reform bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is the same unanimous-consent request I offered last Friday. I thought it was a fair procedure within the bounds of the 105th Congress' 1st session to take up consideration of campaign finance reform. I still think it is a fair procedure. I indicated last Friday it was never my intent to try to have this come up on the last day or the last week. I do not think that would be in anybody's interest. And I did not intend to do that. I said at the time I did not intend to do that. 
So I am glad we have this worked out. We will work now to try to determine a time to bring up consideration and debate of this issue in a way that will allow us to have time to discuss it freely but also give us time to look at other issues that we hope to have completed before the end of the session. 
With regard to the President's letter, I have not had an opportunity to read the letter yet. I am always glad to have a communication from the President. I do not feel threatened or intimidated by the letter because we still have an awful lot of work to do together on appropriations bills. I am still hopeful that we can have the ISTEA follow-on transportation infrastructure bill passed. And we hope to even consider the fast-track legislation. 
So the President has a lot of issues that he would like for us to work with him on. We would be glad to do that. And we intend to do that. However, we do not intend to be threatened or intimidated on this or any other issue.

Mr. LOTT. Well, we need to look at the conference reports on appropriations bills. We need to look at the continuing resolution, if one is needed. I presume it will be. We need to look at what progress is being made with regard to the ISTEA or the highway transportation bill. And we need to look at when we will need to schedule fast track. And we will need to consider when we are going to have an opportunity to take up serious product liability. 
So there are several issues that we feel like, I think on both sides of the aisle, we must do this year, and one way or another--or should do--and we will look at all of that. It is not my intent to drag this out to the end of the session because I would like for us to be--if I had my way, I guess the last thing we would do would be probably the fast-track legislation in one form or another and to deal with it up or down. That would be my thinking what we would do last, not because I am pushing it off to the end but because we have to have some hearings, it has to be marked up, go to Finance and I think Banking and two or three other Committees. That is what looks like will probably come up toward the end of October or early November. 
So it is my thinking that we would want to do it before then. I will try to, you know, make sure everybody has an input here. We have Senators on both sides that have interest. We have chairmen that have interest. It is not my desire to have this come up in the congestion at the end. 
I want to find a window. I can see a possibility of one before long where we can take this up and consider it for a period of time that everybody might be comfortable with.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am pleased to welcome a delegation from the European Parliament to the U.S. Senate. The parliamentarians are in the United States for the 47th interparliamentary meeting. 
Europe continues to move forward with economic integration and the European Parliament's role is increasingly important. As the European Union--like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--expands, the role of the European Parliament will become even more important. 
The United States and the European Union have the world's largest commercial relationship, with trade and investment approaching $1 trillion. 
I believe increased interaction between our legislature and the European Parliament will serve the interests of both sides. I would like to add that I met with the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Mr. Vernon Weaver, earlier this summer and was impressed with the job he is doing to protect American interests in Brussels and across Europe. 
I urge my colleagues to greet this delegation, led by Mr. Alan Donnelly of the United Kingdom.

Mr. LOTT. In response to the question under the Senator's reservation to the unanimous consent, this agreement says that it would be done prior to the close of the 1st session of the 105th Congress. Certainly, there would be notification of what date that might be. I think, you know, we would have to talk to a lot of people on both sides of the aisle, including Senator McCain, among others, who could not be here at this hour because he has had a commitment and had to leave by airplane. It depends on a lot of other circumstances that we would have to take into consideration. We might want to do it early. We might want to do it later. But it would not be my intent to do it right at the end of the session. But I don't have a date in mind. We will have to look at what is happening with other bills all the way from FDA to appropriations conference reports. 
Next week, for instance, the focus has to be on getting the appropriations conference reports agreed to. It would depend on what is happening with other major legislation like the transportation bill, the administration's proposal with regard to fast track--all of these will be taken into consideration. We want to do it in a time when it can be fully debated. I think it is important that we have a chance to look at different proposals and see if a consensus can be reached, see if there is some way that we can deal with the way the laws were broken in 1996 but see if it can be done without another big Government gag of free speech. 
So, we fully intend to have notification of the date and an adequate discussion on all sides of the issue.

Mr. LOTT. As we have discussed in the past, at the beginning of the year we sort of laid out a schedule for the whole year of the times that we would be in and out in each month. At the beginning of the year we had talked in terms of having a week in October off for the Jewish religious holidays as well as the Columbus Day period, and that we would--you know, our target day to adjourn was the 14th. 
There has been some consideration of it being earlier than that. Senator Daschle and I, as you recall, we did discuss the possibility of November 7. So I don't think we can at this point fix a specific date. I think more important is to get the work done that we must get done before we leave. But I think we are sort of shooting now for the 7th of November. But at the beginning of the year we said we would be out no later than the 14th.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not intend to have this issue come up the last day or the last week of the session, because I think we will have other issues that we would have to deal with or want to deal with and I assume the administration wants to deal with at that point. I presume that we would probably want to look for a date earlier in the month of October, maybe even the end of October. 
But I think this consent request is an honest one and a fair one for now. I would like to leave it the way it is so that we will have a full panoply of options to make sure we have it brought up at the right time and we can have a full debate and look at all the other things that we need to consider. 
So I object at this time to changing that date. Let's leave it for the end of the session. I do not intend to bring it up the last day. I don't want to do that. I don't want to go out and be cramped on this issue. I would like to have a free discussion much earlier, but I would like to have a chance to talk to Members who have worked it on both sides--Senator McCain, Senator McConnell, Senator Feingold, the leadership on both sides, the committees that are involved--and come to an understanding and agreement that everybody is comfortable with.

Mr. LOTT. Let me respond to the question, if I can, and give a full response. We were working on the language of the UC. I believe a copy was given to Senator McCain, perhaps a copy to Senator Feingold. I understand Senator Daschle saw it. It is not a complicated UC. Basically, all it says is we are going to bring this up and how it will be brought up and it will be done before the end of the session. 
As a matter of fact, Senator Daschle and I sat right there yesterday, and we talked about the parameters of this agreement, and I had the impression he knew full well what was in it. 
The only difference in it now to what happened yesterday was to clarify that we are not going to have this popping up all the time while we have an agreement to get it brought up at a specific time. 
So that is why it was done the way it was. He was notified I was going to make a unanimous-consent request. We don't have, usually, necessarily hours or days of running discussions. This was very simple and clear. I thought everybody would be delighted with this. Senator McCain is comfortable with it. I had the impression Senator Feingold is comfortable with it. Senator McConnell is here ready to comment on it. He is comfortable with it. 
If this is a sneak attack, there hasn't been such a well-covered sneak attack since Pearl Harbor. So everybody knew what was going on. I think it is a fair agreement. If we want to get this issue up in a way everybody understands and deal with some of the changes that we can make legitimately in campaign finances, including allowing employees and union members to have some say in how their dues and their fees are spent in campaigns, then we can do that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we have made a very fair unanimous-consent offer here that we would bring this issue up before the end of this session of Congress, that we would bring up McCain-Feingold and then the latest iteration of that, which I believe is the McCain bill, and that I would have the opportunity, as majority leader, which I have anyway, to offer an amendment or a substitute for that. A very clear, understandable, fair process. 
Now, if the Senator is surprised, I thought he had been talking to his own Senator Feingold. I have in my hand a press release from yesterday that went out from Senator Feingold's office announcing that Senators McCain, Feingold, and Lott, much to my surprise, `will discuss the McCain-Feingold campaign finance proposal in coordinated statements on the Senate floor this afternoon.' That was yesterday. `Attached is an outline of the new proposal.' 
I thought if it had gone that far--which I thought was certainly jumping the gun because we were trying to make sure everybody had an opportunity to know how this unanimous-consent agreement was being constructed and what was in it, and Senator Feingold, to his credit, apologized that it was done in the way it was. I said, no problem. I understand how sometimes we get a little carried away, maybe staff got a little exuberant and released it before it was completed. 
For instance, I felt like I ought to at least talk to Senator McConnell and make sure he was aware of what we were developing here. I thought this was a very good proposal. This is a fair way to get the issue up, have a full discussion, for us to offer proposals that would correct some of the problems and abuses of union members, abuse of their dues, to deal with the illegal foreign contributions that we have seen over the past year in 1996, to deal with the other abuses of the law, tighten up the law and make it clear, or clearer if we need to, about the President and Vice President should not do certain things while on Federal property. Whatever. 
It seemed like a fair proposal to me. And I was ready to go with that. And my intent is to try to get an agreement where we could do this some time early in October. But if the Senator feels constrained to object, that is certainly his right. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am not able at this time to propound a unanimous-consent request, but I have been talking to the manager of the bill and to the Democratic leader about this issue, and the next issue we hope to consider, or plan to consider, is the Food and Drug Administration reform package. It is absolutely essential that we complete the Interior appropriations bill, and we must do that this week, and we will do that. If we have to stay late tonight and have votes tomorrow, up until 12 o'clock, or whatever it takes to finish it, we will do it. 
I believe we are close to where we will be able to see exactly what is needed. Perhaps we can get the amendments worked out. The managers are going to be working on that. We are not ready to do that right now. We will work in the next few minutes, and we will let the Members know what the prospects are. We will be working on a UC that will allow us to complete the bill and get to final passage either tonight or first thing in the morning. 
We will be prepared to do something on that within, I hope, a short period of time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the filing of the cloture motion on the FDA bill tonight, Senator Kennedy be recognized for debate only for up to 1 hour, and the pending Harkin amendment be temporarily laid aside until Tuesday, September 23. 
I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Friday, all time from adjournment on Thursday and reconvening on Friday count against the 30-hour cap postcloture. 
I further ask that the Durbin amendments Nos. 1139 and 1140 be in order on Friday and limited to 30 minutes each, equally divided, and the votes occur in a stacked sequence at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, September 23, with 2 minutes for debate between each vote. 
Further, I ask unanimous consent that the time between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. on Friday be under the control of Senator Kennedy for debate only, and when the Senate resumes consideration of FDA on Tuesday, September 23, that 5 hours remain postcloture to be equally divided, and following the stacked votes, Senator Reed of Rhode Island be recognized to offer his amendment No. 1177 and all other provisions of rule XXII remain in status quo.

Mr. LOTT. In just a few minutes I will propound a unanimous-consent request. I had hoped we would be able to finish the interior appropriations bill by tonight. We have not been able to do so because of a number of conflicts and amendments that have been offered. 
Senator Daschle and I have tried to move it along and we have not been able to do so yet. I understand that Senators still have some amendments they would like to offer. We have one more vote pending tonight which has already been called for. 
I believe the next amendment then would be the Hutchinson amendment. I will ask unanimous consent that we have a time limit of about 20 minutes, and that we do that vote at 9:30 in the morning. I will also ask that we get a list of amendments tonight to see what we are dealing with, to begin to close this out. I don't think we have that many problems, but because of the length of time that we have put into the amendments we have already voted on, a number of Senators would like to see this list and work through it in the morning. 
Again, I hope we can work together to get it done. We could have as many as five votes tonight--could have. You know, one of these days we may have to do that. But in view of the circumstances, since we seem to be contributing to some of the problems, and everybody has tried to work in good faith, I think the better part of valor tonight would be to have this one last vote and get the UC, and we would begin votes again in the morning. Is there any comment on that from the minority leader?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have now passed our first conference report of the year, and I am hoping that within the next 10 days we will pass at least a half dozen more. I know the chairman is working with Members on both sides of the aisle and with our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to do that. I appreciate the cooperation we have received on appropriations bills, although we seem to be a little stalled out here on the Interior appropriations bill. I am not sure the Members are back from the August State work period; we seem to have difficulty in getting Senators to come forward and offer amendments that they say are important. 
Now, we were on this some last week. We were on the bill yesterday. We have been on it today. We did not have a vote on an amendment all day Monday, and I am being told now that, well, we have several very important amendments. I want to say this is not just directed to our colleagues on the Democratic side. We have four amendments cooking on the National Endowment for the Arts. My answer is, great, let's have a debate and let's vote. And let's do it in the daylight or we will have to do it tonight. 
Now, I have tried very hard for us to do our work during normal working hours like normal people. I know that's very difficult, but that would be helpful. It keeps you from being cranky. It allows us to live somewhat normal lives with our families. But if we refuse to come forward with our amendments and agree to reasonable time agreements--how many of you think you are going to change anybody's mind by giving a 90-minute speech? How many of you think you are going to change somebody's mind on NEA by giving a 30-minute speech on NEA? 
Come forward, my colleagues, offer your amendments, agree to a reasonable time, and let's vote. If we are not going to do it now, we will have to do it tonight because we need to get this appropriations bill done. 
We have made good progress. We have worked together. We have had good cooperation. Let's not bog down. If we have a mining amendment, grazing, NEA, let's get them up, let's have reasonable debate with hopefully not more than an hour on anything, and let's vote. I believe we can complete this tonight and go on to the FDA reform package that I believe at least 94 Senators want to do. The Democratic leader has agreed to work with me to try to get that done this week, so I urge my colleagues, let's get going here. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I join my colleague to express my sadness at the loss of our friend and Thad's administrative assistant, Wiley Carter. I extend my sympathy to Senator Cochran and his staff, and certainly to the family and all the many friends that Wiley Carter had in Mississippi. 
Senator Cochran did a wonderful job of talking about his indomitable spirit. He was a lovable guy, a great pleasure to be around. He was a friend of mine. And on many occasions when I needed advice and counsel, I can remember seeking out Wiley Carter. He did always have good spirits. I have never seen anybody who actually enjoyed Government and politics, which is the art of Government, any more than Wiley Carter. He was dedicated to maintaining an America in which we want our children to grow up. I am not the only person to note that more Wileys would serve us all well. 
In the initial part of his 40-year career, Wiley worked for the State's economic development department, the Mississippi Democratic Party, former Lt. Gov. Carroll Gartin and former U.S. Representative John Bell Williams of Mississippi. But it was during his 23-year stint as Senator Cochran's administrative assistant that people throughout Mississippi knew him best. 
Wiley spent much of that time criss-crossing our State, listening to its citizens, and working on Thad's behalf to carry out their mission. People trusted Wiley. They were comfortable sharing their concerns with him, and they knew that their words would go straight to Thad's ear. 
Thad and I were not the only ones who counted on Wiley's knowledge. Very few people knew more about Mississippi politics than Wiley, and in past years, few young political hopefuls in our State have considered a run for office without first consulting him. He also provided advice and perspective for many who had been around for quite a while, and he did it with his infectious smile and sense of humor. 
His wit always seemed to put political life in perspective. While running Senator Cochran's Senate race, Wiley quipped, `In a campaign, if you haven't heard a good rumor by noon, you better start one.' Needless to say, Wiley knew how to have fun in serious situations, and he always got the job done. 
Wiley's outstanding work and invaluable knowledge were not the only reasons he was well loved by Mississippians. Many benefited from his tireless work as an ambassador for his beloved Mississippi State University. Wiley was a servant of the people, and he was one of them. 
He is best described as the kind of person who never met a stranger or knew an enemy. He reached out to individuals at all levels, and his friendliness was contagious. Quite simply, everyone liked Wiley. 
I understand that the church in Jackson couldn't hold all those who showed up yesterday to pay tribute and show appreciation for Wiley. To anyone whose life he touched, this is no surprise. 
There is not a story that can be told or a memory brought to mind about Wiley that wouldn't bring a smile to the faces of those who knew him, which is a tribute in itself to his character. Wiley will be sorely missed, but more importantly, he will be fondly remembered. 
I am sure all my colleagues in the Senate join me in extending condolences to the members of his family, to his friend Senator Cochran, and to the many others who loved him. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, we are moving at this time to accommodate one of our Senators who has a health problem right now. It does disrupt the whole schedule. We have work we need to do on Interior appropriations. If we delay it further and then come back to it and have to go off it at 12:15, it just confuses and complicates the whole process. 
We have asked the managers of the Interior appropriations bill--now we have interrupted them--to come to the floor. They are scheduled to be on the floor. I know the Senator from Iowa is working to try and get an amendment included. I feel confident that will be done at some point. At this time, I have to object to the expansion of the unanimous consent request that was offered by the Senator from Massachusetts and support the request that was made by the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so we will be clear what we have agreed to, Senator Gorton and the other manager of the bill will be here to, again, further debate amendments on the Interior appropriations bill. They have been good partners on this appropriations bill and have worked out some of the areas where there have been disagreements, but there will be amendments and, I presume, votes throughout the day on a number of issues, including the National Endowment for the Arts issue, perhaps on some mining issues. I understand perhaps the Senator from Arkansas has an amendment. 
But we need to make progress on the Interior appropriations bill because we hope to finish it tonight or tomorrow and then go to FDA at some point. I hope we can work out a reasonable agreement where we can complete the debate on the Food and Drug Administration reform bill, and we hope to then pretty quickly, either late this week or early next week, go to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. That would be the 13th and last appropriations bill that we would have to deal with this session, and then we could focus the rest of next week and the next week on adopting conference reports to the appropriations bills. We will need to move them very quickly. It will be my intent to try and hold time and focus on getting those conference reports agreed to. 
I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators as we try to accommodate one of our most beloved Senators who has a problem this morning, and we will begin with the Interior appropriations momentarily. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning we are scheduled to have 30 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment to S. 830, the FDA reform bill. This is the second cloture vote we have had to have on this very important bipartisan legislation to reform the Food and Drug Administration so that medicines and medical devices can get to the American people in a responsible and reasonable period of time so that they don't have worse health conditions, or even death in many instances. We are scheduled to have a rollcall vote at 10 a.m. this morning on cloture, if it is required. And we had hoped to go ahead and do that and then go back to the Interior appropriations bill and complete that, and then come back to FDA. 
We have a Senator that has an illness this morning who would like very much to be able to make this vote. So we are contacting all of the managers of the legislation that is pending this morning, including the Interior appropriations committee, to see if we can maybe take some additional time this morning on Interior appropriations. If we can get that worked out, we may delay that 10 o'clock vote until either say 11:15 or 12:15 in an effort that I know all Members would want to make to accommodate this Senator who is anxious not to miss the vote. 
So we will ask our colleagues on both sides to cooperate as we try to use this time for constructive debate and see then exactly what time we could expect these votes to occur. 
Under the consent agreement that we entered into last week, Members have until 10 a.m. today to file second-degree amendments to the FDA reform bill. After the disposition of that cloture vote and/or the FDA reform bill, depending on what we can work out, then we will resume consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. Senators can expect additional votes throughout the day either on the FDA reform package or on the Interior appropriations bill. 
I will ask the managers of the FDA bill to work with us on this and cooperate with us so that we can have some orderly consideration of both the FDA and the Interior appropriations bill. Hopefully we will go to Interior after we invoke cloture again on FDA reform, then allow Senators that are interested to continue to work together, and then see if we can get an agreement to complete action on FDA reform in a reasonable time this week. 
Does the Senator from Vermont want me to yield at this point?

I hope that we can complete action this week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have the opportunity this week, I believe, to complete action on the Interior appropriations bill and on the Food and Drug Administration reform package. There has been a lot of work done on FDA, and I believe a consensus is evolving. Hopefully, within a day or day and a half, we could complete action on that bill this week. And if time permits, we will also take up the D.C. appropriations bill which would be the last of the 13 appropriations bills the Senate needs to pass. 
Today, though, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. As announced earlier, there will be no rollcall votes today. Any votes ordered on amendments to this bill, H.R. 2107, will be set aside to occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the minority leader. Presumably, that would be in the morning, hopefully even early in the morning. The Senate will be able, hopefully, to conclude debate on the Interior bill by Tuesday. We have one of our most outstanding chairmen who is managing this bill. I think this one is going to be a handful for him, but they have worked out a number of issues. I feel like we will be able to get an early resolution and complete action on the Interior appropriations bill. Members are encouraged to contact the managers of the bill to schedule floor action on any possible amendments. I hope Members will not wait until sometime Tuesday afternoon or late Tuesday night, or whenever, when it is convenient for them to drop by if they have any amendments. If you have a good amendment, you get more attention, you get a better chance to have it properly considered and even get a vote if you show up early for work and offer your amendment. 
As Members are aware, then, there will only be one appropriations bill left, and we will take it up later on this week or the D.C. appropriations bill will come up perhaps early next week. We need Members' cooperation in scheduling floor action, and we will attempt to conclude action on both these bills this week. We will notify the Members when rollcall votes are agreed to. 
Under rule XXII, all first-degree amendments to S. 830, that is the FDA reform bill, must be filed by 1 p.m. today. I want to remind Members of that deadline. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I wish the chairman and manager of the bill, the great Senator from the State of Washington, good luck in completing his work. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 2 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to a vote on Executive Calendar No. 234, the nomination of Joseph Bataillon, to be immediately followed by a vote on Calendar No. 236, Christopher Droney, to be immediately followed by a vote on Calendar No. 237, Janet Hall. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to each of the above votes. 
I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following those votes, Calendar Nos. 238, 239, 245 and 247 be confirmed. 
I finally ask unanimous consent that following these confirmations, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the Senate then return to legislative session.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information then of all Senators, that is three judicial nominations that have been cleared on both sides of the aisle, although recorded votes will be required, and then two U.S. attorneys that have been on the calendar for some time, U.S. Attorney Sharon Zealey of Ohio and U.S. Attorney James Hurd of the Virgin Islands. We also have two nominees for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that we are able to confirm. 
With these nominations moving forward, I think it is very positive for the Senate. I want the Senators to be aware that there will be three back-to-back votes beginning at 2 p.m. today. 
Also, I am very pleased we are going to be able to get clearance for all committees to meet during the afternoon hours and the rest of this morning. 
I believe, Mr. President, we will momentarily be prepared to go to opening statements with regard to the Food and Drug Administration reform. Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy are here ready to proceed. 
Mr. President, with regard to the comments made by Senator Harkin, the fundamental difference in his position and our position with regard to education funds is that we just believe that the people at the local level and people at the State level want good education in their schools. I am a big advocate of vocational education, but I just happen to believe that if the State of Mississippi had more discretion in how those funds are to be used, they probably would put more money in vocational education in our State and less money in some of the programs they are mandated to do by the Federal Government. 
We want good vocational education. We want safe schools. The difference is we just think that parents and teachers at the local level would do a better job of deciding how to educate their children than dictates from Washington, DC, and the Federal bureaucracy. It has not worked. We spent billions of dollars on education, and the test scores and the quality of education and the safety of the schools and parental involvement has gone down, down, down, down. 
It is time we try something else to really improve education in America. That is what we are trying to do. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I think we are making some good progress now. Those three votes move us much closer to being able to get to final passage. 
I see the manager of the bill is here. I have been talking to the Democratic leader and I need to converse a few moments more with the manager of the bill. We are hoping maybe we can take up another amendment and get a vote in a relatively short period of time, and then after that we are working on getting some time agreement on a couple of issues. Depending on how much time is needed, then we would probably--if it is going to be a lengthy period of time, we would probably have those votes in the morning, at 9:30, one or two of them, as we come in. But we are still working through how much time is needed for debate and the time agreements. As soon as we get that all worked out we will notify the Members. 
It is our plan now, I think it is safe to say, that the next major amendment we would like to take up is Senator Daschle's amendment and have a vote. I assume that would not take too long. At that point we hope to be able to give the Members an idea about what the remainder of the night would be and what would be the votes, if any, tonight or the first votes in the morning. 
I believe we have a 20-minute time agreement on the amendment of Senator Daschle. 
Before we begin on that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there has been a concerted effort on all sides to work out a unanimous-consent agreement. I think it is a fair one in view of the time--and the amendments--that we have spent on this important appropriations bill, the Labor-Health and Human Services and Education bill. 
We have an agreement here now that I think will allow us to complete all action on the bill before noon tomorrow. Then it would be our intent at that time to go to the Interior appropriations bill. In the middle of the afternoon we would probably go to FDA reform. There would be at least an hour of debate by Senator Kennedy, followed by others certainly, and then we would have probably a cloture motion, and we would return to Interior appropriations. 
That is not a part of the UC. There are a lot of contacts still being made on behalf of Senators on both sides of the issues involved in Interior appropriations. But I believe we have the FDA reform time, and general understanding of what we will do there. 
But I just wanted to give Members some idea of what we hope our schedule will be tomorrow beyond this agreement. 
I ask unanimous-consent that time on the Nickles amendment, No. 1081, be limited to 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form, and following the debate the Craig second-degree amendment, No. 1083, be agreed to, and that no other second-degree amendments be in order. 
I further ask that the time on the Gregg amendment, No. 1070, as modified, be limited to 30 minutes, equally divided in the usual form, and, following the debate, the second-degree amendment, No. 1071, be withdrawn, and no other second-degree amendments be in order.

But if that does not come to a head, I would modify then--let me put this part of the consent.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then in light of this agreement, there will be no further votes this evening, and at 10 a.m. on Thursday, four back-to-back votes will occur. Also, for those Senators interested in the Gorton education amendment, that debate 
will be occurring this evening. The debate on the Teamsters issue and the testing issue will occur between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. followed by, of course, the stacked votes. 
I do want to say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the effort by Senator Gorton. I agree with the statements I heard being made by Senator Craig. And the idea is to get education back to the people, back to the local level, back to the parents, and the children, the teachers and administrators. Let them make the decisions of how best to spend their allocation of these Federal funds. I believe they will make the right decisions, and it will be a way to help improve education in America. It is one thing to test. But we know that our children are not doing as well as they should be. What we should be focusing on is greater parental involvement in education, and in the decisions affecting that education at the local level. This amendment would do it. 
I heartily endorse the Gorton amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for 3 long years, the House Resources Committee has worked with the Department of the Interior to craft a statute that redefines and redirects the mission of the wildlife refuge program. After holding a total of eight hearings and countless legislative meetings with the administration, the House Resources Committee introduced and reported H.R. 1420. Thanks to the dedicated support of Chairman Young and Secretary Babbitt, this bill overwhelmingly passed the House by a vote of 407 to 1 on June 3, 1997. 
Mr. President, I am proud of the Senate's unanimous approval of this historic legislation. It proves that successful environmental policy can be crafted in a bipartisan manner. 
This legislation was endorsed by a coalition of diverse interests. It is rare to find an issue that captures the attention and collective effort of industry, sportsmen, and conservationists. These groups, ranging from the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America and the National Rifle Association to the Safari Club and the Audubon Society, have shown good faith in their efforts. I appreciate their perseverance and cooperation in finding a consensus for the public policy governing America's refuge system. 
In order to ensure that the bill would be considered and passed with as few changes as possible, it was held at the desk for consideration. Some may claim that this was an unusual parliamentary procedure, but I contend that this is an unusual bill. I was protecting the balance reached within the House-passed legislation in order to ensure a swift resolution of the legislative process. Senators' concerns and the jurisdictions of the committee process were respected and preserved. 
Mr. President, the result of these unusual proceedings is an outstanding product. Americans for generations to come will appreciate the wisdom and equity of this clear multiuse mission for our refuge system. 
As Mississippians go to the Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge, some will be there to hunt, some to enjoy the tremendous beauty of their surroundings, and others to appreciate the effort to preserve our natural heritage. All is possible because of H.R. 1420. Mississippians--and their many diverse interests--will be given the right to coexist within the refuge. 
H.R. 1420 will refocus the mission of the refuge system. It recognizes that hunting and fishing are important and legitimate activities on these public lands. Common ground was found--and it is high ground indeed. 
Again, I want to personally applaud Chairman Young and Representatives Dingell and Miller for their dedication to this legislative initiative. With the assistance of Secretary Babbitt, they have forged a new path for a refuge system with a clear multiuse mission. I thank my Senate colleagues for their participation and endorsement of this legislative proposal.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, like the Chaplain, and on behalf of the Senate, I would like to pay tribute today to Mother Teresa. I know that I am speaking for every Member of the Senate in expressing our sorrow in the loss of Mother Teresa, this wonderful lady. 
At the same time, we realize that if ever there was a life well lived, it was hers. Her passing helps us understand the psalm's comfort for those who mourn, that `precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His faithful ones.' 
Only 3 months ago, Mother Teresa came here to the Capitol. She joined us as we gave to her the Congressional Gold Medal in support of her work for the poorest of the world's poor. Even then, everyone present understood that it would only be a matter of time before her work, never finished, would rest in other hands. 
But what an honor it was for us to meet her. The leaders were there, and the Members of the House and the Senate. That was a special occasion. We all felt touched by this elderly lady, who at once was so frail and at the same time so tough and so unconcerned about anything except the suffering of others. 
This was a lady who, on an earlier visit to Washington, when she was being escorted to a White House car waiting to take her to the airport, inquired about how her companions would get to the airport. When she was told they would go in a different vehicle, she declared everyone must stay together and take the bus. 
To put it mildly, fame, and accolades were not important to her. What was important to her--what shaped her life from the Balkan village where she was born to the places of power where she was honored--was a devotion to the most vulnerable members of the human family, especially children, both before and after their birth. 
When she first visited the Capitol back in 1981, one of our colleagues, then Senator James Buckley of New York, remarked, `There is no telling what may be started by someone like her, who plays with fire by striking sparks off the flinty heart.' 
Today, 16 years later, it is magnificently clear what she did start, literally around the world. Out of her poverty, she enriched mankind. Out of her loneliness, she showed us the heights of the human spirit. From the perspective of this century's end, we have a better understanding of what true greatness really is. 
The monsters of our era--Mao, Stalin, Hitler, and the rest--they and their ideologies are in the trash heap of history. But what Mother Teresa launched, with bare hands and with an open heart, is going to last far longer than anyone can imagine. 
Sad as our loss of her may be, we should not forget that her passing would not be viewed by her as a tragedy, but as a triumph. She had that assurance from the person to whom she gave her life, who surely has said to her, `I was hungry, and you gave me to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink.' 
So as we celebrate her life, let us now celebrate her joy. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding naval officer, Capt. Robert C. Klosterman, who served with distinction for 41 months as commanding officer of the U.S.S. John C. Stennis nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, named for the great Senator from Mississippi. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and commend him for the superb service he has provided the Navy and our great Nation. 
A native of Cincinnati, OH, Captain Klosterman graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1969 and was designated a Naval Aviator in 1970 at NAS Kingsville, TX. He flew over 440 combat missions in Vietnam, piloting UH-1B gunships with Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadron 3. Following his service in Vietnam, Captain Klosterman returned as a flight instructor with VT-9 at Meridian, MS, where he served as Director of Flight Training and Operations Officer through 1973. 
Captain Klosterman's service at sea includes junior officer and department head tours in VA-86 (U.S.S. Nimitz) and two instructor pilot tours in VA-174. He joined Attack Squadron 46 (VA-46) as executive officer in June 1984 and took command in January 1986. During his tour, VA-46 participated in combat operations against Libya from U.S.S. America, and was awarded the 1986 COMNAVAIRLAN Battle `E.' Captain Klosterman completed naval nuclear power training in 1988 and was executive officer of U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) from June 1989 to April 1991. He is a veteran of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, as well as Operations Restore Hope and Southern Watch. 
During his naval career, Captain Klosterman has accumulated over 5,800 flight hours and made over 1,000 carrier arrested landings. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, 3 Meritorious Service Medals, 15 Air Medals, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and the Combat Action Ribbon. He was also the recipient of the 1986 COMLATWING ONE Pat Anderson Award for weapons delivery excellence. 
As commanding officer of the U.S.S. John C. Stennis, he delivered to the Nation and the U.S. Navy the most modern and technologically advanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the world. He did this while realizing over $75 million in savings to the taxpayers, for which we owe him a debt of gratitude. 
Mr. President, Robert C. Klosterman, his wife Rebecca, and son Todd have no doubt made many sacrifices during his 28-year naval career. They have made significant contributions to the outstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. Captain Klosterman is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so proudly serves. As this decorated combat veteran now departs the Navy, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and following seas. He is a sailor's sailor.

Mr. LOTT. Tomorrow the Senate will immediately resume consideration then of S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. As Members are aware, under the order, all amendments had to be offered today in order to be considered as part of this legislation. Therefore, the Senate will continue debating amendments in order throughout Tuesday's session of the Senate. It is hoped that all debate and votes on amendments to S. 1061 can be completed on Tuesday. The next rollcall votes will occur beginning at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. In addition, the Senate will recess, as I got permission just a moment ago, between 12:30 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. for the weekly luncheons to meet. As indicated earlier, it is hoped that the Senate can complete this work on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. We will then go to the FDA reform legislation, and our intent is to complete that work this week also. Once we have completed the appropriations bill that we have approval for here, plus the FDA, then we would go to the Interior appropriations bill. 
Members can anticipate votes throughout the day each day of this week, including Friday as it now stands. And, also, depending on what happens with regard to committee meetings, we may have to go into the night. I hope that is not necessary. I think it is better for us to do our work in the daylight, and I will do everything to try to make sure that happens.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume debate on the motion to proceed to S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. Under the previous order, there are 4 hours of debate remaining on the motion to proceed equally divided between Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy. I believe Senator Jeffords is on the floor ready to use his share of the time. 
Following the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1061, which is the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill. Also under the order that was agreed to, a vote on an amendment relating to S. 1061 is expected around 5 p.m. today. In addition, Members are reminded that under the consent, all amendments remaining in order to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill must be offered by the close of business today. 
Any further votes ordered on amendments to the bill, S. 1061, or other votes, will be stacked to occur on Tuesday at a time to be determined. And we will consult with the Democratic leader about what those amendments will be or other votes and what time they will actually occur. 
In addition, under the previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of the FDA reform bill following the disposition of S. 1061, but not before 4 p.m. on Tuesday, although it is my hope that certainly by 5 o'clock on Tuesday we will be working on the substance of the FDA bill. 
Members can expect then that the Senate will complete the Labor-HHS bill, the FDA reform bill, and we will begin then with the Interior appropriations bill this week. Whether we will be able to finish that, how late we will have to go on Wednesday night or Thursday night or whether or not we will have votes on Friday will depend on what kind of progress we make during the day Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 
The next rollcall vote then will be at 5 o'clock today on an amendment related to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill or other vote that we may get worked out.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of amendment No. 1077, offered by the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, who is here and prepared to go. This is an amendment, of course, to S. 1061, the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. It is hoped that an agreement can be reached this morning to conduct a vote on the Coats amendment by mid-morning, hopefully within the hour. 
In addition, Members can anticipate additional votes on amendments currently pending to the Labor, HHS appropriations bill and other amendments expected to be offered to the bill throughout the day's session. I understand a couple of amendments have been offered and set aside. I know there are some other amendments pending. As always, Members will be notified of exactly what time the votes will be scheduled. We will work with all Members to make sure they have an opportunity to offer their amendments and debate them, and then, of course, we will have votes, if necessary. 
I ask, again, that all Senators cooperate with our managers on both sides of the aisle. They are trying to move this very important legislation that means so much to our country. And, as is quite often the case when we return from a period back in our respective States, we have not gotten off to a fast start. We hope to complete this very important appropriations bill today. We do have some problems and some delays. I would like to address those just for a moment. 
First, with regard to tomorrow, it is still my intent to have a cloture vote in the morning. We have not set a time. It could be as early as 8:30 to accommodate Senators' schedules, on the cloture motion on the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. We need to get this bill done. It was reported out overwhelmingly from the committee, and it has broad bipartisan support. Unfortunately, this is even a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. 
The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has objections to this FDA reform. I thought we had them worked out two or three times at the end of the session, before the August recess, and then it seemed to get away from us. 
I hope we can get all the Senators to work together and work out agreements so we can move this very important legislation. It is very important to the health and general quality of life of all Americans. This is an agency that has been bureaucratic, it has been slow, it has not done its work where it should be doing its work, and it has tried to force itself into areas where it really doesn't belong. This is long overdue. 
I, again, am interested in getting it done. But if we have to, we will have more than one vote or votes on cloture. We need to go ahead and complete this. I think, once we can get it to debate and vote, it will not take very long. If we can work out something, by the way, on the bill, before the time, then we would not have to have a cloture vote tomorrow. I would be glad to work with the leaders on the legislation, Democratic leaders, to decide on a time when it would be debated and when that would be scheduled, either later on this week, or Monday or Tuesday. We will work together on that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the other issue I want to address is some of the problems we have today. When we have something brought to the Senate that we have to look into, and, in this case, I am referring to the election in Louisiana for the Senate last year, where allegations of fraud have been made, it is incumbent upon us to thoroughly check those allegations out. Unfortunately, the committee charged with jurisdiction in this area has not been able to work together in a bipartisan way to get it done and get the work completed. I want us to reach that point sooner, not later, and I have worked across the aisle to try to come up with a process to make that happen. I thought we had it worked out, again, the last week in July, and at the last minute that fell apart. 
So, we have to do our job. I am not going to come to the floor of the Senate, look Senators in the eye, and the American people, and say, `We checked it out thoroughly, there is nothing here,' or, `There is a real problem here,' until all the work that needs to be done has been done. I can't do that. 
Now we are being told, well, if you continue it, we are going to have delays and obstruction by the Democrats. What are they delaying and obstructing? The Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill, the Superfund reform. Here is a program, Superfund, that is really the laughingstock of America. 
You care about the environment? Who among us would not care that the program is not working. Lawyers have a grand time. They are making money. But we are not cleaning up hazardous sites. We are not cleaning up hazardous waste sites. 
So the Committee on Environment and Public Works wants to meet today to mark up the Superfund bill, and I am being told, `Well, we are not going to let you meet; we are not going to let that committee meet, in a bipartisan way, and mark this bill up.' And, therefore, I have no option but to say, OK, if you are going to do that, then we will go out this afternoon. 
If objection is made to the Environment and Public Works Committee meeting this afternoon to mark up Superfund reform, which would clean up hazardous waste sites in my State and probably every State in America, if that is going to be blocked, then the Senate will go out at 2 o'clock, we will be out until 4 o'clock so the committee can meet and do its work, and we will tack that time onto tonight. We are not going to have this arrangement where the other side tries to dictate the schedule in committee meetings. We are not going to do that. 
I have worked very hard to keep my word to the Senate and to the Senators. When I say we are going to meet and have votes, we try to do that. When we agree we are not going to meet and have votes, we try to honor that. We agreed we would be out in the third week in October for the Columbus Day period. I am going to keep my word on that. I tried to keep in mind the personal lives, and opportunities to have dinner with families and children. I want to do that. But if we are going to start playing this game of threats and delays and obstruction and blocking of committee meetings and that sort of thing, then I have no option but to put the time on the back end. 
So, I don't think that is necessary. We have had a good feeling here in the Senate for the last 2 months. We worked together in a bipartisan way, even when we disagreed. I think we can continue to do that, and I certainly will try to continue to keep my word and work with the Senators on this schedule. That is one of the reasons why we might have to vote early in the morning, because some Senators on both sides of the aisle want to leave. That is fine. We want to help them. But we also have work to do. 
So, I just wanted to point out what is going on. I don't have any problem with doing it this way. I just want everybody to understand I am not doing it to cause confusion or delay. I have no option. 
The Environment and Public Works Committee will meet today. We will continue to work on the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. I believe that we can and should get it completed today or tomorrow. But we will have success on this bill, and we will do it in a bipartisan way, and we will do it, hopefully, by the end of this week or the first of next week. 
So I just wanted to advise Senators what the schedule looks like for today and in the morning. I will talk to my counterpart on the other side of the aisle. I will be glad to work with Senators on FDA reform and Superfund reform and on Labor, HHS, to see if we can find reasonable accommodation, and we will also continue to pursue an opportunity to recommend to the Senate what action, if any, or none, should be taken with regard to the Louisiana election.

Mr. LOTT. But if an objection is heard today for the Environment and Public Works Committee to meet in session this afternoon and work on marking up a very important environmental bill to clean up hazardous waste sites, that interrupts the process of the appropriations bill. That committee should meet. In my opinion, it should have already met on this issue, and had votes and brought it to a conclusion. So, if an objection is heard to committees meeting, I have no option but to go out for a period of time to allow the committees to do their work. That's a very important part of our process here. 
So the effect is that you are delaying the appropriations bill. But perhaps objection would not be heard, we wouldn't have to stop for 2 hours this afternoon so that a very important committee could meet. I have indicated to the Senator and to Senator Daschle that we hope that would not be necessary. But, you know, the effect is to delay the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. 
With regard to the Louisiana election, yes, it is September. It need not be. This matter could have been concluded, completed, weeks or months ago, but from the beginning, the Democrats on the committee would not cooperate, would not work with us. They didn't actually----

Mr. LOTT. Wait, I have the floor and I will yield when you ask me to. I am on that committee, and all I ever said was find out what happened, was there apparent fraud or not. As a matter of fact, investigators never went into Louisiana until July. Shortly thereafter, in something I have not seen in 25 years in Congress, the Democrats walked out of the committee's proceedings and said, `We won't participate.' 
In investigation after investigation over the years in the House and the Senate, I never saw the Republicans or Democrats, in any other instance, say, `We're not going to participate.' 
What happened after the investigators' being down there for like 2 weeks, the Justice Department withdrew the FBI agents. It couldn't come to a conclusion. The week before we went out, I talked with Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle, and we worked out an arrangement that I thought everybody was satisfied with for a special allocation of money to complete that work and in time to complete that work. At the last minute, it was jerked away. 
What has happened is, I think Senator Warner is going to make an announcement today, I believe, about a schedule he has in mind. There are several boxes of documents that have been turned over now to the committee as a result of the subpoena duces tecum to get evidence with regard to gaming interests and involvement in the election. By the way, I think they have every right to support a referendum. The only question is was it in any way used improperly or illegally. I don't know the answer to that. 
Once those documents are reviewed, I understand the committee is going to meet, hear from the investigators, hear what the evidence is, if any, that they find in these documents and, at some point, the committee will proceed to action. I don't know exactly what date that would be. 
It is not my intention to drag this out indefinitely. But I have to be able to come here and say to Members on both sides of the aisle, `We've done our work. Even though we haven't had cooperation, we have reached a conclusion as best we can, and here it is.' I have told the Senators on both sides of the aisle over the past year and 3 months how we deal with you. I am not interested in causing undue delay or difficulty for any Senator here with or without prejudice. But I must be able, along with other Senators, to say that we did our work, we fulfilled our constitutional responsibility, and then make a recommendation. I will be glad to yield further if you like.

Mr. LOTT. But it has been the common practice for committees to be able to meet. All I am saying to you is, work with us and we can bring this to conclusion. But I am also saying that if you start interrupting the business of the Senate or committees, it will not be without action in return. We need to work together. We need to do these things privately and communication in the type of way we have done over the last 2 months. But if you start playing games with committees meeting on important issues like Superfund and, let me tell you, fast track, it will have an effect. Every action produces a reaction. 
So let's not start down that trail. Let's continue to work together as we have, and we can complete our work on appropriations and on Superfund and on fast track and on ISTEA, and then return to our constituency.

It is not my intention to delay this investigation and this conclusion. It is my intention to make sure that we have investigated all of the alleged fraud and abuses of election laws and illegal acts. When we have done that, I will press aggressively for a conclusion. But until that is done, with the cooperation of the Democrats, it will not end.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, our Democratic colleagues are objecting today to permission for two committees to meet during the pendency of this session. The Agriculture Committee began meeting at 9 a.m. this morning to discuss rural and agriculture credit issues. Yet, as a result of that objection, or the objection we heard on that committee meeting, they had to abruptly end their meeting at 11:30 this morning. 
The Environment and Public Works Committee is scheduled to meet at 2 p.m. today, and I want to take some action here momentarily that will allow them to, in fact, begin their hearing to discuss the Superfund Cleanup Act. Permission for them to meet was also objected to by the Democrats. It is my understanding that prominent witnesses have flown in from all over the country to appear before the Environment and Public Works Committee to discuss this vital environmental issue, what can we do to reform Superfund so the lawyers don't clean up but we clean up hazardous waste sites across America in most every State in this Nation. 
Included in the group that was to come to testify is the Governor of Nebraska. He is scheduled to be introduced momentarily by one of the Senators from Nebraska. That testimony would certainly be key with respect to the Superfund Act in that State. 
The objection lodged by the Democrats would deny that meeting from taking place unless the Senate were to recess. I regret that the Senate must recess in the middle of the day while discussing a very, very important piece of legislation, the Labor and Health and Human Services appropriations bill. We were, I thought, committed to working together in completing the appropriations process, especially a bill like this. While there are still some amendments pending that are of great interest and perhaps even controversial, we have made progress, and I think we could finish it up tonight with a little effort. 
Unfortunately, this objection will only delay the consideration and passage of the Labor, HHS appropriations bill. Our colleagues from the other side of the aisle have stated that `there is no intention to interrupt the business of the Senate, which is to pass these appropriations bills. There is no one out there objecting to the work on those appropriations bills.' Yet, the Democratic objection to the Environment Committee meeting today on Superfund in fact does interrupt the business of the Senate. I truly regret the action taken by our colleagues here today and hope this will not become a practice by Members on the minority side of the aisle. 
Having said all of that, by consent a vote is scheduled at 4:30 p.m. today on the D'Amato amendment to the Labor, HHS appropriations bill, and I now ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in recess until 4:30 p.m. today.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I regret that we have to take this action in order to get our business done on a very important environmental issue. This sort of selective hit certainly, I think, would not be in the best interests of the legislative process of the Senate. We want to get Superfund legislation considered by the committee to the floor. We want to hear from witnesses such as the Governor of Nebraska and citizens who are affected by this. It seems to me the normal way of doing business around here is that is allowed to happen. 
Mr. President, the saber rattling has begun. After bipartisan cooperation by Senate Democrats and Republicans over the past several months, it seems as though the Democrats have now returned to the preening and posturing of politicians more interested in blocking and obstructing the other side than concern for the interests of the American people. 
Senate Democrats have effectively withdrawn from the bipartisan spirit of negotiation and compromise that has been evidenced regarding the budget and tax bills recently enacted by the Congress. Mr. President, the minority is, in effect, threatening to shut down the effective operation of the Senate. Now, they can call it selective cooperation or some other slick phrase that seeks to skirt the truth of the matter, but the American people are too smart for these word games, or, in Washington speak, for deceptive political spin. 
Let me state, positively, that we are more than willing to continue the spirit of bipartisanship to achieve significant accomplishments on subjects of importance to the American people. For example, we are more than willing to work through the Appropriations bills, through ISTEA, and through debate on the many other matters pending before the Senate. But it is going to take cooperation and good faith on both sides, including the Members of the minority. 
That good faith and cooperation is now missing on the part of the minority. The subject of the investigation into the election in Louisiana involves a duty of the Senate--of every Member of the Senate--to fully, thoroughly, and completely investigate the conduct of such elections where the integrity and result of the election is legitimately called into question. The minority is refusing to allow--in fact, is actively obstructing--the Senate from conducting a thorough and complete investigation of the election in Louisiana. 
If the minority wishes to prevent the Senate from living up to its duty regarding this election contest, and wishes to prevent the Senate from considering these important matters that I have noted and to shut down the Senate, then the minority must assume the responsibility for the consequences. Mr. President, good faith and cooperation is a two-way street. We believe that it is important to conduct and complete this election investigation in a thorough and complete manner. We are bound and determined that the investigation will be completed despite obstructionist tactics. I urge the minority to recognize the importance of this subject and the essential place that good faith plays in this legislative process. I urge the minority to assist us in completing this important investigation and to work together with us in good faith to address the many other subjects which are important to the American people. 
I will sum it up this way. This is not the way to get the investigation by the Rules Committee concluded. In fact, it will cause difficulty and will probably delay it. The goal is not--there is no way we could just say, OK, it is over right now. The intent of the chairman is to have a hearing, to see what evidence they have found during the August recess, and I presume to have a meeting at some point to decide what action, if any or none, is to be taken. We will conclude this. We have had to proceed, frankly, without the cooperation of the Democrats. I have been in Congress 25 years. I have never, never, ever before seen one party or the other, either party, walk out on a committee's investigation or activities, even though there have been many, many investigations, several in which I was involved. 
When I can look my colleagues in the Senate and the American people in the eye and say we have looked at this and we have found out as best we could--with the lack of help from the FBI, for instance, in most instances--we have concluded what happened or did not happen, and we in good conscience can say that, when I can do that, then we will conclude it. I can't do that right now. 
But rather than engaging in extended debate at this time, there will obviously be other opportunities to do that and----

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have never seen so many red herrings in my life. We should be flying a flock. This is not about the recent Teamsters strike at UPS, although clearly that strike injured millions of Americans and small businessmen and women. And I heard a lot of those concerns while I was home. I had a lot of calls in my offices pleading for help in some way. `Please find a way to help end this strike because of what it is doing to us as individuals and small businesses.' 
It is not about a union or a particular union. I have had a good relationship with individual teamsters over the years. When I practiced law I represented the longshoremen, the boilermakers, and every other union you can name. 
No. What is this really about? This is about fairness for the American people. That is why this amendment has been offered and why it is so important. The taxpayers of America are paying for union elections. Do we want that? I don't think my constituents know that, and they would be horrified to know it. That is what this is all about. Paying for the Teamsters to hold an election has not happened once. It has happened twice. The question now is, Will it happen a third time because of fraudulent elections, or is it in fact a bill the American people have to foot in perpetuity? 
I've heard a great deal of talk about a consent degree. I am not impressed that a judge said that the people of this country, the taxpayers, should pay for union elections. I am not impressed, whether it was a Republican or a Democrat administration, or which Justice Department went along with it. This is wrong. 
When the people find out the truth of what is going on here, they will be in an uproar because we should not be paying for private union elections. 
So that is the remarkable thing about this situation. That is why this amendment has been offered--to set up a process to stop taxpayers' money being used to conduct union elections; and more importantly, it sets up the process for taxpayers' money to be repaid. 
That is one of the key components of the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. It says that there will be a process whereby the Teamsters, if, in fact, taxpayer dollars are involved, will have to pay back in an agreed-to process with a plan to repay the cost of these elections. The taxpayers of America paid $22 million for the last Teamsters' election; that is $45 per Teamster vote. 
As the Washington Times noted, `the taxpayers were monumentally ripped off.' It turns out there was a fraudulent election. And now there is an indication, well, a judicial official might decree that the taxpayers should have to pay the Teamsters again. This is a horrible procedure. This is a horrible precedent. I don't care what union it is; what business it is. We shouldn't be paying for these kind of elections, and certainly not without some process to get the taxpayers repaid for what they have put into this process. 
The Nickles amendment puts an end to this nonsense. It allows the Federal Government to continue the fight against corruption in the Teamsters Union but says the teamsters have to pay the American people back for the privilege of an honest election. For heaven's 
sake. Nothing could be more fair than that. 
Last month, a Federal election official determined that `corruption'--this is a quote--`in the Teamsters remains a major problem.' Citing `extraordinary' and `egregious improprieties,' the Federal election officials threw out the Teamsters election. We didn't have anything to do with that. That is what the Clinton administration is saying about this. Taxpayers paid for what turned out to be a stolen private election. 
Somehow or other the Justice Department, which was supposed to be overseeing this process, let someone in the Teamsters steal an election right from under its nose with the taxpayers paying the tab for the election. Guess what? Now they are saying, `Well, we don't know but maybe we will have to have another election, and maybe the taxpayers should pay again.' Ridiculous. It is time that we stopped this. 
The Clinton FBI, not the Republican Congress, alleges that there was an intricate money laundering scheme pouring thousands of dollars from the union treasury into union president Ron Carey's campaign. 
Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues: This is a travesty. It is a travesty that these elections are fraudulent again and again. People around here forget that the Teamsters have even been thrown out of the AFL-CIO in the past for such corruption. Now you add to that equation more taxpayer funding. This won't sell in America. 
The Nickles amendment should be adopted. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some of the things that have been said, or questions that have been raised when I was off the floor a few moments ago. First of all, I think I just need to reiterate here what is at stake is taxpayers' money being used to pay for labor union elections where there has been a record of fraud and abuse. Yes, there was a consent degree in 1989. How long does it apply? In perpetuity? We had a fraudulent election, on which, to my absolute horror, $22 million of taxpayers' dollars were spent. It turned out it had problems. The FBI has said so. The Justice Department has even said so. So now they say, oh, yes, let's have another one and let the taxpayers pay for that. So the American people understand very clearly here, this is taxpayers' money going to pay for labor union elections. Judges may or may not say that it ought to be done. All I have to say is, if judges are saying taxpayers' money should be used to pay for private sector, or labor union elections of any kind, I think it is time we take some action to say we are not going to allow that. 
The second thing is, the question was raised, `Why don't we have some votes? Why doesn't somebody tells us when we will have some votes?' Hey, we are ready to vote. Let's vote on the Nickles amendment right now. The motion to table the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts carried; 56 Senators voted to table that motion. I believe the Senate is ready to vote for the amendment of Senator Nickles. 
But, as we try to do around here, we try to accommodate everybody's schedules and their desire to be able to check with the administration or I don't know who. We could probably work out something, to have a vote on Senator Nickles' amendment at some time certain other than tonight. He has indicated he would, perhaps, be willing to do that. But if anybody has raised any questions about why don't we vote, why isn't somebody saying what the schedule is going to be--if you want to vote, let's vote. 
If anybody wants to know that, any one of the Senators who have been speaking, I am ready to vote. That's what we ought to do. We already had a statement of the Senate on this issue. The Senate is concerned about use of taxpayers' money to pay for labor union elections. 
But I have also been working on a whole series of things that I think would be fair to the Senate. Unfortunately, our business was interrupted today. From 2 to 4, we had to go out so the Environment and Public Works Committee could have a hearing and begin a markup on the Superfund bill, a bill that the American people surely would be for, because it means improving the way that we clean up hazardous waste. 
We all know now lawyers are cleaning up. They are doing fine. But we are not cleaning up any hazardous waste sites. We ought to have Superfund reform. And yet there was an objection made to the committee meeting, so we had to go out for 2 hours. We would not be here right now probably if it had not been for that 2-hour interruption. But when we take out 2 hours in the day, we are going to make up that 2 hours at night, or 3 hours. 
I have spent a year trying to be sensitive to Senators' needs, to know what the schedule is going to be, to be with their families, to be with their children, to be with their dog, dogs, so we can have a life, but it takes cooperation on both sides. 
I hope we won't start down that trail where we start these things that force us to be in session late at night. But if it's necessary, we will. That is why we are here now. I had offered a UC request, and I am going to ask for this unanimous-consent agreement that would allow us to not have any more votes tonight, not have any votes tomorrow, but have further debate on amendments on the very important Labor and Health and Human Services bill during the day tomorrow, with no votes; that we would come in on Monday, we would have more amendments on the Labor and Human Services appropriations bill with a vote at 5 o'clock, but only one at the request of the Democratic leader; and that we would get at the close of business Monday a final, finite list of all amendments pending to this appropriations bill. Both the managers would very much like for us to help them get that done. Then we would have other votes that might be pending from Friday or Monday on this bill Tuesday at 9 or 9:30. Then we would be able to wrap up the finite list, which is not that long. There are a couple controversial issues. I think we can get them worked out. Then we would have final passage on all amendments and the bill on Tuesday. 
Then at 5 o'clock on Tuesday, we would go to the Food and Drug Administration reform bill at 5 o'clock, not have any votes on cloture tomorrow, not go through the cloture exercise. An overwhelming number of Senators on both sides of the aisle support this FDA reform bill. It was reported out of committee, I think, 13 to 2.

Mr. LOTT. When we get to final passage, the vote on FDA is going to be 95 to maybe 5, maybe more. Ninety-five Senators want to vote on the substance of FDA reform. The American people want that. The American people want to get a better system for approving drugs and medical devices and a more active and a more efficient FDA. We ought to give it to them. I believe the House is going to act on this. So it was a process to allow the Senators to continue on this bill, to get this bill completed, get FDA up in a reasonable way, and not have more votes tonight. 
Senator Kennedy has indicated he can't agree to that. The alternative then is this: We will have to pull down Labor-HHS tonight. We will then go to two votes on Federal judges tonight. We will vote in the morning at 9:45 on cloture. If we get cloture, then, of course, the Senator from Massachusetts and others perhaps can talk all day tomorrow if they want to. They can talk for 30 hours if they want to after cloture on the motion to proceed--on the motion to proceed now, I want you to know--to the FDA bill that over 90 Senators support. 
Then on Monday, we will go back to Labor-HHS, and we will have a vote on two more judges Monday, perhaps even earlier in the day than we had indicated earlier, and then we will go to votes at 5 o'clock. 
I mean, we are trying to get these things cleared. We are going to have recorded votes on them. I think plan A is in the best interest of the Senate and the American people, our time and efficient legislating. We can get our work done without unnecessary acrimony, without getting outdone by each other. 
If the alternative is two votes tonight and a cloture vote in the morning at 9:45, inconveniencing unnecessarily--and, again, I am trying to accommodate people, we need to go a little later because some can't quite be here at 9:45, others at 10. We will have the vote at 9:45, and we are going to vote cloture. I just don't see why that is necessary. That is where we are. 
I am going to make a unanimous-consent request on that in a moment and then go to judicial nominations. Does anybody have any comment or questions on that? I yield to Senator Kennedy for a question.

Mr. LOTT. If you will allow me to respond to some of the things the Senator from Massachusetts said. He asked for 1 minute to wrap up, and I need to respond, and then I will be glad to yield. 
With regard to the amendment before us, it was offered at 5:05. An offer was made to limit the time on that to 30 minutes. I believe the managers of the bill were very content with that. An offer was made to limit speeches to 5 minutes on this issue. There was no desire to drag it out. So, again, to imply that we have been prolonging this is just not accurate. 
Now, with regard to the Food and Drug Administration effort to make the bureaucratic FDA more responsive to the needs of the American people, this really affects quality of life and health care, and I know the Senator from Massachusetts cares a great deal about that. This is one way we can help them to get medical devices and pharmaceutical products available to the American people. The vote in the committee was 14 to 4. Usually when you have a vote in the committee and it is overwhelming in a bipartisan way, you bring it to the floor and you have debate, amendments, vote, and move on. 
But somehow or other, I mean, some folks seem to think when you have a vote in a committee and lose, then the negotiations begin. The leader of both parties always has to be sensitive to that. I have allowed Senators on both sides of the aisle to continue negotiations on the foster care bill, on other bills, but I have been very patient on this. And I wanted a cloture vote on this back in July. I was told repeatedly, `Oh, we're about to get it agreed to, about to get it done.' Every time we were about to get it done, the Senator from Massachusetts said, `Oh, no, there's something else here I want.' 
I think the Senator from Vermont has been doing the very best he can in the negotiations. I personally think he has negotiated too dang much. The vote in the committee was 14-4. Why are we negotiating on all this stuff? Let us bring it to the floor and let us vote. 
So when I get this magnanimous offer: Oh, you can have a cloture vote next week, put it off another--I offered a UC that would have given the Senator from Massachusetts an opportunity to negotiate Friday, Monday, all day Tuesday, and go on the bill on Tuesday night. He said no. But if we wait until next Tuesday to have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed, then he may try to force us to have a vote on going to the bill itself later on on a cloture vote, and then we might someday, in another week or so, get to FDA. That is ridiculous. There has been enough time. 
The Senate wants to vote on this issue, overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way. The committee has spoken. On a cloture vote, on a motion to proceed, the requisite number of Senators will vote for cloture, I believe. So I mean, that is not very responsive. It is time we get to this issue. Make your case, offer your amendments. 
On the cosmetic thing, I mean, the Senator from Massachusetts is defending and worrying about States rights. Boy, getting some role reversals around here, when he doesn't want us to even get an amendment and vote on it. He may have the merits on his side. If he does, let us hear them; we will vote. 
But, you know, it is time that we move forward on Labor-HHS. It is time we vote on the merits of FDA reform. I cannot believe we want to further delay. Every day we delay on FDA reform, there is some other delay by the bureaucracy at that agency that denies the people of this country medical devices and pharmaceuticals that help them with their lives and lifestyles. And so we are not going to delay it any longer. We are going to get an agreement to go to the bill on Tuesday or we are going to have a cloture vote in the morning. And if the vote doesn't succeed, we will have another one. I think I have been more than reasonable, and so has everybody else.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only amendments remaining in order to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, other than the pending amendments, and they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments, and that all first-degree amendments must be offered prior to the close of business on Monday, September 8, other than the amendments designated as managers' amendments. 
I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading, and a vote occur on passage of S. 1061, and the bill remain at the desk. I further ask unanimous consent that once the Senate receives the House companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 1061 be inserted, the House bill be advanced to third reading, and passed, all without further action or debate. 
I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees. 
I further state for the membership that any votes ordered with respect to the Labor-HHS bill on Friday and Monday, September 8, be postponed to occur at 5 p.m. on Monday, with one vote at that time, on a case-by-case basis. Thereafter, we will begin votes on Tuesday morning at 9:30. 
I further ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S. 830 following the passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill--that is the Food and Drug Administration reform bill--but not earlier than 4 p.m. on Tuesday, September 9, to give the Senate plenty of time to continue to work on any agreements that they could come together on, and the cloture vote scheduled for Friday be vitiated. 
That is the unanimous-consent request that I think is fair for all concerned. I urge that it be accepted.

Mr. LOTT. In view of what I just heard the Senator say--he is right, that is the regular order. Of course, it is common practice, if you work things out you vitiate the necessity for a cloture vote. But, yes, I knew exactly what I was doing. And what I was doing was trying to carry out the will of the Senate, 
and not allow one Senator to any further delay the discussion of the merits of FDA reform. 
In view of what the Senator said, I revise my unanimous-consent request to comply with what I thought I heard the Senator saying, the same unanimous-consent request all the way down the line, except that we would have the cloture vote in the morning at 9:45. 
Would there be objection to that?

In the interest of trying to get something worked out here, I would be prepared to take a 5-minute quorum call so we can look over the list and discuss it. If we cannot get that worked out, then I would begin the process of taking up the two judges and voting here in a few minutes. 
So in view of the Senator's comments, and the idea that maybe we could get an agreement, I would at this point----

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the next recorded vote will be the last vote tonight. Unfortunately, we have not been able to work out an agreement that will allow us to vitiate the cloture vote on the FDA reform bill tomorrow morning. So there will be a vote at 9:45. After that, Senator Kennedy, assuming cloture is invoked, would have 4 hours of debate on FDA reform. We could go back to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill tomorrow for other amendments to be offered, but no further votes, other than the 9:45 vote. 
On Monday, we will have FDA debate from 12 until 1. Then we will go to the Labor-HHS at Monday at 1. We will have a vote at 5 o'clock on Monday on either the Nickles amendment or any other amendment that Senators have taken up during the day, or any other pending amendment. I believe the McCain amendment is pending. We will have one vote at 5 o'clock on Monday. And then, on Tuesday, we will have other amendment votes, if there are any pending, at 9:30. We would complete the list we have agreed on, all amendments, and final passage on Labor-HHS sometime Tuesday afternoon, and then we will go to the FDA reform package, but not earlier than 4 o'clock. 
I had hoped we could get an agreement that would allow us not to have had a cloture vote in the morning and be able to vitiate that. Senator Kennedy didn't feel he could agree to that. I hoped that we would not have to have votes on Monday, but we could not get all that worked out. So that is the outline of the UC that I would like to renew. I have discussed this with Senator Daschle. The list has been worked over by everybody. So I would like to renew my request with respect to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill that I made earlier and ask consent, if cloture is invoked Friday on the FDA reform package, that there be up to 8 hours divided between Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for debate on S. 830 and an additional 4 hours of debate on Monday, divided in the same fashion, beginning at 11 a.m.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, I regret that the cloture motion is necessary at this time. I understand all of the interested parties were in agreement just prior to the recess. In fact, I stayed very close to the members of the committee that reported this legislation and to those who have continued to work to try to work out remaining disagreements, including Senator Jeffords, Senator Mack, Senator Frist, others on this side of the aisle, as well as Senator Dodd and Senator Mikulski. 
This is truly a bipartisan issue and one we certainly should take up and finish before we go out at the end of this year. 
When you talk about quality of life for Americans, certainly having a reformed Food and Drug Administration would be in their interest. Too many procedures, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices are delayed, hung up by bureaucracy. What we need is an expedited process, the reforms that are necessary to make that happen, and safe procedures for the American people. 
I hope we can get this done. The only objection I know of was one that has been lodged by Senator Kennedy. We thought we had the agreement all worked out the last week we were in session. At the last minute, there seemed to be some further objection. As a matter of fact, I had hoped over the last 2 weeks before we went out the 1st of August for our State work period that we could get this agreed to. Now there is apparently some disagreement with regard to cosmetics. I would think this legislation is much more important than some remaining small disagreement in this area. 
So as a result of filing this cloture motion, a cloture vote will occur on Friday, September 5 in the morning unless something is worked out in the meantime. I will consult with the Democratic leader and all the Senators involved on both sides of the aisle as to how we can proceed. We need to get this done. 
By the way, this is on the motion to proceed. It looks like we will have a filibuster even on the motion to proceed. I am committed to this. If we have to have a cloture on the motion to proceed, if we have to have more than one, if we have to have cloture on the bill itself, whatever is necessary, I feel that we should force this to an action. 
However, I do ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived at this time.

Mr. LOTT. Today the Senate will resume consideration of the Harkin amendment No. 1057 to the Agriculture appropriations bill. Under the previous order, there will be 20 minutes for debate on the amendment equally divided between Senator Cochran and Senator Harkin. Following the use or yielding back of time, a vote will occur on or in relation to the Harkin amendment at approximately 9:50 a.m. 
Following the disposition of the Harkin amendment and passage of the Agriculture appropriations bill, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. 
I remind Senators that this issue, of course, was considered in July. The Harkin amendment was defeated at that time, I believe, by a vote of 52 to 48. I urge my colleagues to again vote against the Harkin amendment and to, of course, support passage of the Agriculture appropriations bill. I believe Senator Cochran in July outlined clearly what is involved in this issue, and I think obviously he has stated the position that we should support which is to defeat this Harkin amendment. 
Members can expect a number of amendments to be offered today and votes will occur throughout the day on Labor-HHS. We hope to be able to complete action in short order on the bill. We may not be able to do it tonight, but we will stay with the Labor-HHS appropriations bill until it is completed, either today or, if necessary, tomorrow. We will notify Members when votes can be expected. 
In addition, the Senate will recess at 12:30 until 2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. As announced earlier, Members can expect votes each day this week, including the very real possibility of at least one vote, maybe more, on Friday of this week. 
As the Senate continues the session through September and October, we will notify Members, after consultation with the Democratic leadership, when we will definitely have votes on Mondays or Fridays or if there will not be any votes on a particular Monday or Friday. But if we are going to be able to complete our work by a reasonable time this fall and then go back to our constituencies in our respective States, we are going to have to work on some Mondays and Fridays. 
I yield the floor, Madam President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will be returning from the August recess and will begin immediate consideration of S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, is here and is ready to go with the opening debate. As announced prior to the recess, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Members will be offering amendments, hopefully, to the bill. Today, however, any votes ordered on those amendments will occur during Wednesday's session. 
Also under the order, at 2:15 p.m. today, the Senate will resume consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill to allow Senator Harkin to offer an amendment regarding the FDA. A rollcall vote will occur on or in relation to Senator Harkin's amendment at approximately 9:50 on Wednesday morning, tomorrow morning. 
I remind my colleagues, in addition to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill this week the Senate needs to consider and complete action on the Interior appropriations bill as well as the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. If there is difficulty continuing with the FDA reform, it would be my intent to file a cloture motion tomorrow, which would then ripen on Friday morning, and unless some agreement can be worked out we would have to have that vote on Friday morning. 
Therefore, after today's session, votes will be occurring each day. The chairman just indicated to me he would hope to finish the Labor-HHS bill tomorrow night, but we will stay on the bill and get it completed except for the one vote at 9:50 on Wednesday, and of course, if we have to go to FDA reform--we can complete the bill, although I hope it can be completed by the time we get to FDA. 
I urge Senators that are back in town that have amendments to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to please come to the floor, offer those amendments today, so that you can have them debated now and not get under a time pressure late tomorrow afternoon or tomorrow night or whenever we get to the close of the debate. I think you get a lot better consideration of amendments if you come and offer them early rather than later. 
I want to thank all Senators for their past and hopefully continued cooperation during the remainder of the first session of the 105th Congress. As all Members are aware, as we approach adjournment at the end of this legislative session it will be very busy and will necessitate everyone working with the leaders as we try to complete the remaining schedules. We have not had an opportunity to meet with the leadership and to talk with the leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle about exactly when our target adjournment will be, but during the remainder of the week we will be doing so. Later on this week, to early next week, we will give Senators some idea of our hoped for adjournment. 
I do want to say again how much I appreciate the cooperation that we have had this year. We did complete the Balanced Budget Act and the tax relief package. We also have already passed 10 of our 13 appropriations bills, with only 3 remaining, this bill, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, Interior, and the District of Columbia. We would like to finish, in fact, we plan to finish, all three of those bills by the end of next week. Then we will begin to take up conference reports and other bills that are necessary before we end the session for this year. It did take cooperation from all Senators and it took cooperation of the leadership on both sides of the aisle. I hope we can continue that and do the people's business in a way that produces results that will help the quality of life of all Americans. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see Senator Harkin is here. Therefore, the managers of the bill are now ready. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I indicated last Saturday on a radio show that if we could get this answer to the American people's prayers this week, I would whistle `Hail to the Chief' in the Senate. 
Well, the rules do not allow that. I am afraid that Senator Byrd would come down and chastise me if I whistle, but let me tell you I am humming `Hail to the Chief' to the American people today because we have accomplished an awful lot in reaching the agreement on these two major bills. 
I was reading an article last night entitled, `O Ye of Little Faith,' and it made me think about what we have gone through the last few weeks. I just have to ask the Senate this morning, how many of us really, really thought we were going to get this done and that we were going to get it done this week? Even 1 week ago there were those who were saying, `Oh, no, you can't get that done before we go out for the August recess. Wait until September; we will do it then.' 
But we persisted. We just kept saying we can get through this. We can do this together. We can do the right thing for the American people, and we can do it now, because it has been a long time coming. 
I think it is appropriate that on both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, and, yes, the President, all are saying this is good for America. 
It is not utopia. It does not solve all the problems. There are some things in here I do not like. There are some things in here that the Senator from New Jersey does not like. But it is a major step forward--maybe not a leap but a major step forward. We are doing some things we promised the American people, things that really matter. It matters that we are going to get to a balanced budget, and this time it is with honest numbers. We are really going to do it. And for a lot of reasons we may do it before the year 2002. This is the type of commitment that I have not seen in the Congress in a bipartisan way in the 25 years that I have had the honor of serving the people of Mississippi. So I think we should declare this is a very important step forward. It is worth having. 
I was doing an interview yesterday and somebody said: Well, not enough in the tax bill, not enough tax relief. Why wasn't there more? Why didn't you insist on this? Why didn't you insist on that? 
I have a simple question. Is some tax relief better than no tax relief? There are those who would rather have nothing if they cannot get everything. Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues in the Senate, these bills are worth having. I am proud to say that I worked on it for 8 months of my life. This past Saturday night and Sunday morning, I thought we had lost it. I was boiling inside. I was disturbed. I was hurt that we were going to let this moment get away from us. But I guess maybe after a Sunday morning of reflection and prayer, we said, no, we are going to do this. And so we did. The President made a commitment. He wanted to get it done. The leadership in the Congress, House and Senate, Republican and Democrat, wanted to get it done, and that is why we just did it. We went ahead and 
did it. 
Let me say to my colleagues here today, there are so many I want to thank and congratulate for this step forward, but I have to begin with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. None of us has worked longer, none of us has contributed more, none of us knows more about what is in this bill than Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico. He has been my confidante. He has been my trusted ally. He has done this when, in his own personal life, he has had problems to worry about. And so I know that the President, the Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the aisle, want to say thanks a lot, Pete. You did a great job for your country. 
His colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Lautenberg, could have walked away from this. Even at the last moment, something he cares about tremendously, guaranteeing we get the Amtrak funds--it is in there, but with a condition--he could have said, if I can't get what I want, I am not going to do this. 
He is not going to do that. He is going to do what is right for his State and the country. 
My colleague, Tom Daschle, from South Dakota, yesterday said some very nice things about my efforts, and I have to say the same about him. He was reliable. He was honest with me. He stayed the course. He came to the meetings. There were some meetings he didn't get to come to. A lot of people had an opportunity to get their egos hurt, but everybody rose above it. 
Pat Moynihan, Finance Committee, bipartisan effort. We reported one of these bills, I think it was 18 to 2, the other one 20 to nothing, out of the Finance Committee, but it began with Bill Roth, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and the Senator from New York. They made up their minds they were going to get it done, and they were going to do it together, and the rest of us could come along if we wanted. Our scholar Senator helped lead the way. 
I have to say again about Bill Roth, patience, tenacity, he was not going to relent on getting this job done. And the Finance Committee had both of these bills. No other committee in Congress had to do it that way. In the House, it was Ways and Means and Commerce Committee as well as Budget. Over here, it was just Budget and Finance. He did a great job. We would not have what we have in the tax bill on IRA's; we would not have what we have on Amtrak; we would not have what we were able to get on a myriad of issues in this legislation. He did a fantastic job. 
I could go on down the list, but it truly is a bipartisan effort, and I am proud of that. Some people say, `Why don't you draw the line and fight?' I have done that. Sometimes it is fun, but it doesn't produce anything but a fight most of the time. 
So there will be another day to differentiate between the parties, but today we are going to do what is right for the country. This bill is rightly called the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It contains literally hundreds of positions that will get us to that balanced budget. But the bottom line is, it is something the American people have been waiting to hear for many years. We will have a balanced budget by the year 2002 and thereafter. 
How is that accomplished? Well, it does have spending reductions of approximately $270 billion over 5 years. It has $140 billion in restraint on appropriated accounts. It has $132 billion in entitlements and net interest savings. It does provide help for children's health, and that is a bipartisan effort. 
Most of us are parents. Most of us have children in our States who are not covered. We disagree about how much we should pay for it, how much should be done, but it is something we care about and we should do. And we get it done in this bill. 
Now, we give as much flexibility as we can to the States, and that is the way it should be. I have faith in my own Governor and my own legislature. I want these decisions to be made as close to the people that need this help, as close to the children as possible. What they need in West Virginia may be different from what they need in Arizona. Give that flexibility so that the decisions are close to the people and so it is provided in a way that will really provide the help it should. 
I want to make this important point about Medicare. We are going to improve Medicare. We are going to save Medicare from going insolvent for another several years at way out to, I believe, close to the year 2007 probably, and we are going to do it with flexibility. We are going to give the seniors a chance to choose. They can go with the old system; they can go with an HMO; they can go with a professional services organization; they can have medical savings accounts. 
We have done what we have been arguing about for 4 years. We are actually doing it. We are doing what we said we were going to do in Medicare and that alone, what we are doing in Medicare alone is worth voting for this legislation. What other problems you may have with this bill--some of the changes in welfare, I think, go the wrong direction; we really want to get people from welfare to work. This bill has some problems, but just the Medicare provision makes it worthwhile. 
We have some savings in Medicaid. The States will have a greater ability to deliver health services more efficiently for poor persons. When you look through the list of things that we have done here, in instance after instance, I think we should be very proud. 
I am here today to tell you that I am going to vote for this legislation with pride, not with fear and trepidation, not with reservations or grumpiness because I didn't get everything I wanted, but because the process worked. Our system of Government worked here like I think our forefathers intended for it to work, and we are going to produce genuine results that will be of benefit. In this bill and in the other bill we will pass for our children our educational system in America, child health care, the guarantee of the important programs that we want for our seniors. From the day we are born to the day we die, there will be benefits coming out of this legislation. 
So I urge my colleagues, let us make this an overwhelming vote. I think we will have as near to a unanimous vote as you will ever get in the Senate on a bill of this magnitude, a bill of this size. I think when we vote on it, it is going to pass overwhelmingly. Then we are going to go to the tax relief package, which I am tremendously excited about. 
I am glad to have been a part of this effort. It has been worthwhile. It has been long. It has been tedious. It has tried my patience. I lost my temper a few times, along with others, and for those occasions I apologize. But we got it done, and we will have more decisions made by the people at the State level; we will have genuine tax relief; we will have security for our seniors, and now and then we can move on and address other problems that we need to take up for the future of our country. 
I thank the Chair and I thank all Senators for what you have done on this.

Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to offer clarification to the Chairman of the Amtrak authorizing Committee. As members know, we have spent significant congressional time working to develop comprehensive Amtrak reform and reauthorization legislation. As Members further know, I worked for 2 years on a bipartisan reform package in the 104th Congress. Senator Hutchison has picked up this legislation effort and has worked diligently to advance the process. However, we cannot justify new Federal subsidies for Amtrak unless we also fix the many impediments imposed by statute which prevent Amtrak from operating like a business. Comprehensive reforms in the areas of Amtrak operations, labor, and liability must be enacted if we are serious about addressing Amtrak's financial crisis. Amtrak cannot survive without these fundamental changes. Money alone will not address Amtrak's systemic problems.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for yielding me this time and thank him for his great work. I talked about that this morning in relation to the balanced Budget Act, but I think it is even more appropriate that I commend him for his diligence, patience, persistence, leadership, his bipartisan effort. He did a great job on this legislation. I am extremely proud of him and I think he should feel proud. Also Senator Moynihan, for his cooperation and for the way he approaches his legislative responsibilities, we thank him. Without his being willing to support this we would not have had the 80 votes that we had when the bill passed the Senate a month ago. To the Senator in the Chair, the Senator from New Mexico, his imprint is over both these bills; all over them. I thank him for that. 
This morning I was satisfied with our action on the balanced budget. I was pleased we got it done. I thought it was an important thing to do and that we should get it done and move forward and reach a balanced budget with honest numbers. 
But, with this bill I am enthusiastic, I am really excited about what this legislation does. It is going to help our children with the tax credits and education provisions. I feel good about the education provisions. Some people say, `Well I don't like that part or the other part.' Education is about the future of America, and we put some of the President's provisions in there but we put some others in there that will help our children have a better access to community colleges and universities and colleges. It is worthwhile and I am proud of that. 
A lot of young people, young business men and women are going to benefit from this. My own son, a young entrepreneur, will benefit from it. And even he was excited, the other night, when I told him what was in this bill. Nothing makes a father prouder than for his own son to say, `Dad, this will help me to create some more businesses and hire some more people.' He has 60 young people working for him now. This is what the American dream is all about: Investors, savers, farmers, small business men and women, spouses, and seniors. This is one that really does what we said it was going to do, and we got it done. I am very proud of it. 
This is the first significant tax cut for working Americans in 16 years. It is long overdue. Taxes are too high in my opinion. The Tax Code is obviously too complex and complicated. The IRS is too intrusive in our lives and everybody knows it. Congressional Republicans and a lot of Democrats wanted to do more than just talk about tax relief, they wanted to get it done. We wanted to deliver and we wanted to provide this legislation. We picked up considerable bipartisan support and came together in a way that I have not seen the Senate come together in the years that I have been in the Senate, certainly as majority leader. It was a good feeling. We went out on the steps of the Capitol and said we had done this job for the American people. I thought it was constructive and thoughtful, and I was very proud of it. 
The President also supports this bill. I am glad that he has supported this tax package and the tax relief that we are giving to the American people. He insisted that some parts of it be dropped. I was very disappointed in that. But we insisted on some things that he didn't want to go along with. As I said repeatedly, we gave ground on both sides, but we found common ground in many instances. 
I was particularly concerned, though, about one provision that we had to drop, the so-called Coverdell amendment that would have allowed for an education IRA to be used to pay for education from K through high school, for elementary and secondary. Yes, I like the fact that we are helping community college opportunities for our children, and universities and colleges. But the truth of the matter is, the problem in education in America is not at the higher education level. Our higher education system in America is a good one. It is broad, it is diverse, there is lots of choice. The problem is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Why shouldn't a parent, who can now put $500 in the Roth education IRA opportunity, be able to take some of that money to help their children in the fourth grade with some tutoring, so they can learn to read better, or to get help with remedial arithmetic? Why shouldn't a parent be able to do that? I think they should, and I am very sorry that we had to drop this from the package. But the President insisted that this not be allowed because, he said, it would undermine public education. I don't want to do that. I am a product of public education. My mother is a public education schoolteacher. So there were some disappointments along the way. But there is a lot of good in this bill. 
Everybody can declare a victory in being for this, because the American people, the American family will benefit from this legislation. Three years ago, congressional Republicans promised the American people a $500-per-child tax credit to help them save for the future or to meet the costs of raising a family in today's world. We kept that promise. And along the way, the Democrats got involved. They put their imprint on it. But the main thing is they are going to get this help. Parents with children will get some help to do things for their own children. I think we should be proud of that. 
At the start of this Congress I urged that the Republican conference introduce, as our first bill, a bill to help families with the needs for education and for college costs. S. 1, the first bill that was introduced this year, our highest priority, was in education. The legislation before us today incorporates many of those tax provisions. 
If American families are looking for someone to thank, they need to look to further than the sponsors and the leaders of this legislation, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan. They really did a great job. They brought us together and they produced the final package that we are voting on here today. 
Amazing as it seems, we have been willing to resist some of the criticisms that we should not give tax relief for working Americans. We have done it here. We have kept our promises. I think it is going to be good for the economy. Allow the people, allow our people in this country to make some decisions of how they will help their own children, when it comes to the tax credit, and for education. Let them decide how they will use their money to pay for education. 
We are making individual retirement accounts available to almost everybody, especially homemakers. We have that up, now, so they can put in $2,000 like everybody else. Why shouldn't they be able to? But they had not been able to in the past. Now homemakers have this opportunity, just like everybody else, to have this IRA. 
We are reducing the unfair tax on capital gains, including homeowners. That alone is going to help fire up the economy even more, foster job creation and expand opportunity for every willing worker. 
So, this is an important package. But I want the taxpayers of America to understand this. It is only a downpayment. It is not Utopia. It's not everything we would like to do. It doesn't make the Tax Code a lot less complicated. In fact, it maybe goes the other way. But it's a step in the right direction. It provides help where it is needed and there will be another day for us to have a fairer Tax Code. So, it is the kind of legislation that we need. We have come together to pass it. It will provide extensive tax relief. Tax reform will be something we will do another day. 
But we have done a good job here, and I urge my colleagues to rally round the banner of lower taxes and economic growth and join me in sending 
America's tax cut to the President for his signature. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

I think we should do that and, if I have to, I will begin a cloture proceeding the week we come back because I think this reform is very important.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is the second time this week I have been blocked from trying to move to consideration of critical FDA reform legislation. 
This bill, the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act, would ensure that patients and consumers have prompt access to safe and effective products, including prescription drugs, medical devices, and foods. 
It would streamline the FDA bureaucracy, which has spun dangerously out of control in recent years. And, it would reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. 
I am greatly disappointed that this bill is being held hostage by a small number of Senators. This legislation enjoys strong bipartisan support. It passed the Labor Committee by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 4. 
Since the bill passed committee on June 18, supporters of FDA reform have tried repeatedly to address the concerns of these four opponents. In fact, supporters of reform have made an additional 30 concessions in the bill since it was reported from committee. 
Cosponsors of the bill, Democrat and Republican alike, met with Senator Kennedy this morning in a last ditch effort to convince him to let the bill go forward. Despite the bill's strong bipartisan support and despite these additional compromises, he refused. 
This legislation is too important to be held hostage. As such, I intend to bring the committee-passed FDA reform bill to the floor in September. If necessary, I will file cloture to ensure that this important piece of business for the health of the American people is completed in a timely manner.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before leaving for the August recess, I want to address the Senate briefly on the matter of the vacancy in the Office of the Comptroller General. The General Accounting Office is a vital organization to the Congress, and the person selected to head the GAO must have the confidence of both the majority and minority. When a vacancy occurs, a commission is established by statute to consider and recommend candidates to the White House. The members of this commission are the President pro tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, and the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
Members should be advised that this group has been organized on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, and we are moving forward. Based on the precedent of alternating between Houses, I will serve as chairman of the commission, with the Speaker of the House serving as vice chair. The Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over the General Accounting Office, and I have asked Senator Thompson and his staff to manage the administrative tasks of the commission. There are a number of candidates to start, but Senator Daschle joins me today in putting all Members on notice that we are open to recommendations. If you know of someone interested in being considered for the position, please advise me, the minority leader, Senator Thompson, or Senator Glenn at the Governmental Affairs Committee, as soon as possible to ensure that the commission has an opportunity to consider all qualified candidates.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize two young people who served on my staff through all the long hours and difficult days of the last year. 
After I was elected majority leader, the next morning at 9 o'clock, I was in the majority leader's office, but I only had about a third or half of the staff that I needed. I had some interns from my State of Mississippi, some college students, who had been working with me just through the summer. I asked them to stay and help us, and they have been with me the last year. 
They filled positions that are very vital. They did a great job. 
Dan Dukes of Como, MS, has been like my alter ego. He has been with me throughout the day and, on occasions, when I had to go downtown, he has just done a fantastic job. 
He has been my personal assistant, shepherding my appointments, finding my lost notebooks, and keeping up with my headlong dashes from meeting to meeting. 
Dan has had the patience of a saint and the attention to detail of a seasoned Hill staffer. It is an understatement to say that I will miss him as he returns home to finish his studies at the University of the South in Sewanee, TN. 
This is one of those occasions when we say goodbye to a young man with every expectation that we will be seeing him often--and hearing about him too. I have the same feeling about him as I once had about a youngster on my staff by the name of Chip Pickering, who now represents the Third District of our State. 
I want to express to him publicly my appreciation for filling in the way he did and doing a great job. 
I also want to recognize Celeste Embrey of Southaven, MS, who has been one of the two receptionists in my front office who answered the thousands of calls that have come in, some of them not always very complimentary. She has done it with just charm and grace. In fact, she does just a great job that the President of pro tempore, the Senator from South Carolina, comes by to check on her several times each week to make sure she is doing all right. She appreciates that, and I appreciate that. 
Even my colleagues who do not know her by name know well her unfailing smile, her enthusiastic greeting, her ability to make everyone feel at home. 
If you have enjoyed the atmosphere of true southern hospitality in my office, you have Celeste to thank. But you cannot fully appreciate what she has done for us until you overhear her conversations with callers--whether from Mississippi or around the country. 
She has always dealt with their questions and handled their complaints with a concern and patience that go well beyond the call of duty. 
Celeste is off to graduate school, and though there will soon be another person at her desk in my outer office, there will still be a void in our staff. I will have to get her new phone number so that any of us who miss the brightness of her welcome and the cheer of her voice can keep in close touch. 
Dan and Celeste are the kind of young people who keep up our faith in the rising generation. I am proud of them. I hope they will always be proud to have been part of the Lott team. 
I want to say to these two very fine young people, I really appreciate their work. I am proud of them, and I wish them Godspeed in whatever they do in the years to come.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of all Senators on both sides of the aisle, as we have cleared these lists. When we get through today, we hope to have cleared most of the Executive Calendar. We have some that are still being held for matching nominations, some reservations on both sides. But when we get through here, I believe we will have cleared all that is on the calendar, except maybe those that have just been reported today and maybe just eight or nine others that we are still working on. 
I appreciate, again, the support that we have had from Senators on both sides and from the Democratic leader. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: Nos. 121 through 127, 133, 134, 166 through 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175 through 178, 179, 182 through 185, 201, 203, 204, 205 through 223, 225 through 232, and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the Foreign Service. 
I finally ask consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of George Munoz, to be president of OPIC. I understand that before the Senate confirms the above nominations, there are several Senators who may like to speak. 
I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session. 
I might note, Mr. President, we are still trying to clear some other nominations. There may be another opportunity before the night is over to clear some other nominations. Some of these nominations did not actually get reported from the committees until today. We are scrambling to try to see if we can get them confirmed so they can begin their service during the August recess. Therefore, that completes my unanimous consent request.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to object to that request. But I note to the Senator from South Dakota--again, I understand why he would need to make that request. And I appreciate his cooperation. I observe that we have moved several judges in this group of nominations, some of them that have been pending literally back to last year, including some circuit judges, and that there are only four remaining that are on the calendar. I think we can maybe clear some more, one or two more of those early when we come back in session. 
I think a couple of them, we may have to call them up and have a vote. I am prepared to call them up and have debate and a vote on them as we did with regard to Mr. Klein at the Justice Department. I think that these holds can only last so long. And we have to call them up and have a vote one way or the other. 
The other nominations were only reported today. I think there are several of them that we can do quickly. A couple of them I know there is no problem with, but there are some others we just have not had a chance to discuss with the chairman and run them through our hotline and get them cleared. But we will be down to very few of these judges. And I hope to keep moving along as they come out of committee, including the ones that we moved here today. I believe they included the four I mentioned, and maybe there is one other one in sort of a unique category that we did approve. But we will keep working on it. And something more may even happen before the night is out. We will see how that goes.

Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to thank all the Senators for their cooperation. I know this is kind of like `school's out' for a break, and we are taking advantage of the opportunity to say good-bye to each other and enjoy the district and State work period. But I want to thank all the Senators for the tremendous cooperation we have seen here in the last 2 weeks. I do not know that I have seen it any better since I have been in the Senate. 
We have already moved 10 appropriations bills. We are going to try to get lined up to start on the 11th one right when we come back. We have passed these two very important bills, the Balanced Budget Act and the Tax Relief Act. It took a lot of cooperation on both sides of the aisle. 
I want to thank my counterpart on the Democratic side of the aisle, Senator Daschle. He is a pleasure to work with. I think we have a relationship that is important for the Senate; that we be able to talk to each other and work with each other in honesty and frankness. We are going to continue to do that. 
Before we leave, we are going to work on doing as much as we can, and I think it is going to be substantial on the Executive Calendar. So I just want to thank Senator Daschle and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work. 
If we could keep this pace going, I think the American people would be very pleased, and maybe they would feel very good about our Senate and what we are trying to do. 
So thank you very much for your cooperation. 
I would be glad to yield to the Democratic leader.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I expected that I would get this question, and I don't have a time that I could give. I must say that the Governmental Affairs Committee is working right now and looking into potential campaign violations, and what happened in the last election. I think for us to proceed before we even get the completion of that work would be premature. Regarding the last election, we ought to know what laws have been broken and how they were broken. I don't have a date in mind. 
I am sure I have been told by several Senators that this issue will come up sometime soon. I understand that. I hope that we will be patient and take our time and maybe even see at some point if we could not do something in this area in a bipartisan way. But I understand what the Senator from Massachusetts has said. He indicated he is going to bring it up at some point. I am sure that will happen. We don't have any time scheduled on that at this point. 
When we come back, the focus will be on the three remaining appropriations bills that we have not passed, the conference reports that we must pass, and pending legislation we must pass, including ISTEA, the highway transportation legislation, which expires at the end of September. We have a lot of very serious work to do of interest to the Nation's Capital, to the people in America, including the Interior appropriations bill, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, as well as the ISTEA bill. But there is time to look at these matters. I am sure they will be considered appropriately as we move into the fall.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I stand here today with my friend and colleague Senator Daschle, the minority leader, to introduce an important public safety bill. I am also joined by initial cosponsors Senators Shelby, Rockefeller, Warner, Robb, Inhofe, Inouye, Cochran, and Conrad. 
The Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act is designed to protect a very important component of America's infrastructure--our underground infrastructure. With roots going back several Congresses, this legislation enjoys widespread bipartisan support and is supported by several members of the Senate's Committee for Commerce, Science and Transportation--the committee of jurisdiction. This legislation provides a public policy statement which is long overdue. The legislation is still a work in progress and I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle and on the Commerce Committee to further fine-tune this bill as the process moves forward. 
America's underground infrastructures contain many buried communication and fiber optic cables, water and sewer pipes, electric lines, and oil and gas pipelines. All too often people inadvertently damage these facilities causing harmful consequences. Often a nick or a bump which goes unreported can, over time, become a problem and have a delayed harmful effect. 
Mr. President, this bill is important because it will prevent some of the damage to underground facilities that causes accidents across America. These accidents often are caused by excavation without notice or by inaccurate markings of our underground facilities. This damage to the infrastructure may cause environmental harm and disrupt essential services and even cause injuries and fatalities. 
I am not here today to condemn those who excavate. I am here today to say that one-call safety legislation is necessary because many excavation accidents are preventable. 
Mr. President, America needs a single, nationwide system to forward excavators' toll free calls to the appropriate State or local one-call center. To delay further is to unnecessarily jeopardize America's underground infrastructure. 
Let me make it clear this is not a new idea. It is a concept that has been embraced by many States. Already 49 States have some form of a one-call system on the State level. I am proud to say my State of Mississippi has a one-call system; however, many of these systems can be improved with Federal assistance. Our bill does that. 
This bill uses an approach that will create uniform national standards and provide grants to establish or improve State one-call systems. This bill does not dictate how a one-call system should operate or how a State's law should be written. On the contrary, it requires input from States and stakeholders before developing operational best practices and gives States the latitude to continue to determine the details of its one-call statute. This analysis will serve as the catalyst for a national effort to improve State one-call programs. 
Mr. President, the administration also recognizes the necessity for a one-call safety statute. When the President introduced his method for the reauthorization of America's Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, he included a one-call provision. Our bill is different, but it is compatible. In addition to working with my initial cosponsors during the drafting phase, I have worked with the administration to address their concerns. We are not done yet, but we are committed to continuing the dialog. The introduction of our bill is the Senate's first step. 
By introducing the legislation today, we hope the congressional recess will be used by organizations and stakeholders who have an interest in this policy to enter into the discussion. It is the desire of the initial sponsors to include those with an interest in this public safety policy in preparing the legislation for a committee hearing. 
This bill sets out broad minimum standards for State one-call programs. There is flexibility for States to determine who will participate and how enforcement will occur. The legislation is not proscriptive. Rather, it identifies the goals. The foundation for our approach is the understanding that the level of risk varies with each type of excavation activity as well as the type of organization which conducts the excavation work. The bill will offer State grants for those States who want to participate. A study will also be conducted to identify the best practices for one-call centers and to promote adoption of the most successful solutions. 
Mr. President, this bill is neither a mandate nor unfunded. I want to repeat this. There is no mandate that every State must participate. We are simply proposing the authorization of sufficient funds to study State activities and to administer assistance to States wanting to participate. 
I expect those industries which place a premium on operational convenience will recognize that one-call is responsible and a small price to pay for ensuring safety of the public and environment. I am optimistic that all affected parties will work in genuine partnership with us to finalize the legislation rather than sit on the sidelines and criticize. 
Mr. President, the information highway offers many opportunities and challenges for our society and culture but, it too can be put in a peril by simple events. Just 2 weeks ago an article in the Washington Post reported that for half a day the Internet and long distance communications on one carrier were disrupted by a backhoe cutting through a fiber optic cable. 
Let us also not forget the death of an 84-year-old woman in Indianapolis, IN last week where a blast leveled seven homes. The Indianapolis Star/News said the explosion turned the quiet subdivision `into a living Hell. The blast turned trees and utility poles into impromptu candles and sent chunks of earth raining down as people ran for their lives.' I believe our legislation will play a part in preventing this type of disaster. 
Finally let's not forget the 1994 accident in Edison, NJ where there was a much larger explosion. Significant property damage occurred and again there was loss of life. This event prompted one of our former colleagues and the senior Senator from New Jersey to actively work for tougher laws governing America's infrastructure. Former New Jersey Senator, Bill Bradley and Senator Frank Lautenberg were actively involved in seeking a legislative solution and today's bill is a direct result of their efforts. 
I am convinced that this Congress will champion meaningful safety reforms and leadership for America's underground infrastructure. It will not be a traditional big government approach. It will help provide adaptable, convenient, accountable, meaningful and overdue protection for citizens. 
I want to thank my colleagues for their attention, and I hope they will join us as cosponsors. 
Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text and summary of the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act be entered into the Record.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, it is my hope that the Senate will be able to make a great deal of progress this week. We have a number of votes that already have been agreed to and we have several bills that we may be able to consider before the week is out. 
Today it had been my understanding that we would be able to begin consideration of S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. I understand that there would be an objection to proceeding to that measure at this time. I certainly regret that. I don't understand why that is the case. I had been told on Friday that, after a lot of laborious negotiations, agreement had been reached. 
Certainly we need to pass this legislation. There are very few organizations in this city that are more in need of reform than the FDA which, for years, has been bureaucratic; it has been dilatory; it has delayed access for the American people to medical procedures that clearly should have been approved earlier, that are available in other countries, including Great Britain; they delayed approval of drugs that could mean a great deal of comfort to Americans. At the same time, they have been over trying to push into other areas where they really have no business. So, to say the least, I have a very low regard for the FDA, and they are long overdue for reform. 
This legislation has been pending in the Senate both last year and this year. The chairman of the committee of education and labor has reported that bill out. Negotiations have been 
underway with a number of Senators, including Senator Mack, Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, and I presume Senator Durbin, and I thought that all had come to resolution. But it appears now that we will not be able to go forward with it at this time. But we will continue to look for an opportunity to get that done this week. 
As all Senators are aware, this is the last week of legislative business prior to the August adjournment for our State work periods. There are a number of important issues that will be considered this week, including the conference reports on the budget, Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the Tax Relief Act. I get a lot of inquiries about that, will we do it or not? Have we reached an agreement with the administration or not? 
Negotiations continue; they continued throughout the weekend. There were communications on Friday, meetings on Saturday, a number of communications back and forth between the Congress and the administration all through the day yesterday, all the way up until about 9:15 or 9:30 last night, and there are negotiations underway now with the exchange of paperwork as to exactly what these issues may mean. Some of them are pretty complicated, in terms of the formulas that will be used--how do you define a benefits package where the States and the Governors and the legislators have the maximum flexibility in providing the services for the needs of the children in their respective States? But I would have to say, I think we are very close. I continue to be relatively optimistic. 
I must say, this agreement on both the spending bill and the tax relief package is worth having. I hope we will continue to try to come to a conclusion today, if at all possible. 
We will be completing work also this week on the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill as well as the Department of Transportation appropriations bill. 
Previous agreement was entered into also last week to complete action on S. 39, the tuna-dolphin bill, early this week. So we expect that sometime in the next 2 days we will have a 30-minute time for debate and possibly a recorded vote, but a vote of some sort on the compromise that was worked out on that issue last Friday. 
At 5 p.m. this afternoon, the Senate will begin consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill. We hope to get most of the work done on that appropriations bill tonight, done tonight. There will be no rollcall votes today. 
Tomorrow morning the Senate will be scheduled to have a series of votes, or we were scheduled to have a series of votes with debate beginning at 8:30 and votes occurring, I believe, beginning at 9:30, on the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill, but we understand that there is a memorial service for Justice Brennan that will be held on Tuesday morning, so it may be necessary to delay these votes and, as always, Members will be notified exactly when that will be. There will be some stacked votes, I don't know right now whether it's 2, 3, or 4, with relation to Commerce, State, Justice. But it will be later in the morning or in the early afternoon, so we can accommodate Senators who would like to attend the memorial service. Then we can complete action on the bill. 
I had hoped we would have agreement on the spending and on the tax relief bill early enough that we could actually get started on it on Tuesday morning. It looks like we will not be able to do that, but we still want to get the final votes on the State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill as soon as we can 
and be prepared to move swiftly to the budget agreements once they are reached. 
I thank all Senators for their cooperation. I know this will be, again, a hectic week. But I believe we can complete 2 more appropriations bills which will put us at 10, leaving only 3 that we would have to work on when we return in September. That is an incredible pace, and I am very pleased with the cooperation that we have had in getting that done. I hope we can continue that. We also, again, hope to complete action on two or three other bills; most important, the budget agreements. When that is completed, of course, we would then have an opportunity to turn to the Executive Calendar also. 
Mr. President, I would like to hear from the distinguished Senator from Vermont as to what is the state of negotiations regarding the Food and Drug Administration reform package. I know he has worked very hard on it. We hope to get that done this week. I would be glad to hear his impressions of how we are going to do that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I support Senate Resolution 98, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the Global Climate Change Treaty submitted by Senators Byrd and Hagel and supported by nearly two-thirds of the Senate. Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have many serious concerns about the economic impact that this treaty would have on our Nation. 
By adopting this amendment, the Senate will be exercising its constitutional role of advising the executive branch as part of a treaty process. The President should take this resolution as a serious and constructive step in the treaty process. 
Before we take another step toward ratification, I believe that the Senate must insure that the economic impact and inequity of this international agreement be fully aired for the American people. 
As written, this legally binding treaty would require the United States and other developed countries to reduce their carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010. In order to meet these targets, the United States would either have to issue new regulations or levy huge taxes on all fossil fuels in proportion to their carbon contents. Economists have suggested that stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels with a tax could cut America's gross domestic product by $350 billion. Further regulations would likely take even billions more from our economy. 
And what would the developing nations contribute? 
What would our neighbors in Mexico have to do to help stop global warming? Nothing. 
What about other so-called developing nations like Korea, China, India, and Brazil? 
The treaty lets them off the hook. 
Mr. President, this is not an equitable international policy. 
This is not a level playing field for the United States. 
Simply put, I believe the United States should not ratify this treaty as it stands. 
I do not believe that this Nation has been a bad actor when it comes to characterizing our environmental public policy. In fact, I believe America has already set the example. An example which all Americans have through their taxes and prices on many commodities has already paid for. Unless all the citizens of the globe are involved, there is a clear inequity. 
Mr. President, this does not mean I do not want to address the issue of curtailing carbon emissions. 
It means that we should only participate in a fair, balanced equitable agreement where all nations must participate. 
Is there such a thing as global warming? 
We must admit that there is no consensus among scientists about the validity of this theory. While some cry that the polar ice caps are melting as we speak, others point out that the lower atmosphere has shown no statistically significant warming in the past 19 years. 
I do not believe this is the place to launch a debate on the quality of the scientific data. I simply point out that the science is not settled or certain. So why rush into signing a legally binding and economically damaging international agreement? 
This much is certain--in order for America to reach the treaty's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010, the United States will have to reduce their fossil fuel use by at least 25 percent. 
How do those who advocate this treaty think this will impact our country? 
Mr. President, let me give my colleagues some illustrations of what our Nation could face: First, energy taxes on energy use which would reduce economic growth by nearly 
3 percent annually, increasing consumer costs by $110 billion; second, the loss of under 2 million American jobs, most of which will actually move overseas; and third, harm to the steel, basic chemicals, petroleum refining, aluminum, paper and cement industries, which would be targeted for severe restrictions by the treaty. 
The Byrd-Hagel resolution states that the United States should not be a signatory to any agreement that `would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.' I believe this is a reasonable and responsible action. 
Mr. President, this treaty imposes very serious burdens on our economy with little environmental gain. This is just not a sound public policy. 
I have but one question for those who want to sign the treaty: How can America help the global environment by wreaking havoc and permanent harm on our own economy? 
This administration says that the United States--all alone--should decrease its energy use for 40 years before the developing nations are required to participate. There is no guarantee that these developing nations will be any more interested in curtailing their energy use then than they are now. Today, China is accelerating its use of fossil fuels, and by 2015, will likely pass the United States in total carbon emissions. Is it fair to let them off the hook now while we are subject to such stringent regulation? 
The Byrd-Hagel resolution would require developing nations to comply with the same regulations at the same time in the same treaty as the United States. This is not only equitable, it is the only way that there can be any real benefit to the global environment. 
Mr. President, the debate over global warming is tremendously important to the future of all Americans. The threat of losing 2.5 percent of our GDP will impose enormous hardships on the average consumer. The treaty is essentially an attack on America's life style. 
The United States has already spent more than a trillion dollars to clean the environment. American taxpayers must be assured that any new environmental programs actually provide benefits that outweigh their costs and that are grounded in sound science. At the same time, we must not enter into any international agreement that puts the United States at a significant disadvantage in the global arena. 
Mr. President, I believe the Global Climate Change Treaty is unacceptable as it stands at the very least it needs the Byrd-Hagel correction. 
I would like to thank and commend Senators Byrd and Hagel for their dedicated efforts to educate our colleagues on this issue. I appreciate their leadership and thoughtful consideration of this important international environmental issue. Thank you, Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting the Byrd-Hagel resolution.

For the information of all Senators, in light of this agreement with respect to the tuna-dolphin legislation, the cloture vote was vitiated; therefore, there will be no further votes to occur today. The next votes will occur in stacked sequence on Tuesday, July 29, beginning at 9:30 a.m. 
I want to thank all Senators for their cooperation, especially the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe. She did outstanding work. She did not always receive the type of consideration she should have, but she has risen above that. Without her agreement, this would not have been possible. Also, of course, Senator McCain has been diligent in his work, as always, and also Senator Kerry, who got involved to help us work this out. 
I would like to make sure now that Senator McCain has a chance to speak and put the proper perspective on all of this.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek recognition so we can announce there will be no further rollcall votes tonight. There will be at least one vote tomorrow. And I believe that we can say there will be one vote tomorrow. It will be an important vote. We expect that that vote will be either on the tuna-dolphin issue or, more than likely, under the agreement we are going to propound, it would be on the global warming issue. 
So there would be a vote tomorrow. A time would have to yet be determined exactly what time that would be, but probably not before 10 o'clock in the morning. And then we hope to work out some understandings with regard to State, Justice, Commerce. And then we would probably not have final votes on that until next Tuesday, I believe it would be. 
So that is the point I wanted to announce. There will be at least one vote tomorrow, and no further rollcall votes tonight. We will make an announcement with regard to Monday later on, in a few minutes, or tomorrow, about the situation on Monday.

Mr. LOTT. Unless there is an agreement, there will be a cloture vote on tuna-dolphin, but we are working on an agreement where it may not be in the morning. But we will have one in short order. We are trying to work through all the different players and make sure everybody has been consulted. That is why we are not asking for the UC right now. 
I think I should go ahead and say to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, it would be our intent, because of requests of a number of Senators, and because of the cooperation we have received, that we would not have any recorded votes on Monday. But we are trying to also clear an agreement that the Democratic leader indicated he would like to approve with us to take up the Transportation appropriations bill some time during the day on Monday, but it would not lead to recorded votes. The next recorded vote would be tomorrow, and then Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning under the agreements we are working. But we have not cleared them with everybody at this point. 
With that, at this time, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for finishing expeditiously and for his help on a number of issues throughout the day as we try to get an agreement on how we can proceed for the remainder of the day, and when we can get votes tomorrow and next week. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be the only remaining first-degree amendments in order to S. 1022, and they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments. 
Mr. President, I will submit the list since there are several of them. But everybody has been consulted on this list. The Democratic leadership is aware of it as well as the Members on this side.

I have more to this request, but I want to emphasize what that means. We will complete all of the amendments tonight. The votes on those amendments and final passage will occur next Tuesday beginning the 9:30. 
I further ask that if the Senate has not received the House companion bill at the time of passage of S. 1022, the bill remain at the desk; and I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives the House companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration and all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1022, as amended, be inserted, the House bill then be read a third time and passed and the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees and that S. 1022 be indefinitely postponed.

I think I should clarify this and put it in common language. 
If an agreement is worked out, we will vitiate the cloture vote. I would like to modify that agreement to say that, if an agreement is reached, we will vitiate; then we will take that issue up next week with 30 minutes of debate and a vote next week, unless a voice vote would be agreed to for tomorrow or next week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I realize it gets a little confusing on how we are lining these up. But I think it is being helpful to all Senators. I think it is allowing us to complete the debate and get votes and move important legislation forward in the best way possible. 
So the way we are getting it racked up, so to speak, I think is good for the Senate, and we are trying to do the right thing. 
So I would like to modify that earlier request to this extent: 
That we come in in the morning and go immediately at 9:30 to the global-warming bill. That bill is Senate Resolution 98. I ask consent that there be 2 hours of debate on the resolution equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member or their designees with the only amendments in order to be the following: Kerry amendment adding specific negotiating positions; Senator Byrd's amendment, relevant. 
I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above-mentioned amendments and the expiration or yielding back of time for debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the resolution with no intervening action or debate, and, if the resolution is agreed to, the preamble then be agreed to, which means that the final vote on global warming would occur around 11:30 tomorrow morning.

I am pushing this issue at the request of the President of the United States. I think it is a good conservation policy.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to recognize the work of Mr. Mark Lacovara, who has retired after more than 27 years' employment in the Senate. 
Mark came to the Senate in 1969 as a reference assistant in the Senate Library and has since served in various capacities with the Official Reporters of Debates, the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate, and administrative services. The position from which he leaves us is that of assistant Journal clerk. 
To those of us who are a part of the Senate, Mark's regard for this institution is well-known and highly valued. Such dedication is no doubt rooted in his early years. Mark grew up in the Washington, DC, area and observed his father, the late John Lacovara, in service as the Senate's Republican Deputy Sergeant at Arms. Mark began employment with the Senate as a young man of 18. As he worked, he also earned a college degree and served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. 
Mark has been committed to the best interests of the Senate and to the United States throughout his career. This is evident in both the quality of his work and his enthusiasm for it. 
I want to thank Mark for his outstanding service in the U.S. Senate; we will miss him. I'm certain my colleagues join me in expressing appreciation and in wishing him well.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 3 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. We made great progress on appropriations bills last week and I hope that will continue. As a matter of fact, we completed action on four bills and completed everything on the fifth appropriations bill except for a vote on an amendment or amendments and final passage. So I ask all Members' cooperation in working with the chairmen of the remaining appropriations bills to enable us to finish each of these measures in a timely manner. We are hoping that we can complete the bill that we brought over last week, the Treasury, Postal Service, with votes this afternoon. As I said, we will begin the VA-HUD and will consider agriculture, military construction, and even State, Justice, Commerce this week. 
So I remind all Senators that at 5:15 today we will temporarily set aside the VA-HUD appropriations bill and resume consideration for final passage and, I believe, one amendment we have pending on the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill. Senators can expect, at 5:15, a series of rollcall votes on or in relation to those amendments on Treasury, Postal Service, and then final passage. Following those votes, I encourage Members who have amendments to the VA-HUD appropriations bill to remain and offer their amendments this evening so we can make progress also on that measure. 
There are 2 weeks remaining for business prior to the August recess period. There are a number of appropriations bills now available, and the committee will be reporting additional bills tomorrow. It is my hope that the Senate will be able to finish action on many, if not all, of these. Obviously, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and his ranking member, Senator Byrd, are doing an excellent job in getting these bills through the subcommittees of appropriations and through the full committee. So we can perhaps also have conference reports available soon, in September, on appropriations bills, and we will have, hopefully in short order, conference reports agreed to which accompany the Tax Fairness Act and the balanced budget amendment, and they will be available later on this week, or certainly early next week. Prior to the recess, we will conclude action on those conference reports. 
Some have suggested that we may not be able to do that, but I think we have made good progress. There has been a lot of work even over the weekend, Senators and Congressmen meeting on both sides of the aisle on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and also with administration officials. I think good progress has been made. Obviously, there are some very important decisions yet to be worked out. But I think we will be ready to be doing that today and tomorrow and maybe even Wednesday if it has to go over to that day. 
I previously announced that S. 39, the tuna-dolphin bill, and the FDA reform bill could be considered this week, and probably at least one will be brought up. On the tuna-dolphin bill, we will begin the process on Wednesday to move toward a cloture vote on Friday, if some other agreement is not worked out. I 
believe the interested parties can work out a compromise that is acceptable to all sides. I know the administration is very interested in getting this legislation considered. I have been called by the President to urge that we schedule this legislation and we come to an agreement. This is an international agreement with regard to tuna and dolphin that has been laboriously worked out by 12 or 13 countries. We should not leave for the August recess without acting on it. We intend to do that. Although I say to one and all, we cannot tie up the Senate for an extended period of time on either one of these issues, FDA reform or the tuna-dolphin bill. 
Needless to say, the remaining sessions during the legislative period will be busy, and Members should expect rollcall votes occurring throughout each day and into the evening if necessary. Senators should be cautious with their scheduling during the next 2-week period as we will attempt to complete these items just mentioned. They should expect votes, obviously, on this Monday and on this Friday. There is even a possibility that we will have to go over in session to Saturday to resolve the State, Justice, Commerce appropriations bill and/or the tuna-dolphin bill. Then we will have votes the following Monday and we will have votes, if necessary, on Friday of next week, so that we can complete action on these two very critical conference reports. But I feel very good about the prospects of doing that. There are those who are concerned right now, can we complete that work. I think the way to do it is just redouble our efforts and develop the attitude that we are going to complete action. I know the President and his administration wants us to get this done before we leave for the August district and State work periods. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the Treasury, Postal Service Subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, for the good work he has done today on this legislation and the cooperation he has received from the ranking member, Senator Kohl. I want to thank the Senate for the work that has been done this week. 
We have completed four appropriations bills and we are down to an identifiable, finite list of amendments on the Treasury, Postal Service bill. It has taken cooperation from all the Senators and a lot of support from the leader on the Democratic side of the aisle. I think we should commend each other when we do good work like this. I appreciate the support we have had. 
In recognition of that, I think rather than trying to drive on to conclusion tonight and perhaps having votes later on tonight, we will go forward tonight with debate on all remaining amendments, and then we will ask unanimous consent to stack the votes beginning at 5:15 on Monday. 
Also, on Monday, we will begin the HUD-VA appropriations bill. For those that are interested, on two other subjects, at the request of a number of Senators on both sides, so that we can try to continue to see if we can work out an agreement, we have moved the tuna-dolphin issue off until next week. We hope an agreement can be worked out, or a compromise. If it cannot be, we will probably have a cloture vote on that on Friday of next week. 
With regard to FDA reform, we have a very good bill that was reported from the education-labor committee. Senator Jeffords has been working with other interested Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the issue. We are hoping that a time agreement can be worked out on that. If we get a time agreement, we will try to take that bill up, perhaps, Tuesday or Wednesday. 
If we get the unanimous-consent request, there would be no further votes tonight or Friday. The next recorded votes would be at 5:15 on Monday. We will resume consideration of the treasury, postal appropriations bill. Earlier today, the managers were able to reach an agreement to limit amendments to that bill--first-degree amendments, I believe. Therefore, the Senate will remain in session this evening until the amendments have been debated. The votes, then, will be postponed to occur until 5:15 on Monday. 
Mr. President, I believe that is all we need to announce at this point, Mr. President. So we can go back to the Treasury, Postal Service bill.

But it is our intent that if we don't get a compromise worked out, we would have a cloture vote on that on Friday of next week.

Mr. LOTT. If I could just say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the suggestion that a good compromise could be worked out. And that is why I have not forced the issue this week. I originally planned to have a cloture vote on Friday, probably. But there were requests that we not do that both from the Senator from California and others. 
I am not interested in trying to make an issue here. This is not an issue I am directly involved in, although it came out of the Commerce Committee, which I serve on. I think it is an important issue, an important conservation issue. It is an issue that affects jobs and fishing areas. Senator Daschle and I both have been receiving calls from the President of the United States saying, please get this legislation up and get it to a conclusion. 
So my desire is to try to be helpful on this one. At the request of the administration, I am looking for a compromise that will allow us to get it completed in a reasonable period of time. But, if we can't do that, then we will just go with the alternative. 
I yield to the Senator from Arizona.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Army officer who has served our Nation with distinction for the past 27 years. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and commend him for his service. 
A native of Brandon, MS, Colonel Owens attended High School in Byram, MS. He graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi, where he was commissioned as a regular Army second lieutenant in June 1970. This foundation, provided by his education and training in Mississippi, began his distinguished national career. 
Colonel Owens has served throughout the world in defense of our Nation's freedom. He served three tours in Europe during the Cold War against the Communist block countries. These tours were served with renowned units including, VII U.S. Corps, 2d Armored Division and 8th Infantry Division (Mechanized). While stationed in the United States, Colonel Owens served with the elite XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He served in Desert Storm with XVIII Airborne Corps, receiving a Bronze Star for his dedicated service. 
Colonel Owens' current and final assignment has been with the U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida as Chief of Personnel. Colonel Owens' magnificent work has ensured our Special Operations Forces personnel who are deployed throughout the world in more than 50 countries are always taken care of and put in the right place at the right time. 
The common thread throughout his 27 years of service has been Colonel Ownes' selfless sacrifice in doing everything he could to take care of the young men and women who served under him as a platoon leader all the way through Brigade Commander. Mr. President, we owe a debt of gratitude to Col. Tom Owens, his wife, Ulrike, son, Steve, and daughter, Audrey, for their many sacrifices during his 27-year Army career. He is a great credit to both the Army and the country he has so proudly served. 
On behalf of the great State of Mississippi and our Nation, I wish him, as a paratrooper and distinguished soldier, `calm winds and soft landings, while keeping his feet and knees into the breeze' as he transitions into life as a civilian. He is a soldier's soldier. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

I have discussed this with the distinguished Democratic leader. I do have one other amendment I have to put in the stack. We may work something out on it, but in case we cannot, we need to have the vote in the morning. 
I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on the Bingaman amendment No. 896 at 9:30 a.m: let me modify that.

We have really been working very well across the aisle to avoid this sort of problem, but I don't think we can resolve it right now. 
So, we can proceed with this vote and see if we can work out an understanding as to how we will proceed later on tonight or in the morning, and we can try the unanimous consent request again after the vote. We cannot assure Senators at this point that there will be no further votes tonight.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment. It requires a modest amount of funds be dedicated to supporting NATO integration costs for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
Earlier this month at Madrid, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization made a historic decision: to invite three former members of the Warsaw Pact to join NATO. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made tremendous progress since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Their economies are free, their militaries are under civilian control, their disputes with their neighbors have been resolved. 
The invitation to join NATO is not a gift--it has been earned by the hard work and sacrifice in each of these three countries. Including them in NATO will change the course of history--no longer will they be at the mercy of stronger neighbors. 
I led a delegation to Europe just before the Madrid summit. We met with NATO officials in Brussels and we went to Budapest, Hungary for a firsthand assessment of that country's progress. We all left convinced that Hungary--like Poland and the Czech Republic--has earned the invitation to become members of the most successful alliance in history. 
In the coming months, the Senate will consider all the issues associated with NATO enlargement. One of the key issues will be the costs--the total cost of enlargement, the U.S. share of that cost, and how that overall cost will be shared with existing and prospective NATO members. 
I believe the costs of enlarging NATO will be manageable. I believe there will be greater costs if we do not enlarge NATO. But the concern over the cost is legitimate. Much of the concern is based on a fear that NATO enlargement will drain a defense budget already under siege--already stretched too thin from humanitarian interventions that have little to do with U.S. national security. 
I believe we should look at ways to finance NATO enlargement from non-defense sources. My amendment today helps pave the way for that approach by earmarking foreign aid funds for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
There is a lot of money in this bill for programs that, in my view, are a lower priority than NATO enlargement. For example, the bill contains $950 million for the International Development Association to make concessional loans to countries like India and China. The bill contains $1.3 billion for development assistance, much of it going to countries where United States strategic interests are far less than in Central Europe. 
My amendment is designed to give maximum leverage to the managers in conference to ensure adequate funds are made available for the three countries invited to join NATO--funds to finance language training, communications modernization, and equipment interoperability. 
Much has been done by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to prepare their military forces for admission into NATO, but much more needs to be done. Meeting these needs will be a major share of the cost of NATO enlargement. 
Chairman McConnell has long been a leader in supporting enlargement of NATO to include new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. His report points out the importance of keeping the NATO enlargement door open, and his bill takes a number of steps to provide reassurance to those not invited in the first wave of enlargement--especially for the Baltic States. 
Adoption of this amendment--with the other provisions in the bill on NATO related issues--will send a strong signal of Senate support financing a key element of enlargement preparation for the Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I thank the managers for their cooperation and I thank Senators Lieberman, Smith of Oregon, Hollings, Shelby, Roth, Biden, DeWine, Coats, Hagel, and Frist for cosponsoring the amendment. I urge support for the amendment.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration of the DOD appropriations bill. I urge all Senators who have amendments to notify the chairman and the 
ranking member. They are here, and they are ready to proceed with this very important legislation. So we need to know what amendments will be offered in order to make substantial progress today. 
Under the previous order, at 6 o'clock this afternoon the Senate will proceed to executive session to conduct a cloture vote on the nomination of Joel Klein to be an Assistant Attorney General at the Justice Department. In accordance with the consent agreement, if cloture is invoked, there will be an additional 3 hours for debate on the nomination before the Senate votes on the nomination of Mr. Klein. That vote may occur tomorrow; therefore, following the cloture vote at 6 p.m., the Senate will resume the Department of Defense appropriations bill. 
As previously announced, it is the hope that the Senate will complete action on three or possibly four major appropriations bills this week. Therefore, late sessions can be expected and votes should be anticipated throughout each day of the Senate this week. We hope to conclude the Department of Defense appropriations bill on Tuesday. We would like to then move to the energy and water appropriations bill. I believe next we would try to go to the foreign ops appropriations bill, and then perhaps Friday we would be ready to go to legislative appropriations. 
In the interim, we also have a couple of bills that we may want to call up for consideration. One of them is a wildlife refuge bill reported overwhelmingly from the House of Representatives and held at the desk; and another one is having to do with dolphin legislation which has been reported from the Commerce Committee. We may look at an opportunity to begin consideration of that legislation on Friday of this week. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it sounds to me as if good progress has been made here, and we are about ready to come to final passage on this very important legislation. I think it is a monumental achievement to be able to move a Department of Defense authorization bill in the way this has been moved and in the time it has been moved. 
Therefore, after this vote, then, it will be the last vote of today. Following the disposition of the DOD authorization bill, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Joel Klein to be an Assistant Attorney General. I expect some debate at the very minimum on that nomination today. The Senate will begin the DOD appropriations bill at 12 noon on Monday and at 3 p.m. on Monday conduct a cloture vote on the Klein nomination. Therefore, the next rollcall vote will occur at 5 p.m. on Monday. I encourage all Members who intend to amend the DOD appropriations bill to be prepared to offer their amendments on Monday. We hope to complete that bill by the close of business or afternoon Tuesday. This will be the final vote this week until Monday. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on Monday, the Senate will debate the DOD appropriations bill. I urge all Senators who have amendments to be present on Monday to offer their amendments. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer is very anxious to get this legislation up and the amendments will be considered and disposed of so we can complete action on this bill as early as possible on Tuesday. 
Under a previous order, at 6 p.m., the Senate will proceed to executive session to conduct a cloture vote on the nomination of Joel Klein, to be an Assistant Attorney General. Therefore, the next rollcall vote will occur at 6 p.m. on Monday, July 14. 
Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of amendments to the DOD appropriations bill. Senators should be aware that next week, the Senate hopes to complete action on four major appropriations bills. That would be perhaps a record if we could complete four, but I think we can do that. If we can get through the Department of Defense appropriations bill at a reasonable hour on Tuesday, we hope to go to energy and water appropriations, and we are hopeful we can maybe take up foreign operations and legislative. In some order, we will work on those bills next week. 
We will expect to be in session and have votes throughout the day and perhaps into the night next week, because we are committed to completing all the appropriations bills, if at all possible, before the end of the fiscal year. I have a commitment from the Democratic leader to work with us in that effort, and we have the support of the administration to complete action on these appropriations bills. There is no need for these bills to be amended endlessly. There is no need for us to delay action on them. We already reached agreement on the overall number, and I know that the committee chairman, Mr. Stevens, from Alaska, is going to be very diligent in his work. These are going to be good bills when they come out of the committee, and there is no need for 100 amendments per bill. I ask my colleagues for their cooperation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we begin the last vote, after consultation with the Democratic leader, I have a unanimous-consent request I would like to make. If we can get this agreed to, we would have this remaining 10-minute vote and then we would go on to debate on the amendments we have identified, with the votes to occur in the morning on these issues at 9:45. 
So I ask unanimous consent that, following the stacked votes, Senator Bingaman be recognized to modify his amendment No. 799, and that there be 30 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that no second-degree amendments be in order and, following the expiration or yielding back of time, a vote occur on or in relation to the Bingaman amendment at 9:45 on Friday.

Mr. LOTT. Part of what we are trying to do is to get an agreement to have debates tonight so we can have votes in the morning at 9:30 or 9:45. I thought there was a need just to have a vote at 9:45. Our intent is to finish the defense authorization bill tomorrow. In order to do that--we understand that, other than the three amendments we may get agreement on tonight, there may be three amendments or so tomorrow. We are going to try to identify those and get time agreements and have the votes so that we can, hopefully, get out of here by 12:30 tomorrow. 
So if the Senator would be willing, we could have the debate tonight and then if you want to, in the morning, come in at 9:30 and have 15 minutes more of the time equally divided, in addition to the 30 minutes tonight, and have the vote at 9:45 because of other considerations, I think that would be a good arrangement.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so the Members will understand fully what the Senator from New Mexico is doing, his amendment, as I understand it, would knock out $118 million, leaving only $28.8 million to be available for the space-based laser program. 
I rise to offer my support for this space-based laser and to oppose the amendment to strike funding of this important program. Clearly, one of the most serious threats facing us today is that of ballistic missiles. As rogue nations or terrorist organizations have the ability to develop more sophisticated means to deploy weapons of mass destruction, it is incumbent upon us, then, to develop the wherewithal to render those threats ineffective. Increasing funding for other programs, as the Senator originally intended, by taking it out of the space-based laser would have been a mistake, and I think to have this kind of cutback down to only $28 million reduces our ability to really develop the sophistication and the degree of the development of the program that we have the capability to reach. 
It is time that we actually do something on this now. We have talked about it, we have had funding, we have had progress made, there has been real development capability reached, yet we continue to sort of shove it off and say, `Someday. Right now this threat is not serious enough.' I maintain it is very serious. 
We currently have no effective defense to counter the ballistic missile threat, particularly in the early launch phases when defensive measures are the most effective. I think the American people would be alarmed if they had an opportunity to stop and think about this, the fact that we have not developed this effective defense to this threat. 
Space-based laser offers potentially one of the most effective solutions to this threat, utilizing relatively mature technologies for boost phase missile defense because we have been working on this, because we have expended funds in this area. So not only does this capability provide an effective protective blanket, but it also serves as a strong deterrent against the launch in the first place, as the boost phase interceptor ensures a destroyed missile falls within the short range of the launch site. So that is a very important factor. It would be a deterrent to launching in the first place, if you knew it might, as a matter of fact, land generally in the area or in the country that fired such a missile. 
This inherent capability offers the initial and most effective defense against ballistic missiles. Coupled with terminal and midcourse defenses that we are now procuring, it provides an architecture that is robust to a wide variety of threats. 
Moreover, the program is achievable, it is achievable, within current technical and political constraints. The program received a very positive endorsement from the Ballistic Missile Defense Office Independent Review Team which has assessed the program as low risk and capable of achieving a 2005 launch goal, yet it is fully compliant with the ABM Treaty. It in no way commits to us an operational system, but it is absolutely essential to the research and development efforts that preserve our option for such a program in the future. 
Space-based laser is clearly the future national missile defense system of choice. It affords us the opportunity to protect the Nation, our military forces and our allies against the ever-growing threat for ballistic missile-deployed weapons of mass destruction. In fact, I think it is the greatest threat that we face today in the world. We cannot ignore it. We should not delay taking actions any further. 
The early boost phase negation potential that spaced-based lasers can provide is essential. It is a critical component of our future national defense. We must ensure that the 
space-based option is carried forward with vigor and a sense of priority. If we cut it down to only $28 million, or something short of $29 million, we are not going to be able to go forward with this mature program in a vigorous way in one that gives it priority. 
By the way, the people we have running this program now are very good and they are doing a good job. They have gotten the Secretary of Defense's attention to this program. So as this technology matures, I think it is clear that we now are at the point where we should build a demonstrator and show that, in fact, it will work. 
I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for the work he has done on this, both in the committee and on the floor. Senator Smith is prepared to debate this issue further. Without his efforts, without his attention, this program would not be where it is today and we would not be able to go forward with it in the way we need to now. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to cut the bulk of the funding for the space laser program. 
Mr. President, I thank the chairman again for his support in this area. This is something we clearly should be doing. I hope the amendment will be defeated. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin-McCain amendment and in support of the Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment. Before I speak on the substance, I want to, again, take note of the tremendous leadership we are receiving from the Armed Services Committee chairman, the Senator from South Carolina, and the cooperation we are getting from the Senator from Michigan as they try to move this legislation through. They are doing an outstanding job. I know we will start a series of votes later on this afternoon, and we continue to look forward to completing this very important legislation before the week is out. 
Mr. President, I have followed these base closure recommendations, so-called BRAC issues, now for many years. I was in the House when it was first proposed by a young Congressman from Texas, Dick Armey. I was a member of the Rules Committee, and he came to me and asked about how to get this procedure to be considered, to get it through the Rules Committee, to get it to the floor of the House of Representatives. I remember specifically telling him how the procedure would work, but assuring him from the beginning I would oppose it. 
I have always been opposed to this approach. It is one more example of Congress not being able to deal with the tough issues of what we need in terms of facilities in this country and passing the decisions off--the tough decisions off--to others, in this case the Commission. I don't think that is the way it should be done, and that is not the way it was done until recent years. 
In the past, the Pentagon, the Department of Defense, would make recommendations to Congress. Congress, through the appropriate committees--Armed Services and the Appropriations Committee--would consider those recommendations and, in some instances, base closures were approved, including facilities in my own State and probably most States in the Nation, and in others, it was rejected. But somehow over the years, it became more and more difficult to close these bases or to make decisions, to make changes in the bases, and so these so-called BRAC rounds gained some currency and were pushed and, in fact, passed through the Congress. 
We have been down this old BRAC road before, three-and-a-half or four times, if you will. I maintain it has not worked well. First of all, we found that it is a very difficult process. There is always concern about the fairness of how it is done. There are always some implications or indications that some political considerations came into play, and there always will be. But also I think it is important that we remember what it does to the communities and to the people who are involved. 
These are just not nameless, faceless people. These are bases in communities, communities that are disrupted by these proceedings, communities and States spending millions of dollars trying to prove the worth of their bases. So we know that it has had an impact on the communities where these bases have existed. 
We know it has created problems for the Defense Department among the various branches. We know that it is almost totally impossible to assess the real damages or the benefits or the savings from these closings. We have seen this in instance after instance. For instance, we have made decisions that certain bases would be closed and there would be certain savings. Yet, we have found that it has been very difficult to move toward closing those bases and getting the savings for no other reason than we have found, in many instances, that there are environmental problems in cleaning up those bases before they can be turned over to the private sector or the local communities. 
To this day, the recommendations of previous BRAC's have not been completed. We have bases or facilities, depots that supposedly were going to be closed. They are not closed. So without having had an opportunity to really assess the damage that has been done to our capabilities and our facilities for the military of this country, without having an opportunity to really get these bases closed and, therefore, the savings achieved, we have now the recommendation that we have not one but two more of these base closure rounds. 
I think that it has been a very dubious process that has caused lots of problems, and it should not go forward again with two more rounds until we fully understand the ramifications and the implications of what we have already done. 
So that is why I think that the Dorgan amendment is a better approach. It doesn't say that we will never have another base closure round, although I can't envision myself voting for one in the future anymore than I have in the past, but it does set up a legitimate, logical process to assess what has already happened, what has been achieved in terms of savings as a result of those decisions, what it has done to our capabilities militarily, before we go forward with another round. 
The amendment that has been offered by Senator Dorgan and others allows already authorized base closures and realignments to go forward, and that is important, I emphasize again, because what has already been agreed to has, in fact, not been completed. 
This would include the 97 base closures and the 55 realignments that have already been agreed to. 
Economic and fiscal ramifications of closing and realigning bases Congress has already authorized will stretch well into the 21st century. The Pentagon estimates on the savings cannot be supported. GAO, for instance, recently concluded that the `Department of Defense cannot provide [accurate] information on actual savings.' The Congressional Budget Office has stated that it `was unable to confirm or assess DOD's estimates of cost and savings because the Department is unable to report actual spending and savings for [these] actions.' As a result of all these factors, CBO observed that additional base closures `should follow an interval during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have been taken * * * ' 
The Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment sets up a logical process to review what we have already done before we go forward with recommended rounds in the future. The last Base Closure Commission concurred in the assessment and stated that another round of base closures should not occur until the year 2001--not 1999, as proposed in the Levin-McCain amendment. That is an important point. The last Base Closure Commission specifically recommended that there not be another one until the year 2001, if then, so that we could get our work done, see what happened, and then make an informed judgment about whether to go forward with it again in the future. 
This amendment provides the Pentagon with the time to develop accounting techniques so they can fully and accurately reflect the costs and savings from previous and future rounds of base closures, and it requires the Pentagon to prepare a report on the financial ramifications of past and future base closures and to have the report reviewed by GAO and CBO. 
In short, Mr. President, this sets up a process to take a look at what we have already done, evaluate it, make sure we understand the cost savings or the costs that have been expended to try to achieve what has already been agreed to before we go forward, and then and only then after that review should we make an informed decision about whether or not to have another round. 
I am going to hand out to my colleagues when we start having votes a list that I had prepared of facilities and activities that were considered by the Base Closure Commissions in the years 1991 to 1994, but not closed. There is a long list. And I just want to ask my colleagues, whether they be from California or Connecticut or Georgia or Minnesota or my own State or any other State, take a look at what is on this list. 
Think of what you have already been through, and think of the impact it would have on the military if some of these facilities, which are very fine facilities that are important for our training for the Air Force, for the Navy, if they should be threatened once again with being closed. Do you want that? So I will have this list, and I invite my colleagues from all over the United States to take a look at this list. 
This should not be done. We should not be closing down needed facilities and needed bases in the United States while we are sending our military men and women on humanitarian missions around the world. We are looking after the needs and problems around the world. That is fine. But what about the impact and the needs in our own communities of our own constituencies and most importantly of the military itself? 
I vigorously oppose the Levin-McCain amendment and I will go along with the Dorgan-Daschle-Lott amendment because I think 
it is a better alternative and that it sets up a logical process to evaluate whether or not we should ever have another Base Closure Commission. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate pauses to recognize a colleague who has now presided over the Senate for 100 hours during this session of Congress. It has been a longstanding tradition in the U.S. Senate to honor those Senators who preside 100 hours in a single session. To those individuals who achieve this height, we bestow the Golden Gavel Award. 
While many Senators have won this prestigious honor, few have done so as swiftly as Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Indeed, Senator Enzi has surpassed all other records that have been set by Republican Senators in the history of the Golden Gavel Award. Today he completes his 100th presiding hour. The Senate has been in session this year for approximately 615 hours, and the freshman Senator from Wyoming, as Presiding Officer, has filled 100 of those hours with matchless enthusiasm and dedication. 
So, on behalf of my colleagues, I extend my congratulations to the first Golden Gavel recipient of the 105th Congress, Senator Mike Enzi, who is presiding at this time. 
Congratulations, Senator Enzi. Thank you for all the time that you have spent in the chair. The week before the Fourth of July recess period I had noted what an excellent job you had been doing as a Presiding Officer, having been in the chair late, I think it was, on Thursday night and back in the chair through a long, extended period of time on Friday morning. 
We appreciate your good work. Now that you have reached this milestone, we hope you will continue on. You are doing such a good job we will just keep this pattern going in the future.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senators should be on notice that the Senate will begin having rollcall votes on Mondays and Fridays in order to make substantial progress on appropriations bills prior to the August recess. I have discussed this with the Democratic leader. He understands and agrees we should be prepared to have these votes on Mondays and Fridays so that we can make substantial progress on appropriations bills. 
We hope to do a minimum of five appropriations bills as well as the balanced budget and the tax fairness conference reports before the Senate adjourns for the August recess. 
Consequently, Senators need to be aware that votes should be anticipated on Mondays and Fridays, at least up until noon on Fridays. We will need the cooperation of all Senators. 
We also, of course, could have some Executive Calendar nominations that would be required to either get clearance or to actually have them called up and have votes on them. We will be providing more information on that as the week goes forward. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond. 
Of course you always have the option of vitiating a cloture vote. My only goal is trying to get this very important legislation moved through to completion this week. I know that that is the desire on both sides of the aisle. I am concerned about the number of amendments that have been suggested, as many as 150 first-degree amendments. I know a lot of those will fall very quickly once we start moving through the process and getting to the end of the week. But I certainly will consult with the Democratic leader, with the Senator from Michigan, and Senator Thurmond, to see how we are doing. And we can take that into consideration when we get to Thursday and see what the prospects are at that time.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the cloture vote scheduled for today will occur at 3 p.m. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked so that the Senate can complete action on this very important Department of Defense authorization bill this week. 
It is my understanding that perhaps as many as 150 first-degree amendments have been filed to the bill. Needless to say, there remains a tremendous amount of work to be done in order to complete action this week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until the hour of 11 a.m. in the morning. At 11 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of this very important Defense authorization bill. Senators can expect a series of rollcall votes on pending amendments to the bill later in the day as we make progress on this important legislation. 
We do have some Senators that are attending the Madrid meeting at this time in a very important role that they are fulfilling as NATO enlargement observers. They will be returning in the afternoon, and that is why we are trying to accommodate their schedules to make sure that they make these important votes. As always, Members will be notified accordingly when votes on amendments are ordered. 
As a reminder to Senators, this evening a cloture motion was filed, and all first-degree amendments then must be filed by 1 p.m. on Wednesday. That is one of the benefits of the cloture motion. All first-degree amendments have to be filed on Wednesday, so we will have a real good look at what is pending out there. 
As previously stated, it is the intention to complete action on the bill by week's end, so Members should expect long, busy days with a number of votes occurring throughout the week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I announce when the Senate returns following the Independence Day recess, the Senate will return to consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. I want all Senators to know in advance it is my intent to complete action on that bill--the DOD authorization bill--that week, and I intend to stay with it even though it means votes on Friday, July 11, and even on Saturday, if necessary. 
We have a lot of work to do. Earlier this year, because we were in a new Congress, some of the committees were not able to get their bills out, but we now have a lot of bills that are coming to the floor. The appropriations bills will be coming in rapid order. We have bills such as the FDA reform legislation, wildlife refuge bill, Amtrak reform, a whole number of bills. We are just going to have to work on Fridays, and we should begin, certainly, with the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
In order to expedite action on the bill, I want any amendments that are going to be offered to be delivered to the committee. We would like for them to be given to the Armed Services Committee as soon as possible next week. The Armed Services staff will work through the recess to clear the amendments of any Senators that do have amendments they want to offer. 
So we urge Senators to make us aware of the amendments they have.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the loss of child is probably the greatest heartache that any parent can experience or could conceivably experience. 
Last fall, Senator Santorum and his wife, Karen, faced that tragedy. Most of us, I am sure, had occasion to speak with them then and were impressed by their faith and their courage. 
Senator Santorum talks about his family's experience in an article in the May 23 issue of `National Right to Life News.' Its title is `A Brief Life That Changed Our Lives Forever.' It is very powerful, and I urge my colleagues to take the opportunity to read this article, because I think it will affect their lives also.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to agree with the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, of which I am a member. The work of the National Civil Aviation Review Commission could result in a unique opportunity for an often divided aviation industry to reach a consensus on important funding issues. Congress should not force its will on the industry prematurely. 
The Commission is in the process of developing legislative recommendations, and plans to complete its work soon. Unfortunately, the reconciliation process is moving faster than the ability of the Commission to reach a comprehensive solution. The Commission recently wrote to the leadership of both the Senate and House on this issue. We should ensure that the reconciliation bill, or budget rules, do not foreclose the ability to consider the commission recommendations in the future. At that time, we will have a full and fair debate on the recommendations themselves.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the vote we're about to take will be one of the most important any of us will ever cast. 
The decision before us is as important as our families and as large as the American future. 
If this is not an historic moment, then it is as close to it as most of us will ever come. 
Several weeks ago, when we first reached the broad outlines of an agreement with the President, I called it a victory, not for a party or a person, but for the American people. 
We can reaffirm that today. We listened to the American people. We knew what they wanted us to do. 
And somehow, by the grace of God and the endurance of Pete Domenici and Bill Roth, we did it. 
We set out to lower the tax burden on the American people. We did so. In this bill, more than 75 percent of the tax breaks go to people with incomes under $75,000. 
We set out to make the Tax Code family-friendly. We did so. After far too many years of talking about a tax credit for children, we're finally approving one. In addition, we're making it easier for families to save for the costs of education. 
On top of that, we're expanding the availability of IRA's to virtually all homemakers in the country. And we're easing the death tax on family farms and businesses. 
This bill rides in tandem with the Balanced Budget Act the Senate passed 2 days ago. 
That marks a turning point in the way Congress deals with the entitlement programs that have driven our country to the depths of indebtedness. 
Even more important, it fulfills our commitment to strengthen and preserve Medicare, not only for today's beneficiaries but for those who will depend on that program in the years ahead. 
Taken together, what the Senate and House have done this week gives the American people the assurance of something they have not had in three decades: a long-term balanced budget. 
That, of course, is more than an end in itself. It is the surest way to touch off a dynamic economic expansion that will make the first years of the new century an opportunity decade. 
What we have done this week, and what we do today, is more than an exercise in bookkeeping. It is a commitment of the heart to an America where every willing worker can find a good job, where industry and thrift are rewarded, and where every family can aspire to a better life. 
And yet, this is not a perfect bill. I wish we could have reduced taxes more, just as I wanted to reduce spending more in the Balanced Budget Act. 
But we had to craft both pieces of legislation through compromise and consensus. If the American people understood everything we were up against these last few weeks, they would be amazed that we were able to do for them as much as we did. 
This is not the end of the story. We have one hurdle left, and that is the highest of them all. 
After passing this bill, we will go to conference with the House. I will do all I can to make that conference quick and productive. 
Our hurdle--our challenge--will be to preserve the historic work of the Senate and the House in the face of opposition, and perhaps veto threats, from the administration. 
On behalf of our entire Republican leadership, and all Senators who will be our conferees, I want to give this pledge to the American people: 
We will go the extra mile to advance this legislation that is so vital to you. We will do our utmost to work out disagreements with the President. 
But by the same token, we will not agree to any settlement that denies your tax cuts or turns them into the kind of tax fiddling that does nothing to advance opportunity and job creation. 
So as we prepare the conference report on these two bills, we will listen in good faith to anyone who speaks in good faith. 
We will share credit, take blame, and let others have the spotlight. But we are not going to yield on matters of principle. 
With that in mind, Mr. President, I urge the passage of the Taxpayers Relief Act as the Senate's Independence Day salute to the taxpayers of America.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the junior Senator from Montana for his leadership on the important issue. Senator Burns has led a valiant effort to address an area that I believe is in great need of reform. He has championed the cause of allowing citizens to protect their information through readily available strong information security technology. In the 104th Congress, he introduced legislation that set the stage for our reform efforts in this Congress. Again, last week, Senator Burns offered a compromise version of his original bill before the Commerce Committee, but unfortunately this measure did not pass. I hope that now we can go through a process to bring all parties together, industry and Government, to try to relieve some of the problems created by current law. We did not accomplish everything that I wanted in Committee, but I am confident that there is still time to improve this legislation. I want to congratulate Senator Burns and others on the committee like Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan who have taken the time to understand the technology and to attempt to effectively guide us through these difficult issues. 
Mr. President, the demand for strong information security will not abate. Individuals, industry, and governments need the best information security technology to protect their information. The Administration's policy and the McCain-Kerrey bill allow export of 56-bit encryption, with key recovery requirements. How secure is 56-bit encryption? That question was answered the day before the Senate Commerce Committee acted. Responding to a challenge, a secret message encoded with 56-bit encryption was decoded in a brute force supercomputing effort known as the `Deschall Effort.' The message that was decoded said `Strong cryptography makes the world a safer place.' 
Now that 56-bit encryption has been cracked by individuals working together over the Internet, information protected by that technology is vulnerable. The need to allow stronger security to protect information is more acute than ever.

Mr. LOTT. It remains my hope that we can work with Chairman McCain and other members of the Committee to produce a bill that more of us can support. We need to recognize that American industry will have increased difficulty of competing in the international marketplace unless we provide some real reform. It is as if we erected a 30-foot wall between the United States and the rest of the world. The problem is that in today marketplace, American industry only has a 10-foot ladder while their foreign competition has a 35-foot ladder. Foreign firms are able to climb the wall while our American industry faces an insurmountable obstacle. This is both short-sighted and wrong. 
If we follow our current path, we will rue the day when we allowed our policies drive world leadership of the important information security business to shift to Germany, Russia, Japan or China. I fully intend to work toward a legislative solution that will help solve the problem while protecting American security interests. We need to create the mechanisms that will allow American companies to have the same sized ladders that the rest of the world can use. 
Mr. President, we all appreciate the legitimate law enforcement and national security issues involved in this debate. Our national security and law enforcement agencies need to work with industry to ensure that our interests are protected. I remain convinced that we can do this in a way that insures that our national security and sovereignty remains protected.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to propound a unanimous consent request here, that would allow us to carry out the indication that we have put at the table here that this would be the last vote of the night. 
Before I do that, I want to say again I really appreciate the bipartisan cooperation that we have had throughout this week. I think it has made the Senate look good and it has taken a lot of work and several of us have had to keep our commitments in a way that was not always easy, but we have stuck by it on both sides of the aisle. I thank the Senators for doing that. I appreciate also your tolerance when I suffered mightily on one of the votes myself today. 
The chairman and the ranking member have been a pleasure in working through all of this. I thank them and their staff. It is a little premature. I think we are tired, we are trying to find a way to complete our work, but it is important we also take note of the fact that we have been doing some good work working together. We want to keep that going. 
So we have a unanimous consent request that we have worked with Senator Daschle on. He has made a lot of very positive recommendations. We think this would be the fairest way under the process that we have now to complete our work. 
I want to say, Senator Daschle and Senator Domenici, Senator Byrd and I have been talking about the fact that we need to take a look at the process and see if we cannot come up with a little better way to do it without the votes in seriatim at the end of this process. Senator Byrd has a resolution he is going to introduce. Senator Daschle and I are going to appoint a task force of senior Senators to see if we cannot come up with some ideas we can agree to, to allow this process to be done better in the future.

Mr. LOTT. But, in view of what we have to deal with, I ask unanimous consent, now, that during the remainder of the consideration tonight of S. 949, the following be the only amendments in order, other than agreed-upon amendments to be offered by the managers: The Nickles amendment, the Gramm amendment, and Kerry of Massachusetts amendment. I further ask at the conclusion of the debate on the above listed amendments, it be in order for any Member of the Senate to address the Senate with respect to an amendment that may be offered after all time is expired, but there be no further amendments to be in order this evening. 
I further ask that at the conclusion of the remainder of the time on S. 949, the Senate automatically proceed to a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. That way, if all time has expired and you have an amendment that you are going to offer tomorrow, you have that 10 minutes in which you can explain tonight what your intentions are, what is in the amendment; so I ask at the conclusion of the remaining time on S. 949 the Senate automatically proceed to this period of morning business.

Mr. LOTT. The Senator's point is well taken and I certainly agree. Senator Daschle and I would hope there would not be a long series of amendments offered tomorrow. 
Some Senators will feel very strongly and feel like they should have that opportunity. Under the rules as they now exist we could not cut them off. We have had a good debate. We have had the alternative amendment offered by the Democratic leader. We have had other good amendments and debates that occurred. We hope we could bring it to a conclusion at a reasonable time tomorrow. 
I remind my colleagues we had 16 votes yesterday, I believe it was. We started at 9:30 and we finally concluded that at about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Now I believe we can do a better job. We'll start earlier tomorrow and we will stick to the 10-minute vote after the first vote. And we will try to move it right along. But we found the other night that when we said OK, just leave your amendment with the managers of the bill, when we came in in the morning we had 61 amendments. Then the leadership, Senator Daschle and his whip team, as we were, were running around trying to find out which amendments really--what they do. You know, will the Senator insist on offering it? Can we get them accepted? It really complicated the process. 
We really believe by this process Senators will be able to debate these amendments and other amendments tonight. Then they, based on their thinking tomorrow, they would have the opportunity or perhaps would choose not to offer the amendments tomorrow. But if they do we cannot--we cannot cut off the Senators' right to offer an amendment.

Mr. LOTT. I agree and I appreciate the Senator's comment on that. I have been thinking that for several years. I remember one day here we had, what, 39 votes and set a record, a historical record Senator Byrd told us. It is just not a good process. 
We are committed to coming up, by September 8, within the next couple of months, with a way to change the process. In fact, Senator Byrd has some good ideas. But I just want to make sure that we have thought it through and we don't start and change it without thinking about unintended consequences. I don't believe anybody intended 10 years ago, when reconciliation was set up, that it would lead to this type of voting process. We are committed on both sides, the leadership and our senior Members, to coming up with a better process. We are going to do that. We certainly would like the input of the Senator from Nevada, too.

Mr. LOTT. I have not had a chance to get into the specifics of each one of these amendments, but I hope we could pursue the possibility of not going through the long list of process amendments. At least half of these are on our side of the aisle. So I hope we could find another time, another day, another way to do these process amendments. I will certainly be working on that later on tonight and in the morning. 
Since we have the first 3 votes already lined up that would give us time to do some work on exactly whether or not this is essential. I will work with Senator Daschle on that.

We really think that we may actually wind up having fewer amendments finally voted on tomorrow by doing it this way. We tried it the other way. Bear with us as we try it this way. 
Again I urge, unless you just really feel you have to have a vote on your amendment tomorrow I urge you, and I will be saying it on this side--but 
but if you feel strongly, you can talk about it tonight and offer your amendment tomorrow.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can respond again, I share a lot of the Senator's feelings. We will work to see if there is some way we can get an agreement on these process amendments to limit the number or to find another time and opportunity for them to be offered. 
I remind you that yesterday, one unanimous consent agreement that we worked out took nine amendments off the board in one swoop, and we agreed to something that was passed by voice vote. I am not sure we can do that here. Part of what we need is a little time to work with what we have left.

Mr. LOTT. In answer to the Senator, I say there was no time agreement worked out, partially because the Senators didn't want that time agreement. I am hoping they will be actually relatively short in time. I know Senator Nickles doesn't need a lot of time. I believe these amendments will go relatively quickly, and there will be time left for other Members to address the Senate on their amendments. And then after that, when all time has expired, Senators can still talk in morning business for up to 10 minutes. We did not get a time agreement in our effort to get the UC worked out, but I think we are talking about a relatively short period time of time.

Following debate on the three amendments, any Senator wishing to discuss an amendment that may be offered tomorrow may do so. The Senate would then begin voting at 9 a.m. on Friday, on or in relation to the three listed amendments and any amendments offered tomorrow. If Senators do intend to offer amendments tomorrow, I urge them to please give a copy to the managers, since there will be no debate time other than the 2-minute-equally-divided time. It will be very helpful to all Senators to have these amendments available so they can be given to interested Senators. 
I yield the floor. We have approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes left of time on the bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997 is a continuation and extension of work initiated in the last Congress by Representative Bud Shuster and former Senator Larry Pressler. Their goal was to build a fair and responsible balance in America's international container shipping maritime policy. The purpose was to better reflect the modern maritime marketplace. Unfortunately, it was not achieved because we ran out of time. 
In the 105th Congress, a bipartisan group of Senators from the Commerce Committee introduced a modified version of the Ocean Shipping Reform bill. It addressed many of the concerns with last year's bill identified by affected stakeholders. Our plan to move this shipping reform legislation forward has been inclusive, simple, and direct. Under the leadership of Senator Hutchison, and working in a bipartisan way, we have developed a bill that reflects a broad consensus. Most stakeholders in this industry are comfortable with it. This doesn't mean they each got everything they wanted. It does mean that a balance was achieved between what they desired and what the other stakeholders would accept. A real compromise. In this Congress, we have worked hard to achieve a consensus, and we will work even harder to keep it. 
This bill is not perfect. But the process has been excellent. The Commerce Committee held a hearing and a markup, and innumerable meetings with all affected parties. And throughout the process Senator McCain's staff has made the various iterations of the legislation publicly available. This transparency was important to reaching the compromise. 
Mr. President, I believe that it implements real change that will benefit America's ocean shipping industry. When passed and signed into law, S. 414 will help foster the many benefits of increased competition that this industry sorely needs and wants. 
Mr. President, it will also merge the Federal Maritime Commission with the Surface Transportation Board to create the United States Transportation Board (USTB) which will ultimately provide an independent federal transportation regulatory board which thinks and acts on intermodal issues.

Mr. President, I know that during the markup, Senator Gorton expressed strong reservations about the bill. He made it clear that three issues needed to be addressed prior to a vote on the floor. And, a collaborative effort was used to try to accommodate these changes. Mr. President, two of the three issues were incorporated into the bill. The negotiations were tough, but all stakeholders worked together in an open and honest fashion to reach a consensus on this reform legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Gorton's kind words, and recognize his right to continue to advocate for the confidentiality provision. However, I am convinced that any further reduction in service contract reporting provisions would erode the broad consensus achieved by the Committee for this bill. 
Mr. President, we must remember that when the Committee set out to develop this legislation, we agreed to move forward incrementally and work to keep a broad consensus. 
And, I want more reform, but I also want a bill. 
I look forward to a vigorous debate on the service contract reporting provision if Senator Gorton decides to bring an amendment to the floor. Let me be clear. I will not support such an amendment because I believe that in the end, it would erode support for final passage of this important maritime legislation. 
Mr. President, I want all our colleagues to thank Senator Gorton for his fine work on this bill. He has challenged us to improve the bill, and in doing so, he has expanded the reforms it provides. This is good for America. This is good for America's container shipping industry. This is good for the great state of Washington. 
Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to support our bill to accomplish meaningful reform in this important maritime industry. 
Mr. President, one final comment, I pledge to bring this bill to the floor in this session of the 105th Congress. It is overdue. It is bipartisan. It is supported by all stakeholders of the maritime industry.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been working with Senator Chafee and others, including Senator Jeffords, on a number of amendments that were offered last night as first- or second-degree amendments. I think we have worked out a process, now, that we are all comfortable with. Let me enter this unanimous-consent request and then we will have a brief colloquy also. 
I ask unanimous consent the following amendments be withdrawn: Chafee amendment No. 448, Chafee amendment No. 500, Chafee amendment No. 501, Lott amendments Nos. 505, 507, 508, 509, Rockefeller amendment No. 510 and the Roth amendment No. 513; 
I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn to the Roth amendment No. 511, and that all between lines 23 on page 22 and line 3 on page 23 be stricken; 
I further ask the Senate then call up the Chafee amendment No. 512 to the Roth amendment No. 511, as modified, that the Chafee amendment be agreed to, and the Roth amendment, as amended, then be agreed to; 
I further ask unanimous consent that when the committee amendment to S. 949, the Taxpayer Relief Act, is before the Senate, Senator Roth be recognized to offer an amendment which is the text of the Roth amendment No. 511, as modified and amended, and the text of the Kennedy amendment, No. 492, if adopted by the Senate, to S. 947, to the language regarding the children's health initiative, and the amendment be agreed to; 
Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order during the pendency of S. 949 to offer further amendments or motions regarding title XXI of the Social Security Act, except amendments regarding revenues and outlays.

Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, if I can respond to the Senator's reservation, I noted when I read through this that there were a series of amendments that had been offered in a variety of ways affecting this particular area: Three by Senator Chafee, four by myself, one by Senator Roth, one by Senator Rockefeller. So this is quite a laboriously worked-out process. 
The Senator from Vermont, as a matter of fact, is not particularly happy with some provisions still remaining, and he had an amendment that would have tried to change that. A number of others--Senator Nickles of Oklahoma--I believe, had something. But this unanimous-consent agreement was worked out in a way that a number of Senators decided not to go forward with their objections. 
I personally don't agree with this, but it is the best way that we could work through about six or eight amendments that were pending in a reasonable and fair way, and it certainly will have another day in court.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, approximately 6 hours remain for debate with respect to the Balanced Budget Act, basically equally divided. There are approximately 30 minutes remaining on the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Medicare age increase issue. Therefore, a vote will occur on that motion to waive around 3 o'clock, or maybe shortly before that. 
As was mentioned in both luncheons today, the Senate will remain in session this evening until all time is consumed. If any Senator intends to offer an amendment after the time has expired, they will be required to do so this evening. It will then be my intention to stack all votes on the amendments and the final passage, after the time has expired this evening, until approximately 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday. 
So all debate time and all amendments will be offered tonight, and then we will begin a series of votes at 9:30. We don't know exactly how many amendments that could entail. It could be as few as five, I hope. It could be many more than that. We will begin voting at 9:30 and continue voting until we complete all the amendment votes and final passage. Then, of course, we will go to the taxpayers' relief act. 
Senators can expect additional votes today and a series of votes beginning at 9:30 on Wednesday, the last of the series being final passage of the Balanced Budget Act.

Mr. LOTT. If the Chair will allow me, the first-degree amendments would be offered tonight if Senators wish to offer them, and then the second-degree amendment would be in order to be 
offered tonight once the first-degree amendment is offered. 
I do not understand why that is a problem. You have to stay here to offer your second-degree amendment or have some leadership person in your behalf offer that second-degree amendment, but there would be ample opportunity on both sides tonight to offer second-degree amendments if a Senator so desires. 
Under the rules, all time will expire between 8:30 and 9 o'clock, and the only time remaining then will be to offer amendments and to have the votes in order on those amendments.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 88, S. 936, the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19970619</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, then, the Senate is now considering the defense authorization bill. Several amendments are expected to be offered to the bill; therefore, votes can be expected throughout the remainder of the afternoon and into the night. We will have to get started and see what amendments are available, and then we will expect some votes, but we would like to get as much work done today as we can. And that could take us into the night. 
Also, I want to make clear that we do intend for the Senate to resume consideration of the bill on Friday. I do expect rollcall votes on amendments relative to the DOD bill, at least until the noon hour on Friday. But, again, that will depend on exactly what amendments are pending. We recognize Senators do have commitments to go back to their States tomorrow afternoon, and we will try to accommodate that. 
But I do think we need to get some work done on this important legislation. A lot of effort has gone into working out a way to be able to bring the DOD authorization bill to the floor. I think we can make some progress, and I encouraged the ranking member and the chairman to see right away if they could get some finite list of amendments that might want to be offered and be considered. Maybe we can get some understanding of when we could get a final vote on this legislation when we come back after the recess. 
Next week, we again do intend to bring up the reconciliation spending bill on Monday, as I discussed with the acting minority leader, and we hope to run off time on that bill on Monday. We will talk further about exactly what will happen on Monday. We will do that tomorrow probably just as we wrap up consideration of this bill, complete the spending reconciliation bill Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday, and then go to the tax bill on Thursday, and stay until we finish the tax cut bill. 
I do not know exactly how long that will take. We have a very bipartisan effort underway in the Finance Committee. The vote on the spending bill was 20 to 0, and we are working together right now on the tax cut provisions also. I expect it will be a bipartisan process and a bipartisan bill. It is possible it may not take that long, but it is very important legislation and we need to get it done, completed next week--both of those bills. 
Assuming we cannot complete the DOD authorization bill tomorrow because of some concerns, and at least one issue that may come up, I know the Democratic leader would want to be here 
for that, so we may not be able to take that up until after we come back from the recess. 
I want to thank the Members for their cooperation in getting this legislation before the Senate now. And I do want to announce that we will expect to complete action on it the week that we come back. Hopefully, it will not take all week, because we have a lot of other bills now that are ready for consideration. It will be the pending business when we come back--if we do not complete it tomorrow--when we come back from the recess. 
I hope Senators will come to the floor now and offer their amendments. Some Senators were inquiring, `Why do we need to vote during the middle of the afternoon on Thursday?' I would like to suggest we have votes the rest of the day into tonight, on Friday, and we be prepared next week to work long hours, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, to get our work done. Then we can go to the recess period and feel good about our production. 
Would the Senator from Kentucky have any comments?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to announce there will be no further rollcall votes tonight. We have been working to make sure that the Members that we need to have here tomorrow, if necessary, on the Finance Committee and also the Budget Committee members are here so we can complete our work on the tax cut provision of reconciliation, so that the Budget Committee can meet tomorrow morning to package both the reconciliation spending provision and the tax cut bill. We are now satisfied we will be able to have Members here for that, even though we do not have recorded votes scheduled. 
For the information of all Senators, the Senate will resume consideration of the DOD authorization bill. However, I have been assured that amendments will be offered. Therefore, votes will not occur during Friday's session. 
The point I am making here is that we will be in session. We will continue to work on the DOD bill. We will have amendments that will be offered, but because of the request of a number of Senators, and the agreement we have been able to work out, we will not have to have votes during Friday's session. 
As all Members know, the Senate will begin reconciliation on Monday. It is my understanding that Members will offer amendments to the reconciliation bill. Again, with a lot of requests from the Members and with the assurance and the cooperation in a number of ways, which I will not enumerate now, the votes that are required as a result of amendments being offered Monday will be stacked to occur on Tuesday, at 9:30 a.m. Therefore, no votes will occur on Monday. 
Committees are expected to act in the morning on the tax reconciliation package. We will be in session tomorrow with some morning business time that we will have identified later, and the Department of Defense authorization bill will continue to be considered. We will be in session on Monday on the reconciliation bill, with amendments to be offered. But the next recorded votes will occur and be stacked--more than one, hopefully, and at least a couple, but maybe even more--to occur at 9:30 on Tuesday. 
Mr. President, does the Senator from Kentucky wish to add anything?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will have a unanimous-consent request momentarily with regard to calling up Calendar No. 84, S. 924, the Department of Defense authorization bill. We have been in communication with the Democratic leadership and Senators on both sides about our desire to call up this legislation. We do have some concerns on both sides about some provisions that are in or not in it. But I want to withhold on making that request just for one moment. 
I had, also, as a second consideration, hoped that we could get up the intelligence authorization bill this afternoon. We are asking the Armed Services Committee to continue to work on that and consider that as something we would like to try to do this week if at all possible. But we are still working to get that cleared. 
We will ask consent later on this afternoon to go to S. 923, which would deny veterans benefits to persons convicted of Federal capital offenses. I believe we can get that done this afternoon. Senator Specter has been working on that. I understand there are Senators on the other side of the aisle having some input. I believe we can get something worked out on that this afternoon. It is something certainly we should do.

Mr. LOTT. I regret we have had this objection to proceeding on this very important legislation, the Defense authorization bill. 
The Armed Services Committee in the Senate has worked very hard on this legislation. It is urgently needed to this extent: Until we can get the authorization bill through the complete process, it makes it difficult for the defense appropriations subcommittee to do its work. So timing is important. 
We would like to get this authorization bill done at the earliest possible opportunity so it can get on into conference and so that the defense appropriators will know what the authorization numbers are. It is important for our country. 
It is my understanding that a major issue of contention is still being discussed with respect to the depots and bases that could be affected by it or will be affected by it in Texas, in Oklahoma, in California, in Utah, and Georgia. There are a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of this issue that are very concerned about how it was handled in the committee. 
So I have urged those on both sides of the aisle to work together and see if we cannot come up with something that is acceptable to both sides. It will not be easy. This is not a new issue. We went through this in a way in the base closure rounds. 
We had debate and amendments on it last year. So everybody knows the arguments on both sides. I still believe that there is a way that we can come to some compromise language that would allow us to go forward. 
The Senators are exercising their right to object to waiving the 2-day rule or calling up the bill to go straight to debate and amendments. But I hope that they will not do this for very long, because we have our work to do. 
So I understand there is a meeting that will meet again, perhaps today, this afternoon at 5:30, on this issue. We had a preliminary meeting on it in my office yesterday. I will be glad to work with both sides. I want a resolution to be found. But I am not inclined, as I discussed with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, the acting minority leader, here--I want Senators to be able to exercise their rights, and I want to be helpful with that, but I also think at some point, if you cannot work out something, if you do not work out something, then we will have to use the rules of the Senate to move this very important legislation forward. But I would like everybody to get an opportunity first to work together, and you know we are losing some time here. Every day that goes by that we do not take it up, it means that it already looks like it could be the week of July 7, 8, before we could actually get this legislation completed. I just wanted to make those points. 
I understand Senators on the floor now would like to be heard on this issue. I would like to yield the floor so that they could make their statements. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a resident of California has, for the second time in the past several years, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate. Under rule XXII, debate on a pending matter may be limited by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn or, in the case of an amendment to a Senate rule, a vote of two-thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum being present. 
The plaintiffs has named as defendants in this action all Members of the Senate, together with the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms, the Parliamentarian, and two executive branch officials. He seeks a declaration that rule XXII is unconstitutional and a court order rewriting rule XXII to permit a simple majority of a quorum to limit debate in the Senate. 
With respect to a prior action filed by the same plaintiff also challenging rule XXII, Senate Resolution 150 of the 103d Congress authorized the Senate Legal Counsel to defend Senators named as defendants in that action. With respect to the plaintiff's prior challenge, the district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing. On appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate court vacated the district court's decision and ordered the plaintiff's complaint dismissed as moot. In his complaint, the plaintiff had sought to present his alleged injury as frustration of the majority party's legislative program by the minority. The appellate court noted that the intervening change in the control of the Senate after the 1994 election had mooted his allegations of injury. 
The plaintiff's new action alleges an injury independent of party control, as well as adding non-Member defendants. The new action is subject to the same grounds for dismissal as was the previous action. 
Over the years, the Senate has vigorously debated the merits of rule XXII. That debate has included the question that the plaintiff seeks to present to the court in the instant action of whether a majority of the Senate should be permitted to end debate. The resolution of this issue under our constitutional system, Mr. President, is best decided in the Senate and not in the courts. 
The resolution at the desk would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Members, officers, and an employee of the Senate who have been named as defendants in this case and to move to dismiss the complaint.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate the good work that has been done on this legislation. It is truly a bipartisan compromise. The distinguished chairman and ranking member, the Senator from Delaware, have really worked hard and have come together, I think, on a good bill. It is obvious that the bill is going to be supported by the overwhelming votes that we have seen here today. 
It is important that we finish this bill tonight. There are not a lot of amendments left. I hope that the Senators who have amendments they are seriously interested in will come to the floor right away and talk to the chairman so that we can finish this up in the next hour and a half or 2 hours. 
I thank the Senator from Kentucky, who is acting as leader in the absence of our good friend, Senator Daschle. Let's really stay behind this and see if we can't finish in the next couple of hours. I wanted to make that point.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business today until the hour of 12:30 p.m. Following morning business, by previous consent, the Senate will begin consideration of the State Department reauthorization bill. Senators who intend to offer amendments to that legislation should be prepared to offer and debate their amendments today. I understand we do have a couple of amendments that may be offered. We have announced earlier that any rollcall votes ordered on those amendments will not occur today but, instead, will be stacked to occur at a time to be determined in the morning by the two leaders. We do hope to open with some early votes so we can get on toward completion of the State Department reauthorization hopefully by tomorrow night. Senator Daschle and I discussed that last week before he left, and we agreed that we would try to complete action by Tuesday night, since we have bipartisan agreement on this legislation. 
Senators will be notified accordingly exactly when the rollcall votes will be scheduled, and we hope that we can finish the State Department reauthorization so that we can move on to other bills. We now have scheduled the Defense authorization bill for Wednesday and the remainder of the week. We have some other issues that we might try to get up, including the intelligence authorization bill. 
So I remind Senators again that there are only 2 weeks remaining prior to the July 4 recess. The next 2 weeks will certainly be very busy, and I hope Senators will continue to be cooperative as we schedule legislation and votes. I thank our colleagues for their cooperation in the Chamber. We may have to go into the night some the next 2 weeks in order to get through the State Department authorization, the Defense authorization, maybe even the intelligence authorization and the two reconciliation bills next week, one on the spending side and, of course, the tax bill. That is a big order, but the Finance Committee will be meeting most of the day tomorrow and Wednesday and Thursday to complete action on those two important reconciliation bills that will carry out the directions of the budget resolution that we agreed to.

I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives from the House legislation which provides for the continuing of Government funding at a level of 100 percent of the fiscal year 1997 for those fiscal year 1998 appropriations that have not been signed by October 1, 1997, the majority leader may proceed with that legislation after consultation with the Democratic leader. 
I did not read that smoothly. This is the continuing resolution, Government shutdown prevention language. We assume we will receive it in this 100 percent form of 1997 levels for those 1998 appropriations that have not been signed. There will then be one relevant amendment in order for each leader, limited to 1 hour each, to be counted against the overall 8 hours, and no other amendments or motions be in order to the bill, there be 8 hours for debate on the bill equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and finally, following the expiration or yielding back of the time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage, all without intervening action or debate.

Mr. LOTT. Let me say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from South Dakota. He has been willing to work on a number of different approaches to resolve this matter. This is clearly not the way I thought we should proceed. Apparently, the House-passed bill will be at the full funding level of about $8.6 billion. I think that is inappropriate, uncalled for. I think it is important that we get the disaster funds through and the funding for the Department of Defense Bosnia activities, but this bill has grown like Topsy. There is no need for it to be $8.6 billion. There has been a lot of add-ons on both sides of the Capitol, both parties, and the administration even made an additional request apparently in writing the other day with regard to forward funding. 
It seems to be everybody has found a way to add more money here and there, and while enumerated on the floor and put in on the floor, some of the things that have been added--and, again, this is not partisan or it is not aimed at just the Senate or just the House; it is a bicameral, bipartisan exercise--but as the effort has gone forward to try to reduce this funding, basically what this Senator has found is everybody said: No, not mine. Don't take this out. Don't take that out. There is a good reason for that, good reason for this, good reason for everything--always wanting to spend more of the people's tax money. So I am very unhappy with the amount of money involved here. 
But I think, as majority leader, it is incumbent upon me to work with all the various parties involved here to find a procedure to get this work done. We have done that, and so now I think we are ready to go forward with the debate. I believe the chairman, Senator Stevens, is here to give some more details about what is included in this bill.

Mr. LOTT. Oh, yes, absolutely. Only that substance. Not other unrelated matters. I can think of lots of things they might try to attach to that. 
No, not at all. We want this to be considered upfront in the daylight and a sincere effort to work out a way to avoid the fun and games at the end of the fiscal year. I think this will give us that shot. And if the House adds extraneous to it, it will never 
come up in this form. I would work with the Senator to make sure that does not happen.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am prepared to ask for some unanimous-consent agreements here momentarily. I believe that the Democratic leader will be here. In the meantime, I thought I might just give the Senators some idea of what the time could be for the balance of the afternoon and then some thought about next week. 
If we get the agreement we have here before us entered into and agreed to, we would begin debate, I believe, then at about quarter until 4 on the supplemental appropriations, with a vote occurring 1 hour from then. So that vote could occur around quarter of 5. We are looking at the possibility of, of course, getting agreement for committees to keep working, because we have a number of committees that are in very crucial markups--the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, and the Finance Committee is meeting in a walk-through, although it is not a markup. 
We are also looking at the prospect of calling up again the birth defects bill, which has broad bipartisan support, and we believe we could get a limited time agreement on that. We are contacting the principal sponsors, Senator Bond and perhaps others who are interested in that, and we could take that up somewhere around 5 o'clock and hopefully complete that early in the evening or late this afternoon, because we think we are only going to talk about 30 minutes to an hour, perhaps with the possibility of a recorded vote that could come, I presume, about 6 o'clock. 
With regard to the consent agreement that we are about to ask for here, we would begin as soon as we get the agreement on the supplemental appropriations bill. Basically, it is the bill that the House is now considering, or is about to consider. It may be before the Rules Committee and will be going to the floor of the House shortly after that. 
We would ask unanimous consent that our agreement only apply if the text has been received from the House and is identical to the bill that we are sending to the desk for the Record. 
We also have worked out a process to consider the very important issue that we feel very strongly about, and that is the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. And we are going to ask for consent that would allow for a process for it to be brought up, full debate with one relevant amendment for each leader. I think it is a fair way to consider this issue, and the Democratic leader has indicated he thinks that would be the way to proceed. 
With regard to the census issue, I understand that they have worked out some language on census with the administration, which is in the document that they are going to be taking up. I do not know the details of the agreement, but I understand that language is in there, for the information of all Senators. 
Would the Senator like to comment before I enter the UC request?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 2:05 p.m., the Senate begin 3 hours 55 minutes for debate only, to be divided equally between the two leaders or their designees, for discussions with respect to the supplemental appropriations bill, and that there be no motions in order during the approximately 4 hours of debate, other than a motion to adjourn by the majority leader or his designee. 
I further ask unanimous consent that it not be in order for the Chair to entertain any unanimous-consent requests with respect to consideration of any supplemental appropriations bill during the 4-hour period described above. 
And, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the Armed Services Committee be permitted to meet during the session of the Senate today, Wednesday, June 11. 
In support of that unanimous-consent request, before the Chair puts the request, I would just like to observe that I know there are Senators who would like to be heard on this issue, on the supplemental appropriations bill, about what is in it, the importance of it, how it can be resolved, comments on language that is included, a whole variety of statements that I am sure Senators would like to make to show their interest in and their suggestions as to how we deal with the supplemental appropriations bill. So I think to have 4 hours of debate makes good sense for the Senate to be able to hear what Senators have to say. 
I also indicate to our colleagues that there are a lot of discussions underway, a lot of meetings underway. Today, we have been in direct contact with the White House on how some of these issues can be resolved. I have had conversations with Senator Daschle. We are communicating with the House leadership to see exactly how they plan to proceed and when that would be. I understand perhaps there is a meeting right now at the White House on some of the provisions of this issue. So I think and I hope that we are making some progress and that we can find some way to bring this issue to fruition in the next few hours. Hopefully, we can have some action on it before we go out this week. 
But I think while we are doing that, we should be doing the business of the Senate, having hearings or markups in committees, particularly the Armed Services Committee, which is working on the defense authorization bill which we hope to have up next week in the Senate, and also so that we can continue our efforts to come to an agreement on how we deal with the supplemental appropriations, the Government shutdown provision language, the census language, to try to see how we can work out an agreement and what that language might be. It is very important we have an opportunity to do that this very afternoon. That is why I make the request. I urge it be considered and that it not be objected to.

I do want to note also that the Finance Committee has requested consent to meet this afternoon, also to begin the process of markup on the reconciliation bill, which is required under the budget agreement. I believe it is going to be pretty bipartisan in its makeup, in terms of the spending provisions or the restraint on spending, whichever the case may be. And in order to have this legislation completed in the Finance Committee by, I believe it is the 18th of this month, we need to have them meeting. 
But I ask unanimous consent, sort of in the vein of what Senator Daschle was talking about, that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 18, H.R. 581; and further, no amendments be in order, with the exception of one substitute amendment to be offered by the majority leader or his designee; that there be 1 hour total for debate on the bill and the amendment, to be equally divided in the usual form; and finally, that following the expiration or yielding back of time and the disposition of the substitute amendment, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed immediately to vote on passage 
of the bill, as amended, if amended, with no intervening action or debate.

Mr. LOTT. I don't have one now, but I believe that during this time, while we are debating the issue, we could develop one and, as a matter of fact, I believe there is a meeting at the White House right now that would be the subject of this substitute and one we could agree on. 
Or I could do it this way. What I suggested yesterday, and where I think we actually should go, is a bill that provides the actual emergency disaster funds and the funds for DOD, but not the language and not the supplemental, just what has been referred to as a narrow disaster and emergency funding bill only, and the amount I am thinking about would be in the range of $3.9 billion. That way, we would get this issue resolved quickly while we continue to work on such things as the census language, where we hope and think maybe we can come to some agreement. We get this thing done; we get it done now. 
The House traditionally, as you very well know, is very sensitive about us acting before they do, but we could go ahead and have debate on this and take some action and hold it at the desk. I think this is one way to deal with this emergency. How would the Senator react to that?

And I do not want in any way to dampen the efforts that are underway to come to a broader total agreement. But in order to get this emergency addressed this week--hopefully within the next 24 hours--I think this is the way that we want to consider doing it. 
I hope you will think about that between now and tomorrow and let us look at that as a possibility of what we might do at 2 o'clock tomorrow if something else has not already been worked out. 
I again thank the Senator for his comments.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, my colleague and friend, introduced S. 866, legislation that provides a necessary Federal standard regarding voluntary environmental self-auditing for states. There are nearly two dozen States which are experimenting with laws to encourage self-audits. These laws are aimed at increasing environmental protection and directing scarce enforcement resources toward the real bad actors. We need Federal legislation to make these state laws work, and Senator Hutchison has a balanced, fair approach. 
I want to take this opportunity today to share with my colleagues how this legislative proposal will strengthen America's environmental policies. I will join Senator Hutchison as an active cosponsor to S. 866. 
First, I would like to explain what voluntary environmental self-auditing is all about. 
In the past 10 years, the number of environmental statutes and regulations that impose compliance obligations, and the corresponding civil and criminal penalties and sanctions for violations, have dramatically increased. In response to these developments, more and more companies are using environmental self-audit programs as a tool to ensure compliance. 
Generally, an environmental audit is a means of reviewing a business in order to get a snapshot of its overall compliance with environmental laws and to troubleshoot for potential future problems. EPA defines an audit as `a systematic, documented, periodic and objective review by regulated entities of facility operations and practices related to meeting environmental requirements.' Audits can include inspections of equipment to insure that permit requirements are being met; review of future and present risks of regulated and unregulated materials used at the facility; and surveys of the day-to-day operation of environmental management structure and resources. Some companies have compliance management systems that include day-to-day, even shift-to-shift, voluntary activities to assure compliance. 
No State or Federal law requires companies to undertake comprehensive environmental self-auditing. This is just a good business practice initiated by companies that are taking extra steps to be in full compliance with environmental law. 
There are no guidelines or standard practices--audits vary considerably because they must accommodate the individual needs of companies or specific facilities to be most effective. They are typically much more extensive than an inspection by a State or Federal regulator because they are done more often and because companies simply know much more about their operations and permit obligations than regulators do. A company conducting its own audit can identify and correct a much wider range of potential environmental violations. 
Mr. President, doesn't this sounds like a great idea? 
Unfortunately, many companies do not perform voluntary self-audits because the information contained in the audit documents can be obtained by Government regulators, prosecutors, citizens' groups, or private citizens and used to sue the company. Companies completing environmental audits develop documentation of their instances of noncompliance or areas of potential concern. These documents, if made public, are a roadmap for third parties or governments to sue even if the problem has already been corrected and no environmental harm has occurred. 
Remember, we have an incredibly complex compliance system. Last year a survey conducted by Arthur Anderson and the National Law Journal found that nearly 70 percent of 200 corporate attorneys interviewed said that they did not believe total compliance with the law was achievable. This is due to the complexity of the law, the varying interpretations of the regulators and the ever-present role of human error and the cost. 
Because of this complexity, it is possible and logical that companies which take on the task of self-evaluation will find violations--and that is what we want them to do. Find problems and fix them without waiting a year for a Government inspection. 
Companies are already vulnerable to extensive liability under environmental laws. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, for example, the maximum civil penalty that may be assessed is now $25,000 
per day per violation. EPA's fiscal year 1994 enforcement and compliance assurance accomplishments report shows that 166 civil judicial penalties were brought in 1994 totaling $65.6 million. On average, that is about $400,000 a case. There were 1,433 administrative penalty orders for the same year totaling $48 million. 
Mr. President, that's a lot of money. A pretty powerful disincentive to self-auditing. 
Yet, nearly two dozen states have recognized this disincentive to self-auditing and have enacted laws to fix the problem. These states and their citizens want more companies to conduct self-audits. Mississippi is one of the States that has acted on this issue. 
These State laws typically do three things: First, provide qualified evidentiary protection for internal company audit documents; second, grant penalty immunity to companies that conduct audits and voluntarily disclose all violations they discover in their audit; and third, require prompt cleanup of the violation. 
In other words, the States are saying that responsible, self-auditing companies that find and report problems to State authorities are rewarded. The companies do not have to pay a fine and are protected from any court action on an internal company audit. 
Mr. President, this is a fair deal. We get more environmental protection--which should be the goal of environmental laws--not just freedom from sanctions and penalties. Senator Hutchison's legislation brings better environmental compliance with a voluntary flexible component. 
Mr. President, this is basic common sense--companies have an incentive to find and fix their problems right away. What could be better for the environment? 
State officials also benefit because they can establish cooperative relationships with companies instead of the current adversarial enforcement system. Taxpayers get a better return from their tax dollars because enforcement resources can be redirected toward the bad guys who are not following the law. And, most importantly, we all benefit from greater compliance with our environmental laws. 
Some will say that these State laws are about secrecy and letting polluters off the hook. Opponents say that these laws make it more difficult to prosecute and that they will interfere with enforcement actions or compromise the public's right to know. 
Mr. President, this is just not true. These laws protect only the voluntary self-audit document. They do not protect any information required by law to be collected, developed, maintained, reported or otherwise made available to a Government agency. The opponents are saying that protection of the audit document will allow bad actors to hide violations and endanger human health. Of course, that is not true. Any action that causes an imminent threat is not protected and must be immediately reported to authorities. Companies gain nothing from these laws if they are using an audit for a fraudulent purpose, or if they find a violation and don't fix it. If they're cheating, they're out. 
These laws present a new way of doing business. No safeguards are removed. The State legislature is just as eager as the Federal Government to protect its citizens. Senator Hutchison's legislation has the same safeguards. 
Twenty-one States think this is a better way to get things done. Twenty-five other State legislatures are considering this voluntary self-audit legislation. Let me give you those numbers again: 21 states have enacted a voluntary audit law and 25 are considering one. 
Mr. President, that is a grand total of 46 States. I'd say this is a definite trend. The Federal Government ought to open its eyes and join the parade. 
We need to enact similar legislation on the Federal level to complement and assist those States with a full and effective implementation of this concept. That is what this bill is all about. No rollback of standards. No removal of any environmental law. Yes, a different approach, but one already tested in States where 95 million Americans are currently living. It is time for EPA to see the wisdom of 95 million Americans. 
Why not let the States continue to show us innovative ways to achieve environmental progress? I frequently ask that question. The answer is EPA wants to retain the right to enforce the law after it delegates program authority to a State. This means that without a Federal law granting a qualified exception for voluntary self-audits, the EPA can take separate enforcement actions--or overfile--regardless of any State action. 
The sad consequence is that a company that wishes to take advantage of a State audit law is not protected from Federal enforcement actions--even 
though the Federal inspectors didn't find the problem and the company has fixed it. 
Why would a company voluntarily disclose violations to a State when the Federal Government can come after them for the same thing? 
EPA has been very clear about its intent to scrutinize companies in States that have enacted laws and that are currently addressing audit bills in their legislatures. EPA has set up a task force to monitor the approval of State delegated programs under the Clean Air Act for States with voluntary environmental audit statutes. The agency has indicated that approval of certain State programs may be delayed or denied because of their State audit privilege statutes. EPA has used this threat to withhold Federal program delegation in order to influence pending State legislation. Does this sound like an agency whose charter is to clean up the environment or does this sound like a bureaucracy that focuses on punishment first? Is this a constructive environmental approach? 
Why--in the face of such Federal challenges--did the 21 States enact legislation? Because 95 million citizens want a cleaner environment. The States know it is the right thing to do. Americans want an approach that cleans the environment first. That is also why 25 other States want to consider alternatives. These States have shown great environmental courage. 
I firmly believe that States can design and implement effective and successful environmental laws. In fact, States have proven that the Federal Government does not always know best and does not always get the job done. 
I hope that EPA does not continue to minimize the independent sovereign rights of States to adopt and enforce environmental laws that protect the environment and add to our quality of life. Perhaps EPA needs to get a copy of the Constitution. 
Full use of these State laws will never happen as long as EPA continues an adversarial approach. And Americans miss an opportunity to achieve creative and cost-effective solutions to environmental problems. 
Even the Clinton administration has recognized the value of promoting environmental self-auditing when it issued a policy statement in December of 1995. It was a good first step forward, but in 2 years, we've seen only intimidation. 
Basically, the administration policy says that if companies come forward and voluntarily disclose violations, then EPA will not prosecute them as aggressively as they could otherwise. Not a real bonus. No evidentiary protection, no protection against citizen suits, and it is only a policy, not a rule, so it does not have the force of law nor does it have any impact on what the Justice Department or the FBI can do. And this policy can and will vary from State to State and company to company. 
It is now time for legislation. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has accepted the challenge and introduced a sound bill yesterday. This bill fully recognizes the sovereignty of the State. Mr. President, Senator Hutchison's bill, S. 866, will encourage environmental self-auditing by setting up incentives at the Federal level for those States with the provision. Nothing more. 
Americans get better environmental compliance. I urge my colleagues to give serious consideration to the proposal being advanced by Senator Hutchison.

Mr. LOTT. I regret that the Democrats will not allow the Senate to consider this bipartisan legislation. I know there are a number of Democrats that are cosponsors of it. I presume we are going to find a way to consider this. This legislation would establish a national birth defects prevention research system. I point out that our bill is cosponsored not only by the Democratic leader, but Senator Dorgan, Senator Hollings, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, just to name a few, and a number of Senators on this side of the aisle. 
As I know the cosponsors are aware, an estimated 150,000 infants are born each year with serious birth defects, resulting in 1 out of every 5 infant deaths. The bill is designed to 
establish regional birth defects research programs, establishes the Centers for Disease Control as the coordinating agency for birth defects surveillance and prevention, and authorizes grants to public and nonprofit organizations to develop new public awareness to reduce the incidence of birth defects. 
With regard to the supplemental bill, I presume that we are going to continue to work to try to find a resolution to this problem. I think I have proven over the past year that I always believe you can find a way to work through disagreements. Quite often here in the Senate, when we seem to be in an immovable position, when everyone is intractable, Senator Daschle and I have found if we go to the Senators that say, `No deal ever,' and ask them, `OK, what's the solution?' I think quite often they say, `Well, we can do it this way or that way.' 
What I have suggested to Senator Daschle and to the White House and to the House of Representatives and to the leadership in the Senate, including the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is we can work together and see if we can come up with language that we can agree on with regard to this very important issue and with regard to preventing a Government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year and find a way to move the bill with some of the other language that is in there. Some of it may have to be removed; some of it may be compromised. 
But, you know, compromise is not something where you work it out with yourself, on one side of the aisle or one side of the Capital. Now we have to work among ourselves, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate and the administration. It involves engagement. 
And I have asked several times along the last couple weeks, including last Friday and again yesterday, and including direct conversations with the President--`You know, can't we find a way to come up with some language that you can live with and that we can live with and move this issue beyond us and go on to other issues?' 
I want to note also for one and all that this bill was originally requested to be $4.1 billion. It is now at least $8.6 billion. And it is not just funds for disasters around the country, it is also funds for the Department of Defense and a lot of other programs that were not originally requested. 
I will just give you some idea what we are talking about. I hope I have the list here. It does include things like--and these are all good and fine programs, I guess--but $33 million I think it is for the Botanical Gardens, not exactly emergency disaster funding; $23 million for a parking garage in Cleveland, OH. I do not have the list here with me, but there is a long list of things that have been added along the way. 
Barnacles have been picked up on this ship. So one of the things I have suggested is, while we continue to work to try to resolve the amount and the language--in fact yesterday I was asked by one of the administration officials--I do not want to put words in their mouth--`What is this objection that Attorney General Reno has to some money in the bill?' I said to this person, `Are you talking about the $2 million for a law enforcement commission?' Would the President want to start talking about vetoing a bill because of $2 million for a law enforcement commission? 
I do not think so, but I would like to hear what their argument is against it. 
One of the things I have suggested, with all honesty, and I did it back before the Memorial Day recess, rather than trying to negotiate this thing down or to solve all the language right now, we should go ahead and do a smaller bill that will provide the real emergency disaster and the urgent salary for DOD. That will still leave a lot of money and a lot of language that we will continue to work on. 
I guess what I am saying here is that I would like to get this worked out. I would like for us to move on to the reconciliation bill. I would like for us to move on to appropriations bills. I had hoped we could do two or three appropriations bills before the Fourth of July recess, and I still hope we can put them in there tomorrow. I would like for us to take up some of the nominations that are pending. I would like for us to take up adoption legislation, legislation that passed the House with 465 votes, to make it easier to have adoptions in America. I did not bring it up last week because I found that we have a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle that have been working on that and have some good ideas, including Senator Rockefeller, Senator DeWine, Senator Craig, and Senator Chafee. They are working on it, and I think we may have a compromise adoption bill we could call up later on this week. 
All I am saying here is let us go on and do some of these bills that we should be able to do in a relatively short period of time, including the birth defects research program, while we continue to see if we can work things out. I am ready. I am ready. Help me. I think we can find a way to get this thing done. 
But it does not work this way. It does not work that the President says, `Send me down a full plate of money, $8.6 billion --and, by the way, we do not want any of your language on it.' I have gone back and I have looked at supplementals over the years, and there has hardly ever been a supplemental that did not have all kinds of extraneous language, all kinds of add-ons. If necessary, as the afternoon progresses, I will read the list. Many of the supplementals that went to President Reagan, President Carter, and President Bush had not one or two little pieces of language, lots of pieces. I will give you some idea of how on every supplemental, I believe without many exceptions, the Congress has expressed its will. We have input. We deserve some consideration. These are not insignificant issues. 
I am not convinced, for instance, on census, that at some point, once we fully understand how the sampling might work, that we would not want to do that. I think I have real legitimate questions that I do not know the answers to yet. Rather than let the administration start on down the trail, and we will do this by sampling, I want to know for sure how that is going to be better than enumeration. I want to know who is going to do it, and how it will be done. I do not know the answers. 
All I am saying is, take a time out on this issue, on census, until we have more time to work on it, and then we can resolve it this fall or even next year, but we should not get locked in now before we have had a chance to really look into it. 
So, I yield to my colleague, Senator Daschle, and ask my colleague to answer this question: If the Senate cannot consider this bill today, would he be in a position, if we cannot do it today, to grant consent for the Senate's consideration during Wednesday's session of the birth defects research program bill?

Mr. LOTT. I note the figure I used on the parking garage in Cleveland, OH, was not the accurate number. It is actually $12 million. It also has other interesting things in here, including $3 million for the Olympics counterterrorism fund, $3 million for Indian health care, $9 million for California vineyards. 
These may all be good programs and all deserving, but I wonder how they found their way into this supplemental appropriations bill. 
Also, I was here during the 1980's and early 1990's. I remember how supplementals worked. Unfortunately, I used to plead with President Reagan not to send supplemental requests up here because I knew it would become a freight train pulling all kinds of things through. I remember Presidents of both parties objecting to things that Congress added to the supplemental appropriations bills. The one we had June 30, 1989, I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine add-ons. Some are not exactly insignificant, either, like East European refugee assistance, foreign aid to Haiti, funds for the Washington Convention Center. The supplemental appropriations also had about nine add-ons, including renewing section 8 housing contracts. 
Remember, supplementals are always alleged to be--while they may not all be natural disasters--they are always alleged to be somewhat emergency, or otherwise they would not be coming to the floor of the Congress saying, `Give us some more money.' Most administrations and Congress always underfund food stamp programs, knowing full well we will come back next year and add more money to it. 
Again, some of this is pretty significant legislation and pretty costly, also. 
The same thing again in 1991 and 1994. There is always language that is added. There is always funding that is added to these bills beyond what was originally requested. So, to infer that this is really something new or different is not the case. 
Now, what I maintain is different here, if I could make this point.

Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to respond if I could make this point. 
When I have suggested, and others have suggested, let's work together to work this out, I give credit to the Democratic leader. He has always been willing to listen, and I think that some of the things we have suggested he has been willing to think about and discuss with his colleagues. And he, like I, we cannot always say it will be this way or that way. We have a conference we deal with and you have an administration that you have to deal with. I have asked the President and his chief of staff, `Please respond. Come back. Let's see if we cannot work this out.' Basically, what they are saying is, `Give us the money and no language. We want it our way and no other way.' It does not work that way. 
However, in the realization and in recognition of the need for some of this to be done, I am advocating while we continue to work on that, that we do a smaller bill that would address some of the concerns that the Senator from South Dakota has. 
I yield to the Senator from North Dakota, if I could.

Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield, I have been an advocate of doing that for probably about 3 weeks, and I would 
entertain doing it. I tell you why I said it to Senator Daschle earlier today, so that we can do something quickly. Even if we came to an agreement here in the next 24 hours on how we would do this, it would still have to go through the committees and both floors, with amendments in order. It would take time. 
This approach that you are suggesting, and I am suggesting, could take 24 hours if we put our heads to it, and we could go on and continue to work and think about the additional money. And the language, keep it in mind now, I do not know how much they are worried about some of these other issues, but I have the impression from the administration that they have a couple of other issues that they are very, very interested in. So it is not just two. 
But I am interested in, and I would like to work that out, and, again, we would have to do it over here, and we would have to get it done on the other side of the Capitol and the President would have to be willing to sign it. 
I think that approach makes sense--that is all I am saying. Common sense around here usually works pretty darn good.

Mr. LOTT. I think that could be done quickly. It would take--I don't think it could get done right here and how. I'd like to talk further with your leader. One of the problems with the appropriations is they generally begin on the other side. But in furtherance of what you are saying, I have discussed this this morning with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee here in the Senate and with the Speaker of the House. 
I presume he is consulting with his chairman and others. So I think this is the process by which we might move pretty quickly. 
I think there are opponents to this. There are urgent things sort of now with regard to some of the disaster programs--perhaps some of the housing programs, perhaps some of the agriculture. There is a need to get this done as soon as possible because of weather considerations and so forth. 
There is a second and third component. There are some other parts of it, some money that will need to be available and that will be available for months and even years down the line. 
So there are really two parts of it. The part that is somewhat in the emergency category is different from what we usually have because you are talking about some new programs and some new ideas--which I think have some attractiveness, by the way. I have said that publicly and to the people from your States; I think it is the way to go. I think it would save money if we can find a way to move people out of what you call the flood way--what we call the floodplain in my neck of the woods--into areas where they will not be flooded year after year. That would wind up in the long run saving money. 
So there is that part. 
Then there is the funding for the longer term which could be available maybe for your State and may be available for other States as we look at these various disasters. 
I will yield to the Senator from Missouri. But let me wrap this up. I am ready. I am willing. And I want to work with you to see if we can't do it that way.

Mr. LOTT. That has not been made clear, if I could respond to the question in this discussion. But I think repeatedly it has been noted that there is money in the pipeline. The distinguished Senator from Missouri is the chairman of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction in that area. He knows what is available and what should be available to FEMA for housing-type programs. Clearly those funds are flowing. We do need to prospectively for the future have additional funds. But the money is there. 
I have spoken to the head of FEMA, James Lee Witt, to ask him that specific question. I have asked him, `Do you need to do something more; something different? You do have the money, don't you? You do have temporary housing available, don't you? If you do not, we would like to help make sure that you have that temporary housing money available and the temporary housing available.' 
So I think the Senator makes a very good point.

Mr. LOTT. In answer to the Senator's question, that is my understanding. I have been through these disaster situations. I know there is a painful period during which you must have assessments and you must have plans. It is the most difficult time of all. It is actually worse a month after a disaster than it is the day after, in some respects. Or certainly after 6 months you begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
We checked this morning from the staff standpoint with regard to FEMA funds available. I understand there is $1.5 billion available as of this morning. 
So there are funds available, and they are, I believe, probably flowing to the various States that have been affected.

Mr. LOTT. In answer to the Senator's question, it is absolutely right. 
I thank the Senator from Missouri for his work on this legislation. He has worked for a good long while and with the help of a lot of other Senators. 
He is absolutely right, also, that we have tried this afternoon, during which time we can do this birth defects legislation while we see if we can work out some agreement or some emergency disaster bill. It would have to pass the House. Also, in connection with the Senator's stand, we want to talk about the supplemental. 
I am prepared to work with the Senator from South Dakota to make sure we have adequate time later on this afternoon and tonight to have a full discussion. 
I thought last week having protracted discussion would have been counterproductive to trying to get an agreement, to get it completed. If the Senators feel strongly that they want time to do that tonight, my advice is to accommodate you in that effort. Of course, we will want Senators from our side of the aisle to have equal time or opportunity to speak also. 
I thank the Senator for his questions. I know he is prepared and ready to go to the birth defects legislation. 
Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question only.

Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, if I could respond to the question and comments, the Senator is suggesting right there at the end that we try to move the emergency disaster portion of this as expeditiously as possible. I suggested a way we can do that. 
I want to remind the Senator also that this additional funding and authorization, I believe, would be available--would have been available yesterday--if the President had signed the bill, a bill that 67 Senators voted for. It would have been available yesterday just like that. But the President of the United States vetoed it because of language that he is not happy with, and, I repeat, a bill that got 67 Senators to vote for it, including, I think, a majority or very close to a majority of Democrats. I know why. And I know that there are some areas where the youth program is being suggested, and I hope we can find a way to move that expeditiously, as has been suggested.

Mr. LOTT. In responding to the question, there are perhaps some programs or agencies that may not have specific disaster funds. I know that the Senator from South Dakota has advocated something new or different with regard to livestock, if that is an accurate way to put it. 
I know that agriculture has a good bit of money that they could use in a variety of ways that would be helpful. But, as I understand it, this would be a new program which I am sympathetic to. But before any of this is done, I repeat once again, there has to be a plan. 
I just say to my colleagues here again that as soon as we complete this dialog and then we hear from others who are awaiting to speak from both sides of the aisle, including the Senator from Minnesota, who wishes to be heard, I will be glad to talk further with the Senators from North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota, or any other States. We can talk about how we can do this thing expeditiously while we continue to work on the bigger package. 
Also, I would like to note, if I could, that we hope to move other issues in the days ahead. 
I mentioned that I believe we hope to consider the State Department authorization bill next week, as well as the DOD authorization bill. We need to get this resolved as soon as we can so we can get on to those important issues. 
I understand that my Democratic colleagues have also objected to the permission of committees to meet during today's session. One of those committees, which is very important, is the Armed Services Committee. The Armed Services Committee is marking up the Department of Defense authorization bill for the next fiscal year. 
This year, unlike a lot of past years, I had the impression that the DOD authorization bill and the Armed Services Committee marking up is going smoothly and that it is not going to be as controversial as it has been in the past; that we may have one or two big amendments, but that this is something we can do in a relatively short period of time--perhaps 3 days. 
The Armed Services Committee had three subcommittee meetings planned today in an effort to prepare or report the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
I really regret that objection. Needless to say, this objection to committee meetings will only delay and hamper their ability to report this bill. 
Then, of course, during the week of the 23d, the Senate will consider both reconciliation bills, both the spending restraint and realignment-of-spending bill. And the tax legislation will be reported out of the Finance Committee. 
So we are going to have long days and nights ahead of us. I want the Members to be on notice that we must get this work done before our Fourth of July recess. Therefore, in anticipation of that, Senators should be prepared to be here at least next week throughout all of the week and probably the next week, too. The objection to the birth defects bill, as well as the provisions for committees to meet, will only make these last few weeks even longer. 
I understand what you are trying to accomplish here. I hope that we can find a way to allow the committees to meet, and I hope to do that later on this afternoon. 
Then I would like also to talk to the Senator from South Dakota the Democratic leader about exactly what we need to do in terms of debate tonight and how long you are thinking about. Also, I need to talk to all of you about how we can move something very quickly and expeditiously.

Mr. LOTT. In response to that question, why, of course. We all have that interest. As a matter of fact, 35 States have had some amount of disasters--whether it is flooding, freezes, or whatever it may be--including my own State, in which I think for three or four counties a request was made by our Governor to have disaster assistance available, which I might note has been turned down by FEMA even though the State right across the river, which was also flooded, was approved. 
But in answer to the Senator's question, the Senate, the Congress, has always shown a desire to, as a matter fact, address natural disasters; 
and also a desire to avoid manmade disasters like the fiascoes we have had 11 times since 1981 of Government shutdowns that also cause people pain and suffering and loss of their jobs and income. So, yes, I feel that sympathy. I have been through it. I have been through hurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, droughts----

Mr. LOTT. There seems to be an abundance of selective memory around here. I remember--in fact, I have been through how that disaster legislation has worked. In fact, I was a staff member one time on the biggest one of all where we did not have FEMA. We did not have existing law. In fact, if you go back and look at the history of what has led to FEMA, it was in legislation we drafted in 1969. The disaster occurred August 18, as I recall it was, something like that, and we had to rely on the Corps of Engineers and people, volunteers to come in and help us. It was weeks, weeks before we got the legislation and, in fact, got many of the programs to help us. In fact, we did not have a lot of the programs that are now on the books. 
I am not saying that that is good. I think we have learned from that experience.

Mr. LOTT. I am glad we have been through that, and now we are going to provide, as we always have, the assistance that is needed to the people in America who cannot help themselves. 
There is one thing that worries me about part of this bill. There is a lot of spending in here that does not relate to these disasters. It has just sort of been added as it's gone along, and I am not putting that just on Democrats either. A lot of these projects, if I go down the list, I can trace them back to some of my colleagues. But we are going to get this done. We can do the emergency stuff, and we can do the bigger package. 
But right now everybody is trying to find a way to prevail or to claim victory or to get the PR victory, and I am not--I did not say you. I said we. And when we decide, once we make up our minds we are going to get this done, short term or long term, we are going to find a way to do it. But the fact is, as has always been the case--and it will be this time--the people who have been hurt and hit with these disasters in a variety of States are going to get the help they need.

Mr. LOTT. I say again I would like that to happen. I am hopeful, and I believe we can get a clean bill through this week but it will not be $8.6 billion. It would be only--the only chance we have to do that, what you are suggesting at this point, would be the truly emergency portions of the bill. 
Now, we may also get an agreement on the bigger package and language that would be attached to it, but based on what I have experienced during the last 4 days, I think that is going to take a little longer. 
Keep in mind now, I have not been up in Minneapolis, MN, or the delta of Mississippi and not thinking about this. I have been on the phone. I have been probing. I have suggested a variety of ways to solve these problems. I did it on Friday. I did it on Monday. I did it last night. I am trying to find a way to solve this problem, and I am open to suggestions with regard to the census language, for instance. I confess this openly here because I am not ashamed of it at all. I went to the Democratic leader, and I said I think you see what our concerns are. Is there some language that you all could live with? 
This is not insignificant. When you talk about changing the way the census is done, this is not without major implications. We do have language in the Constitution with regard to the census. I talked to the Secretary of Commerce this very morning. I am not sitting over in a corner just trying to outlast you guys. I have talked to FEMA, the head of FEMA. I have talked to the Secretary of Commerce. I have talked to the Chief of Staff of the President of the United States. I have talked to the President of the United States, the Democratic leadership, the Speaker of the House. 
This morning I was talking to the Secretary of Commerce. I said one of the things--or he suggested one of the things we might do would be to set up a process where there could be a quick judicial determination of this constitutional question. 
That is important. And census is important for more than just how you count. It is also important from the standpoint of how many representatives a State has--very important. It also has a great impact on how you get Federal funds. I have towns in my State of Mississippi, and I know it is true in Minnesota, that because of the census count, either undercounting or not proper counting programs, that are not eligible as far as some of our Federal programs, some of the Federal grants and loans, and so this is very important for a long time.

Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, I have two answers. I have suggested to you today, to the leader on your side of the aisle and the Senators from North Dakota, there is a way we can get the emergency funding and do it quickly if we make up our minds and are determined to do that while we continue to work on the solutions here. 
But the other point with regard to the census, the reason why I make the explanation is to show once again an abundance--we can solve this. We can solve this problem, but there is a reason why we have to do it now. The die is being cast; the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce have indicated we are going to do this. And if we wait until October to deal with this issue, we are going to be in a position of having to reverse something that is already set in place. They are getting ready to do it. So we do not have the luxury of saying, well, we will pick up on this in July or September or October. 
It would be a fait accompli by then. 
So that is a consideration. But we will continue to work on that, and we will find--I think we can find a way to do this this afternoon. 
Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to ask another question?

Mr. LOTT. Well, I am trying to answer the question. I am not going to say here that it is going to be--I do not know, for instance, what the exact amount is, what the total amount is that would be alleged to, or would be needed for the disaster assistance, so how can I say what the number would finally be? But I am prepared to say this, that there is a difference between the total amount that is requested over a period of months and years for disaster and those parts of it that are urgent, that need to be addressed now, and that is the part I am really focused on. But I am not prepared to say it would be even limited just to that. I think we need to look at what is really needed right now and in the short term or in the foreseeable future and go with that number. I think we have to talk--are you on the appropriations committee?

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-41-19970610</DOCNO>

Mr. LOTT. If I can respond to that, it is interesting the Senator would raise that. As a matter of fact, I believe that one of the things that will probably be indicated as urgent disaster need would be in the transportation area which is different from the $694 million that is in the bill, and let me just emphasize this. The President in that area asked I think for about $300 million, but along the way that figure grew to almost $1 billion. I have seen this figure I believe that is there, $694 million. I think that has to do with ISTEA and the allocation formula and that there is a separate emergency transportation item that we might consider. It may not be accurate, but that is the impression I have. That $694 million is for funds all over the country not related to the disaster.

Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, one of the things that amazes me is the President of the United States would veto a disaster bill because he doesn't want language in there that says we won't have a Government shutdown. As a matter of fact, if we can get this problem worked out now, it will avoid a problem we are surely going to have in October, where, once again, like we do almost every year, we have these fun and games where there is a threat of various departments or agencies or Government shutdowns that has been used by Democrats and Republicans--most effectively, by the Democrats. And all I am saying is, you know, we could work this out. I have suggested some language that I believe most of you could live with, and we ought to go ahead and do that and get this issue resolved and move on. 
Of course, obviously, the purpose here would be to separate these things out where the President could veto them, if he wanted to, and not resolve the problem. Why move these on down the line toward another disaster--as I have already pointed out, a manmade disaster--at the end of the fiscal year?

Mr. LOTT. Let me just say, in order to allow other Members to speak, would the minority leader be willing to allow us consent to provide for speeches by Senators Daschle, Grams, Hutchinson, Dorgan, Sarbanes, Bond, Wellstone, Nickles, or his designee, say for 10 minutes each, and following those statements that I be recognized?

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19970610</DOCNO>

Mr. LOTT. I would not want to exclude them. I think this would just get an agreement that these Senators that are here, waiting for an opportunity to speak--I would like to amend that list to include the Senator from North Dakota--that we get a lineup of speakers, led off by the distinguished Democratic leader. Senator Grams has been waiting to speak; Senator Hutchinson, who is an original cosponsor of the Government shutdown prevention language, and Senator Dorgan and Senator Sarbanes have been waiting. Senator Bond is here and wishes to speak on his birth defects bill. That has been blocked now. It is a bill we should be able to have some limited debate on and get agreement to move on. 
Senator Wellstone, I am sure, would like to be recognized, Senator Conrad and Senator Nickles, or his designee, for 10 minutes each with their statements, and then I be recognized at end of that group. 
Then, if others come in, we will get time for others to speak, too. There is no desire to cut Senators off. I am just trying to set up some regular order where I don't hog all the time and I am in a position of saying to you I will yield for a question only so I do not lose control of the floor. 
Let's set up an orderly process and we all get our chance to make our speeches, make our statements, without being just a question or response to the question. Would the Senator object to that?

But when we begin the debate or comments other Senators are going to make, we will talk with you about how much time we think we need and how we will do that. It is my inclination today to try to get it worked out, where we could have an understanding, an understood period of time, and to not go with a motion to adjourn.

Here is the alternative. If you like, I'll just keep talking here. We can go right on until some other time here in the afternoon. But I would like to have a free-flowing discussion, so I would like to do it in an orderly way. 
I asked unanimous consent, and then we will get an agreement, I presume later on, that we will have an extended period of time for debate during which Senators will be able to speak for extended periods of time.

I think we could work that out. I am indicating to you I would like for you to be able to have that time tonight. But I have been asked for three different things to agree to. I asked for one thing in return, and that's for committees to meet. I am going to have to go through a parliamentary procedure here in order for committees to be able to meet. 
Let us do this. Let us talk while others are talking and we could work this out. I think there is no question we can get that done. 
Mr. President, I renew my request that the Senators that I outlined be allowed to speak for 10 minutes and that I be recognized at the end of this list, at which time, if there are other Senators who wish to speak, they will be recognized or we will work out an order so the debate can continue.

I don't know exactly what you all are thinking about or what you want, but there is no desire to cut the Senator from North Dakota off today. I want him to be able to make his case. I am going to work with you to do that, and I think the record will show I have done that sort of thing in the past. I am telling you here, now, we are going to find a way for you to be able to make the speech you want to make. What more can you ask of me now?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, my consent request was for the Armed Services Committee to meet on S. 450, the Department of Defense authorization bill. They are the Subcommittees on Airland Forces, Strategic Forces, Seapower, Acquisition, and Technology. Also, for the Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs and the Subcommittee on Foreign Relations to meet on some very important issues, with witnesses to be Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. William J. Bennett, and Michael J. Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, Father Keith Roderick of the Coalition for the Defense of Human Rights, prepared and waiting to testify before that committee. 
The second panel includes Col. Sharbel Barakat, a witness from Iran, and an anonymous witness from Pakistan. 
In addition to that, we asked for the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee, Committee of Commerce, to meet with regard to NASA's international space program, which we have been working feverishly to make work, with other countries including Russia. 
Those are the committees that are prepared to meet this afternoon. They have witnesses lined up of both parties and a variety of positions. That has been objected to. I thought it was appropriate we put in the Record that objection is heard. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have very important committee work that needs to be done. As the Senate knows, the bulk of the work and the writing that goes on in the Senate does occur in committees at the hearings and markups. We have a very important markup now that we need to get done in the Armed Services Committee. The defense of our country is, obviously, something we want to pay very close attention to. We have less than a week in which the Armed Services Committee needs to complete its work. 
I would prefer that we get an agreement that the Armed Services Committee, as is always--almost always--the case, be allowed to meet with these other committees. I understand the Senator has a problem, some objections from his conference. I also would prefer that we have an hour of debate equally divided so that Senators who have been patiently waiting for quite some time can be heard, including Senators here now, and Senator Grams of Minnesota who has been waiting to be heard. 
I also had hoped that we could work together and get a time worked out whereby we could have extended debate tonight. It doesn't appear that we can work that out. So, I would be prepared to proceed at this time. 
Does the Senator have any other comment he would like to make before I propound a unanimous-consent request?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also had hoped that we would be able to work out an agreement where there wouldn't be objection to my motion to proceed to the Birth Defects Prevention Act--this is broadly supported legislation; I don't see how there could be objection to it--while we continue to work to find ways to move other legislation while committees are meeting. 
I understand the pressure that Senators feel on both sides of the aisle on other issues, but I don't see why that should cause us to halt or prevent us from taking up a very noncontroversial, broadly bipartisan supported legislation like S. 419. 
I am also hopeful that this week we could take up the adoption legislation that we have been holding in abeyance for a week. And the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, has done very good work on that and I believe is prepared to spend time on the floor when we call up that legislation. I hope it will be in the next coming days. 
Let us be clear about what this legislation does, the birth defects legislation. No one in this body needs to be told that birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in this country. They are directly responsible for one 1 of every 5 infant deaths. Here is a chance to do something about that, not in a week, not in a month, but this afternoon with, I am sure, not very long debate but enough debate so that the issue can be properly addressed. 
We have spent the last couple of hours or so talking about other issues other than this bill which we had hoped to call up and begin debating. 
No one needs to be told that every year some 150,000 infants are born with a serious birth defect. Here is a chance to do something about that. 
Here is a chance to foster the most effective--and, by the way, the most cost effective--ways to prevent birth defects. 
We now know that folic acid vitamin supplements can prevent spina bifida. We know that programs to promote avoidance of alcohol, especially early in pregnancy, can dramatically reduce a whole range of birth defects. 
We want to get that knowledge out to those who need it. Senator Bond's bill would do that through regional research programs to identify the causes of clusters of birth defects. 
His bill, which, by the way, is cosponsored by more than a score of Senators on both sides of the aisle, makes the Centers for Disease Control the lead agency for surveillance of birth defects and prevention activities to reduce their incidence. 
His bill proposes grants to public and nonprofit groups to foster public awareness in ways to prevent birth defects. It would also set up a National Information Clearinghouse on Birth Defects. 
This legislation, to which there has been objection, is really important and is endorsed by a wide range of groups: The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Mental Retardation, the American Hospital Association, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, the American Public Health Association, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the March of Dimes, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National Perinatal Association, the National Easter Seal Society, and the Spina Bifida Association. 
On their behalf, I again renew my concern. There has been objection to this bill. On their behalf, I ask that we confer and see if we cannot find a way to bring up this legislation, if not today, tomorrow, while we work on other solutions to other problems. 
It is not a partisan issue. It is not controversial. And all that Senator Bond has sought has received support across the political lines and he has urged that we take it up this week. It would be different if it were controversial or if this were a partisan issue. But it is not. It is one that I think we certainly need to get passed. And a lot of good work has gone into it. And I will continue to ask that it be brought up this week. And I will certainly confer with the leaders on the other side of the aisle as we try to find a way to bring to the consideration of the Senate legislation that would help with this very serious and very difficult problem of birth defects. 
So now I ask----

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-6-19970610</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would respond to that, if I could, that certainly it is again not controversial. There has been a lot of work done on it. There have been hearings on this bill. And I believe an almost identical provision, if not identical, was a part of the comprehensive health legislation that came up last year. That was a different Congress, but it is not as if it is a new idea. It has been around for awhile. And a number of Senators are very familiar with what it would do, including the Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. President, because he has been so diligent in his effort to wait to be heard, and recognizing that it does not appear we are going to be able to work out some agreement where he could make a statement, I, if I can, yield to the Senator from Minnesota for the purposes of a question so that he could at least address a question that frames his concerns in this area.

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-7-19970610</DOCNO>

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will respond to the question and comments framing that question by the Senator from Minnesota. I appreciate what he has had to say. And I appreciate his interest in getting this assistance provided. He has been constructive and helpful in that he has been suggesting a variety of ways we could try to come to an agreement on how to proceed here. 
He is absolutely right that, as a matter of fact, what we passed last week was a compromise. There had been funds added, language added. And, as a matter of fact, the language dealing with the Government shutdown prevention was a compromise provision. Senator McCain, one of the original sponsors, along with Senator Hutchison, offered an amendment and actually raised the level of funding whereby the Government would continue basically at the current year level until an agreement was reached on the next year's appropriations bills. 
So it was compromise language. I mean, it should not go without people's notice that it got 67 votes here in the Senate. This matter can be resolved. It can be done quickly. It could have already been dealt with if the President just signed the bill. 
The President is not without tools to work with the Congress. But he must understand--and I know the American people understand--that we, as representatives of the people, have a coequal voice in this Government. We have a right to be heard. And we have a right to have very important issues that we are concerned about addressed. 
So I again appreciate the Senator's patience here and his suggestions. I know he is going to continue to work with leadership on both sides of the aisle and across the Capitol where he served in trying to find an appropriate solution to this problem.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would also like to inquire of the Senator from Texas. Senator Hutchison, had indicated that she had hoped to be able to speak. I wonder if she has a question she would like to propound at this time because I would 
be able to yield to her at this time, under the rules we find ourselves confronted with, only for a question. So I ask that she frame her comments in the form of a question.

<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-9-19970610</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in responding to the question by the Senator from Texas, obviously I think that she is suggesting a route that is appropriate. There is a difference between a supplemental appropriations in its normal sense and a supplemental appropriations that includes some emergency provisions. Clearly, they could be separated out and moved as the Senator from Texas has suggested. 
I want to commend the Senator from Texas for her work as a member of the Appropriations Committee, a member that knows what is in the bill and what is not. And I think some Senators have not had an opportunity to look at all the things that have been added in terms of language and additional spending and programs which may be worthwhile but which are much more in the supplemental range, not in the emergency range, and also could be dealt with in the regular appropriations process. 
We are in the period of time now in this year when we ought to be doing our regular appropriations bills. And the need for a supplemental for many of these provisions has been long since past. 
Also, I just have to say, the idea of resolving this issue about the annual confusion at the end of the fiscal year, the threats of and in fact the shutdowns of programs or Agencies, Departments of the Government, that idea originated with the Senator from Texas and Senator McCain. They are the ones who said we need to resolve this now, not October 1 or October 15 or November 1 when we are going through these fiascoes. 
The suggestion was that we solve this problem now. The language that was introduced, which was subsequently compromised, by the way, to raise the funding above what the Senator from Texas wanted, originated from her. 
I challenge anybody in this institution or anywhere to suggest that the Senator from Texas is not concerned about the need for the disaster assistance or the funds for the Department of Defense. She knows that this issue is important, and she also knows it can be resolved. It can be resolved quickly and it can be resolved in terms of working out language that would serve the American people well in stopping these annual Government shutdown activities. 
I commend her for the work she has done, the leadership she has provided, and for the fact she continues to say we can work through this with language which may be different from what she originally started with but with language that is acceptable, or that we go with emergency language only. 
I yield to the Senator from Texas for a further question.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, clearly, the Senator from Texas, 
Senator Hutchison, is right on this. She knows her business. She is on the Appropriations Committee. 
I do not know what the exact figure is but probably of the $8.6 billion in this supplemental, well over half of it could not remotely qualify as disaster. It is probably in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion of the $8.6 that would not qualify as emergency disaster, either because it is not directly needed and/or because it could be handled through the regular appropriations bills. Clearly, a large portion of this bill would not qualify as emergency disaster. Again I do not know the exact amount. We have to hear further from the committee members, and I presume we will as the time goes forward.

Mr. LOTT. I will yield if the Senator allows me to make a couple of points. I want to go back and reconfirm something I said a moment ago to make sure it is correct in the Record. 
The bill that we are trying to get brought up, the birth defects bill, is not a new bill. It was one that has had a lot of work, and the substitute that we have now is going to be considered when we get permission to bring it up. There has been objection to bringing up the birth defects bill by the Democrats. It is almost identical to the language that was approved by the committee on Labor and Human Resources in 1995 and passed the full Senate in September 1996 as part of the Health Profession's Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act, S. 555. 
So the Senate is familiar with this. The Senate has worked on it. The Senate has voted on it. It is not a new issue or one that we are trying to put out without it having been considered by committee or having been considered by the full Senate in the recent past. 
I want the Record also to reflect that I have tried to get the Democrats to agree for the Armed Services Committee to meet, and other committees, on very important issues. They have objected to bringing up the birth defects bill. They have objected to the Armed Services Committee meeting, the Foreign Relations Committee meeting, the Science Committee from meeting. I even offered an opportunity for us to divide an hour of debate time equally on both sides and to get an agreement where we could have extended debate tonight, and I suggested even as late as midnight, 6 hours, 7 hours, whatever amount of time that might have been called for. But that was not accepted because they would not agree for the Armed Services Committee to meet and to do their markup work. 
I want to say again, my Democratic colleagues have objected to bringing up the birth defects bill, they have objected to very important committees meeting with very important witnesses, and a markup of the Department of Defense. They have objected to dividing the time equally so all Senators can be heard in 10-minute segments of their own time, and they have even refused an offer that I have made for this debate to go on for an extended period of time, perhaps even as late as midnight tonight. 
Now, before I make any further motion, did the Senator from North Dakota have a question he would like to ask? And I yield for the purpose of a question.

Mr. LOTT. I would be willing to work with him in that regard. I think we definitely can do it. I believe we will have some time here in a moment where maybe we can talk about that. 
Here is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is convening. I have seen him work miracles before, and I know he is prepared to do that again this time with the help from the Senators from North Dakota and the Senator from Texas. 
Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to ask a question with regard to the situation?

Mr. President, I appreciate the questioning of the Senator from Oklahoma, and I say that the procedure which I am about to carry out here has been forced by the fact that we can't get consideration of the birth defect legislation, we can't get permission for key committees to meet, and we can't get a time agreement on how the debate will occur.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am here to talk to my colleagues about used cars. No, not to sell you one, but more importantly, to protect Americans who buy used cars. I am joined by my friend and colleague Senator Ford in introducing legislation which will require that the title of a vehicle, at the time of resale, indicate that it has been significantly damaged. This bill is about safety. This bill is about consumer protection. 
We believe America's policy must protect used car consumers from unknowingly purchasing automobiles which have been totaled and rebuilt, but sold as undamaged vehicles. Often these vehicles have serious safety problems. We want you to join us in helping to protect the public. In the last Congress, I worked with Senator Exon to advance similar legislation. We need to complete the job this Congress. 
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's automobile auction figures, the practice of selling rebuilt salvage vehicles as undamaged used cars costs consumers and the auto industry nearly $4 billion annually. In some States, as many as 70 percent of all totaled vehicles may return to the roads after being purchased by unsuspecting buyers. This is dangerous to everyone on America's highways. 
While most States require some type of disclosure on the title indicating a vehicle's history, the requirements vary from State to State. Some rebuilders take advantage of these inconsistencies in State titling procedures to obtain clean titles that bear no indication of previous vehicle damage. Not only does this type of fraud affect the consumer's wallet, it also threatens the consumer's safety. 
Several years ago, Congress established a Federal task force to study this issue. This consumer friendly bill stems from the recommendations of that task force. 
Our bill requires that any vehicle with damage exceeding 75 percent of its preaccident value be designated as a salvage vehicle. If the salvage vehicle is rebuilt and placed back on the road, the title to the vehicle must be branded as a rebuilt salvage vehicle and it must have an inspection to assure that stolen parts were not used in the repair. In addition, all rebuilt salvage vehicles must have a decal permanently affixed to the driver's side door jamb indicating that the vehicle has been rebuilt. It will also specify whether the vehicle has passed an approved safety inspection. 
Mr. President, the number of victims in the rebuilt salvage vehicle industry is growing, and it must be stopped. We need to establish policies to stop these illegal practices and protect American drivers. Along with Mr. Ford, I urge you to join us as a cosponsor of this common sense legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until the hour of 2 p.m. to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. At 2 p.m., it is my hope that we will begin debate on the supplemental appropriations conference report. We are working to get a 2-hour debate agreement on that supplemental conference report, of course, to be followed by a vote. 
Then after that debate, the Senate will, hopefully, be able to begin consideration of the budget resolution conference report with 3 hours of debate on that. Therefore, Senators can expect votes on both the supplemental appropriations conference report and the budget conference report before the Senate adjourns this evening. I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
I might also note, we hope to be able to confirm the nomination late this afternoon of Elizabeth Anne Moler to be Deputy Secretary of Energy. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will shortly adjourn over until Monday at noon, 12 o'clock. I announce to all Senators that no votes will occur on Monday prior to the hour of 5 p.m. I expect a lengthy period of morning business on Monday to accommodate a number of requests, and I will update the Democratic leader at a later time with respect to potential legislation the Senate may consider on Monday. We have already had one conversation about that, and we will have some more here in a few minutes. 
Before I consider two housekeeping items, I would like to thank all Senators for their cooperation this week. The Senate has now passed a budget resolution outlining a long overdue balanced budget for our Nation, and I congratulate all those Senators who have participated in the negotiations. Again, I thank Senator Domenici, the chairman of Budget Committee, and Senator Lautenberg, who also has worked with us getting through some problems we ran into. They both did an excellent job. The Senate also adopted the supplemental appropriations conference report. Consequently, I think this has been a good week, and I hope we can continue that next week.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. By previous consent, Senator Kennedy or his designee will be recognized for 30 minutes of debate to be followed by Senator Ashcroft for up to 30 minutes. At the expiration of that time, the Senate will proceed to a vote on cloture on the substitute amendment to S. 4. Senators can therefore expect that cloture vote at approximately 4 p.m. today. I guess it will probably be shortly after 4. Senators are also reminded that they have until 3:30 this afternoon in order to file second-degree amendments to the substitute to S. 4. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked and the Senate can then proceed to conclude action on this very important measure. If that is the case, Senators should be prepared to continue the debate and vote on amendments to S. 4. 
In addition, as previously announced, it is my hope that we can conclude work on the budget conference report--and I understand the conferees have met today and should be able to complete the conference, if not this afternoon, sometime tomorrow--and the supplemental appropriations conference report as soon as those items are available for consideration. 
Now, I understand that some of my colleagues are concerned about the supplemental appropriations conference report and are now talking about extensive debate. I do want to say that I have just been advised that the conferees have been working and they feel they have made real good progress and, as a matter of fact, they could conclude action on the conference report even within the hour now. Knowing how conferences work, sometimes when you get right to the end, that last 10 percent or 2 percent causes a problem and they may still encounter further delays. But the appropriators and the conferees are meeting, they are working, and I believe they are making progress. Hopefully, they will get to some conclusion this afternoon on the conference report that we could vote on. 
I understand the frustration of Members on all sides. It is very important language here. The administration needs to understand that Pennsylvania Avenue is a two-way street. It doesn't just come from the Capitol down to the White House, where we send down billions of the taxpayers' dollars; we have to get a little cooperation. We feel very strongly about the importance of a law enforcement commission to take a look at the overall application of law enforcement in America. We feel very strongly about the census issue. How do we make sure that it's fair and thorough and complete and accurate? We may come to an agreement on how that can be done, either in terms of actual count or some modification, but not without consultation and not without the Congress being involved in a constitutional issue. We also remind people that the only way--the only way--the disaster funds will stop flowing from FEMA or SBA--and the money is flowing right now--is if we have some sort of fun and games at the end of the fiscal year with a Government shutdown. 
I think we can work these matters out. We should. But everybody needs to understand these are important issues. This is not abnormal. I have been through supplemental bills probably 24 times or more in my career in Congress. I have been through disasters. There is nothing new here. There is nothing 
out of order here. We need to keep working together, and if we heighten the rhetoric and the partisanship, it doesn't help. 
I tried my very best to make sure that the Senate in fact is a family friendly workplace. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, we have flexibility in our schedules and we have tried not to work into the wee hours of the night. In fact, I think only one night this year have we gone beyond 8:30. I think that is wise, because over the years I have noticed that any time the Congress, House or Senate, stays in after about 8 o'clock, they start making mistakes. And some of us still have wives that we like to see or spouses that we like to see or children that we enjoy being with. So the threat of staying up all night tonight to talk about a bill that in fact we hope we can come to agreement on shortly rings hollow to me. Let's just do our work and keep calm and we can get this thing solved.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on the family friendly workplace bill itself, the comptime/flextime issue, I hope that we can come to 
an agreement on this. Senator Daschle has indicated he would like to work with us on it. The President said during the election campaign and, in fact, 2 weeks ago, he would like to work with us on giving some flexibility to workers' schedules. I believe he has indicated that again today. Senator Ashcroft has done such a magnificent job on this bill. In fact, I believe the President said flextime is very important--flexibility is very important. I wrote it down and gave a copy of it to the Senator from Missouri. 
So, we all agree that having a little option of taking your comptime in terms of higher pay or the option of it being some time off, that's a good idea. We all agree, I think, that working spouses ought to have a little flexibility in their schedules. That is who really benefits from the flextime portion of this bill. 
Now, if there are questions or concerns about making sure that it is fair and there is no intimidation, it is truly voluntary, hey, let's work that out. We ought to do that. We want those protections. We want those guarantees. But I want somebody to explain to me how I can explain to the hourly workers in my State that they should not have these options even though Federal employees do. And, as a matter of fact, in truth, so do salaried employees. If they want a little time off, they take it off. But, no, not the hourly workers, not the blue collar workers in my State, not the people out there pulling the load. They don't even have this option. 
Protect them, make sure that the law doesn't get out of control, that it's abused--let's do that. But to have this type of flexibility, to have a more family friendly workplace, isn't that a worthwhile goal? Can't we do this? 
The Senator from Massachusetts and I worked together on some bills that he forced me to work with him on. I didn't particularly want to, but we wound up doing it. We got health insurance reform last year, thanks to the good help of the Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum. This very day, an unbelievable achievement was signed by the President of the United States: IDEA, I-D-E-A, Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. Last year we gave up in exhaustion. We couldn't get it done. This year, because of a lot of good staff work, administration input, Democrats, Republicans, all regions, all races, all ethnic backgrounds, all degrees of philosophy, we came together on a bill that will help education in America--not just for the disabled, but I believe all of our children will be better off because of this bill. We got it done because we put aside our prejudices and our determinations that we were going to be committed to this position or that position and we said we need results and we got results. 
We need to do this on this legislation. Let's get started. Let's work together. If you have amendments, put them up. I would like them to be germane. I would rather we not solve some irrelevant issue. Let's stick to the subject at hand. And I believe the American people would be the beneficiaries. 
So I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote for this cloture, or if they don't, tell us how we can come together and give this opportunity to working Americans. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina. 
This is a very special occasion for the Senate, as we take this time to honor the longest serving Member of this body in history. 
Senator Thurmond is an institution within this institution. Among the American people, he is probably one of the best known--and most recognized--Members of the Senate, every morning opening the Senate dutifully here; almost every day when we open. On rare occasions he is not in the chair. And within this congressional family, he holds a place of respect that is truly unique. I have been honored to serve with him, privileged to learn from him, and proud to call him my friend. 
If the Senate had a Mount Rushmore, Strom would be on it. 
As my colleagues know, Senator Thurmond's stature in the Senate is not just a matter of longevity. It is a matter of accomplishment. 
He was first elected to this body on November 2, 1954, as a write-in candidate, and remains to this day the only person elected to the Senate in that manner. 
He has served here on both sides of the aisle, and in both the majority and the minority. But he will quickly tell you that the majority is better. 
He has chaired both the Armed Services Committee and the Judiciary Committee, and he thereby has made an enduring contribution to both our Nation's security and our system of justice. 
He has stood for causes that were popular and causes that were less so. He has been fearless in defending his views, and what may be more important, equally unafraid to change those views when convinced of the rightness of change. 
I can remember some of his speeches here in the Senate. He holds the record for the longest speech in the history of the Senate. But I remember as a brand-new Senator, he was standing in this aisle here and giving the most vigorous speech in behalf of the need for a criminal law reform that I believe I have ever heard. It was magnificent. 
When Strom Thurmond came to the Senate almost 42 years ago, he brought with him enough accomplishments already for a lifetime. 
He had already been a State senator and circuit judge in his native beloved South Carolina. He had been Governor of the Palmetto State and had been the States Rights candidate for the Presidency in 1948. 
Most telling of all, he had landed in Normandy on D-day with the 82d Airborne. Senator Thurmond has much to be proud of in his Senate career. But I doubt that any honors bestowed on him in the course of that career can rival the decorations he won in the Normandy landing: The Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster and the Bronze Star for Valor. 
All of this, of course, is a matter of public record. But what the public generally does not know, however, is the personality and the fantastic character that Senator Thurmond brings to his work in the Senate. 
I often wish I had his unfailing good humor, which, come to think of it, probably has something to do with his length of service here. He always comes in ready to go to work with a smile on his face, as he did this very morning. 
We all know firsthand how strongly he can argue his point, how fiercely he can defend his values, and how firmly he can put down an opponent who does not have the facts on his side. 
But we also know how courteous he is when the debate is over, how generous he is even to those who do not reciprocate that conduct sometimes, and how respectful he has always been to this institution--and to every Member of this institution. 
He has been a master of the Senate's rules, for he has always understood that those rules--frustrating and bothersome as they may often seem--are what sets the Senate apart as the most extraordinary legislative body in the world. 
He has given so much to his country, in so many different ways, and yet he would resist any attempt on our part to thank him for his lifetime of dedication. For in this regard, Senator Thurmond is truly of the old school: He would rather thank his country for the chance to repay the honor of being an American. After all his years, after all those decades, that is the one appellation that best describes him. Though he has been a Democrat, a Dixiecrat, and a Republican, he has ever been and always will be, most of all, Strom Thurmond, proud American. 
Thank you, Senator Thurmond for what you have done for your State, for your country, and for all of us as individuals. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, these days, just about every aspect of our daily existence is regulated in some way by the Government. And in most instances, it makes sense because we must protect human health and the environment. We would all agree that food and drugs should be inspected, work conditions should be considered and safety measures must be enacted. 
On the other hand, the Federal regulatory system is notorious for producing top-down, one-size-fits-all regulations that are often inefficient and ineffective. These regulations impose tremendous costs on business and industry, increase the costs of goods and services and reduce economic growth. Most importantly, too many regulations fail in what they are trying to do. 
As I look more closely at the patchwork of regulation this Government has created in the last few decades, however, I see regulation for regulation's sake. We are witnessing an eruption of regulation based on inaccurate science, poor judgment, and bad politics. Most shocking is the fundamental lack of trust in the ability of the American people to take responsibility for their own actions. 
I think it's time we returned to the basics, Mr. President. The central goal of regulating is to significantly protect human health, safety or the environment. When held to this standard, many regulations fall short of the mark. So how do we get from here to there? 
First, agencies must begin issuing regulations based on sound science. This means one thing--that any Federal regulation issued must be justified by solid science. This principle sounds very simple, but many agencies have become obsessed with the power to regulate, forgetting that there must be sound scientific reasoning behind their action. 
The time has come to raise the level of debate. No longer can agencies be allowed to dream up and order a regulation without genuine oversight or input from the 
outside scientific world. I know that the more informed Congress is about an issue, the better public policy decision we will make. The same should be true of regulatory agencies. With so many experts in the academic, Federal and private sectors, it is a shame to limit the scope of debate to one elite group of scientists. I have heard some agencies claim that their rulemakings are indeed reviewed by outside experts, but a closer look reveals that these objective scientists are not completely independent. I do not think it unreasonable to ask that there be some consensus among truly independent outside scientific experts as to the proper course of action before issuing a rulemaking. 
The bottom line is that, to effectively regulate, agencies should not issue rules based on anything but honest, peer-reviewed science. Period. 
Second, agencies must learn to correctly assess risk. Beginning with sound science, agencies should look at the real world risks of a situation, recognizing that not every risk is avoidable. Sometimes I think that these agencies are on a mission to create a 100 percent risk-free, accident-free--possibly industry-free--world. They also need to acknowledge that all risks are relative. Regulating small risks can have adverse side effects, resulting in greater risks and less protection. We should focus our efforts and our resources on the greatest risks. 
Agencies should also realize that exposure to a chemical doesn't automatically present a risk or indicate a cause and effect relationship. The risk associated with a given dosage level should be examined. Where exposure to a truckload of almost any toxin poses a significant risk, in most cases, an extremely diluted version may not present any danger at all. Regulators should be sensitive to risks as they relate to dosage instead of assuming that any contact with chemicals presents too great a danger. Too often, regulations are issued based on a better safe than sorry mentality. This can leave us less safe and considerably sorrier. 
In closing, Mr. President, I reiterate the dire need for regulatory reform. The invasive regulatory hands of Government are slowly choking the life out those whom they seek to save. Let's get back to the basics. Using sound, peer-reviewed science, agencies should make a valid assessment of real world risks and determine a solid cause-and-effect correlation before taking action. 
I am committed to enacting regulatory reform in the 105th Congress. I welcome the input and support of my fellow Senators.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate today the names of the four youngsters who are recipients of the 1997 American Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal. 
This is the highest award given to members of school safety patrols throughout the United States. It is presented annually to students, who, while on duty took heroic lifesaving actions to save the life of a fellow student from imminent danger. 
I would like to briefly describe the heroic actions of these four young citizens. 
The first two honorees hail from the State of Ohio. On February 28, 1997, Leawood Elementary School Safety Patrol Captain Surmel D. Cummings and Patrol Edwin H. Berry were assisting students on their way home. Surmel noticed a 6-year-old boy and his 8-year-old cousin walking close to the westbound on-ramp for I-70. 
The cousin was trying to prevent the 6-year-old from climbing over the guardrail next to the on-ramp. Surmel ran over to the two boys and tried to hold the 6-year-old. The boy began hitting and kicking Surmel. Edwin ran to help his partner. The 6-year-old broke loose from Surmel and scrambled over the guardrail. He was now confronted by the fast-moving cars on the on-ramp. Surmel told Edwin to try to get the 6-year-old back across the guardrail while he returned to the school to get help. 
When a car driver started blowing his horn, the 6-year-old covered his ears and turned his back toward Edwin. At that moment, Edwin grabbed the 6-year-old and pulled him back across the guardrail to safety. This was a great team effort by both of these two young men. 
The State of Indiana can be proud of the next honoree. 
While on duty on December 6, 1996, Shambaugh Elementary School Safety Patrol Marcus A. Morgan, noticed a 6-year-old girl running alongside a van. This vehicle had just dropped her off and was pulling away from the curb. Marcus yelled for the girl to stop chasing the van, but he quickly realized the girl's string was caught in the van door. She then fell and was being dragged by the van. 
Marcus raced after the van, shouting for the driver to stop. he ran to the passenger-side and banged on the window to get the driver to stop. The van kept moving so he ran to the driver-side window to get the driver's attention while a parent banged on the passenger-side window. The driver finally stopped after 54 feet. The girl was not seriously injured due to Marcus' quick and heroic actions. 
AAA's last honoree is from California. 
It was a clear afternoon on November 4, 1996, at St. Jarbeth's School when School Safety Patrol Domonique Fines and April Corral took their post on the northwest corner of Harold and Champion Streets. 
A white pickup truck stopped at the stop sign next to their post and then started up the steep hill on Harold Street. Near the top of the hill, the truck stalled and rolled backward. As it came down the hill, the truck picked up speed. 
Unaware of the truck, April handed her patrol sign to Domonique as she bent down to tie her shoe. Domonique noticed the truck rapidly heading toward them. She shouted to April to watch out and started to cross Harold Street to get out of its way. Halfway across the street, Domonique looked back to see if her partner, April, was following her. Unaware of the danger, April was still tying her shoe. Domonique yelled again, but April couldn't hear her over the noise from the street traffic and the playground. 
Unconcerned about her own safety, Domonique ran back to April, grabbed her arm, and pushed her out of the way. The truck jump the curb where April had been tying her shoe and then crashed into a fence. 
I also want to recognize and thank the American Automobile Association for their invaluable safety program and for honoring these outstanding safety patrol members. 
In the 1920's AAA began organizing safety patrol programs whereby older students assist younger students while crossing streets as they walked to and from school. Today, more than 500,000 students across the country serve as AAA safety patrol volunteers. In fact, there are currently 50,000 schools with safety patrols. 
AAA supplies training materials, belts, badges, and other items needed to operate the safety patrol programs. Importantly, AAA promotes and recognizes patrol efforts each year through a series of awards, newsletters, summer camps, and scholarships. 
On behalf of my Senate colleagues, and for parents all across the country, I want to thank AAA. Their work in helping to keep our youngsters a little safer on their way to and from school is extremely praiseworthy. 
I am very proud of Surmel, Edwin, Marcus, and Domonique who exemplified courage and citizenship. I know that their parents and communities are equally as proud. These four youngsters showed great courage in saving another individuals life.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morning, until the hour of 12:30 p.m., the Senate will honor the service of our President pro tempore, Senator Thurmond, as the longest serving Member of the Senate. By previous consent, from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m., the Senate will be in recess to allow for the weekly policy luncheons to meet, and, at 2:15 p.m., the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, with amendments being offered throughout the day to that legislation. 
Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate as we make progress on this most important legislation. 
I want to commend the Senator from Missouri for the time that he has spent on this legislation, and I look forward to further debate and amendments that may be offered. 
A cloture motion was filed yesterday on the pending amendments to S. 4. So Members can anticipate a cloture vote on Wednesday morning. 
As always, Members will be notified accordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to this legislation, or other legislation. 
Also, under the provisions of rule XXII, Senators have until the hour of 12:30 p.m. today in order to file first-degree amendments to the substitute amendment to S. 4. 
It is my hope also that the Senate will conclude action on the concurrent budget resolution and the supplemental appropriations conference report this week. We do not have an exact time yet for those two but we expect that they would come up Wednesday and Thursday, one or the other, as soon as they are available, with the budget resolution conference report being one that we will take up first--hopefully tomorrow. 
I appreciate all Senators' cooperation in this.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will be in session today for a period of morning business to give Senators an opportunity to speak. 
At 2:30 the Senate will resume consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I encourage any Senator who intends to offer an amendment to this legislation to be prepared to offer the amendment during today's session. Any votes ordered on amendments offered today will be set aside with the possibility of votes occurring on those amendments after 5 p.m. today. 
In addition, a cloture motion on S. 4 will be filed today. Therefore, the Senate can expect a vote on cloture on S. 4 to occur on Wednesday morning. 
As a reminder to all Senators, tomorrow from 9:30 until 12:30 a.m. the Senate will honor the services of our President pro tempore, Senator Thurmond, the longest serving Member of the Senate. I encourage all Senators to participate in this important tribute on Tuesday morning. 
For the remainder of the week Senators can anticipate Senate action on the concurrent budget resolution, the supplemental appropriations conference report, and possibly the adoption of legislation. 
As Members are aware, this is the first week of a 4-week legislative period prior to the Fourth of July recess. The Senate has a number of important issues which need to be considered prior to that next recess. We anticipate action on the budget reconciliation bills, both on the spending side and the tax cut bill. 
The DOD authorization should be ready, and the chairman of the committee has asked that we try to reserve time in the latter part of June to do that, if at all possible. 
Product liability legislation is pending, as well as various appropriations bills, including the legislative branch, foreign ops, and Treasury-Postal Service as they become available. 
So we are looking at those three appropriations bills that we would like to be able to finish in the Senate before we go out for the Fourth of July recess. 
As all Members know, this is not an exclusive list that the Senate may consider. There are other issues that are pending legislatively and executive matters as they are cleared. For instance, I understand the national missile defense legislation has cleared the Armed Services Committee. That is an issue that we may be able to take up before the Fourth of July period. 
Therefore, I encourage all Members to adjust their schedules for a busy month of Senate work. That could very well include some votes on Monday afternoons late and evenings on Friday. But later on this week, probably tomorrow, we will try to give Senators some clear idea of what Mondays and Fridays they should expect to be in session. At a minimum, the Friday that we are scheduled to go out for the Fourth of July recess--that would be Friday, June 27--is clearly one that we will likely have to be in session to complete our work on reconciliation bills.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a couple unanimous consent requests that I think Members will be very interested in. First, let me take a moment to comment on the cooperation and the significance of that vote. 
It truly was a bipartisan effort. It was cooperation between the Congress and the President. I think we should be proud of it, and it is an example of what I hope we can do more of in the future. 
I thank the Democratic leader for his efforts, his willingness to be on the floor and work with us on some of these votes. We had a couple of bumpy spots along the way, but I think the result was a good one. 
I particularly thank the chairman of the committee. I know he feels a rush of emotion right now. He has been working on trying to get us to this type of budget resolution for 25 years. I think he has done a great job. I commend him and thank him for the great work he has done.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to recognize the dedication of a gentleman who has long been a part of the Senate. Larry Harrison, Senate Chamber attendant, is retiring after over 36 years of Federal service. 
Larry began his long Government career in the U.S. Army in 1942. Those who have been around the Hill for a while may have known him in various capacities as he worked for the Architect of the Capitol and in the Senate's Environmental Services operation. 
As a Chamber attendant for the past 10 years, Larry frequently was here before we arrived and remained after we left, opening the Chamber in the morning and locking it again after the day's business was completed. He has greeted us each day with a smile and a friendly word. We will all miss Larry around here. 
Larry's retirement will allow him to do something that makes us all a bit envious--and I'm not talking about playing golf, though I'm sure he'll be doing plenty of that, too. He will be spending more time with his wife, Jean, and sons, Michael Henry, Albert Philips, and Kevin Harrison. 
I want to express my personal appreciation to Larry and his family, and I'm certain my colleagues share my sentiments. Our best thoughts and wishes are with him.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this has been an extremely busy week for the Senate and a historic week, capped off by our work on the landmark budget resolution. 
Before we finish today, and before Members return home to observe Memorial Day, I want to join my colleague, Senator Cochran, from Mississippi, and others who are interested in paying special tribute to a special lady. I thank my colleagues that do have time reserved to speak for giving us these few minutes to say to our good friend, and, in my case, a former colleague when I was a staff member, Jonna Lynne Cullen, and thank her for a lot of great memories and for a lot of great work and for all that she has done for our country. 
I think it is appropriate that we do this at the end of this week when we have done something good for this country by passing a budget resolution that will, at last, ensure a balanced budget for the American people. It is appropriate because most of Jonna Lynne Cullen's life has been devoted to good things for her country. 
She first came to Capitol Hill as a young woman. I got to know her in 1959 as a college freshman at the University of Mississippi. We were friends then. A few years later, then, in 1967, when she came to Capitol Hill, she went to work for the Rules Committee with the legendary chairman, William Colmer of Mississippi. 
One year later, I joined the Congressman's staff as his administrative assistant, beginning a close working relationship with Jonna Lynne--or J.L., as we all affectionately call her--and that relationship grew as we worked on bills before the Rules Committee and we spent time in the presence of Chairman Colmer and as she worked in the Reagan administration. Through the years, our relationship and friendship has continued to grow. 
Over the course of 30 years in the Nation's Capitol, J.L. has remained much as she was when we first met. Without dealing in stereotypes, it's true that she is very much a southern woman: 
Gracious even in the face of rudeness, generous to a fault, ready to make others feel at ease and at home, tolerant of other's opinions but quite sure of her own, soft of heart and tough of spirit. 
Last week, many Members of the House of Representatives took to the floor of the House to recount their own memories of J.L. And the recurrent theme of their recollections was how much she has helped them, in one way or another. 
I remember when she worked on the Rules Committee staff. She would come back to the rail, and they would have a rule up, and she would not only watch the rule, but she worked with many of us who had various and sundry problems to try to help us get through a legislative problem or to deal with a family problem. She was sort of the mother hen in the House back in those days in the early 1970's. Senator Cochran and I enjoyed her friendship so much. 
I can't think of a better tribute to any person than to be known by how much she helped others. And certainly that is true with J.L. 
The reason she could help so many is because she really was so able. She is a master of the House rules. She not only knows every in and out of the legislative process, but she knows the people involved as well to help you get the results you are looking for. She has always had their trust, and her word was good. She has never been a part of the deplorable side of Washington that thrives on leaks or negative information or self-promotion. It is just not her style. Indeed, she represents an older tradition--maybe one she learned from Chairman Colmer in the behind-the-scenes service in which the good of the Congress and the good of the country that it leads to by its actions must come before any personal considerations, which helps to explain why she has friendships across the partisan aisle, too. She worked both sides of the aisle. She can fight someone on policy and yet respect them on principle. She has always been a winner who understands how to win the right way. 
It was little wonder, then, that in January 1981 when President Ronald Reagan came into office, Jonna Lynne was asked to take charge of the Congressional Affairs Office at the Office of Management and Budget to work with then head of OMB, David Stockman, a Congressman from Michigan at that time. 
That has always been an important job. But it was at a particularly critical juncture at that time, which was an extraordinary period of active legislative involvement by the President--changes in a number of laws, major tax cuts, some restraint on the budget--that really made a difference. 
The President-elect and his inner circle knew they were facing a national crisis. At that time we had a sinking economy with worse ahead, raging inflation, regulatory strangulation, the Iranian hostage situation, a hollow military force, Soviet proxy aggression on three continents, and on Capitol Hill, deeply entrenched majorities from the other party with a minority in the House and the Senate--or in the House at least--of the President's party. 
Today, we tend to forget just how bad things really were then or just how gloomy the future might have appeared to us at that time. The President-elect and most of his key aides were strangers to Capitol Hill. But OMB was to be the vanguard, the spearhead actually, of what we needed to accomplish. We had Jonna Lynne Cullen working at OMB, working with the House and with the Congress that she knew so well. 
So to OMB she went working around the clock to help forge a governing coalition in the House. 
In those days we couldn't get a majority on any vote if we didn't get around 50 Democrats. We had 180 or so Republicans--I think there were about 186--and in some instances every one of the Republicans and we had to get something over 50 Democrats 
to be able to win any votes. Time after time after time we won by one vote, two votes, six votes. It was scary. It was tedious. But Jonna Lynne was there helping us work both sides of the aisle to get the victories for the American people. 
Much later, when the fruits of her labors came to harvest in the historic economic package that set the stage for the longest sustained economic recovery in our Nation's history, there were plenty of people around to take credit. 
But Jonna Lynne is not that type. She continued to be the ultimate insider, shy of the news media but bold in her commitment to what will forever more be known as the Reagan revolution. 
Even after she left the administration, she was always on call for a good cause. She handled congressional relations for Reagan's bipartisan commission on Central America-- an interesting commission. Henry Kissinger was involved in that, Jack Kemp, and I think even Alan Greenspan--quite a group--Jonna Lynne, and Democrats and Republicans. They went to Central America and did a great job. 
She helped develop a policy consensus that turned the tide against the Soviet and Cuban meddling in this hemisphere. 
Devoted as she has always been in public service, J.L. has still a remarkable private life. Professionally, she has not only been a lobbyist but, as businesswoman, very successful with culinary skills that have led to the Pesto Plus line of food products. 
Somehow she found time to paint along with her Pesto Plus products. Her botanical water colors outshine their real life subjects. With flowers, as with people, J.L. is able to look beneath the surface to bring out the hidden beauty. 
It must be said that J.L. came up through the ranks of the congressional staff from the lowest entry level at a time when it was very difficult for women. Not all doors were open to them. But she opened them, not by confrontation or argument but by excellence and by hard work. 
I doubt if she ever considered herself a pioneer, but, in fact, she has led the way for others, getting ahead the old-fashioned way--with strength of conviction and hard work. 
Characteristically, she has translated her commitment in that area to the advancement of women in Government, and especially within the Republican Party, into positive action. She has pulled together women Members of Congress, of the media, and others to better understand and assist one another. 
Of course, bringing people together like that and finding common ground on which to make progress has always been J.L.'s trademark. 
A few years ago, when many of us joined together to help celebrate a milestone birthday for J.L., the walls were decorated with large blowups of photos from her childhood days and her days in college. I remembered some of them, actually. Needless to say, there had been certain changes along the way. But you could see the same openness, frankness, and sparkle, and the same zest for life in Jonna Lynne every day as in those childhood days and those pictures, too. 
When illness struck J.L. several years ago, she turned even that into an opportunity for service. She gave her time and energy to fighting against cancer while waging her own individual battle in that regard. According to Senate procedure, we are not supposed to address individuals here on the Senate floor but, Mr. President, if Jonna Lynne were here with us, I would tell her what all of her many friends are trying to tell her in many different ways, and that is simply this: Thank you, J.L., for all that you have done for us and for our country. And though you are not with us in the Capitol, you will always be in our hearts. 
God bless you and thank you.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some unanimous-consent requests to make and an Executive Calendar list. First I want to say to the distinguished Democratic leader I understand his feelings and appreciate his comments. We did work to try to get through all the legislative hurdles in moving the supplemental and resolving the problems attached to it. We ran into some procedural limitations there at the end that made it impossible for us to complete it, but we need to get it done. We are going to get it done. We are going to make sure the people of the States that have had disasters are going to get the aid they need. 
I have already sent a letter urging everything be done to make sure the funds continue to flow through FEMA and any other agency that has a role in providing disaster assistance, whether it is in South Dakota, North Dakota, Kentucky, or Minnesota. 
When we come back, it is going to be one of the two first orders of priority. One, we have to do the budget conference report, which I think will be done very quickly, and then we can really focus on getting the supplemental completed and resolving some of the issues that are critical issues attached to it so that we can come up with a solution everybody can live with on the census question and address the roads problem and also find a way to deal with avoiding Government shutdowns in the future. 
I think we can do all of those once we make up our minds to focus on it and get our minds committed to working on that effort.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence has received a request from the inspector general of the Department of Justice for copies of certain committee records relevant to the inspector general's pending inquiry into allegations of involvement by the Central Intelligence Agency in crack cocaine trafficking with supporters of the Nicaraguan Contras. 
It is anticipated that other Senate committees may receive similar requests for documents in the future. 
This resolution would authorize the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, acting jointly, to provide committee records in response to this request, utilizing appropriate security procedures. This resolution would also authorize the chairman and ranking member of other Senate committees, acting jointly, to provide relevant records of such committees in response to similar requests without the necessity of further Senate action.

Mr. LOTT. The congressional participation in the OECD shipbuilding agreement continues in the 105th Congress. On April 22, 1997, Senator Breaux introduced S. 629, the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement Act. On April 30, 1997, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, chaired by Senator McCain, held a hearing on trade matters which included the OECD shipbuilding agreement. On June 5 that hearing will be continued with the focus on this particular maritime trade policy. 
I must say that S. 629 represents the administration's attempt to reconcile their earlier legislative proposal made in the 104th Congress with the successful amendment made by the House of Representatives to that bill. Let me be clear, while the current bill does not address all of the concerns voiced by America's largest shipbuilders, it is a positive step in the right direction. My colleagues must not ignore it. 
It also begins to deal with issues I raised in my two colloquies in the Senate with Senator Snowe. 
I intend to work with Senator Breaux to amend S. 629 so that all appropriate maritime solutions are incorporated. At a recent maritime function, I challenged the audience to examine the new language and to offer constructive improvements. Our Nation has international maritime responsibilities and we must respond to the challenge. 
I believe that with the introduction of S. 629, the administration has made an honest attempt to address the majority of the concerns. 
I plan on working with my colleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to ensure that acceptable ratification and implementation legislation for the OECD shipbuilding agreement is passed by this Congress.

Mr. LOTT. A primary thrust of the amendment in the 104th Congress by the House of Representatives was to clarify that the agreement shall not affect in any way the Jones Act and other laws related to our essential coastwise trade. My colleagues know my position on the Jones Act--I support it unequivocally. I believe the language in S. 629 also supports the Jones Act by requiring the withdrawal of the United States from the agreement if it interferes with our coastwise trade laws. However, I am continuing to work with Senator Breaux to further strengthen this provision.

Mr. LOTT. Many of our American shipbuilders also expressed their concern to me that several countries with a significant shipbuilding industrial presence are not signatories to the agreement. This reduces the effectiveness of the agreement. S. 629 includes a provision not found in last year's House bill which would direct our Trade Representative to seek the prompt accession to the agreement by these other countries. This is one step in the right direction. Another step is that S. 629 also would direct our Trade Representative to use the mechanisms already available under existing U.S. trade laws to redress efforts by non-signatories to undermine the agreement. 
Additionally, I expect our Trade Representative to vigorously protest the recent approval of approximately $2.1 billion in restructuring aid to shipyards in Germany, Spain, and Greece. I'm sure that all will agree that the agreement has no chance of holding together if any signatories work around its provisions in order to continue unfairly subsidizing their shipyards.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for yielding this time and for the outstanding work he has been doing. 
We have before us a budget resolution that has been in the making for 4 months. A lot of hard work went into it, a lot of give-and-take. It is truly a bipartisan agreement. It is not a Democratic package, and it is certainly not a Republican package. It is one that we came to agreement on. There are provisions in it that I don't agree with. There are changes that I wanted to make until the very end, and some I would like to make at this very moment. But we entered into an agreement, House and Senate, Republican and Democratic leadership, working with the Budget Committee leaders and the administration, specifically the President of the United States. We came to a budget agreement. We shook hands. Now we have this budget resolution to implement that agreement. 
The House spent a very long day yesterday and they stuck with their commitment. They kept the faith. They passed the budget resolution that will carry out the budget agreement. It took them until 3:30 this morning. One amendment that was offered, which was very attractive, was one that I would like to vote for, to put more money in transportation. I think we should take more money out of the highway trust fund and put it in the roads and bridges of America, and so do many of the leaders in the House on the Republican side. But, no, they fought off a very powerful, very important chairman by a vote of 216 to 214. The amendment was defeated. They kept their word. The leadership worked all night to keep their word, to stick with the agreement. And they did it and they passed a budget resolution. 
Just yesterday, here in the Senate, I worked with Senator Daschle, Senator Domenici worked with Senator Lautenberg, and we resisted amendments that would break us out of the agreement. Senator Dodd from Connecticut had an amendment he felt compelled to offer and was very serious about. But with some nine Democrats and most Republicans, we defeated that amendment. 
Senator Allard, the Senator from Colorado, had an amendment. I voted against his amendment. I didn't want to. I am proud of this new, fine Senator from Colorado, and I agreed with what he was trying to do. But, no, I kept my word. I kept the faith. 
Now, my colleagues, this is a show-stopper. This takes us outside the budget agreement. Remember, in the agreement is $16 billion for child health care. I thought that was excessive, but we came to an agreement. We do need to make sure that, for some children who are not covered in America, there is a way for them to be covered. We said: Finance Committee, here is $16 billion to address this problem, and we believe there are ways that can be found to get that done. 
I care about children in America. I am a parent. I am from a State where there are children who are not covered and 
should be. But we have a program here that we have agreed to, $16 billion, and the committee will work with that, and I hope and think they will come up with many innovative ideas of how we can make sure these children are covered. 
That is why we are here now. We have an agreement we are committed to, that addresses this problem. Now we have an amendment that will take us, clearly, outside the parameters of the agreement. We must defeat this amendment. We must have bipartisan support against this amendment, or how am I going to be able to stand up here and vote against some of the amendments that will be offered from my side of the aisle that will take some of the spending out of our agreement and put it in more tax cuts? I would like to do that. I want to do that. The American people are overtaxed and overworked, for what they get back, in terms of being able to keep their own money. But I am prepared to say no, we have to stick with this agreement. 
Paragraph 3 of the bipartisan agreement between the President and the leadership of the Congress reads: 
Agreed upon budget levels are shown in the tables included in this agreement, including deficit reduction levels, major category levels of discretionary, mandatory, and tax receipt levels. 
This amendment would change those agreed-to budget levels. Like yesterday's amendment by Senator Dodd of Connecticut, the pending amendment would break our bipartisan agreement with the President by increasing spending and taxes beyond the levels in this agreement. 
By the way, I thought the original Kennedy-Hatch bill just provided for $20 billion. We have $16 billion in this package. If you add $20 billion on top of that, now it is $36 billion. 
The Kennedy-Hatch amendment would create $20 billion of new entitlement spending above and beyond what is already in this resolution. 
The sponsors of the amendment claim the amendment would increase the tobacco tax. That is not true. It is false. The budget resolution cannot tell the Finance Committee which taxes to raise and which to cut. The practical effect of this amendment on taxes is not to raise a specific tax. It is, instead, to reduce the size of the net tax cut by $30 billion, to only $55 billion over 5 years. That is not enough to do what we have committed to do--some tax credits for families with children, some capital gains tax rate cuts for Americans who are entitled to it and deserve that opportunity, some modification of the estate taxes. And it puts an additional squeeze on the President's education program. We cannot do what we have committed to do with this change. 
I am a party to the bipartisan agreement with the President that we entered into and we outlined in paragraph 2 of the agreement. I am going to keep the faith on this amendment and other amendments. We are going to stick with our budget resolution agreement. I have talked to the President, because the President is in on this. He has made it clear he supports the concept of Kennedy-Hatch. But he is also committed to me that he is going to work to try to get Democrat votes for our second-degree amendment and against making this change in the budget resolution. That is what I have been told by the President of the United States. If anybody doubts that here on the floor or in the news media, call the White House and check it. 
I signed in on the deal and I have taken criticism for it. 
The President signed in on the deal, and he is going to take some criticism for it. He already has. But this is clearly a deal-buster. If this amendment should be adopted right at the gate, the wheels will come off of this thing. They will come off. And I only have two options: One, offer second-degree amendments, and if we have to, we may go through a series of them, and let me assure you, each one will get hairier and more difficult for Senators to vote against, more uncomfortable. 
Or the other one is to say, look, we had a deal. Is the deal off? We can pull this down. We have a little work we can do. We can go back to the comptime-flextime bill, to give the working men and women of America an opportunity to make some decisions, taking time to be with their children. We can go onto the chemical weapons implementing legislation. Maybe we can go to other bills, like product liability. That is pending. We could take that up. Or national missile defense. We have other things we could be doing. 
But we should, instead, vote for the second-degree amendment. It is a very responsible and reasonable amendment. I urge Senators on both sides, vote for the second-degree amendment we are going to offer. Let us move on and complete our work on this today, on this whole resolution, so we can get to conference, meet tomorrow, and pass this budget resolution on Thursday or Friday. 
The amendment we will offer as a second-degree amendment will allow us to adhere to our bipartisan budget agreement with respect to health care for our children. This amendment accomplishes this by wiping out the increases and decreases in the dollar amounts which have been proposed by our colleagues in the Kennedy-Hatch amendment. It allows us to stick with the balanced budget plan now before us and to provide health care for kids. 
I think that is the responsible thing to do. I would prefer to even give some direction, maybe even have a vote like they did in the committee, saying what we should do is having 100 percent deductibility of the self-employed. That would be a major help. There are all sorts of things we can do. But we should not break out of the agreement here. We should not mandate a new program at this point, on the budget resolution. We should not raise taxes when there are other options that are as good or better. 
So, my friends, I just want to sum up by saying I think we have come a long way. A lot of time has been invested in this, a lot of effort. We need to be able to get this budget resolution done so we can go on to the reconciliation bill and the appropriations bills. If we do not defeat this amendment and if we do not pass this budget resolution today or tomorrow, in our effort to get a balanced budget, with spending restraint and some tax relief for working Americans, and some reform in Medicare that will save the program on out well after the turn of the century, we will have made a terrible mistake today. 
So I urge my colleagues, when we get to the vote, that we vote for the second-degree amendment and we move on to other issues in this area.

But I would have to have assurances from your leadership and from the White House, from the President, that in fact it is going to be defeated.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can reclaim our time, I would certainly like to have a reaffirmation of our support of what was in the budget agreement, that we worked through very carefully. I agreed to what was in there reluctantly. 
If we then come along and vote for the Senator's amendment, we have undercut, we have broken out of the agreement, and we will reverse the affirmation we just voted on. That does not make any sense. 
So, I yield the floor at this time so the second-degree amendment can be offered.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me that time. We don't want to go over everything that has been said two or three times this afternoon, but let me again make it very clear, if the Kennedy health care proposal had been in this budget agreement, I would never have agreed to it. I would have never signed on to it. This is a new entitlement program. It is money on top of what is in the budget agreement. As a matter of fact, I agree with the Senator from Texas, what he just said, the $16 billion was more than I thought was necessary. But it is in the agreement and the Finance Committee is already working, I am sure, on ways to deal with those children that might, in fact, be uninsured or not covered. They have the opportunity to do that. And there is enough money in here to do it. 
But, now the Senator comes in here and makes all kinds of threats about how we will go on and on and on today, until we get a vote--I guess he presumes to put this in there. And then the argument is made that this does not change the agreement. 
Would it change the agreement if an amendment is offered to cut spending, which I think should happen--there is not enough spending restraint in this agreement--and add it to tax cuts? I would be inclined to vote for that, want to vote for that. That would be the right thing to do. But that would clearly change the makeup of this agreement. 
So, to now say that this does not change it, that it is revenue neutral, when in fact it adds a tremendous amount of money to the area of child health care--the Senator from Massachusetts wants a Government takeover in this area. That is what really is at stake here. He knows this clearly is beyond what was included in the agreement and it would completely unravel it. What will come out of this is we will reach a point where we will not have a budget resolution. I think that would be a real tragedy. But I want to make it clear, I am opposed to this amendment, No. 1, because I think it violates what we agreed to, but, also, I am opposed to the Kennedy-Hatch approach here. I think it costs too much money. I don't think it is the answer to the problem. 
The Finance Committee can work on this and come up with solutions that will get the job done for those children who do in fact have a problem. So I do not think it is fair to imply we are not concerned about this area and we cannot deal with this problem. It is just the Kennedy-Hatch proposal is not the be-all and end-all. There are other proposals out there: 100 percent deductibility or 80 percent deductibility of the cost of this health care is one way to go, with more flexibility for the States. Why, the States are already using that flexibility to make sure children are covered. In the State of Utah already the Governor, with limited flexibility, has been able to make sure that a third of the children that were not covered are in fact covered. That was pointed out in a Wall Street Journal article in April of this year.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. What the Senator from Utah is trying to do, along with the Senator from Massachusetts, is mandate how this problem should be addressed and add more money beyond what is needed to get the job done, and to put it in the budget resolution. We had lengthy discussion about how to deal with this. Meeting with the President's representatives, talking with the President, we came up with what we thought was a reasonable compromise in terms of the amount of money, $16 billion, without the Government takeover provisions, without the Federal mandates. I have information here that indicates there are five new major Federal mandates included in this bill, which will, in fact, complicate the job of insuring the children. 
We have an adequate amount of money. We are saying to the Finance Committee and the Members of the Senate, in a subsequent vote that we will have on a reconciliation bill, that there is an area where we need to help children who are not covered. We have the funds to do it. And for them to come up with proposals. 
They will be able to do that. But, no, the Senator is saying: Do it our way and do it with an additional $20 billion. Clearly, this is not going to get through the process. It just cannot, because we will not have a budget agreement if this is included in there. I do not mean that as any sort of threat. I just mean, if we start down that trail there are going to be other amendments offered that then--look, if the agreement we shook hands on is going to be wiped out here with this amendment, where does it stop? There are other amendments pending out there. There are amendments I would like to vote for. I intended, on our side, to oppose them because they were not part of the agreement. I would like us to have a disaster fund set up in advance. The Senator from Texas has an amendment on that. I do not think there are adequate tax cuts in this agreement. I think we should have more. 
If we are going to start doing that, we will wind up with at great big mess on our hands and no budget agreement. That is what is at stake here. Over the insistence that we do it the way the Senator from Massachusetts says, to add another $20 billion above what we agreed to and what is necessary, we are going to threaten to take down a multitrillion-dollar budget agreement that gets us to a balanced budget, that has some reforms in it, some restraint on spending--not nearly enough--and some tax cuts, and not nearly enough in that area either. I don't think it is worth jeopardizing a multitrillion-dollar agreement that the President signed on to. 
If he has changed his mind, if he has walked away from this, I think he owes me, you know, the right to know if that is the case. I expect that before the day is out we are going to have some votes. We are going to see whether the Democrats are going to live up to holding this package to the way we agreed to it or not. If you are not, then how am I going to be able to do that? 
I have taken the flak, I have kept my word. This clearly will defeat the whole purpose of the agreement and what has already been approved in the House of Representatives last night in the wee hours of this morning, and what came out of the Budget Committee on a 17-to-4 vote. 
Now we are going to rewrite it here on the floor, mandating it has to be done this way. I just think it is absolutely the wrong thing to do, Mr. President, and we intend to resist it all the way.

I have had occasion now to again talk to the President. And his press representative has gone out and said, while he supports the concept of what is in this amendment--he recognizes it--it is a deal breaker, and this amendment should be defeated. 
We have money in the agreement, $16 billion, for child care that the Finance Committee is going to be able to take and work with and come up with a proper solution. That is the way we should go. We should not add this on this resolution because the net result would be this whole resolution and agreement would come unglued.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the first concurrent budget resolution. Senator Kennedy will be recognized immediately to offer his amendment on tobacco taxes. Following the disposition of the Kennedy amendment, Senator Gramm will be recognized to offer his amendment regarding deficit-neutral natural disaster relief. 
Members can expect rollcall votes in relation to these amendments and others, and all Members will be notified when these votes are specifically scheduled. 
I am still hopeful that the Democratic leader and I can join together in an effort to yield back additional time off the statutory time limitation, which is 50 hours, for the budget resolution and permit the Senate to complete its work on the budget resolution today. 
Subsequently, Senators wishing to offer amendments to this legislation should notify the chairman of the Budget Committee or the ranking member of the Budget Committee of their intentions this morning. 
Again, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout the day. We have a good deal of other work that we need to complete before the Memorial Day recess. For instance, tomorrow we already have a time agreement for 3 hours on the Chemical Weapons Convention implementation legislation. We would, of course, like to complete this resolution and have it go to conference where, hopefully, there will be very little problem in working out the conference. Hopefully, there will be no real differences between the two bills. That is going to take a lot of discipline on our part throughout the day until we complete this legislation. 
We also have at least three nominations that will require some small amount of time--judicial nominations, district courts--and three recorded votes. 
The supplemental appropriations bill, or some version thereof, very likely would need to be voted on this week also. 
So it is essential that we stay with it and that we complete the budget resolution today, if at all possible. 
There is good news and bad news. The good news is that we made good progress yesterday. I think almost 10 hours have been used or yielded back already. We did take up some amendments and had votes. While it was difficult and delicate, the amendments were defeated by considerable margins. We need to continue to do that. 
There are going to be a lot of good and appealing amendments offered today. It will be difficult to resist those. But this is a very delicately crafted budget agreement that the Republican leadership signed onto and that the Democratic leadership has agreed to. The chairman and ranking member have been working together more so than I have ever seen before. I commend them for that effort. 
So I hope that we will continue to hold the line. If we start down the trail of changing the mix, where will it end? I know of several amendments that I am very attracted to. The one by Senator Gramm obviously is very attractive. He basically says we should have some revenue-neutral process to have funds set aside for the annual disaster relief bill. We have to come every year for $5 billion, $6 billion, or $7 billion. He says we should go ahead and set that aside so we have that planned for. That is attractive. But that was not included in the budget agreement, so we probably should not do that here. 
There will be an amendment offered by Senator Warner with regard to highway funds. I would like to see more money go into the highways and bridges in America out of the highway trust fund, which is there for that purpose. 
Of course, there is the amendment offered by Senator Kennedy here with regard to child health care. 
I want to emphasize that we discussed this at great length during the budget negotiations and in reaching the budget agreement. There are funds in here for that area. There are more than enough funds in that area. In fact, I think there will be a struggle to find the best way to provide those funds to the people that want to have child health care. 
So it will be a very, very bad change in the makeup of this legislation and could unravel the whole budget agreement, if the Kennedy amendment is approved today. 
So I hope that we start off the day by having a fine discussion about what is in the bill, and what the alternative offered is. But we need also to recognize that is a substantial increase in what is provided in this particular area. It is totally different from what was in the budget agreement that the administration agreed to. 
So I urge my colleagues to keep calm. Let's keep working. But let's not start passing amendments that will change the mix of the make up of this budget agreement. 
I yield the floor at this time, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader for making that statement at this time. I intend to do the same thing as we go forward. 
When we have amendments that change the basic content of the budget agreement, as this one does, which would provide for changes in the tax provisions, to have tax increases in the code, and move that over into funding programs at a level above what was included in the budget agreement, we think that would be outside the agreement. And, while there are a number of Senators led by the 
Democratic leader who see an attractiveness in it, I think this is the right thing to do. 
We were trying to be cooperative by not going through the waiver of a point of order. But we will have the vote on the motion to table. 
It would be my intent to take the same position when amendments are offered of this nature from our side of the aisle. 
I think it is important that the two leaders on both sides make it clear that we are going to try to stick with this agreement as we go forward in the next 2 days. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators who have asked for time to speak. 
The Budget Committee is scheduled to mark up the budget resolution beginning this afternoon at 4 p.m., and it is my hope that we may count any debate time today that we will use relating to the budget toward the statutory time limitation. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will begin consideration of the concurrent budget resolution, and Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout the day. 
It is also possible that the Senate may resume consideration of H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion ban bill, with the intention of a vote on final passage occurring early this week. We had actually hoped that we could get a vote on that perhaps right after the luncheon on Tuesday. But there are some discussions underway, and we may not be able to get to that that soon. 
As always, all Members will be notified as soon as any votes are scheduled on these or other matters. 
Also, as a reminder to Members, this is the last week prior to the Memorial Day recess and, therefore, Senators can expect a very busy week with us more than likely having to go into the evening on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. And we should expect votes on Friday. At least on Tuesday, I don't know that there will be recorded votes, but certainly on Wednesday and Thursday in order to finish the budget resolution, complete action on the partial-birth abortion ban, and also get to another vote on the comptime-flextime Family Friendly Workplace Act. We will have to have some votes on that probably on Thursday. Then we would probably need to do the budget resolution by Friday, or probably on Friday, as well as the supplemental appropriations on Friday, if we haven't been able to get an agreement to do it before then. 
Also this week we will have to pass the Chemical Weapons Convention implementation bill. I think the problems are being worked out there. It shouldn't take too much time, although a block of time will be necessary to explain what is included in that implementation bill. 
So, Mr. President, I just want to reconfirm that we do still this week intend to do the budget resolution, finish the debate and final vote on the partial-birth abortion ban, have votes on the comptime-flextime bill with the hope that we could reach some agreement to actually get the legislation completed, and then vote on the budget resolution conference and the supplemental conference. 
We will keep the Members advised of any changes in the schedule. 
By the way, we do expect this week to take up perhaps some action on the Executive Calendar, at least the judicial nominations, probably Wednesday or Thursday. And we will have to have recorded votes on those three nominations, if we actually do take them up. 
So we would try to schedule that either Wednesday or Thursday.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just to confirm, again, this is the last vote for tonight. The next recorded vote will not occur before 5 o'clock on Monday. However, we are now working with the leadership on both sides of the Capitol and the Budget Committees, with the idea of having the Budget Committees markup the budget resolution, and we hope to get to the budget resolution early next week. We will continue to work to get the budget resolution out of the committee either tomorrow or Monday, and we will bring it to the floor as soon as we can get it completed and get an agreement as to how that will proceed, knowing what the rules require, but, also, wanting to work in good faith in a bipartisan way, which we think we are going to be able to do. 
For the information of all Senators, as I said, there will be no further votes this evening. The Senate will next consider S. 476, relative to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, for debate only, and a rollcall has not been requested on passage. There will not be a rollcall on that passage. We are going to take that up tomorrow, and we will be able to pass it without rollcall vote. 
The Senate will be in session tomorrow for morning business to accommodate Senators' requests, although there will be no votes tomorrow. 
Again, I think we have reached a final agreement on the package that will go to the Budget Committee.

Mr. LOTT. No. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. 
I am glad I was able to come to the floor, Madam President, and listen to this exchange. I always enjoy learning from the exchanges involving the senior Senators, like the Senators from West Virginia and North Carolina and Delaware. I wish all Members had been here for the last hour and heard this debate. 
I do want to take just a few minutes, as we get to the close of debate, to speak on the Chemical Forces in Europe flank agreement or resolution of ratification because I think it is very important. I wish we did have more time to talk about all of its ramifications, but I know the chairman and the ranking member have gone over the importance of this treaty earlier today. 
Madam President, we have an important treaty before us today modifying the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Agreement [CFE]. The Flank Document adjusts the CFE boundaries to reflect the collapse of the Soviet Empire, adds reporting requirements, and increases inspection provisions. 
Negotiations to modify the CFE Treaty began in 1995, because Russia threatened to violate the flank limits in the original treaty. The precedent of modifying a treaty to accommodate violations by a major signatory concerned many of us. We have also been concerned about how Russia intends to use the Flank Agreement to pressure countries on its borders--former Republics of the Soviet Union. Our concerns were dramatically heightened by the classified side agreement the administration reached to further accommodate Russian demands. This side agreement is available for all Senators to review in room S-407 of the Capitol. 
The concerns about the CFE Flank Agreement are shared by a number of states which have been subjected to Russian intimidation, pressure and subversion. States with Russian troops on their soil without their consent--Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia--have rightly expressed concern that the Flank Agreement must not undermine their sovereign right to demand withdrawal of those Russian forces. A fourth country, Azerbaijan, has been subject to Russian-sponsored coups and assassination attempts. They have been reluctant to approve the Flank Agreement without adequate assurances. 
The resolution of ratification before the Senate today addresses these concerns. The resolution includes a number of binding conditions which make clear to all CFE parties that no additional rights for Russian military deployments outside Russian borders are granted. The resolution ensures that United States diplomacy will not be engaged on the side of Russia but on the side of the victims of Russian policies. In addition, the 16 members of NATO issued a statement last week affirming that no additional rights are granted to Russia by the Flank Agreement. This statement was a direct result of the concerns expressed by other CFE parties and by the Senate. 
The resolution directly addresses the administration's side agreement in condition 3 which limits United States diplomatic activities to ensuring the rights of the smaller countries on Russia's borders. This resolution ensures the United States will not tacitly support Russian policies that have undermined the independence of Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan. Finally, the resolution requires detailed compliance reports and lays out a road map for dealing with noncompliance in the future. 
The resolution of ratification also addresses important issues of Senate prerogatives. It clarifies that the Byrd-Biden condition, added to the INF Treaty in 1988, does not allow the administration to avoid Senate advice and consent on treaty modifications or amendments. The resolution addresses the issue of multilateralizing the 1972 ABM Treaty in condition 9. The administration has raised objections to this provision as they have to many previous efforts to assert Senate prerogatives on this point. This should be an institutional position--not a partisan issue. 
For more than 3 years, Congress has been on the record expressing serious misgivings about the administration plan to alter the ABM Treaty by adding new signatories. Section 232 
of the 1994 defense authorization bill states the issue clearly: `The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution.' 
Efforts to address the multi- lateralization issue since then have resulted in filibusters and veto threats. It should not surprise anyone that the Senate selected this resolution of ratification to address the issue--just as Senators Byrd and Biden selected the resolution of ratification for the INF Treaty to address an ABM Treaty issue 9 years ago. 
Many of my colleagues are familiar with the issue of ABM multi- lateralization. Despite the often arcane legal arguments, the issue is not complicated. The Senate gave its advice and consent to the 1972 ABM Treaty as a bilateral agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. The administration has proposed adding as many as four new signatories to the treaty and has negotiated limited treaty rights for those new signatories. The administration's proposal would define Russia's national territory to include these countries for purposes of the ABM Treaty. The administration's proposal would essentially define military equipment of these countries as belonging to Russia for purposes of the ABM Treaty. The administration's proposal would add new countries to the ABM Treaty but not grant them rights allowed the original signatories. This would mean that countries would have the power to block future U.S. amendments to the ABM Treaty--even though the new signatories would not have the same rights and obligations as the United States. The administration's proposed multilateralization would only address some of the military equipment covered under the original ABM Treaty--leaving a radar in Latvia, for example, outside the scope of the new treaty. Under the administration's proposal, the vast majority of states independent which succeeded the Soviet Union would be free to develop and deploy unlimited missile defenses--a dramatic change from the situation in 1972 when the deployment of missile defenses on these territories was strictly limited by the ABM Treaty. 
In part and in total, these are clearly substantive modifications which require--under U.S. law--Senate advice and consent. Multilateralization would alter the object and purpose of the ABM Treaty as approved by the Senate in 1972. Multilateralization, therefore, must be subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. 
The administration argues that it has the sole power to determine questions of succession. But that is not true. The Congressional Research Service opinion, quoted widely in this debate, recognizes that `International law regarding successor States and their treaty obligations * * * remains unsettled.' It also notes that `international law does not provide certain guidance on the question of whether the republics formed on the territory of the former U.S.S.R. have succeeded to the rights and obligations of the ABM Treaty' and that `a multi- lateralization agreement could include matters that would alter the substance of the ABM Treaty and require Senate advice and consent.' It is my understanding that this opinion was prepared a year ago by a lawyer who has not even seen the text of the proposed agreement. 
The administration's position does not recognize the arms control precedents followed in the last decade. Arms control treaties are different from treaties on fisheries, taxes, or cultural affairs. START I was concluded with the Soviet Union but entered into force only after the Senate gave its advice and consent to the Lisbon Protocol apportioning the nuclear forces of the former Soviet Union among successor States. The Bush administration did not argue that Ukrainian SS-19 missiles were the property of Russia. Yet, the Clinton administration is 
essentially arguing that Ukrainian phased-array radars are Russian under the proposed ABM multilateralization agreement. The question of successor state obligations under the CFE Treaty was explicitly recognized by the Senate when we gave our advice and consent to that treaty. During our consideration, a condition was included in the resolution of ratification which specified procedures for the accession of new States Parties to the CFE Treaty. On the issue of ABM multilateralization, Congress has specifically legislated on our right to review the agreement. To my knowledge, that has not happened on any other succession issue. Clearly, ABM multilateralization is very different from routine succession questions which have been decided by the executive branch alone. 
Madam President, I agree with the administration on one important point. This is a constitutional issue. The White House has taken one position until today, and now the Senate has definitively taken another. Last January, I asked President Clinton to agree to submit three treaties for our consideration. the President has agreed to submit the ABM Demarcation agreement and the CFE Flank Agreement, which is before the Senate today. After he refused to submit ABM multilateralization, I said publicly that I would continue to press for the Senate prerogatives--because the Constitution, the precedents and the law are on our side. We do not prejudge the outcome of our consideration of ABM multilateralization. All we require is that the administration submit the agreement to the Senate. Yes, that requires building a consensus that may not exist today but such a consensus is necessary for a truly bipartisan national security policy. That is the issue before the Senate today. 
Late last week, the administration recognized the Senate's desire to review ABM multilateralization. They proposed replacing the certification in condition 9 with nonbinding `sense of the Senate' language. In exchange, Secretary Albright offered to send a letter assuring us that we could address multilateralization in an indirect way--as part of a reference in the ABM demarcation agreement. But this offer was logically inconsistent. It asked the Senate to simply express our view about a right to provide advice and consent to multilateralization--and then accept a letter that explicitly denied that right. Adding new parties to the ABM Treaty is a fundamentally different issue from the proposed demarcation limits on theater defense systems. The administration's offer would allow multilateralization regardless of Senate action on the demarcation agreement. Our position is simple: We want to review multilateralization through the `front door' on its own merits--not through the `back door' as a reference in a substantively different agreement. 
When the administration agreed to submit the CFE Flank Agreement for our advice and consent, we were asked to act by the entry into force deadline of May 15. We will act today even though the treaty was not submitted to the Senate until April 7--3 months after my request. We will act today even though we have a very full agenda--including comp time/flex time, IDEA, partial birth abortion and the budget resolution. We will fulfill our constitutional duty, we will address our concerns about policy toward Russia, and we will address the important issue of Senate prerogatives. 
I urge my colleagues to support the entire resolution of ratification reported by the Foreign Relations Committee--including condition 9 on ABM multilateralization. 
Madam President, I want to thank many Senators who have worked very hard and for quite some time on this treaty and on the ABM condition. 
I particularly would like to thank Chairman Helms, Senator Biden, Senator Gordon Smith, and their staffs for all the work they did to get this resolution before the Senate today. Also, I would like to thank Senators who helped in insisting on Senate prerogatives--Senator Warner and Senator McCain, Senator Smith, Senator Kyl, Senator Shelby, Senator Lugar, and Senator Hagel. A number of Senators on the committee and some not on the committee have been very much involved in this process. I commend them all. 
Senators have had concerns about how and why this agreement was negotiated, and we had concerns about a side deal the administration made with the Russians concerning the allocation of equipment under the treaty. 
The Senate has addressed these concerns decisively in this resolution of ratification. The resolution places strict limits on the administration's flank policy. It ensures that we will be on the side of the victims of Russian intimidation and that the United States will stand up for the independence of States on Russia's borders. 
Most important, this resolution addresses a critical issue of Senate prerogative, our right to review the proposed modifications to the 1972 ABM Treaty. It was a decade ago that another ABM Treaty issue was brought in this body. That debate over interpretations of the ABM Treaty was finally resolved in the resolution of ratification for the INF Treaty in 1988. 
Today, we are resolving the debate over multilateralization of the ABM Treaty in this resolution of ratification. For more than 3 years now Congress and the executive branch have discussed back and forth the appropriate Senate rule in reviewing the administration's plan to add new countries to the ABM Treaty. 
Condition 9 requires the President to submit any multilateralization agreement to the Senate for our advice and consent. It does not force action here. It just says we should have that opportunity. We should be able to exercise that prerogative to review these changes. It ensures we will have a full opportunity to look at the merits of multilateralization in the future. I believe the Constitution and legal precedence are in our favor. 
Today, the Senate will act on the Conventional Forces in the Europe [CFE] Flank Agreement in time to meet the May 15 deadline. In spite of the limited time we had to consider the agreement and the very full schedule that we have had on the floor, we are meeting that deadline. 
I did have the opportunity to discuss this issue with our very distinguished Secretary of State yesterday, and we discussed the importance of this CFE Flank Agreement. Also, we talked about how we could properly and appropriately address our concerns about multilaterilization. I suspect that she probably had something to do with the decision to go forward with it in this form, and I thank her for that, and the members of the committee for allowing it to go forward in this form.

Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for those comments. I did write to the President expressing my concerns in this area in January of this year, and other issues. 
When I had the opportunity to visit with Secretary Madeleine Albright before she was confirmed by the Senate, I had the temerity to read to her from the Constitution about our rights in the Senate in advice and consent, and she said, `You know, I agree with you. I taught that at Georgetown University,' and I believe she meant that. 
I think we are seeing some results of that, and I appreciate the fact that our prerogatives are being protected. We have had this opportunity to review it, debate it, and we will be able to take up other issues later on this year that are very important for Senate consideration. I think the process has worked. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of ratification. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are now going to vote on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, referred to as IDEA, has been on the books for 22 years. 
The obligation to provide children with disabilities a free and appropriate education is grounded in the 14th amendment to the Constitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and by the laws of every State. IDEA is one additional civil rights tool that guarantees children with disabilities the right to receive a quality education. IDEA is the only Federal civil rights statute that provides funds to assist States in meeting the obligation to educate all children. This bill is about the educational future of 5.4 million children. 
From my perspective, IDEA is a voluntary grant-in-aid program. It provides funds to States to assist them in making available a free appropriate public education to 5.4 million children with disabilities from 3 through 21. If a State elects to take its allotment of funds appropriated for IDEA in any year, it must provide a free appropriate public education to these children as prescribed by the law. Today, every State is participating in the IDEA grant-in-aid program, and 49 States have elected to participate in and comply with IDEA since 1975. 
The history of these IDEA amendments precedes the 105th Congress. In the last Congress our colleagues on the Labor and Human Resources Committee attempted to move a bipartisan reauthorization of IDEA through the Senate. Their bill, S. 1578, did not make it to the floor before that Congress ended. Those of us involved in the last minutes of the 104th Congress, especially the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, and Mr. Harkin from Iowa, the authors of S. 1578, Senator Jeffords and myself, pledged to make the reauthorization of IDEA one of our top legislative priorities in this Congress. We are here again with a bipartisan approach. And, actions speak louder than words. 
Since January of this year, Senate and House staff, as well as representatives from 
the administration have been meeting daily to craft our bipartisan bill and to bring this legislation to the floor as quickly as possible. Those involved in crafting this legislation included not only Senators and Labor and Human Resources Committee staff, but also our House counterparts, especially Chairman Goodling, Mr. Riggs, Mr. Gray, and Mr. Martinez. Officials from the U.S. Department of Education, particularly Judith Heumann, Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, and White House representative, Lucia Wyman, also participated in the process. The range of expertise and knowledge brought to bear in developing this bill as well as the spirit of bipartisan, bicameral cooperation demonstrated in writing it is unprecedented. I have seen nothing like this in my 24 years in Congress. In fact, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, unanimously reported out identical legislation, S. 717 and H.R. 5 respectfully, on the same day, May 7, 1997. Moreover, the committees collaborated with each other in developing their respective reports. 
The frequency, scope, and type of input we sought and received in putting together this final product was extraordinary. Almost every week for 3 months we held public meetings using a town hall format. This permitted those interested in our progress in drafting the IDEA bill to offer feedback and input. Students, educators, advocates, and parents traveled from all over the country to provide comments on our proposals. Often, more than 100 people would speak at an individual meeting. No effort was made to limit the amount of people that testified or limit the time they could speak. Many told personal stories that were oftentimes both heart warming and heart wrenching. Their recommendations came from the real education front lines. Our inclusive process, although unorthodox, has paid off. As of today, we have heard from over 30 groups that support our moving this legislation without amendment. They view our 5-month effort as worthy of their unequivocal support. 
Many of you in this Chamber and your constituents, who are involved in this issue, appreciate the delicate balance this bill represents. It is built on principles, it is built on consensus, and it is built on compromise. 
I acknowledge that States need additional Federal funding to fully implement IDEA the way it is intended. We have said in S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act of 1997, that we will increase funding, from the current $3.2 billion to $13.2 billion in 7 years. More Federal dollars for IDEA is an appropriations issue that we will turn to after we pass this important legislation. 
I am confident that dollars spent today for the education of children with disabilities is money well spent. When all children are provided a quality education, they stand a better chance of becoming productive and contributing adults in our society. IDEA is an important investment in the future of children with disabilities. 
Another benefit that IDEA provides is that it offers everyone one set of rules on how to go about providing an education to children with disabilities. Prior to 1975, 35 States, through Federal courts, State courts, and State legislatures, were grappling with how to define the provision of an education to children with disabilities. Individual States and the country as a whole did not need, did not want 35 interpretations of what constituted an education for children with disabilities. Everyone wanted one rule book. That is why IDEA originally passed. That is why today, with States educating 5.4 million children with disabilities, less than one-half of 1 percent of disagreements between parents and school districts, over a disabled child's education, end up in court. Do we want to step backward? Do we want to reset the clock and create a legal free-for-all? I don't believe we do. 
I would like to make another observation. I, as much as anyone else in this Chamber, want Federal IDEA dollars to be spent on educating children with disabilities, not on attorneys' fees. I am convinced that this bill makes that happen. Could we have put more limitations on when attorneys could be used or when parents, who prevail against a school district in a legal dispute, could be reimbursed? You bet. Could we have gotten here today having done so? No. Most of the limitations on attorneys' fees were put in the statute by our colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch in 1986. They are in this bill. 
The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 is, in my view, an important legislative accomplishment. The process we implemented to develop this legislation provides us with a new standard for how we can work together. This bill sends a message to the country that we care about education, that we care about children, that we care about families, and that we care about the future. This is a powerful and positive message. Please join me and the rest of my colleagues who have worked long and hard to get here, in supporting this bill. The President is waiting. He is ready to sign the IDEA.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I commend the distinguished Senator from Texas for her remarks today and on several occasions with regard to the working mothers of this country and the women who would benefit from this opportunity, as well as her work on the spousal IRA last year. In so many ways she has raised our sensitivity to ways that we can help the working women and the moms of America. 
She was on the air this morning shortly after 7 o'clock, speaking up about this important legislation. I hear her often at all hours of the day. She is doing a great job. I commend her for her leadership. 
I also want to thank the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, Senator DeWine from Ohio, Senator Jeffords, all of the Members who have worked to bring this legislation to the floor. S. 4 is probably one of the most important things we can do this year to help the workers of America have flexibility with their work schedules, to deal with the comptime issue in a different way that is more beneficial to them. This is very important legislation. 
I had hoped we could come together on an agreement on getting it completed and moving it through the Congress and on to the President for his signature. There were indications in the administration that they would like to do it, and from the Democratic leadership. So far, it has not happened. But we feel this is so important we must bring it to a foreseeable conclusion and make sure that the amendments that are offered are relevant.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act is the right thing for us to do, and this is the right time for us to do it. 
If there's one thing we should be able to promise the American people, knowing we can keep that promise, it's that there will not be another Government shutdown, as there was in 1995. 
We all know what happened back then. President Clinton vetoed appropriation bills because the Congress would not give him all the money he wanted to spend. 
No matter what gloss my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put on that situation, that was the bottom line: He wanted more tax dollars than we wanted to spend, and he was willing to see much of the Federal Government close its doors rather than make do with less cash. 
But the President did a masterful job at handling the PR of the situation. In fact, he ran rings around us, so much so that, to this day, most Americans probably believe that it was the Republican Congress that shut down their Government. 
There's nothing we can do about that now. We have to leave all that to the judgment of the historians. But we should not leave the future to chance. 
We have the chance today to guarantee the American people that the departments and agencies and bureaus of their Government will remain open this year, even if the Congress and the President cannot agree on spending issues. 
We have a chance to redeem the reputation of Congress by placing the daily operations of Government--from our national parks to the FBI--above politics and beyond political squabbles. 
All we are asking is that, if a department's appropriation bill is not completed by the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 1997, that department can continue all its programs and services, spending at the rate of 100 percent of its current budget. 
Just so no one misunderstands, let me restate that. All we want to do is ensure that, if any part of the Government does not have its annual appropriation in place by October 1, it can continue all its operations at 100 percent of their current level. 
That is a reasonable, modest, prudent measure to safeguard the public interest. And yet, it seems to have provoked a considerable amount of opposition from both the administration and Senate Democrats. 
I can understand why, and the reason has nothing whatsoever to do with some of the procedural arguments that have been advanced against this legislation. 
No, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act does not abdicate Congress' responsibility to produce individual appropriation bills. 
The appropriations process will go forward, and I hope to be able to call up--and pass--every one of those 13 bills. But what if that process fails? What if its failure imperils the operations of the Department of Justice? Or the Department of Health and Human Services? Or the Defense Department? 
No, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act is not out of place on the supplemental appropriation bill. The indignation that has been expressed on this point in some quarters ignores the fact that it is not at all unusual for Congress to accomplish other important business in the context of a supplemental appropriation. 
No, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act is not imperiling or delaying emergency assistance to the victims of floods in several hard-hit States. The aid they need will be forthcoming, and it will come on time. 
The people of my own State of Mississippi have known, all too frequently, the force of natural disasters. Neither they nor I would tolerate efforts to play political games with the aid our neighbors need. 
So let's set that canard to rest. The only way emergency aid will be held up to the Dakotas, to California, and to other hard-hit States is if a large number of Senators deliberately freeze the legislative process. 
Under our Senate rules, a small minority can bring this place to its knees, can paralyze our most important activities. But I don't believe that's going to happen, not on this critical bill. 
There is, however, one procedural argument against this bill that is right on target. 
Enactment of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act will substantially reduce the ability of individual Senators, or a small group of Senators, to hold hostage the Nation's money bills. 
I admit it. With this legislation in place, no one in this Chamber--and no one on any committee--will be able to threaten to shut down one or another part of Government unless he gets his own way with an amendment or a project. 
It is hard to give up power. It is hard to give up even a little bit of power. But I think that's what the American people want us to do this time. They don't want any of us to have the power to play chicken with Government shutdowns. And I don't blame them. 
So on this count, I plead guilty. I am, indeed, asking my colleagues to give up their ability to create a Government crisis by thwarting the appropriations process. 
I am asking them today to enter into a formal agreement with the American people--a legal enactment of our promise that there will be: 
No more legislated layoffs. No more concocted crises. No more administrative Armageddons. In short, once and for all, no more Government shutdowns.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, in light of this vote on the supplemental appropriations bill, there will be no further votes this evening. 
The Senate will be in session tomorrow for general debate on the comptime-flextime bill. However, no votes will occur during Friday's session of the Senate. 
The Senate will be in session on Monday to consider the IDEA, the individual disabilities education bill, hopefully, under a time agreement that we are still working on. I urge that all my colleagues agree to be brief on the time agreement that we can reach so that we can complete this very important legislation that has very broad based bipartisan support. If that agreement can be reached, any votes ordered then will be stacked on Tuesday at the request of a number of Senators. I fear that if the Senate cannot consider this bill on Monday, that events then will cause--because of the budget and other bills that we do have to consider, including the Chemical Forces in Europe Treaty, it would be pushed off until after the Memorial Day recess and everybody would like to get the IDEA bill done. 
On Tuesday, the Senate will begin formal consideration of the flextime-comptime bill.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I go to the closing statement, I want to talk a little bit about where we are on the supplemental appropriations bill. 
We began the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill on Monday, yesterday, and we have been on it today. We did have one recorded vote at about 2:30 this afternoon, I believe it was, and I expected that we would continue then to work through the amendments, with some recorded votes being required throughout the afternoon and even now late in the afternoon. 
I understand some of the amendments are efforts to strike language in the bill. Perhaps they have been worked out and we will have some accommodation, perhaps, on the census issue. I understand the amendment of Senator Wellstone was worked out in some way or the other, and he is not going to offer his. 
Then I received word that the Democrats decided they were not going to offer any more motions to strike, amendments to strike, or any amendments, until something was worked out with regard to the emergency continuing resolution. 
Mr. President, I say to the ladies and gentlemen of America, this is supposed to be emergency supplemental appropriations. This is a piece of legislation, appropriations, to provide funds for our troops in Bosnia--and the funds that are involved there have been offset in this bill--and to provide disaster assistance to States all across America that have disaster needs. 
What has happened? No. 1, the Democrats say, `We're not going to offer any more amendments until we get our way. We want to change the bill that was reported out of the Appropriations Committee, and unless it is changed to suit our desires, we won't come forward with any more amendments.' 
Then, we have before the Senate 109 amendments--109 amendments. Now, are we serious about this supplemental emergency appropriations or not? I do not believe there are 109 problems existing in this supplemental appropriations bill. That is certainly not the way to get this legislation moving quickly. 
We will have a vote in the morning on cloture, I guess at 10 o'clock, to accommodate a request from the Democratic side. If we get cloture, then there will be 30 hours left on the supplemental. Under the rules of the Senate, you can have up to 1 hour on an amendment. That is only 30 amendments. There are 109 pending. I presume some of those will be wiped off the board if we get cloture. 
I want to move the legislation. I am willing to work with the Democrats and with the White House on the issues where they have concerns, as we have on the census issue that has been before us. 
But I want to serve notice now--and I am sending word to the Democratic leader--that we are going to have a cloture vote in the morning, but I am not filing another cloture motion tonight. I am not going to try to cut off debate on this supplemental. We need to get this work done. If we do not get the cloture motion passed tomorrow, if we do not invoke cloture and stop what appears to be sort of a slowdown filibuster, then we will just go to other issues or we will stay on this bill as long as it takes. 
I have been told that we need to pass it right away because there are thousands of farmers and other people, small businesses in States in the Midwest and in the Dakotas, and my own State of Mississippi, that are going to need this help. It is throughout the country--in the Midwest, in the South, in the Far West. And yet now we are ready to go. It has been reported out of the Appropriations Committee last Thursday--or maybe it was Wednesday--but we only had 1 day go by legislatively before we brought this bill to the floor. 
I want to emphasize, Republicans are ready to move this disaster relief bill now. We can complete it tomorrow. We should complete it tomorrow so that we can then go on to the comp time/flextime bill and do a little something to help the working mothers of America before we have Mother's Day. But we are prepared to work on the disagreements. 
The way it works is the Senate acts, the committee acts, and then the Senate acts. The House, by the way, has to complete their work before we can pass the supplemental anyway. We go to conference and we continue to work out the disagreements. 
The way it does not work is, if you do not get your way you stop, you know, offering amendments and you slow down the process. 
So we will have the cloture vote tomorrow, and hopefully we will have an agreement to cut off the filibuster and we can move this bill through. But I want to talk a minute about what the problem is. 
The President has indicated that he does not want legislation included in the bill that would prevent or avert another Government shutdown. This is not something that just was discovered last year. We have had problems over the years of getting to the end of the fiscal year and Presidents or Congresses not being satisfied with the state of the situation, and the President would veto a bill or the Congress would not send a bill to the President. We would run out of funds, and you would have these shutdowns. 
We had them during the Reagan years. We had them during the Bush years. And now we have had them during the Clinton years. I think this is an irresponsible way to do business. We need to work through the process, but we should not endanger the people with the threat of a manmade disaster, which is what happens at the end of the fiscal year. 
It does not have to be in this bill and it does not have to be a specific way, but what we need to do is to make sure that the American people know that we are working together on a budget agreement, we are going to be working together on the appropriations, each one of the 13 that comes through, and that they will know what they can count on. 
If you are in education, you want to know what part the Federal Government is going to pay on it; if you want to visit a national monument, you would like to know that it is going to be open; if you are a private business man or woman, and you do business with some Federal facility, you would like to know that it is going to be open. 
So all we want is some process that makes sure when we get to the end of this fiscal year that the numbers we have agreed to will be honored. But in the process we are not going to go through these, what I consider to be very irresponsible games, whether or not the Government is open or shut down. 
So I hope that when we have--I am not going to file a cloture motion. I reiterate that. Generally speaking, if I do not have to file a cloture motion, that is well received. What I am saying is, we are ready to go. We need to work on a number of 
amendments that are still pending--amendments to change the bill, amendments to pay for the cost of the bill, amendments to strike various and sundry sections in the bill. 
I think we have a good supplemental here the way it came out of committee. Probably nobody would say it was perfect. But it is time that we work out the disagreements, have debate, have votes, and move to final passage. We can do that tomorrow, or we can do it Friday, or we can do it some other time. But I want to make it clear that we are ready to go and we are ready to have the debate and have the votes, and then we will go on from there. 
Mr. President, before I go to the closing script, would the Senator from South Dakota like to make some comments on these eloquent remarks I have been trying to deliver on this occasion?  
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to say I am very pleased to hear the Democratic leader say they are not delaying and they do not intend to delay. In this body, if you have one Senator who prefers not to vote for a while, he can pretty much make that happen. But if it is the Democratic leadership's intent not to delay, that is good news, and I am glad to hear that. 
I presume, then, that based on that we will probably pass cloture tomorrow, and we can move on to dispense with the amendments that are pending in a reasonable time. 
I think the Senator probably has the list of amendments that have been filed. As a matter of fact, there are only about 9 or 10 that state any purpose at all. Most of them have no statement of purpose on file.

Mr. LOTT. I thought it was 61 Democrats and 48 Republicans. 
The point I am making is I have a list here, 10 amendments indicated by 1 on our side, with no statement of purpose, and on the next page, 10 by your side. I think there is a lot of positioning and placeholding, and we understand that is the way it happens around here. I think if we could get cloture passed tomorrow and then work through the amendments that are still legitimately filed and we are concerned about, we can get those done tomorrow and bring this to a conclusion. If not tomorrow, at a reasonable time on Thursday so we can move on to other legislation. Of course, another thing, obviously, we would like to still hold the final passage until the House has acted. We may not actually be able to completely have the final passage until Thursday if the House has not acted by Wednesday, but we could complete everything and then have final passage on Thursday. 
Now, with regard to the quote about not wanting the President to have the upper hand, that is right. I do not want him to have the upper hand. What we need to have is for nobody to have the upper hand. We need to have coequal positions: Congress has a certain responsibility, and the President has a certain responsibility and advantages. We need to find a way to work 
through that, where neither side can hold the other hostage, neither side. I am hoping we will find a way to do that over the next 24 hours or next 2 days. 
With that, Mr. President, I am prepared to go to close.

Mr. LOTT. If I could comment briefly on that. I have said here before, last year, and I actually started working on that a couple of months ago, and as the Senator is probably aware, I met resistance on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, to a large extent from the appropriators, members of the Appropriations Committee. I do not want to put the blame just on them, but I, personally, think this has been abused over the years and is being abused now. This legislating on appropriations bills is not the way to do business. 
However, as long as it is allowed under the rules, unless we can find some way to modify or change that, I am sure it will be used with great vigor on both sides of the aisle. That is not the way I think business should be done.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, there will be a cloture vote on the supplemental appropriations bill tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. In addition, Senators are reminded that all second degree amendments must be filed prior to the 10 a.m. cloture vote. If cloture is invoked, it is my intention to continue consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill and complete action, if not tomorrow--hopefully tomorrow--or as early Thursday, if possible, if it goes to the next day. 
Senators who intend to offer amendments to this legislation should be prepared to offer their amendments during Wednesday's session. I urge them to come to the floor during the daylight and offer their amendments, because we have a job to do here, and if we cannot make good progress tomorrow, then we will be here tomorrow night on this bill. Senators should be aware there are a number of amendments filed to the supplemental, so Senators should expect a busy voting day tomorrow. We could have several votes during the day, and we will notify Senators as soon as possible with respect to the exact times of the rollcall votes occurring during the session.

On Monday, at 1 p.m., the Senate will begin consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill. Amendments are expected to be offered. Therefore, votes could occur but are not expected prior to 5 p.m. on Monday. 
As we work through agreements on amendments, or getting an understanding about amendments, we will let Senators know what time they may expect votes late Monday afternoon, Tuesday, or early.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to express the deep gratitude of the Senate to Ms. Patty McNally, Executive Assistant and Protocol Officer in the sergeant at arms' office, who is retiring after more than 20 years of dedicated public service in the Senate. 
As the chief protocol staffer in the sergeant at arms office, Patty's responsibilities have included coordinating joint sessions of Congress, swearing-in ceremonies, serving many long hours as the Sergeant at Arms representative on the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee, and the more somber occasions of state funerals. Patty also was responsible for making the protocol and security arrangements for the numerous visits to the Senate heads of states and other dignitaries from around the world. 
In 1987, Patty played an important part in the making of Senate history, as she arranged and coordinated the transportation of the Senate delegation to Philadelphia to participate in a very special joint session of Congress that commemorated the bicentennial of the Constitution. 
Mr. President, Patty has made substantial contributions to this institution and in the celebration of democracy. Today, we celebrate her contribution and wish her the very best in her new life with her family and friends, and we will envy the view from her home of the Nubble Light House.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his comments. He knows quite well that there had been concerns, initially, about this nominee. I have been satisfied that she is qualified for the job. But I didn't know all the details of allegations or problems that had been identified. The committee, under the leadership of the chairman, took their time, they looked into the potential problems and allegations, and they finally took a vote. I believe it was a unanimous voice vote. Members of the committee had adequate time to look into these potential problems. I think the nominee has assured Senators that her conduct is going to be very circumspect as Secretary of Labor. I am satisfied that she will do that and that she will work with the Congress and the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, and will do a good job as Secretary of Labor. 
Now, the second problem, of course, has been the idea that there would be an Executive order with regard to Federal union contracting. There has been a considerable amount of concern, 
as the Senator knows, about this being done through Executive order. We feel that should be done by the Congress with recommendations and time for consideration. But we have worked out an understanding with the administration of how this matter will be handled. Based on their assurances, which we feel they will honor, we felt it was appropriate to proceed with this nominee. 
I want to say, again, that the nominee was not the problem over the last few weeks. The problem was an understanding about how labor law should be changed. I think we have reached a point where we can enter into this agreement. I thank the assistant majority leader, Don Nickles, for his effort. He is knowledgeable in this area. He has been aggressive in trying to identify the problem and trying to find a solution. I did have a chance to discuss this last night with the President. He has had an opportunity to discuss it with representatives from the White House, and I feel that an amicable arrangement has been reached. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act. By previous order, at 11:15 a.m. the Senate will vote on the second cloture motion to proceed to this bill, S. 543. As a reminder to all Senators, if that cloture vote fails, two additional cloture motions were filed last night and would be voted on, on Thursday. It is still my hope that the Senate will be allowed to move forward and begin consideration of this important legislation. In addition, the Senate could also be asked to turn to any other Legislative or Executive Calendar items that may be cleared.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on this legislation, again, I want to emphasize to the American people that we are being prevented from even debating the real merits of this very important legislation, which would give some degree of protection to volunteers from being sued when they are not even remotely involved in what may have caused a lawsuit. If they are involved in some excessive action or some misconduct, they would still be subject to lawsuits, but this would give some degree of protection to volunteers. 
I cannot help but again point out the fact that, at a time when there is this great conference in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, talking about voluntarism in America, how important it is to be involved with Little League, to be involved with reading, to be involved with the Boys and Girls Club, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army--be involved. Here, when we say, `Yes, but one of the problems is that you run the risk of being sued; if your good will causes you to be involved as a volunteer you could wind up having legal action against you and we want to provide some protection against that'--the Democrats are filibustering the motion to proceed to the bill. 
That is very curious. They say maybe it is related to other issues that have not been brought up. But the fact of the matter is, this is very clear. It is a very clear choice. Is the Senate going to go on record of supporting volunteers and giving them some reasonable protection against frivolous lawsuits, or are we going to side with the plaintiffs' lawyers who want to be able to sue everybody, anytime, anywhere they want to, even volunteers? We are going to have to choose. 
So I want to serve notice to the Senate we are going to vote on this issue over and over and over, and we will not go to other legislation until this Volunteer Protection Act is passed. 
You know, if there is going to be a lot of whining about we cannot do other things--this is important, fundamental legislation that tells an awful lot about whether we are honest about wanting to encourage volunteers and be helpful to volunteers in America. 
I would like to address some questions to the distinguished Senator from Georgia, who has done such outstanding work on this legislation. I commend him for being prepared to come to the floor of the Senate and point out what is actually in the bill. I put down some of the ridiculous allegations that I have heard against the bill yesterday, about who might be covered by this. You have stood here and you have answered the questions. You have told the truth about what is in the bill. You have been prepared to work out problems that might exist, although it does not look to me like anybody is really very serious about addressing concerns they may or may not have. So, I thank you on behalf of the volunteers of America for volunteering to stand here in the Senate and do battle for them. You have done a great job. I have heard a lot of other good speeches from our colleagues out here in the Senate, Senator Ashcroft--I encourage others to come over and engage in this debate. 
But would you answer for me this question? First of all, is this going to protect volunteers who are involved in misconduct in any way from legitimate lawsuits?

Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Georgia will yield, it is pretty clear and narrowly defined, as I read it. It would be 
applicable to volunteers or any category of volunteers in the performance of services for a nonprofit organization or governmental entity; and (2) nonprofit organizations or governmental entities. That is pretty narrow in its applicability. 
But let me ask you, are you telling me that there are examples in America where individuals who get involved with the Salvation Army or get involved with Little League Baseball literally are being sued?

Mr. LOTT. I thank you again for your effort. I am hoping we will begin to see a break in the stonewall against the motion to proceed to the bill today and that we will have some Democrats join in getting cloture so we can go on and finish our discussion of the bill and get to a final vote. I think that will happen because I think all of us really want to encourage voluntarism and I think this legislation will help that all across America. 
Then we can go on, either later on this week or next week, to take up some nominations that are pending on the Executive Calendar and be prepared on Monday to go to the supplemental appropriations bill. It is our intent to move forward with that legislation. There is a lot of complaining now that there may be some amendments in committee or amendments offered on the floor. What's new? This is the U.S. Senate. Any Senator, he or she, can offer an amendment. We can debate it. And there are those who say, `If you offer certain amendments or if there are certain things in the bill, we are going to filibuster those items and hold up the bill,' and then they say we are holding up the bill. 
I am saying now the Appropriations Committee will do its job today or tomorrow and report out the supplemental appropriations bill, hopefully in a way that will pay for the cost of the bill, for the most part. And then we will be prepared to begin on Monday and I will be prepared to have the final vote Tuesday or Wednesday. If we have to, we will file cloture to try to cut off a filibuster on items that may or may not be in the bill. And we hope to be able to complete it Wednesday or Thursday of next week. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act. Debate on the motion to proceed will continue until 12:30 p.m., with the time equally divided between Senator Coverdell, or his designee, and the ranking member, or his designee. From 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m., the Senate will be in recess for the weekly policy luncheons. By a previous order, at 2:15 p.m., there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act. If cloture is invoked, there will be 1 hour of debate, followed by a vote on the motion to proceed. As a reminder, a second cloture motion was filed last night on the motion to proceed to S. 543. Therefore, if cloture is not invoked at 2:15 p.m., there will be a second vote on Wednesday. Hopefully, cloture will be invoked today, and the Senate can begin consideration of this important bill. 
I note again, this is debate on the motion to proceed on a bill that seems to me we would certainly want to pass in short order to provide some basic protection for volunteers who serve on boards of charitable organizations, volunteer organizations. That is the spirit of what we have seen in Philadelphia for the last 3 days, and yet, if you volunteer in America, you run the risk of being sued. Maybe we can work out some of the concerns that lawyers may have about this bill. But it seems like it is the fair thing to do. 
We have other work we need to do. I am sure Senators would like to turn to the supplemental appropriations bill as soon as possible. We hope that bill will be ready for consideration Wednesday or Thursday, but we have to dispose of the Volunteer Protection Act first. There are other concerns that we think need to be addressed. So we will be working with the minority leader to see if we can come to some agreement on how we can conclude these very important pieces of legislation. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be heard just briefly on the legislation itself. 
You will note that in my opening statement here, the debate 
is on the motion to proceed. I want the American people to hear that. We basically have the threat of a filibuster from the Democrats on even taking up for consideration the substance of the bill, S. 543. 
What is this bill? This bill is the Volunteer Protection Act. I think it is quite a coincidence, highly ironic actually, that there is this meeting now in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, to encourage voluntarism in America--a worthy goal. And I have been impressed by the participants and by what they have had to say. We need to encourage Americans to volunteer, to be more philanthropic, to contribute what they can, not only of their money but of their time--a worthy goal of America. And while America leads all the rest of the world already in that effort, we can all do more, I am sure. 
But now comes this bill and trying to protect volunteers from being sued. In many instances in America, if you volunteer, if you go on a charitable organization's board of directors, if you join some of the volunteer organizations, you run the risk of being sued and being held personally liable. 
So in the spirit of the conference going on in Philadelphia, it seems very appropriate to me that the Senate would pass legislation to provide some reasonable modicum of protection against these frivolous lawsuits that discourage people from volunteering, and yet we are being told that we are going to have a filibuster of even proceeding to this bill. 
Let me read some of the components of this bill. It says: 
To provide certain protections [not total protections, but certainly protections] to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities in lawsuits based on the activities of volunteers. 
It says that: 
The Congress finds and declares that--

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today, until 3:30 p.m., the Senate will be in a period of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act. As announced last week, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. However, under the previous agreed to order, there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 543 at 2:15 tomorrow. If cloture is invoked, the Senate will continue debate on the motion to proceed for 1 hour, followed by a vote on the motion. Therefore, additional votes may occur during tomorrow's session of the Senate. In fact, I expect that there will be. 
Hopefully, the Senate will be able to finish action on the Volunteer Protection Act early this week so we can begin consideration at some point--and it is not clear now whether it would be Wednesday or Thursday; and it will partially depend at least on what happens in the House on the supplemental appropriations bill--but, again, all Senators will be notified of changes in the schedule. And I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. LOTT. I do still have my leader time. If I need that, we can use that also. 
Mr. President, I had planned on and had hoped to be able to speak after all of the votes on the motions to strike because I did not in any way want to distract from those motions to strike. I have hopes that at least some of them might actually be defeated, particularly the one with regard to inspectors coming into the United States from some of the so-called rogue countries, but I think it is important we go ahead and state our positions at this point. Everybody has made their case. It is time to make decisions and to move on. I want to start by thanking Senator Helms for his cooperation. Without his cooperation, we would not be here today. His cooperation guaranteed that we were able to develop a process that was fair, that allowed us to get S. 495 up and voted on last week, that all of the remaining issues in disagreement would have an opportunity to be debated, considered and voted upon. 
He really has done an excellent job. There is no question that he continues to have great reservations about this legislation. But his efforts and the efforts of Senator Kyl from Arizona have been nothing short of heroic. They have been tenacious. They have done their homework. They have made excellent statements both here and in our closed session earlier today. I think they should be commended for what they have done. In fact, their work and their success has contributed greatly to the likelihood that this treaty actually will pass. That had not necessarily been their intent, but they wanted to make sure, if it did pass, they wanted it to pass in the best possible form. 
I also thank the Democratic leader for his courtesies as we worked through a very complicated unanimous-consent agreement. We were watched over very carefully by the Senator from West Virginia. I thank the Senator from Delaware, [Mr. Biden] for his cooperation and his patience, and I think the fact that we have all sort of kept cool heads and been careful how we proceeded has served us well. 
Mr. President, our Constitution is unique in the power it grants the Senate in treaty making. Article II, section 2 states the President `shall have the power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.' 
The Senate's coequal treaty making power is one of our most important constitutional duties. All 100 Senators have approached this duty very seriously in examining the Chemical Weapons Convention, as we should. We have participated in and we have listened to hearings laying out the arguments for and against the convention. We have looked closely at many provisions of the convention and have sought the advice and counsel of experts and former policymakers. We read many articles and we have heard the arguments making the case for and against it. 
Before addressing my views on the convention itself, I should like to share with my colleagues a brief history of the Senate's action on this convention, how we got to where we are today. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed by the United States as an original signatory on January 13, 1993, in the last days of President Bush's administration. For reasons that remain unclear, it was 10 months before President Clinton sent the convention to the Senate. In his transmittal letter, dated November 23, 1993, President Clinton wrote: 
I urge the Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the convention and to give advice and consent to its ratification as soon as possible in 1994. 
Let me remind my colleagues that for the next 11 months, until the 103d Congress adjourned on December 1, 1994, the Senate majority leader was George Mitchell and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee was Claiborne Pell. 
Despite Democratic control of the White House and the Senate, the Senate did not consider the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1994. 
In late 1995, Senate Democrats began a filibuster on the State Department authorization bill to force action on the CWC. On December 7, 1995, an agreement was reached providing for the convention to be reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee by April 30, 1996. The committee honored that agreement, and the convention was placed on the Executive Calendar. 
That is where matters stood when I became majority leader on June 12, 1996. Only 6 days later, before I had a chance to get my sea legs at all, there began a filibuster once again by the Senate Democrats to force Senate action on the convention. 
To allow critical national defense legislation to proceed, we worked with Senators on both sides of the aisle, and again we reached an agreement guaranteeing a vote by September 13, 1996.

Mr. LOTT. On September 12, the day the Senate was scheduled to begin debate on the convention, Secretary of State Christopher called me and asked that the vote be canceled. I quizzed him. I wanted to make sure that was what the administration was asking and that I would be able to come out to the floor of the Senate and explain that is why it was being done. It was canceled because it was clear, in my opinion, the convention was likely to be rejected at that time by the Senate. 
I acceded to the Secretary's request. We canceled the vote, and it went back to the Foreign Relations Committee calendar at the end of the 104th Congress. 
In January of this year, the President and his national security advisers made it clear that the Chemical Weapons Convention remained a top priority. On January 8, 1997, I wrote to the President explaining some of our arms control priorities, including the submission of three significant treaty modifications for advice and consent: The ABM Demarcation Agreement, the ABM Multilateralization Agreement and the flank agreement to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty. The administration had previously refused to submit these treaties for Senate ratification. 
I wrote at that time. 
Bipartisanship is a two-way street. Your administration has now restarted a public campaign to gain Senate advice and consent for the Chemical Weapons Convention. As you seek bipartisan cooperation, you must understand our expectation for such cooperation on ABM multilateralization, ABM demarcation and CFE flank limits. 
On March 18, I again wrote the President reminding him that I had not received a response to that January 8 letter. I also pointed out that `it is essential that you and your administration honor the publicly stated commitments to work closely and expeditiously with Chairman Helms on issues before the committee, including the presentation of a plan to reorganize the U.S. foreign affairs agencies. 
From the beginning of the 105th Congress, I made clear as best I could to all who would listen in the administration that bipartisanship could not mean forcing the Senate into acting on administration-chosen priorities if we did not likewise have an opportunity to consider issues that are important to the Senate, in fact, issues we think have long since been sent to us for action with regard to arms control treaties. 
We stated that we thought it was vital that we get State Department reorganization and real reform at the United Nations. This was not a quid pro quo but a simple statement of reality. Working in a cooperative fashion, as we must, means that both sides have to be forthcoming on issues in these foreign policy very important, critical areas. 
Let me briefly review the status of each of these three related issues. On the arms control treaties, the administration did reconsider their positions very carefully and they came back and agreed to send the Conventional Forces in Europe Flank Agreement to the Senate for advice and consent. Hearings have already been scheduled on this treaty, and I expect a resolution of ratification to be before the full Senate in the near future. President Clinton agreed to submit the agreed statement on demarcation to the Senate for advice and consent. This treaty, agreed to in principle between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at the Helsinki summit, will provide the Senate an opportunity to consider the administration's approach toward negotiating constraints on our defensive systems pursuant to the administration's interpretation of the ABM Treaty. I am sure we will have quite an interesting and lively debate on that, but certainly we should take advantage of our responsibilities to do just that. Along with many of my colleagues, I have expressed grave doubts about the wisdom of this administration's approach in that area. Now, however, we have a full opportunity to debate the policy and this treaty in the ratification process. 
The President still does not agree that they should send forward the treaty dealing with multilateralization. We think the Constitution requires it; his lawyers disagree. We will continue to press the administration to accept our position in this area, and they understand we should keep talking about it. 
If this provision is contained in the final agreement that is submitted to the Senate for advice and consent in connection with demarcation, it will give us an opportunity to debate it. 
On U.N. reform, our now Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked that we begin to actually meet and talk about U.N. reform; that we meet with a U.N. presiding officer; that he come and visit with us. He did. We have started a process between the House and Senate, Republicans and Democrats, our chairmen and ranking members, to take a look at what should be done with regard to the arrearages we may or may not owe, how can we deal with the U.S. assessment at the United Nations that could be fairer, and we are working from a comprehensive Republican document as a basis for the discussions. I think we see some action already occurring. The Secretary General has been working at it, and I think he understands we are very serious about U.N. reform. 
On State Department reorganization, I am very pleased that the administration has proposed, I think, some major changes. Chairman Helms, and many others, have worked to streamline our foreign policy bureaucracy, and now it looks like we are going to have a chance to do that. 
The Agency for International Development, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency were started and organized during the cold war. Barely more than a year ago, President Clinton vetoed a bill which would have mandated the dismantling of only one foreign affairs agency. Last week, however, thanks to the efforts of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the involvement of the President, the President agreed to abolish both the USIA and ACDA and to fold many of AID's functions into the State Department. This will make our scarce resources go farther, increase coordination and help ensure American interests, not bureaucratic interests, are behind our foreign policy decisionmaking. 
On each of these parallel issues--and I call them parallel, that is the way they have always been discussed--we have made progress. I think it is important that we realize that. Thanks to the persistence of the chairman and thanks to a Secretary of State that is working with us now, we have made progress with U.N. reform, with State Department reorganization, and the fact we will be able to consider these treaties. No serious observer can claim that we have not moved forward in these areas. 
There have been important changes in the Chemical Weapons Convention over the past few months. Last September, I worked closely with Senators Helms, Kyl and others in opposition to the treaty. Had we not canceled the vote, I would have voted against it, and I believe that it would have failed. 
In the aftermath of that debate, some in the White House blamed political motivations. The President said it was partisan politics involving America's security. But, fortunately, calmer heads have prevailed this year. The administration did come to the table and they have negotiated with us. They recognize the legitimate concerns that were ignored last year. So we have engaged in a process of member-and-staff-level discussions that have had a major impact on this convention. 
There are 28 agreed items in this resolution of ratification that were not there last September. Senator Kyl, Senator Helms, and Senator Biden have been working together on this. They reached agreements. Some of them Senator Biden said, `Yes, we should do this,' and the administration didn't particularly agree. Others in the administration said, `Yes, we should do it,' and some of our colleagues did not agree with it. There has been a give and take, but real progress has been made. 
Many of these items have addressed the concerns that have been cited by opponents as reasons to oppose the CWC last year. I have gone over some of the letters, some of the memos I have received--and I have received a lot of them--and point by point has been addressed, maybe not 100 percent, maybe not to their total satisfaction, but progress has been made. I will not go down the whole list of 28, but I want to list some of the more critical ones where real progress has been made. 
First, on search and seizure, condition 28 requires search warrants for all involuntary searches of American facilities. We were worried about a constitutional problem here. Now it has been addressed. 
Second, on our ability to use riot control agents, condition 26 ensures that the U.S. policy since 1975 remains in effect. Our military can use nonlethal agents, such as tear gas, to rescue downed pilots. Certainly, that should have been in there all along. I don't know why there was resistance to it, but it has been addressed. 
Third, on intelligence sharing, condition 5 places strict limits on all U.S. intelligence shared with the international 
organization established under the CWC. 
Fourth, on maintaining robust chemical defenses, condition 11 mandates a series of steps including negotiations with our allies, planning for chemical weapons in war game scenarios and high-level leadership of the U.S. Army's Chemical School. 
Fifth, on information sharing, an area that has worried me the most and right up until this very moment, progress has been made in two ways. First, with regard to these articles X and XI, condition 7 makes crystal clear that nothing in the CWC undermines U.S. export control laws, and that the informal Australia Group export controls will continue. Condition 15 helps to ensure that defensive assistance under the convention will be strictly limited. So I invite my colleagues who may still have some doubts to look at these conditions--conditions 7 and 15--dealing with information sharing and how we have restrictions on the defensive assistance. 
Sixth, on financing Russian implementation, which I think is a ridiculous idea personally on its face, but condition 14 precludes the United States from making any commitment to finance Russia's chemical weapons destruction program in an effort to secure Russian ratification of CWC. 
Seventh, conditions 1, 17, 6, and 20 preserve Senate prerogatives in this and in future treaties. They preserve our right to pass reservations to treaties, to ratify future amendments to the CWC and to make clear the executive branch cannot commit to appropriations in advance of congressional action. 
Eighth, on noncompliance, condition 13 requires a series of steps to be taken by the United States in the event of noncompliance by a party to the convention. Condition 13 mandates unilateral actions and requires the United States to seek a series of multilateral actions to deal with CWC violations. 
Ninth, conditions 3 and 22 address financial concerns about the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons set up under this convention. One sets a binding limit on the U.S. assessment to ensure we are not creating another international entitlement program, and the other requires an independent inspector general be created to increase accountability of the OPCW. 
Finally, condition 10 requires an annual report of condition that, for the first time in arms control, shifts the burden of proof to making the administration certify compliance. As previous experience has demonstrated, the arms control bureaucracy has refused to find clear evidence of noncompliance. This condition will change and will ensure our vigilance on monitoring issues. 
Each of these conditions makes the resolution before us today a better document, there is no doubt about it, certainly better than the document we were considering last fall. Each of these changes addresses concerns raised by treaty opponents last year and addresses my own concerns. In addition, the Senate is considering this convention in a manner agreed to by all 100 Senators. We first considered, and passed, as I said earlier, S. 495, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997 sponsored by Senator Kyl. We are considering the resolution of ratification drafted by Senator Helms. Think about that. We are considering that resolution that he drafted and that he had in the committee. That is what we brought to the floor, and the process requires that motions to strike be offered to take provisions out. Much progress has been made, and many Senators have been cooperative. 
But there should be no mistake, serious problems remain with this convention. Unfortunately, key protections in the resolution of ratification may be stricken out in our debate today, and we will have some more votes in a few minutes. 
Condition 33 on verification requires the President to certify the same standard of verification developed under the Reagan-Bush administrations--high confidence in detecting militarily significant violations in a timely manner. Detecting the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons may be more difficult than detecting the existence, obviously, of nuclear-armed warheads. 
But I will vote to retain the verification standard that has served our country well in previous arms control agreements. I understand why my colleagues might not agree with that and they might vote in a way that would lower this verification standard, but it is a serious problem. 
Condition 30, which we just voted on, I think should have been kept in the document. 
Condition 29 conditions U.S. participation in the convention upon demonstrated actions by the country with the largest chemical weapons arsenal on Earth--Russia. Russia has not implemented the Bilateral Destruction Agreement signed in 1990. Russia has not submitted accurate data on chemical weapons. That is a real concern, and we have reason to believe they are devoting resources now to develop new chemical agents which are outside the scope of CWC. I support retaining this condition because I believe it makes sense to expect Russia to live up to past agreements before entering into new ones. 
I strongly support condition 31 which would require the 
President to exercise the power given in the verification annex to the convention to bar inspectors from terrorist states and from states which have violated U.S. proliferation law, particularly, I hope and think that we can defeat the motion to strike here. It is not a killer amendment and we ought to retain the right to bar those inspectors. 
Finally, there is the most serious question of articles X and XI, whether these provisions on information sharing will increase the likelihood of, in fact, chemical weapons proliferation. Over the past few weeks, I made it clear to the administration as best I could the legitimate concerns about the impact of articles X and XI had to be addressed more than what was in the condition. I support delaying our ratification until the CWC is renegotiated to deal with these articles. For obvious reasons, the administration does not want to do that, and probably the majority of the Senate would not want to do that. 
But this very morning, I received a letter from President Clinton which I think is significant. The President made specific assurances that the United States would exercise its right to withdraw from the convention if any one of three things occurred: If countries used `article X to justify providing defensive chemical weapons equipment, material, or information to another state party that could result in U.S. chemical protective equipment being compromised. . .'; 
If countries use article XI to justify chemical transfers which undermine the Australia Group. 
If countries carried `out transfers or exchanges under either article X and XI which jeopardize U.S. national security by promoting chemical weapons proliferation; 
These are specific and probably unprecedented. Yes, it is a letter. It is not in the document, but it is signed by the President of the United States in very strong language that, frankly, I was pleased but somewhat surprised that he agreed to say, I will withdraw after consultation with the Senate. If any one of these things happen, he is the President and his assurances in foreign policy must make a difference. They address countries even justifying transfers where there is concern. They address transfers which promote chemical weapons proliferation. 
Mr. President, I think this is a very important document. I have made that letter available to our colleagues. I have more copies. 
Every Member has struggled with one fundamental question: Are we better off with or without this convention? In my mind, there is no easy answer. I want to know that my children and our country will be better off, and that we will be better able to deal with chemical weapons with it, but I have my doubts. 
Experts, whose opinions I respect deeply, are divided on the question. Over the last 2 weeks, I have had many conversations to discuss this convention. I spoke with Presidents Bush and Ford. I talked with my good friend, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Cap Weinberger, Steve Forbes, former Secretary of State James Baker, Jim Schlesinger, Colin Powell, uniformed military officers--a great variety of people. I met with leaders of groups that are deeply opposed and well informed about the treaty's flaws. I talked with President Clinton, Secretary Albright, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili. 
Republican Senators, with long experience in national security matters, are divided. On this issue, reasonable people can and do disagree, and reasonable people will vote on opposite sides. 
After our negotiations, hearings, and discussions, it is time to make decisions--decisions that will be important to the future of our men and women in uniform, and the future security of our country. 
I have decided to vote in support of the Senate giving its advice and consent to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I will do so not because I believe it will end the threat posed by chemical weapons or rid the world of poison gas. I will do so not because I believe this treaty is verifiable enough or even enforceable enough. And I will not do so because I believe there are no additional proliferations concerns related to articles X and XI. 
I will vote for the convention because I believe there will be real and lasting consequences to the United States if we do not ratify the convention. In a very real sense, the credibility of commitments made by two Presidents of our country--one Republican and one Democrat--is at stake. 
I will vote for the convention because the judgment of the most senior former and current military commanders believe it will make our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines more safe in potential battlefields and less likely to face the horrible prospect of chemical weapons. 
I will vote for the convention because I believe the United States is marginally better off with it than without it. It will provide new tools to press signatories for compliance. It will enable us to gain access to sites and information we are currently unable to examine. 
Through the important and enlightening debate we have had over the past few months, I am convinced the convention will bring new focus and energy to this administration's nonproliferation efforts. We have certainly heightened the awareness and knowledge of the concerns we have. One year ago, few of us even knew about the Australia Group. Now we have committed ourselves and the administration to keeping the Australia Group as a viable tool to limit access to chemicals and technology. 
Yes, the CWC may give legal cover to proliferators in Teheran or in Beijing. But they have undertaken such efforts in the past and no doubt will do it again in the future. 
I believe our allies in Europe are more likely to join with us in isolating Iran if we are a party to this convention than if we reject it tonight. They have made it clear that they hope we will ratify it, whether it is Canada or whether it is Britain or our European allies or Japan. 
I believe this convention will increase the cost of covert chemical weapons programs, and it will increase our chances of detecting such programs. 
I think there is a long list of good reasons why we should do this today. I have struggled with it. I would like to take just a minute, if I can, to talk on a personal note. 
Many people in the media have tended to say, well, you know, this is going to determine the fate of various and sundry Senators and tell a lot about leadership. It has been exaggerated. 
I have talked to a lot of Senators one on one. Not one of them--not one of them--has said that they would vote on it on any basis other than what is best for our country. 
The way the Senate works, we debate these issues--we read, we study, we argue, we go back and forth. We set up a fair process, and then we come to a conclusion. We make a decision. We vote on it. And I do not think it is fair to exaggerate any one Senator's role in this whole effort. 
I think the Senate should be complimented today for the way it has handled this. I think that Madison, and others, placed their faith in this institution. And I think it has worked well. 
The efforts of Senator Helms and Senator Kyl have been heroic. They have done a magnificent job. Others that have supported the convention have done their part, too. 
I think that this process has helped the Senate as an institution to exercise the leadership assigned to it by the Constitution. And that, I submit, is the only real test of leadership that truly matters. 
I urge the adoption and ratification of this treaty.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have already stated my position. I do think we should vote to ratify this convention, but I think we should defeat this motion to strike. This is not 
a killer amendment. This is very serious, where we are just saying that we should have the ability, the President should have the ability, to bar these inspectors from these countries that have violated U.S. nonproliferation laws. You are talking about inspectors from so-called, as the Secretary of State has called them, `rogue nations' that want to come in here and get into finding information that could help them to further contribute to proliferation. 
So I urge the Senate on this motion to vote to defeat the motion to strike. We should have the ability, we should as a matter of fact I think require that we bar these inspectors from coming into this country when they are contributing to the problem all over the world. So I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, today, at 10:30 a.m., the Senate will begin a closed executive session in the Old Senate Chamber to continue the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention so that Members can be briefed on certain classified information. This is the first time in several years that we have had such a briefing. I urge all Senators to attend. I think they will find it very interesting. They need to know what will come out of this briefing before they make a final decision. 
The closed session is expected to last until approximately 12:30. After the expiration of time for the closed session, the Senate will then immediately resume consideration of the treaty in this Chamber. By previous consent, the Senate will continue the debate with respect to the treaty until all time is expired or is yielded back under the time agreement. I think there is something like 1 hour 40 minutes or 2 hours of general time remaining, something about that amount. 
In addition, by consent, the five motions to strike will be in order at any time following the closed session. Separate votes on each of the motions are expected. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the day and into the evening in order for the Senate to complete action on the treaty today. It would appear to me that the final vote will come sometime between 8 and 9 o'clock probably, perhaps a little earlier, but that is the way it looks at this point. 
Again, I encourage all Members to participate in this important debate beginning in a few minutes in the Old Senate Chamber.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will begin consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty. Under the previous order, there will be 10 hours of debate to be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member or their designees and 1 hour under the control of Senator Leahy. Also, in accordance with the agreement, a limited number of amendments are in order to the resolution of ratification. 
The Senate will recess at 12:30 p.m. until the hour of 2:15 to allow for the weekly policy meetings, and when the Senate reconvenes, we will resume consideration of the treaty. I hope that perhaps we could get an agreement to have one of the votes occur later on this afternoon. I believe there may have been some discussions on that. If not, we will have the votes on motions to strike, if any. There, I believe, were five agreed to in our unanimous-consent agreement, and, of course, we are anticipating that the final vote will occur sometime tomorrow night, I assume between 5, 6 and 8 o'clock. And, of course, as always, we will notify Senators of anticipated rollcall votes as early as possible. But there would not be one, if any, today until late in the day. There will be a number of votes throughout the day on Thursday, and I urge Senators to be prepared to answer the votes quickly so that we can get through the five motions to strike that may be offered under the agreement and to final passage at a reasonable hour tomorrow. 
Also, unless there were a lot of yielding back of time, I do not anticipate that we could finish even in the early afternoon or late afternoon on Thursday. I think it clearly is going to go into the evening. 
With that, Mr. President, I would be glad to yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 created procedures for judicial review of employment discrimination claims throughout the Congress to govern cases arising after the requirements of the law took effect on January 23, 1996. The Senate's antecedent process for review of discrimination claims in Senate employment, which was created by the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, continues to govern older cases. The case of William L. Singer versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, now pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal circuit, is a case initiated under the 1991 act. 
The petitioner in this case, a former officer in the Capitol Police Department, seeks review of a ruling of the Select Committee on Ethics, which affirmed a decision of a hearing board appointed by the Director of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices. The hearing board decision rejected the officer's claim that his termination from the Capital Police violated the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, as made applicable by the Government Employee Rights Act. 
Under the Government Employee Rights Act, a final decision of the Ethics Committee is entered in the records of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, which is then named as the respondent if the decision is challenged in the Federal circuit. As petitions for review in the Federal circuit challenges final decisions of a Senate adjudicatory process, under the Government Employee Rights Act the Senate legal counsel may be directed to defend those decisions through representation of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in court. 
Accordingly, this resolution directs the Senate legal counsel to represent the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in the case of Singer versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in defense of the Ethics Committee's final decision.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business to accommodate a number of Senators who wish to speak on a variety of subjects. There will be no rollcall votes, however, during today's session due to the observance of Passover. I remind my colleagues that the weekly party luncheons normally held today will be held tomorrow, Wednesday. 
By the unanimous consent agreed to on Thursday of last week, the Senate will begin consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty tomorrow with, I believe, 10 hours of debate allowed. Then on Thursday there will be five motions to strike with 1 hour of debate on each of those and, presumably, votes on each one of the five, with the expectation of a final vote around 6 o'clock on Thursday. 
Under the previously agreed time agreement, Senators can anticipate votes on the treaty as early as Wednesday afternoon--I want to emphasize that--as well as a variety of votes on Thursday morning and throughout Thursday. As always, we will notify Senators of any scheduled votes or changes as soon as possible, or actions we wish to take on the Executive Calendar. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of this legislation that has been drafted by Senator Kyl and joined in with cosponsorship from Senators Helms, Nickles, Mack, Coverdell, Shelby, Hutchison, and myself, as well as others. We introduced this legislation on March 21. This is important legislation. I know there are a lot of people who are trying to assess will this legislation favorably or unfavorably affect the final vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I do not think you can really judge that. Senators that will vote on both sides of the issue on this bill and that bill will view it in different ways depending on their own personal perspective. The most important thing is this is a bill we should have passed. We should already have passed it irrespective of what might happen on the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
As I have gotten into this issue and studied this bill, I am amazed that we do not already have laws on the books dealing with sanctions against any country that uses chemical and biological weapons against another country or its own nationals, that we do not allow a range of chemical and biological weapons within the United States. I cannot believe we have not already done it. 
This is very good legislation. I hope action on this legislation will put one myth to rest once and for all: No one supports chemical weapons in the United States. Everyone is opposed to them. We all know they are terrible things. Whether they are used in a military situation or civilian situation like we have seen in recent instances in other parts of the world, they are a horrendous thing and they should be eliminated from the face of the Earth in any way we can do it. 
As a matter of U.S law, our chemical weapons stockpile will be destroyed by 2004. No matter what happens on the chemical weapons treaty, we already made a commitment and in fact are in the process of destroying our own stockpiles by 2004. Whether or not we pass this bill or whether or not we ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, the weapons in the United States are being destroyed. 
Next week, when we get this UC agreement worked out, the Senate will debate and vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I have a number of key concerns about the convention which have not yet been resolved, but to the credit of the proponents and the administration, they have been working with us, I believe, in good faith. We have had a number of minor and some major improvements. We are still working on that language at this very moment. But 
fundamental issues exist, some of which have not been resolved. 
I do think that requiring search warrants for involuntary searches is essential. Protecting United States intelligence information is vital; ensuring United States chemical defensive technology and equipment, making sure it is not shared with Iran or other countries that could possibly under this convention get access to United States information or information from other parts of the world in terms of how chemical technology can be utilized for chemical weapons or also how that technology or equipment could be used in defense capability. We do not want that kind of information spread throughout the globe to those rogue countries that in fact have already been using chemical weapons, have that capability and have indicated they either will be in the convention or may not. 
But serious concerns remain. Whether the convention is verifiable enough, whether Russia is taking steps to perhaps violate the treaty and, most importantly, whether provisions in the convention actually increase the likelihood of chemical weapons proliferation, those are all very important questions and we will vote on those issues next week in one form or another through a motion to strike or on final passage. I know all Senators are weighing the information very seriously. To the credit of our committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, in the hearings they have been having, we have been hearing testimony from very distinguished Americans on both sides of the issue. 
It is being analyzed and critiqued in articles and editorials. I believe the Senate now is focusing on this issue, and that is as it should be. This bill will help to do that. 
Today, though, the Senate will have an opportunity to take real enforceable and effective action to address the threat of chemical weapons. The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act includes comprehensive domestic and international steps to act against these horrible weapons. 
Domestically, this bill provides for civil and criminal penalties for the acquisition, possession, transfer or use of chemical or biological weapons. Again, it is amazing we do not already have this on the books. 
It designates the FBI as the lead domestic agency to address chemical weapons threats. 
Our bill provides for a Federal death penalty in cases when the use of weapons results in the loss of life. Swift and certain punishment can help ensure that terrorists do not use chemical weapons against America, and ending bureaucratic struggles can help ensure any terrorists get caught quickly. 
Internationally, this legislation directs the administration to add enforcement provisions to existing international bans on the use of chemical weapons. Use of chemical weapons has been banned since 1925 in the Geneva Protocol, but the world knows this ban has not been effective. In fact, in the 1980's, after clear evidence--clear evidence--of Iraq's use of chemical weapons against its own people, the international community did nothing--did nothing. It is time to add enforcement mechanisms to that Geneva Protocol.

Further, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above-listed amendments, closed session, and the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution of ratification, as amended, all without further action or debate, and following the vote the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action or, if the resolution is defeated, the resolution to return to the President be deemed agreed to and the Senate resume legislative session. 
Further, I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that prior to the Memorial Day recess the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, shall turn to the consideration of the implementing legislation, and it be considered under a time agreement of 2 hours to be equally divided, again, between the chairman and the ranking minority member, and there be only one amendment in order to be offered by the majority leader or his designee, and one amendment only to be offered by the Democratic leader or his designee, and limited to 1 hour each, to be equally divided in the usual form, and each amendment must be relevant to the implementing legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me ask you to state that again--that the motions to strike would be in order on Thursday, the 24th, whether or not the 10 hours has been completed? 
Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I could address this question to the Democratic leader. 
I do not see any reason why we should not have completed at that time, but you are just saying if the time is not agreed to, you want to delay the actions on the motions to strike. 
Mr. President, that would be my intent. I think that is what the agreement indicates. That is what we will do. I believe we will be able to get our time in on Wednesday or we will have an agreement to take part of the time Thursday morning and move immediately to a motion to strike, because we want to make sure that that time and those motions to strike are in order. And the time is required. There is about 6 hours or so. We will make sure that time is there.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me put in a quorum call at this point so we can make sure we understand the question to make sure we go over the history of why that language would be in there. 
I must say this is the longest and the most complicated unanimous-consent agreement that I have worked on since I have been majority leader. I know that the Senator from West Virginia has probably entered in some much longer, more complicated than this. But as I was reading through it, I even hesitated, to go back and reread at least one section there, to make sure it was accurate. I understood exactly what it meant. But we do need to clarify this particular point. 
I would like to suggest the absence of a quorum so I can get a proper explanation.

Mr. LOTT. If I could say to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, we have been working on both sides of the aisle to make sure that this was a very carefully and fairly drawn unanimous-consent agreement. There has been give-and-take on both sides. I am sure the way it is set up would not be the first choice for some of our colleagues that are proponents of the treaty. Let me assure you there are some things in here that the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, had to swallow hard to agree to. But we have been talking to Senator Biden, Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, and I am sure that Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy have been following closely. In fact, let me assure everyone they have been following closely, because Senator Leahy got another bite of the apple at the end. 
I believe we have set it up in a way that is fair. We set it up in a way, sir, where Senators like yourself will actually take the time to read the statements and conditionalities, will have time today and over the weekend and Monday and Tuesday, and even during the debate. We set it up carefully so there is adequate time for full debate. With a motion to strike, and hours of debate, we will have, I believe, and I certainly hope, the time to fully discharge our responsibilities. 
This is a very, very difficult issue for me. I have people I respect dearly, ultimately, on both sides of this treaty. It is a very important treaty dealing with a very important issue. I certainly have wanted to be careful about how we set it up, to have the time, have the hearings that are necessary so we hear from some of the opponents that we have not heard from, and give the proponents opportunities. 
I think the leadership always at the end tries to pull it together before one more cork pops loose, and we try to push it at the conclusion, at the end. If we missed a Senator or two, it certainly has just not been our intention, and we will work with you in every way we can to make sure you have the time to consider it, sir.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my previous unanimous-consent request, which I read into the Record in its entirety, with two changes. On the second page, I would make this change: 
That the first 28 conditions, declarations, statements, and understandings shall be identified as being agreed to between the chairman and the ranking minority member, that these 28 conditions, declarations, statements, or understandings not be subject to further amendments or motions, and a vote occur on adoption of Executive Resolution 75 to be followed by a vote on the agreed-upon 28 items, and, if agreed to, the motion or motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. 
Basically what that is saying is that there would be a voice vote on the underlying resolution and on the 28 conditions and declarations. 
Also, at the end of the unanimous-consent request, I would make this request: 
I further ask that Senator Leahy be recognized for up to 1 hour on Wednesday, April 23, and that prior to the adoption of the resolution or ratification there be an additional 10 minutes equally divided between the two leaders at that time.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to express the deep gratitude of the Senate to Ron Ledlow, the Deputy Director of the Senate Service Department, who is retiring after nearly 30 years of dedicated service to the Senate. 
Ron Ledlow began his career 27 years ago this week as a pressman on the night shift in the Service Department and rose through the journeyman ranks into management, eventually serving as the Director of the Senate Service Department. 
Ron has used his skill, creativity, and expertise in shepherding the Senate through nearly 30 years of changes in print, production, and graphics technology on which we as Members, and an institution, rely. 
Through all of these changes, Ron has been driven by his high standards for quality control and exceptional customer service. His professionalism and respect for his employees and this institution have been a great example to his coworkers, and to all of us here in the Senate. 
His contributions in support of democratic institutions are not limited to the U.S. Senate. In 1990, under the Gift of Democracy Resolution, Ron, along with several other congressional representatives, went to Poland as a technical adviser. His counsel and assistance helped strengthen the emerging democratic institutions of Poland. Ron's assistance was so valuable, that he was asked to return to Poland for another tour of duty. 
Outside of his work in the Service Department, Ron has served on several committees for the U.S. Senate Federal Credit Union. Ron was an active member of the Senate Staff Club and served as the club's president in the mideighties. In 1991, Ron was presented with the Roll Call Sid Yudain Congressional Staffer of the Year Award. 
Mr. President, our Senate family wishes Ron, his wife Dee, and his children Gerald and Steven the very best. We hope that Ron and Dee enjoy their well-deserved time on the links of South Carolina.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first I want to go ahead and speak on the legislation, S. 495, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997, in the interest of time. I think this is very important legislation, and I wanted to comment on it. But while we are in the final efforts to get an agreement on the unanimous consent agreement on how to consider the completion of this legislation, then when and how to take up the Chemical Weapons Convention next week, and how issues that are still in disagreement would be handled and how the motions to strike would be ordered--all of that is in the final phases of negotiation at this time. 
I would like to thank, at the beginning, Senator Kyl for the work he has put into this legislation and for his effort to come up with a fair and reasonable unanimous consent agreement as to how we would proceed. 
I thank Senator Helms for his cooperation and the highly respectable and respectful manner in which he has dealt with this issue in the very important hearings he had. 
Also, Senator Daschle has been persistent, but he has been reasonable in allowing us to have time to work through all the details. I think with an agreement of this importance and with as many parts to it as there is, you never could get it worked out to where it would just be 100 percent what everybody wants. But I think we have gotten it now to where it is fair, and I hope we can go ahead and close the loop, complete consideration of the legislation and then be prepared next week to move to the treaty itself. 
I see the Democratic leader is on the floor. 
Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the bill, in anticipation of entering into a unanimous-consent agreement, I will first observe the absence of a quorum. 
I withhold. Does the Senator from Texas wish to proceed at this time?

That is 3 hours, but we have those requests that have been made, and we have a Senator waiting to begin speaking now. So we will accommodate those requests. 
It is my hope that an agreement will be reached this morning to begin consideration of H.R. 1003, the so-called assisted suicide bill. If an agreement is reached, Senators can expect to begin consideration of the bill at 1 p.m. with a 3-hour time limitation. Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes this afternoon. I would expect at least one and possibly two. As always, I will notify Senators of the voting schedule as soon as possible. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been working this morning with all Senators, including the distinguished Democratic leader, to resolve a matter that emerged yesterday with regard to permitting access to the Senate floor of guide dogs and other equipment needed by disabled individuals. The resolution I am about to offer will allow the Sergeant at Arms to work immediately with staffers who have the need for guide dogs to be able to access the floor on a case-by-case basis. The resolution also calls for the Committee on Rules and Administration to consider a formal change in the Senate rules to address the situation. A permanent resolution is expected to be brought out of the committee before the full Senate so that we can have a formal rule on how matters of this nature will be handled. 
Again, I thank all Senators involved for their thoughtfulness in addressing the matter immediately. I think it is the right thing to do, and I am pleased that with today's action, assuming we can get this agreed to, the Senate will address an inequity that has been brought before us and we will remove roadblocks in the way of individuals helping us to serve the American people in the Senate. 
The chairman of the Rules Committee has been involved in this discussion, the ranking member. I believe we have touched bases on both sides, and I believe this is an appropriate resolution to an immediate problem but also one that can be addressed by the appropriate committee so that the rules will be a little clearer as to how this type of situation will be addressed in the future. 
Before I ask unanimous consent, I wonder; I see the Democratic leader, if he wanted to comment. Would the Senator like me to yield for comment before we get unanimous consent?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today is April 15, tax day. There has been a good effort underway between Senator Coverdell and Senator Glenn and Senator Roth and others to bring before the Senate very important legislation, S. 522, regarding the unauthorized access of tax returns. They have come to a bipartisan agreement. I think on this day it is very important that we have this legislation come before the Senate to be debated and voted on. The American people certainly feel that should be done. I think they will feel comforted by the fact that the Senate stepped up and has addressed these concerns. This idea of a snooping through taxpayers files is very offensive to all Americans. So we need to get this done today. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today, April 15, the Senate proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 37, S. 522, regarding the unauthorized access of tax returns and the bill be considered under the following limitations: That there be only 1 amendment in order to the bill, to be offered by Senators Coverdell, Glenn, and Roth, no other motions or amendments be in order, and further, total debate on the amendment and the bill be limited to 1 hour 35 minutes, divided equally between Senator Coverdell or his designee and Senator Glenn or his designee. I further ask consent that following the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on the Coverdell amendment, the bill then be read the third time, and there then be 10 minutes for debate, to be equally divided, to be followed by the final vote on passage of S. 522, as amended, if amended.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to that additional unanimous-consent request. I might say that I am from a State that has been disaster prone, and I know that Senator Daschle's area has had all kinds of problems this year--drought, flooding, freezing flooding, the works. We have had similar problems in my State, from droughts to floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, freezing rain, which have caused terrible devastation. So I am sympathetic to the problem. 
However, this is asking for a change in the law that has been in place since 1968. Clearly, my constituents and the constituents all over America that have had to deal with disasters have complied with and have dealt with this 30-day requirement of the insurance coverage versus 15 days. Regardless of that, I think it is something we should consider. But we have just recently been aware of the language of the Senator from South Dakota in this area. We need to assess whether there is objection to it. Will there be a budget impact? What does it mean for people that had to deal with it in the past or will in the future? We are checking with the chairmen of the Budget Committee, the Banking Committee, and the Finance Committee. I think we should not leap to do it until we know for sure exactly what the impact would be. 
Again, I do think we should work with each other in a bipartisan way, always, when disasters are involved. But as good stewards of our constituents, we need to make sure we understand the ramifications, too. 
So I think that within, hopefully, a relatively short period of time, we will be able to get an assessment of any negative impact that might come from this. 
I hope we can get started with this legislation, which is so important with regard to snooping through IRS files. Everybody understands that it is wrong. People are outraged by it. There is a bipartisan commitment to it. So if we don't get an agreement to get started on this now, or shortly, we will not be able to get it done today, which is symbolically a very important day to do it. So I would not be able to agree to this change in the bill at this time, while we are talking it out. 
I have suggested another alternative to make in order as an amendment. There are a lot of options. We could either withdraw it, or accept it, or vote on it later in the day. We will work with the Senators that have the jurisdiction. We will talk with the Senator from South Dakota to see if we can work something out on the flood insurance provision. 
In the meantime, I do object to the addition at this time. I plead with the Senator to allow us to proceed with this legislation under our unanimous-consent request while we continue to work on this issue.

I further ask unanimous consent that following the expiration or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to the vote on the Coverdell amendment, the bill then be read a third time and there be 10 minutes for debate at that point to be equally divided, to be followed at that point by a vote on S. 522, as amended if amendment.

But I want the Record to show that we worked to make sure that Senators' concerns, which were certainly understandable, were accommodated.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to now propound a unanimous-consent request that the Senate proceed immediately to the consideration of a Senate resolution submitted by myself regarding the sense of the Senate relating to tax relief for the American people. I further ask unanimous-consent that there be 10 minutes for debate on the resolution equally divided in the usual form, and following that debate the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the resolution to be followed by a vote on the preamble, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. 
I might take just a moment so that there can be a response to that unanimous-consent request. This is a sense of the Senate which just declares a need for tax relief for the American people, and condemns the abuses of power and authority committed by the Internal Revenue Service. 
We have discussed this with a number of Senators. We have provided it to the other side of the aisle. 
So I propound that unanimous-consent request.

Mr. LOTT. Also, I must say it is regrettable that the objection was heard on the earlier unanimous-consent request for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in this area. I had hoped the Senate would be able to adopt the resolution in a timely manner, considering this is April 15, tax day, the day that most Americans have the worst feeling about in the entire year. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and as a matter of fact I would assume that we could probably come together on language that would make it clear we feel that working Americans should have and deserve some tax relief and we need to do it today, not May 9, which is how long the American people have to work to pay their taxes for the year. Until May the 9th we all work for the Government, and then after that we get to keep the money we have been earning because we have paid off the tax burden that the American people are saddled with. 
I know of examples of young Americans who are working making $30,000 a year and their tax burden, when you add it all up, is probably 40 percent. Others, like my own young son who is a young entrepreneur, creating jobs, trying to help people get a job, keep a job, make a living, get some basic training, move on, are paying over 50 percent. We now have probably the highest tax burden on working Americans in history. It is very high. It is oppressive. 
With regard to the budget itself, as a matter of fact, Congress has only met the April 15 deadline for budget resolutions once in 15 years. That is not to say we should not do it. I had hoped we would meet that deadline this year, and I will work toward that goal in the future. One of the reasons we have not is because we have been working in good faith with the administration to see if we could come together on agreement of a package that would take us to balance by the year 2002 with tax relief for working Americans. 
I remind Senators, as a matter of fact, that there has been bipartisan support for tax relief for working Americans. Senator Breaux and Senator Lieberman have supported capital gains tax rate cuts. I think maybe the Senator from North Dakota was referring to that a moment ago. Senator Torricelli joined Senators Breaux, Nickles, Craig, and I in saying the estate tax, the death tax, clearly is one of the worst things we have in the Tax Code because it undermines the American dream of working and saving up something, producing something and leaving something to your children but now the tax law takes 44 percent, minimum, of a life's work above certain levels, once you get above the exemption, and up to 55 percent under certain conditions. 
We should raise that exemption for individuals, for small businesses, farmers, and ranchers, in the Senator's State, in the North Dakota area, in my State and all across America. 
So we should come up with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution today, April 15, that makes a commitment to reducing the burden. As a matter of fact, one of the reasons why we need to do it, the Senator will recall we had the largest tax increase in history that was passed in the first year of the Clinton administration, 1993. We need to give back a little bit of that to families with children, and to the capital gains area where a lot of people are not selling or not being able to get the benefit of their lands or stocks or what they own because they do not want to have to pay the excessive capital gains tax rate. 
But without saying OK, you did it, we did it, they did it, what I am advocating this afternoon is we get a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in a bipartisan way in which we agree that the American people deserve some relief. And that is what the title says here--declare the need for tax relief for the American people and condemn the abuses of power and authority committed by the Internal Revenue Service. We have already done that today. We have already said that their snooping around through files is wrong, and we put some penalties in the law for that. We worked together on that one. 
So it seems that while there has been objection heard on both sides I guess so far this afternoon, I think we ought to see if we cannot come to an agreement on something where the American people can say, yes, look, they really are committed to doing their job in controlling the rate of growth in the Federal Government and giving some tax relief to the American people. So I would be constrained at this point to object to that unanimous-consent request.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, also, I want to remind Senators again that the American people are watching and waiting to see what we have to say, in fact, about what we are going to do about taxes in this country. Tomorrow is the day that we all have to pay the taxes we owe. And the feeling I had gotten when I was home is that people are very upset with the tax burden, both the size of it, how much is taken from them in taxes, the variety of ways that it is taken from them, the unfairness in what we take away from families with children that could do more for and want to do more for their children. Also it discourages savings and investments in the economy. And we even tax death. It is time for us to do something about it. And this is the week to do it. 
We will have a number of comments and some votes tomorrow, in fact, on abuses at the Internal Revenue Service. When you have a computer system that has had millions of bucks spent on it that does not work, you have to ask, you know, how long can this go on, because we have provided millions of dollars. And also when you see that people are being fired for snooping through taxpayers' files, that is absolutely an unacceptable practice. 
So we need to stop the abuses. Then we need to give some tax relief. And then we need to reform the entire system. At a very minimum, this year we should give working people of this country some tax relief. And it is my hope we will be able to do that. 
We are going to be working with the administration, with the White House specifically, this week to see if we can come to an agreement on the tax cuts that we will have in our budget for this year. I hope we can reach an agreement. If we cannot, we will just have to proceed to a process that would allow us to get to a vote on this important issue this year. 
Mr. President, I see no Senator seeking recognition at this time. I do believe that a couple Senators are on the way. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, in 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and tasked the Federal Government with the handling of spent nuclear waste from commercial powerplants and military usages. Despite the clear congressional intent of the act, the Department of Energy has avoided and delayed positive action regarding temporary and permanent storage of nuclear waste. 
The 1982 act called for a permanent waste repository to be built by 1998. But DOE now says the earliest a repository will be ready is 2010. Given 15 years of relative inaction, this delay and avoidance history does not engender faith that the current administration will address this issue in a timely manner absent congressional action. Regrettably, the country that harnessed energy of the atom can't seem to accomplish the basic task of storing and disposing of waste. 
The Federal Government promised nuclear energy consumers that it would develop a plan to dispose of the waste. Congress obligated the Federal Government to begin the waste collection program in 1998. A Federal court of appeals ruled in 1996 that this is a binding legal obligation. 
The Federal Government, therefore, has a binding, legal obligation to pick up the nuclear waste scattered throughout the Nation's coastal communities, farm lands and industrial centers. It must remove used nuclear fuel from 34 States that now store used fuel at nuclear powerplants that were never intended to hold the waste until the end of time. 
Due to the foresight of 15 Senators who reported the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and in particularly its architects, Senators Frank Murkowski and Larry Craig, we are here today to put this program back on the road to recovering used fuel from commercial powerplants and DOE facilities that store high-level radioactive waste from defense-related projects. In 30 years of operation, that waste has amounted to a relatively small sum, given that nuclear electricity powers 65 million homes at any given time in the United States. All of the used fuel produced from nuclear electricity during its history, if stacked end to end, would span a football field to a depth of almost 4 yards. 
While a permanent repository is the ultimate requirement, no one can legitimately deny that an interim storage facility is an absolute necessity. 
Let's talk for a minute about the cost to the public. America's electricity consumers have relied upon the availability of nuclear energy. But such consumption did not occur in a vacuum and without cost. These energy users have already committed nearly $13 billion to pay for the Federal waste disposal program--a staggering figure considering there's nothing to show for such costs to date except for a few feasibility studies. The bill continues to climb, even as the Department of Energy says it will be unable to start taking used fuel by the 1998 deadline. 
Some States are so frustrated by the Federal Government's failure on this program that they are considering withholding their share of the more than $600 million a year that flows from electricity customers to the U.S. Treasury. How can we blame them? 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, would put an end to bureaucratic delays and spiraling program costs by integrating three components: 
First, a Federal storage facility for centralized management of used fuel until a permanent disposal facility is ready; 
Second, a continued scientific study on a permanent disposal site at Yucca Mountain, NV; and, 
Third, a transportation network to move used fuel safely from nuclear powerplants, research reactors and DOE sites to storage and disposal facilities. 
It has been argued by some that we cannot safely transport spent or used nuclear fuel waste from nuclear powerplants to a central storage facility. Certainly the naysayers recognize that we do not intend to throw used nuclear fuel on a truckbed or in a boxcar. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has rigid standards about the types of containers it permits nuclear waste to be transported in. All such containers must receive their stamp of approval. Before such approval, containers must undergo an onslaught of tests without breaking open and allowing radiation to escape. They must successively withstand a 30-foot drop onto a flat, unyielding surface; a drop of 40 inches onto a steel spike; and a fully engulfing fire burning at 1,475 degrees Fahrenheit. 
For proof of the canisters' performance, look at the safety record of the 2,400-plus shipments of used nuclear fuel that have taken place in the United States during the past three decades. Not one used fuel container has ever ruptured during those trips. Radioactive fuel has never been released, harmed the environment, or caused any injury or public safety threat. 
By shipping to a single storage spot, we are reducing the level of risk. A remote, desert location would provide an added margin of safety. Logically, used fuel can be managed more efficiently and effectively at an individual site than it can at multiple sites.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow at 9 a.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the Nuclear Policy Act. Under the order, following 3 minutes of debate prior to the rollcall vote we will proceed to a series of rollcall votes on or in relation to the pending amendments to that legislation. Senators can therefore expect approximately three rollcall votes beginning tomorrow morning shortly after 9 a.m. I believe there are 3 minutes between each vote also. 
It is our intention to introduce and possibly conduct a rollcall vote with respect to legislation regarding unauthorized access by the IRS to tax records. There has been a bipartisan effort to get this legislation developed. We hope to have that cleared and to get a recorded vote on it tomorrow. It is something I know the American people feel very strongly about. There has been a lot of attention given to the fact that IRS employees have been fired because of this unauthorized access to these IRS records. It also will give us an opportunity tomorrow to talk about other abuses at the IRS. 
So Senators can expect additional votes on Tuesday after the policy luncheons--at least one and hopefully two more votes tomorrow.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 12 noon to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. By consent, at 12 noon the Senate will resume consideration of S. 104, the Nuclear Policy Act. And by previous consent, all remaining amendments that are in order to the bill must be offered and debated today. As previously announced, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session. Any votes ordered on the amendments will be stacked, and the votes will occur at 9 a.m. on Tuesday. I emphasize that for all Senators' information. The votes will begin at 9 a.m., and there will be a minimum I guess of three votes--probably three votes at that hour. Therefore, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 104 at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, and Senators can expect to begin voting at that time. 
Senators can expect rollcall votes on Tuesday morning, and then following the disposition of this bill the Senate may turn to the Alexis Herman nomination to be the head of the Department of Labor, or legislation dealing with the chemical weapons ban. 
Now, as it stands at this time we probably will not vote on the Alexis Herman nomination until Wednesday. We hope to get an agreement, or if we do not get an agreement our intent is to proceed, if we can, to S. 495, the Kyl-Helms and others bill, on Thursday relating to the chemical weapons issue. This is the bill. This is not the convention. And I would expect that that 
would take up most of the time on Thursday. 
As always, we will notify Senators of the schedule and when anticipated votes will occur. 
Again I would like to thank Senators on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the issue for their cooperation on the Nuclear Policy Act. I think we are doing the right thing by getting this legislation completed without undue delay, and voting on it so that the House can act. And I understand they do plan to act on this legislation within the next 30 days. We hope to get it to the President and hope for his signature.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, finding a new species of plant in America brings mixed reactions. From scientists, it brings the excitement of biodiversity and more opportunities for scientific investigation. But for many Americans, an endangered plant listing often places strict controls on the use and resources of the land where the plant is found. When an endangered plant is found in a national forest, it can curtail the multiple use mission of the U.S. Forest Service. Its mere occurrence can stop the timber harvesting, which is so important to the rejuvenation of the entire forest habitat. And when trees are not cut, there are dramatic economic consequences for the community that lives near the forest and depends on it for jobs. 
You can be sure that enthusiasm was not over flowing when Mr. Steve Leonard, Camp Shelby's Heritage Inventory Botanist, announced that the Louisiana quillwort was found in the DeSoto ranger district in Perry County, MI on May 24, 1996. 
Mr. President, let me tell you about Perry County. Perry County has only three towns and roughly 11,000 citizens. Perry County contains 410,000 acres, 162,000 of which--over 39 percent--are national forest lands. The employment opportunities are limited primarily to the timber industry. The harvesting and marketing of forest products in the county has created over 1,800 jobs, of which 330 are involved in timber sales in the national forest. Currently, the unemployment rate is 7 percent. This year, Perry County's payment from the U.S. Forest Service for timber sales was cut by $1.5 million. This money would have been used by Perry County's schools to offset the loss of tax revenue received because of the large land ownership by the Federal Government. 
Now along comes the quillwort. This county is already absorbing the economic impacts of repeated and failed government attempts to establish habitats for the endangered red cockaded woodpeckers in the DeSoto National Forest. And let's not forget the restrictions for those gopher tortoise. 
The residents of Perry County love the environment and many make their living from the environment, but the ever growing restriction on land use challenges their commitment. 
The Louisiana quillwort is a very small grass-like plant with just a few strands--smaller than this ballpoint pen--whose scientific name is Isoetes Louisianensis. It was first discovered 5 years ago on private property in just two parishes of Louisiana. It was promptly listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but since then, there has been no monitoring of its population. To this day, there still remains huge scientific factual gaps on the known and potential threats to this plant. 
There is one thing I know for sure. There is a lot of this quillwort growing on the edges of stream beds in Mississippi's DeSoto National Forest. It may be scarce in Louisiana, but Mississippi clearly has more than our fair share. This is not unlike many other aspects of the ever-continuing rivalry with our neighboring State. I say this with great respect for my friend and colleague Senator John Breaux, but maybe the name of this species should be changed. 
Mr. President, today I am here to honor the dedicated efforts of the U.S. Forest Service employees who walked over 200 miles of stream beds this past winter in order to locate quillwort populations and to ensure there would be no disruptions of timber sales. This was no easy task. The heavy winter rains left boot-sucking mud everywhere.

But depending on when we get done, it may require some time and a recorded vote. I believe we can get it up tonight. If we run into a snag on this agreement, it would be our intent then to try to do it during the day Tuesday, probably. I would like to do it tonight. We are working on it. We have asked the administration for some information that is critical. I believe we will have a response in the next 4 hours.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, in light of the recent agreement and the request to bring the nuclear waste bill to a conclusion on Monday morning, I want to thank first of all, the Democratic leader for his cooperation in getting us to a point where we will get the final vote. The Senate, therefore, will not be in session on Friday this week. The Senate will convene on Monday, and following morning business the Senate will resume the pending nuclear waste bill under the previous order for debate of the remaining amendments. However, no votes will occur during Monday's session of the Senate. 
The Senate will convene on Tuesday, April 15, and begin a series of back-to-back votes beginning at 9 a.m. Following those votes, which would include final passage of the nuclear waste bill, the Senate will conduct morning business to discuss the significance of April 15, which is tax filing day. It is the hope of the leadership that the Senate could consider the nomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor on Wednesday. Therefore, a vote is expected on that nomination during the day, Wednesday, April 16, session of the Senate. 
Also, we are very close, I believe, to getting an agreement with regard to the nomination of Pete Peterson to be Ambassador to Vietnam. One of the Senators has had some concerns in reviewing a fax matter at this point, and immediately after we hear from Senator Byrd, we hope to be ready to proceed on that under a time limit agreement. If we could get 30 minutes equally divided on each side unless yielded back, and perhaps a voice vote, but we will determine that during the next very few minutes. 
Again, Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their cooperation. I know it has been a very hard issue for the Senators from Nevada, and they have been very tenacious, but they have been reasonable in their approach. I appreciate that and I want to thank Senator Murkowski and others for their good work and thank you, Senator Daschle for your cooperation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with regard to Calendar No. 34, the nomination of Pete Peterson to be the Ambassador to Vietnam, I would like to specifically thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his cooperation and for the very serious questions that he has raised, which needed to have proper attention. I believe that we have gotten some progress made in that regard. We do have now a letter that has been sent to me, in response to our questions, from the National Security Council, Mr. Berger. 
Senator Smith has had a chance to review that. I personally have had very serious concerns all along about the normalization of relations with Vietnam. I think the certification has been flawed in the way it has been handled, and I think that those points needed to be made. But I also felt that Pete Peterson was an excellent choice for this assignment. And I appreciate the cooperation of Senator Smith in the way he handled this matter, and Senator McCain for his cooperation. I know he has a personal involvement and interest in the nominee. I just wanted to thank them both for their efforts. 
I would like to yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New Hampshire.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am sorry I am a minute late. I will not make a practice of that, Mr. President. We like to start right on time. 
Today the Senate will resume consideration of Senator Thurmond's amendment to the substitute amendment to S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. We are still hopeful that an agreement can be reached to enable us to complete action on this important bill in a reasonable timeframe. At any rate, we will continue to go forward on it, and we are making progress. I appreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides of this issue for their cooperation. 
A cloture motion was filed last night on the committee substitute; however, if an agreement is reached, that cloture vote will, hopefully, not be necessary, and I assume it will not be. If an agreement is not reached, the cloture vote will occur on tomorrow morning. 
As a reminder, under rule XXII, Senators have until 1 p.m. today in order to file first-degree amendments to the substitute amendment. Rollcall votes are possible throughout today's session of the Senate, and into the evening if necessary. I do expect some votes today, but the most important thing is to find a way to come to an amicable agreement on how to conclude this legislation. That is our focus, and, again, we are making progress in that effort. As always, Senators will be notified as to when any votes are scheduled.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as a result of the recent recess of the U.S. Senate, I did not get the opportunity to come to the Senate floor and recognize Sunday, April 6, 1997, as Tartan Day. This day is set aside to honor the millions of Scottish-Americans who have made outstanding contributions to our great country. 
This date has a special significance for all those of Scottish heritage. It is the 677th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath--the Scottish Declaration of Independence which was signed on April 6, 1320. 
This declaration of independence includes these inspirational lines: `* * * we fight not for glory, nor riches, nor honors, but for freedom alone, which no good man gives up, except with his life.' 
 Mr. President, Scottish-Americans have left their mark as pioneers and innovators in the fields of science, technology, medicine, government, politics, economics, architecture, literature, the media, and the visual and performing arts. Their contributions to the history and development of the United States are invaluable. 
Some of these great past and present Scottish-Americans include: Neil Armstrong, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, Julia Child, Hugh Downs, Thomas Alva Edison, Malcom S. Forbes, Katherine Hepburn, Billy Graham, Brit Hume, Washington Irving, Robert MacNeil, William Holmes McGuffey, Andrew Mellon, Samuel B. Morse, Grandma Moses, James Naismith, Edgar Allen Poe, Willard Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Gilbert Stuart, Elizabeth Taylor, and James McNeil Whistler just to mention a few.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this Congress has an opportunity to build on the progress made in the 104th Congress to assist the Food and Drug Administration in meeting the needs of millions of Americans who are awaiting the advancement of new medicines. 
Over the years, I have known individuals who have needed medicines and medical procedures that they could not get because the FDA had not done whatever was necessary, in their opinion, to approve these procedures. I have known of examples of people going to Mexico for medicine or to England for a medical procedure because they could not get that procedure in America. Yet 20 years later, one of the procedures that Americans had to go to England to get now is so common it is almost done as an outpatient procedure. That is ridiculous, and it is time we make some progress in advancing these new medicines in a more expeditious manner. 
We also have an urgent need to act to extend the highly successful law that will expire later this year unless it is renewed in a timely fashion. 
Let me review last year's legislation that would enable the FDA to meet the demands of the rapidly approaching 21st century. 
This past year, we had wide bipartisan agreement on essential elements of FDA reform in both Houses of Congress. In the Senate, the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved S. 1477, the Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act, by a 12-to-4 bipartisan margin. In the House, H.R. 3199, the Drug and Biological Products Reform Act was cosponsored by more than 200 Members of both parties. 
It was unfortunate, Mr. President, that despite the best efforts of then Labor and Human Resources Chair Nancy Kassebaum, as well as my colleagues Senator Dan Coats and Senator Chris Dodd, we ran out of time last year before S. 1477 could be brought to the Senate floor. I wanted to do it. They wanted to do it. A bipartisan group wanted to do it. In the face of a threatened filibuster by some Senators, we were not able to bring it to the floor with that threat hanging over the legislation. 
However, as the urgency of this legislation becomes more and more apparent, I am confident that the Labor and Human Resources Committee under the able leadership of the distinguished Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], will undertake this worthy effort without delay. 
Congress must also consider another important law this year, the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act which is scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997. 
The user fee law was the result of a historic agreement between Congress, the Food and Drug Administration, and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Industry agreed to pay $347 million in user fees during the 1993-97 period, which enabled the FDA to speed up the approval process by employing an additional 600 reviewers. Unless this vital law is renewed, the advances made by the FDA will be interrupted and the progress will be damaged. 
As majority leader, I plan to do everything I can to ensure that PDUFA, the legislation I just referred to, is reauthorized for another 5 years, thus ensuring that our sickest patients will have fast access to life-saving products.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be back on this spring day and to hear the Chaplain's prayer and to see the distinguished Senator from South Carolina here ready for business. I know we are going to have a productive season as we go into April and May. 
This afternoon there will be a period for morning business until the hour of 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 104, the Nuclear Policy Act. 
As I announced prior to the recess, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. Under the order, a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 104 will occur on Tuesday. 
I had planned to ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to invoke cloture occur at 5:15 on Tuesday, with the time between 2:15 and 5:15 to be equally divided between the proponents and opponents. I understand that the Democratic leader may have a little bit of a conflict, where we may try to move that toward 5:30, although we have other Senators who have conflicts at that time. So we will get a definite unanimous consent request here shortly. The vote will be sometime between 5 and 5:30, I presume, and I believe we can get that worked out just as long as we have a minute more to confer with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
All Members should be aware that the next rollcall vote will occur, then, on tomorrow at either 5:15 or 5:30, something like that. It is my hope the Senate will invoke cloture tomorrow, which will enable us to begin consideration of this very important legislation, which is the nuclear waste legislation. I think there is no more important environmental issue pending in America than to make the decision of what we are going to do with nuclear waste that is sitting in sites across this country, from South Carolina to Vermont, from the banks of the Mississippi to the shores of the Pacific. We cannot ignore this. We cannot wait another 15 years for studies to be completed. We have spent billions of dollars. We have been working on this for years. It is time for action. 
The Senate voted by a wide margin last year to make a decision on this issue, to pass this nuclear waste repository legislation. The House did not act. I have been assured this year the House will act, this matter will go to the President, and we hope that it will go to him in such a way that he recognizes that Senators and Congressmen and the American people all across this country feel that this decision must be made. 
So, I am looking forward to our beginning the debate. If cloture is invoked, Senators can anticipate debate and rollcall votes during every day of the session this week so we may complete action on S. 104 as soon as possible. I remind my colleagues that this will be a busy period legislatively prior to the Memorial Day recess. 
I think all Senators should be aware that bills are beginning to be reported out of committees. We have had 3 months to have the hearings to mark up legislation. We have a number of bills that have now been reported, including the TEAM Act and the Comptime and Flextime Act, which can be very helpful to families and working mothers who need time to be with 
their children. That legislation is ready. Sometime late this month or early next month we will, as I have said, have a vote on the partial-birth abortion ban legislation. So we are beginning now to enter a period where we will have a lot of legislation. 
Obviously, we need to have a vote on the budget. I had hoped we could come to a grand agreement that would be in the best interests of all Americans with the President. So far, that has been fruitless. I have committed basically 3 months, along with the chairman of the Budget Committee, the time and the meetings, to try to see that something happened in this budget area, but we have not been successful with that. I had asked the President not to oppose the balanced budget constitutional amendment. He did. In fact, he and the leadership on the other side of the aisle twisted arms, and two Senators switched their positions, and we lost that by one vote. But every Republican and 11 Democrats had the courage of their convictions and voted for it. 
Then I asked the President and his people to send us a real budget, a budget that showed courage, showed leadership, that would have some restraints in the entitlements area, that would preserve and protect Medicare, that would give some tax relief to working Americans, that would have some restraint and controls on the rate of increase on nondefense discretionary spending and would do what needs to be done in the defense area; show some leadership. They did not. They sent a political document. 
Since that time, we have tried to encourage some movement with the suggestion that we have a commission to decide on the accurate, honest number of the Consumer Price Index. The President indicated preliminarily he thought maybe we could get a commission on that. To his credit, the Democratic leader indicated he thought that was a move in the right direction. But then they backed away from it. Other suggestions have been made by the Republican leadership, but there has been no reciprocation, no action. 
The President needs to lead in this area. If he does not, we are moving on. We are moving on. We have to do this budget. We will do a budget in the Senate in the next few days. I think we have to get action in the Budget Committee here in the next couple of weeks. We have to get some decision made so the Appropriations Committee can begin to move forward. We hope it will be a bipartisan agreement. We would like to have the President's help, but the time is over for waiting. We must move forward. I will be talking later today to the chairman of the Budget Committee and interested Republicans and Democrats to see how we can proceed. We still would like to have the President's involvement and help, but he does not seem, so far, to be ready to do that. 
Our staffs were meeting during the past 2 weeks. They were supposed to be making progress. From what I understand, they had a grand time meeting and saying how wonderful it was they were meeting--but that is about all. It was my understanding, from what the President said, that he would meet with the leadership of Congress when we returned from the Easter recess period to discuss, hopefully, the final decisions on the budget--this week. But I understand now, that meeting is not going to occur this week. It is next week. Yet, as we wait for leadership from the White House, we see some people saying, why doesn't the Congress act? We have been trying to confirm the President's Cabinet. We have been trying to work with the administration and to work off of his budget agreement so we could move to a final agreement. It has taken time. But that time is gone. We have to go ahead and do our job. And it will be our intent to do so. 
So, I thank all Senators in advance for their cooperation as we begin what I hope will be a productive couple of months. We have a lot of good legislation we can take up, we will take up, and I think when we go out for the Memorial Day period we will have several bills that we can point to with pride that we have voted on.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a series of unanimous consent requests that may be necessary unless we get some agreement very quickly now from the minority leader. 
I just came from a committee hearing, where I just finished testifying so I could come to the floor at 10:30 and call up the agreement entered into last night after monumental efforts by Senators on both sides of the aisle, working with the administration, with regard to the Mexico certification issue regarding drugs and how the drug war is being fought with the United States Government being involved and, of course, with the Mexican Government being involved, but in ways that are very troublesome. 
I had hoped we could get started at 10:30, get a time agreement that was reasonable, maybe 4 hours equally divided, so we could have a full discussion about what is happening with regard to law enforcement efforts and dealing with drugs coming from Mexico into the United States, so we could talk about the President's difficult decision to go forward with certification, but also to make sure that the American people understand that the Congress is not satisfied with the status quo. More must be done. 
We have a right--in fact, we have an obligation--to get more from our Government's efforts in fighting the drug war and dealing with the flood of drugs that are killing America's children. They are flooding into this country from Mexico. We have a right to expect hardened drug criminals to be extradited into this country. Some of them have, some of them have not. We have a right to expect that our law enforcement people dealing with the drug barons, the drug lords, are able to defend themselves. We have a right to expect some thresholds to be met with regard to what Mexico must do and, frankly, what we must do in our Government. This is a very important issue, one that we cannot leave today or tomorrow without taking action on. 
I want to say how much I appreciate the great effort by the Senators here on the floor now--Senator Hutchison from Texas, Senator Coverdell from Georgia, Senator Feinstein from California, and other Senators that have worked to try to do the responsible thing. I want to point out that these Senators, along with others, for a total of 40, wrote a letter to the President of the United States saying, `Mr. President, don't certify Mexico as doing what needs to be done in this drug battle that we are engaged in.' The President did that. 
Now, the House took an action that will allow them to put down some markers and, after 90 days, look and see if progress is being made and then, perhaps, act further. I believe that is the gist of their action. That resolution is pending here at the desk. 
But, again, in a full, good-faith effort, the Senators have worked with the administration, which included a whole variety of people. I was stunned by all the people that got involved. The Secretary of State was involved; the head of our drug effort, General McCaffrey; the head of NSC, Sandy Berger; the Secretary of Treasury was there. It was a long list of people, and a lot of work was done. I think these Senators here gave a great deal. They wanted to say that these are some things that must be done and be certified by the President; when they are, we should have the right to have another vote on whether or not there should be decertification with waivers, or certification, or whatever. They agreed to not insist on that. But what they did do was reach an agreement that requires a report from the President, by September 1, on what is being done by our Government and by Mexico to do a better job. 
Now, I finally decided last night that the administration 
really didn't want any action by the Senate. They want us to just leave and not do anything. We can't do that. The Senate should take action on something this important. So we will act on this. We will vote. We will do it today, or we will do it tonight or tomorrow; it's OK with me. We are going to vote on this issue before we leave here. 
There is a process where the Democratic leader cannot stop that--it is a privileged resolution, with 10 hours of debate and then a vote. I don't want to do it that way. I want us to come to an agreement. The resolution that I thought we were going to call up at 10:30 requires specific reporting on steps taken by Mexico and the United States to combat illegal narcotics trafficking. It makes clear the Senate view that Mexico has not done enough--and they have not. We have seen that many times. We have seen it with the devastating story recently about the top drug enforcer in Mexico who, as a matter of fact, had to be removed from office because he was, in fact, being involved in what he is supposed to be trying to control. That is as gently as I can possibly put it. I fear there are going to be more devastating reports like that. 
The revision allowing for a vote, as I indicated, was dropped last night, after direct involvement by the Secretary of State, head of the NSC, as well as Senators here, and Senator McCain was involved in that. But it makes clear that the administration and the Government of Mexico should provide real demonstrable progress by September. If they don't, under this procedure, we would not have another vote, but we can have more votes. There will be authorization bills, and there will be appropriations bills, like the State, Justice, Commerce bill. If we don't get a response or action here, the Senate has a powerful weapon called the power of the purse. We can withhold funds. We can make our views known. 
Based on that, the fact that we can act in other ways with other vehicles, I thought this was a good agreement. I thought that the Senators here on the floor bent over backward to reach an agreement. Now, we have--get this picture--the Secretary of State, who is now in Helsinki, and the head of NSC, now in Helsinki, both directly involved, saying, yes, we can go with this. General McCaffrey, head of the drug administration, who was there and said, yes, we can go with this. Democrat and Republican Senators said yes. The majority leader says this is not perfect, but this is a responsible thing to do. And then what happens? There is a Democratic Caucus this morning. They meet and decide that because they can't dictate the schedule on another issue, because they can't make the majority leader give them a date certain on another unrelated issue, they want the United States Senate not to act on the drug problem in Mexico. 
Now, my friends, this is a big-time loser for those that are objecting to this procedure. It cannot stand. We have to find a way to move this forward. 
So all these administration officials are for it, Senate Republicans and Democrats are for it, and now they are saying, `If you don't give us a guarantee on another issue, that we will do it by a date certain, we are not going to let you bring this up.' Look, I know we like to play games just before we get to go home. But this is not the way to do serious business. We are not dealing with partisanship here. We are not dealing with some traditional authorization. We are dealing with drugs. How can we not express ourselves on this? 
We must, and we will. 
I am going to ask unanimous consent, when the minority leader arrives, to bring up Calendar No. 29, House Joint Resolution 58, regarding the certification of the President with respect to Mexico, that there be 4 hours total for debate on that resolution, to be equally divided in the usual form, and that one amendment--and only one amendment--be in order to be offered by Senators Coverdell, Feinstein, Hutchison, and others. 
I will ask that no other amendments or motions be in order, and following the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote. 
We can take it up, and we can have a calm, cool, nonpartisan debate on a very, very important issue. 
I have here the resolution that was the subject of the negotiations and the one that was agreed to last night at about 7:30 or 8 o'clock. I was around and in and out of those meetings. This was interesting, I thought, because I actually have the copy here, or a copy of what was agreed to. See that. These are circled paragraphs the administration had problems with, and the compromise language that was worked out. I don't like this compromise. But it was a responsible thing to do. The same thing on the next page. The work was so intense and so committed right up to the last minute. Here is a paragraph. It circles this, and it is out. 
I am going to ask for that. I hope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will agree to that. If that effort fails--and I am going to make this request not later than 11 o'clock--I hope to hear from the minority leader quickly so we can get started. 
If I don't get that consent, then I am going to ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 21 regarding the decertification--this is the decertification process, not certification; this is decertification--with additional waiver language, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and that there be a limited period of time--presumably maybe 4 hours--for debate. After that, of course, we go to a vote. 
If that is objected to, then I am going to go to the privileged resolution, which is not amendable, provides for 10 hours of debate, and a vote. I do not want to do this. It provides for 10 hours of debate in the law. This is a privileged resolution that sets out very tightly how we would vote on this privileged resolution issue. This is dangerous. It is not good for the administration. I don't think it is good for the country because the vote that is taken would be on decertifying Mexico as being seriously involved in this drug-fighting effort with us. 
It might pass. And if we are going to have games played here on other unrelated issues, it puts me under extraordinary pressure. 
I have indicated that I do not want to vote for decertification. But I might. 
Also, even if it does not pass, what if the vote is 60 to 40? What does it say about the administration's effort? What does it say about the President's effort? What does it say to Mexico that 40 United States Senators voted to decertify Mexico? Then that would have to go--unless the House just accepts that--to conference. And then here is what will be pending in conference: decertification, or 90 days of delay and a vote. Neither one of those should look very tempting to those that want to do the right thing. 
So I do not want to go on at length. I want us to get started. We need to get started. But I hope we can get an agreement to move forward on the agreement that was entered into last night. It is the right thing to do. It is the right thing for the Senate. It is the right thing for the administration. And, on a close call, I guess it is the right thing in our efforts to control drugs coming out of Mexico. 
But, Mr. President, I am in good spirits today. I understand we have to do this positioning around here. I understand you have to try to drag the majority leader into doing something he might not want to do, or cannot do. But I think this is the wrong place and the wrong time to be playing this game. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if the Senator from New Mexico will yield. First, I would like to just briefly clarify what we have in this consent request. It is to bring up this certification issue and to allow an amendment that would put in place the agreement that was entered into last night by a bipartisan group of Senators and the administration. 
So this just basically sets up a process to begin the debate and get a vote on the agreement with regard to certification, with the understanding it does set out some markers as to what we think should be done, and it does require the President to report by September 1 as to the progress that is being made there. But it does not have a subsequent date where a vote could occur. This is going to be the vote on certification, or decertification, depending on your point of view. So I want to clarify what I was asking for there. 
With regard to the inquiry of the Senator from New Mexico, first of all, let me assure him I understand there is concern about the April 29 date and the need for some action before that date by a number of Senators. 
There is disagreement on how essential it is we act before the 29th. As a matter of fact, whenever the United States should ratify such a treaty, certainly we would be sort of the big kid on the block and we would be involved in the process. But there are arguments on the other side of it, and I certainly understand that. 
I acknowledged to the Senator from Michigan, I believe it was yesterday or the day before, that I also understand that in order to get a treaty completed and the subsequent actions that go along with it, enacting or enabling legislation----

Mr. LOTT. Reform legislation--it takes some time after the actual vote. 
So it is my intent for this issue to come up when we come back after the Easter recess. 
There is a statute or bill that has been introduced that we hope to get up and get a vote on. Very serious. I think good efforts are underway to deal with the parallel issues of U.N. reform. The administration is working with a bipartisan group of House and Senate Members. I think everybody is beginning to understand, themselves, and we may be able to get some reforms and some process on how we deal with what is the number we may be indebted to the United Nations for and how that ever would be addressed. 
We are also working with the chairman of the committee, Senator Helms, and Senator Biden, the ranking member, on this reorganization of the State Department issue. The new Secretary of State has indicated some encouraging things there, and I believe there is going to be good faith by all to try to address this issue. 
There are some legitimate concerns about the treaty--the verification question, search and seizure questions, how it affects different things in America. On some of those, the administration this year came back and said, `You're right. We have some concerns about this issue.' 
So a number of them have been worked out. An equal number are within the range of being worked out. Again, Senator Biden has been working with Senator Helms to address some of those concerns. 
There are some we just will not be able to get worked out. I mean, we will have to have votes on amendments on the floor or there will probably be a substitute. But my intention is to continue to work with all involved, including the chairman and ranking member, to get this issue to the floor in April. That is why I had our list of items. It is not my intent to stonewall or delay this. 
I understand that every time we go out or every time a bill comes up, the Senator from New Mexico will be up here raising questions and maybe even objections. We have other things we need to do that are equally or more important. So it is not my intention at all to allow this thing to go on indefinitely. 
But you do understand, as the majority leader, you work with the chairman, you help the chairman, and the chairman helps you, and you work with the ranking member. This is a place of great comity, and we want to keep that. I am trying to honor that as a majority leader who is, you know, sort of learning as I go along, making a few mistakes here and there, but getting some things done on the way, too. So I think you know from what we have been able to do over the last 8 months, I work steadily at these things, and at some point we are going to get to vote on this. 
I do not mean to say in the great wild blue wonder. We are working very aggressively, and I believe we are going to get a process to get it dealt with in April.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the Democratic leader and the Senators on both sides for the work that has been done on this. I believe now we will have a good discussion about what is or is not going on with regard to the drug battle that we are fighting, with the American Government and the Mexican Government being involved. 
Madam President, I believe we are able now to get a time agreement, which I think would be very helpful to all Senators to know that we are going to proceed and there will be a time specified so we can have a vote by 4 o'clock, hopefully. I discussed this with the Democratic leader and other Senators. I believe we have a reasonable agreement here. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 29, House Joint Resolution 58, regarding the certification of the President with respect to Mexico and there be 4 hours 45 minutes total for debate on the resolution and an amendment, to be divided as follows: Senator Coverdell in control of 1 hour, Senator Feinstein in control of 1 hour, 1 hour under the control of the majority leader and 1 hour under the control of the Democratic leader, Senator Grassley in control of 30 minutes, and Senator Torricelli in control of 15 minutes. 
I further ask unanimous consent that there be one amendment in order to be offered by Senators Coverdell and Feinstein. I further ask unanimous consent that no other amendments or motions be in order, and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the amendment, to be followed by third reading and final passage of House Joint Resolution 58 without further action or debate.

Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Illinois will yield, I will be glad to respond to his comments. They have certainly been very good ones. 
We all understand and appreciate and agree with the remarks about the tremendous service and the quality of man that Pete Peterson is. I am satisfied that he would be a great representative for our country in any position, whether it be an easy one, great luxury, or a tough one, as this one will be when he is confirmed. 
The Senator is right that there are those of us in the Chamber and in America who doubt the wisdom of going forward with this normalization with Vietnam for a variety of reasons. Particularly, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, has raised a lot of questions and concerns over the years about POWs and missing in action, accounting for those POWs. He is very concerned about those servicemen that have not been identified, have not been accounted for. He has made that very clear. He has serious doubts that Vietnam is actually doing all that it can do or all it has said it would do in moving toward normalization and accounting for those POW/MIAs, and he has asked me as majority leader in a very good, strong letter, lengthy letter to give him an opportunity to ask some questions and get some answers. 
I try to honor that kind of request for any Senator on either side of the aisle whenever I can within reason. And I have also joined him through my staff that deals with the Intelligence Committee to work with the intelligence staff to try to get a report or reports in response to the questions that Senator Smith has asked. 
Those reports may not be sufficient or they may not be good, but Senator Smith has indicated he has no desire to hold this nomination up at length. In fact, I think he would agree with me and the Senator that this is an excellent choice for any position. 
So it is my intent, barring some unforeseen complication, that this nomination would be brought up on Tuesday or Wednesday the week we come back. I believe that would be the 8th or 9th. I do not think it would be appropriate to hold it up beyond that. And again, barring something that I cannot imagine right now--and, of course, assuming that over the next 2 1/2 weeks we will get these reports--we would call that nomination up. I think we would be able to do that, and I certainly want to. I do not see any reason why we would not be able to based on my conversations with Senator Smith. 
We appreciate the interest of the Senator in his former colleague from the House, and look forward to working with the Senator on this and other issues.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding staffer and dear friend of mine, Sam Adcock. 
For the past 7 years, Sam has served not only as my national security advisor, but as one of my most-trusted and able advisors. Sam is moving on to other challenges, but it is my privilege to commend him for the service he has provided me and the Senate as a whole. 
The youngest of four children born to Pat and Larry Adcock, Sam was born in Baton Rouge, LA, and although Sam was not a native Mississippian, he assured me he had relatives in the Magnolia State. 
I am not sure what effect being the youngest in such a large family had on Sam, but I think it must have played some part in cultivating his competitive nature. 
It is this, combined with a gut instinct for effective legislation, which has made Sam Adcock such an important part of my team. 
Sam joined my staff as a full-time employee in 1990, after serving for a year as a military liaison. He served as my legislative assistant while I was a member of the Armed Services Committee, and quickly sank his teeth into the complicated process of military appropriations. 
Mississippi's shipyards and military bases owe Sam Adcock a debt of gratitude for the countless hours he spent arguing on their behalf. 
During the 1991, 1993, and 1995 Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] procedures, due in large part to Sam's hard work, Mississippi was the only State that had no bases closed. 
Among the many areas where Sam's expertise was invaluable to me were the development of the LHA and LHD programs. Perhaps one of our greatest legislative triumphs was working in 1995 to help Ingalls Shipbuilding of Pascagoula, MS, win the $1.4 billion contract for LHD 7. 
Sam worked around the clock to help Ingalls win this contract so important to the men and women of Jackson County, MS, but that was not unusual for him. I know Mississippians would be proud to know how relentlessly Sam pursued what was in their State's best interests. 
The country, too, should be proud to have had such a champion of strong military ideals fighting to preserve our Nation's military prowess. I could always count on Sam to go into a meeting for me and come away with the best possible deal for Mississippi and our country as a whole. 
In addition to his service as my armed services advisor, Sam was promoted to the position of legislative director. He has always been a take-charge kind of guy, and he ensured that my office's legislative staff was prepared and proactive. As effective as Sam's leadership was, he was also one of the most well-liked members of my staff. 
While those who have worked against Sam know what a formidable opponent he is, those who have worked with him know what a pleasant and approachable man he can be. 
As Sam Adcock moves on to a new and exciting position as vice-president for government operations at Daimler Benz, I wish him, his wife Carol, and their young son Austin, the best of luck. 
Sam exemplifies all that is good in the congressional staffers who work so hard here on Capitol Hill. He is honest, industrious, intelligent, and talented. 
My office will be poorer for his departure, but the people of this country are richer from his time as a Senate staffer. For his loyal and dedicated service, I thank him. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express the gratitude of the Senate to Jim Grahne, the director of our Senate Recording and Photographic Studios. Jim is retiring this week after 27 years of dedicated service to the Senate. 
Jim Grahne has been one of our most talented technical and management professionals in the Office of the Sergeant at Arms. 
He is an engineer by training and profession and has used his skill, creativity and expertise to shepherd the Senate through nearly 30 years of broadcast and photographic technology. I am referring to the television, radio and photographic services on which we as members, and as an institution, so readily rely. 
It was Jim's leadership that made technically possible the broadcast of the proceedings of the Senate floor. 
While that accomplishment may be one of his professional highlights, he always sought ways to improve products and services to members. 
Some of the recent successes of Jim and his staff include the installation of a fiber optic network for the broadcast of committee hearings, CD-Rom and on-line photo data base services for members' offices. Jim and his staff have also pioneered the use of closed captioning text, audio and visual technologies. 
This year the studios released full text and audio search and retrieval of floor proceedings. Offices may now search for and download any speech or debate text and audio with 15 minutes of its being given. 
Our gratitude for Jim is not limited to his understanding and appreciation for technology. Because he came to the Senate from the commercial news and broadcast industry, he understands the importance of the press and of the role played by visual and sound images. 
Every day that the proceedings of the Senate are made available to the press here and around the world, it is an affirmation and practical example of democracy in action. That goal has been an important part of Jim's motivation. 
Mr. President, our Senate family wishes Jim and Linda, his wife of 34 years, and their children--Mark, Lena, and Karen--the very best and hope he gets some time to spend on that sailboat with his granddaughter, Megan. But, knowing Jim as we do, we can expect his sleeves will be rolled up and into another challenge in the very near future.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just in conclusion, I want to recognize the Senator from Arkansas, who is in the Chamber at this time. I thank him again for his courtesy in allowing me to do this and recognize that he is a member of the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources that reported this legislation. I think it is very important legislation. I understand that the Senators from Nevada will have to make their points in opposition to what it would do, but I do think it is just absolutely essential that this country face up to the need to deal with our nuclear waste. There is no easy way to do it. There is no perfect solution for all 100 Senators. But we passed it last time through the Senate and it died aborning in the House. I am told this time that we will, when we pass it, the House will also pass it, and this time we hope we can get it to the President. And we hope we can get it to the President in a way that he feels he can sign it. 
We must do this because it is an issue that will not go away. Nuclear waste is sitting in cooling pools and barrels all over this country from South Carolina to Vermont, from the banks of the Mississippi River to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. We must deal with this problem, and so that is why I take this procedure to make sure that we get it up for consideration and for debate when we return from the Easter recess. 
I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today after months of media exposes and the American people asking questions about exactly what is going on here, I think the question that we are trying to answer today is, `Why hasn't Attorney General Reno appointed an independent counsel to investigate these matters?' Members of both parties, Democrats as well as Republicans, have asked that question, and they can't get a satisfactory answer. They have called on the Attorney General under the law involving the independent counsel to appoint an independent counsel. Senator Moynihan, Senator Feingold, and I think others in both parties have said this is the way that we should proceed, and this independent counsel should be appointed. 
That is why we brought before the Senate Senate Joint Resesolution 22 to express the sense of this body `that the Attorney General should make application to the Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 Presidential election campaign.' 
I cannot understand how anyone who is familiar with the language of the independent counsel statute can disagree with this resolution. And I have gone back and read it and reread it. I have been around when this statute has been passed, and modified and passed again. Frankly, I have always had some reservations about it. But it is on the books, and it is clear when it should be activated. 
That statute sets two thresholds for the process of appointing an independent counsel. The first is whether there 
have been credible and serious allegations of illegal acts by high officials. And it defines who these high officials may be. 
That doesn't mean anyone has to be presumed guilty. As long as the allegations are credible and serious, the statute requires the Attorney General to take action. 
Clearly, that first threshold has been met by what we already know from news reports about illegal foreign donations and the use of White House facilities for campaign fundraising. 
I need not repeat all the instances others have cited during this debate. One expose has followed another. One admission has followed another. One explanation or excuse is followed by another. Without judging anyone involved, it is as clear as can be that the first threshold of the independent counsel statute has already been met. 
But if anyone disagrees with that assertion let them consider the second threshold of the law, the second set of circumstances that permits the Attorney General to take action. That second threshold is the existence of a perceived conflict of interest on the part of an Attorney General who is appointed by the President and confronted with possible illegal activities involving the White House. 
This provision was put in the independent counsel statute in 1978 in order to extricate Attorneys General from serious situations just like the one in which the Attorney General finds herself now. Confronted by myriad allegations of wrongdoing within the administration, of which she is a part, it is not her role to pass judgment on them, and it should not be. Under the law, it is her responsibility to trigger the court process by which an independent counsel takes over the role and does the job which the law deliberately takes out of her hands. 
Listen to the Attorney General herself on this point when she testified, just 4 years ago, on the reenactment of the independent counsel statute: 
It is absolutely essential for the public to have confidence in the system, and you cannot do that when there is a conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, in effect, the chief prosecutor. 
In other words, the Attorney General herself. 
Who did deny that this second threshold for applying the independent counsel has been more than met? Through no fault of her own, Attorney General Reno is caught in an excruciating conflict of interest. If she were to aggressively investigate charges of misconduct by senior administration officials, she could be accused of excess zeal to protect her own reputation for integrity. If, on the other hand, she does not uncover wrongdoing, she would be accused of letting the guilty escape because of political considerations. 
To shield the Attorney General--any Attorney General--from that predicament, and to protect the integrity of the entire Department of Justice, is the essential and primary purpose of the independent counsel statute. 
If that is all so obvious, why then, the question might be asked, is the Senate considering this resolution today? The answer is that we are compelled to take this step, formally expressing the sense of this institution, for two reasons. 
First--it is quite common, and, in fact, almost always when there are serious issues being debated that don't necessarily require a law to be passed--the Senate expresses its collective sense on the issue of national import. If we do not do that with regard to this matter, I think we will be slighting our duty. 
Second, this resolution is a result of our rising frustration with what seems to be determined inaction on the part of the Attorney General to appoint, or start the process to appoint, an independent counsel. Like the American people, we must wonder what it will take to jar the Department of Justice to activate the independent counsel law. After all, the Department is not dealing with one or two frivolous allegations. It is dealing with a steady drip, drip, drip of revelations over a period of several months that has now become a tainted stream of suspicion. 
There is only one way to clean it up, and that is through the appointment of an independent counsel. Let me remind my colleagues that the purpose of such an appointment is not just to prosecute the guilty but to clear the innocent. In neither case should that be seen as a partisan endeavor. 
Nonetheless, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle find fault with this resolution. They say it ought to apply to the Congress as well. But the independent counsel statute already does apply to Members of Congress. 
If the Attorney General has received credible and serious allegations of illegal activity by one or more Members of Congress, she is already fully empowered to ask the Federal court to name an independent counsel. And it has been done in the past. Believe me, it has been done. The conflict is not between the administration and the Congress. The Attorney General can take that action. The perceived conflict of interest is when you have the Attorney General of the same party of the people in control of the White House where allegations are being made. 
I respectfully suggest that the effort being made here to include the Congress in this resolution is, once again, just a distraction. That is as polite a term as I can find for something that is irrelevant to the Nation's concern about what we have seen happening. 
But what has been the modus operandi? Every time another new, serious allegation comes out, the alternative by the Democrats has been to attack the people who are going to be in critical positions. Senator Fred Thompson, who is chairman of Governmental Affairs, his motives were impugned when we were moving through with setting up the investigation for Governmental Affairs. Insinuations, well, this has 2,000 ramifications. And now today Dan Burton, the chairman of the committee in the House who has a job to do, yes, attack him. 
That has been the way it has been done for the last 4 years. Anytime you get accused by somebody or somebody has a job to do, go after them. That is what is at stake here--distraction, obfuscation, say, well, they do it, too. No. So much of what has happened here is not normal; it is not the way it has always been done. 
That campaign is the heart of matter. The campaign has been the focus and the forum on other issues whereas what we are trying to get at is a very serious matter here, illegal foreign contributions. I mean even the word espionage has been suggested in all this. We are talking about staggering sums of money that have been raised and in unusual ways. 
That campaign continues to generate media allegations about improper--we voted on that last week--as well as illegal conduct. 
If anyone is tempted to take the position of a pox on both houses, I have news for them. It is not true that everybody in politics per se behaves alike or ignores the law or pushes the limits of legality. There are clearly things in the law that may be debatable, but they are legal and they are appropriate. If we want to go back and have a debate--and we will have a debate this year on campaign finance reform, but before we start trying to reform the law, I think we need to look at how do we find out what happened. Who did what? What has gone on here? 
If anyone is tempted to take that position, I think they need to reconsider. We do not all do it, and I do not think that it is going to work to just try to shove it off by trying to drag the Congress into it. We are trying to get at what has happened. 
The independent counsel, by the way, is not necessarily going to be a slap at the President. In fact, that is the way to quiet this thing down, have the process go forward, have an appropriate investigation, find out what happened, who did what, by an independent counsel. 
As a matter of fact, I am going to presume that it may not reach to the President. I do not think all of these things involve the President. They may not come to that conclusion in the end. But this is the way to get at the bottom of what really has happened. So I urge my colleagues here today do not be distracted. We have a very clear resolution here that just says it is the sense of the Senate that the thresholds have been met to provide for an independent counsel and that we should do that, make it very clear what our position is and go on with the substantive business that we have to do around here. 
Some people say, how are you going to deal with the budget, less taxes, less spending, less Washington, more freedom if you are going to be fighting on these other things? As a matter of fact, maybe now we are in a position to move on. We have a committee that has been funded. They can do their investigation, their hearings. If we have an independent counsel appointed, which clearly I think the law has provided for, and the threshold has been met, then we can go on about our other business. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for Senate Joint Resolution 22, I believe it is, and then vote to table the other resolution that is pending, because it is no more than a distraction because the law already provides for that coverage. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief statement to explain my vote that I will cast later on today. I know we are having interesting discussion, and this is one that has been a long time coming, getting this judgeship to the floor of the Senate for a vote. 
Obviously, there has been support for this nominee by Senator Hatch and by Senator Specter and others. Senator Leahy has been pushing to get these judges voted on. This is the first one of the year. I presume this is a celebratory event.

Mr. LOTT. But now maybe I can comment just briefly on why it has taken so long. There were a lot of factors involved. I will vote not to confirm Merrick Garland to be a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals judge. I have no opposition to Mr. Garland himself. I think he is qualified. I think he has experience that would be helpful. And I think his disposition is acceptable, too. 
In fact, based on all the reports that I have heard about him, I think he more than likely would be a much more acceptable nominee to this court as compared to many of the other nominees we have considered or may be considering in the future. 
It is my belief that this court of appeals is more than adequately staffed based on the number of cases pending on the court's docket, the filings per judge at this court as it is currently staffed for the year ending September, 1996, with the trend of such filings over the last several years, and in comparison to other workloads of circuit courts of appeal around the country. It is very small. I think as compared to others certainly they have more judges than they need. 
I am looking at this chart over here. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is at the bottom end of the caseload, and yet you have other circuit courts across the country--my own circuit, the fifth, is about in the middle. The eleventh circuit obviously has a high caseload as compared to this particular court. 
So I really do not think this confirmation is needed. Even if it does get through, I want to say right now that regardless of the next nominee, unless this caseload is dramatically turned around, I hope it would never even be considered regardless of how qualified the nominee may be, he or she, in a Democratic administration. 
I recognize that some circuits do have tremendous caseloads, but this is certainly not the case in this circuit, and therefore I will vote against the nomination based on that. In fact, I just do not think an additional judge is needed in this district court of appeals. 
I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of the filings per judge in 1996 and the total appeals docket in 1995 per judge that shows as compared to other circuits this judge is not needed.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am delighted to take part in introducing the first bipartisan family tax relief bill of the 105th Congress--the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act. 
Today, the Government can confiscate up to 55 percent of an estate in tax when a person dies. This tax is a grotesque relic of an earlier era when some people believed it was the Government's job to determine who should be allowed to keep what they earn. They believed it was the Federal Government's job to confiscate the hard-earned dollars of working Americans when they died. 
The estate tax is a monster that must be exterminated. If it were up to me, we would simply repeal the estate tax in its entirety. Unfortunately, our budget process does not allow us to completely repeal this tax all at once. We must do it in stages. 
Therefore, the bill we are introducing today will increase the amount of every estate that will be exempt from estate tax. When fully phased in, up to $1 million will be automatically excluded from every estate before imposition of the estate tax. 
The bill also creates a new category of excludable assets for family-owned businesses that are passed on to succeeding generations. No longer will small business owners be forced to sell part or all of their business assets merely to feed the voracious tax appetite of the Federal Government. Our bill allows an exclusion of $1.5 million of the assets of a family-owned business from the estate tax, and 50 percent of the next $8.5 million. For many small businesses this will make the difference between staying viable and closing their doors. It will preserve jobs, give many communities around the country stability and certainty, and encourage entrepreneurship. It is the right thing to do for our farmers, for our ranchers, for every American who owns a small business that he or she wishes to keep in the family. 
These businesses are, after all, the engines of prosperity in communities across America, and we must help them to remain so. 
This bill is the first step. The tax on death should be zero, and that is what we will continue to work for. 
I want to thank Senator Grassley for his leadership on this bill, and Senator Baucus and Senator Breaux as well for joining in this bipartisan effort to reduce the crushing tax load on all Americans.

Mr. LOTT. As the Senator from Massachusetts recalls, this issue was reported by the committee in the last Congress, and I made a commitment in connection with other bills that we would bring it to a vote. In fact, I believe it was scheduled for a vote, or we were moving toward a vote. But for a variety of reasons--and there is no use rehashing the history of it--the Secretary of State called and asked that we pull it back and not force it to a vote last year. We honored that request. 
This year, there have been a number of discussions. The President did call and ask that we meet with his Director of the NSC, Sandy Berger, to talk about how we could bring it to a conclusion. At his request, I did meet with him, and Senator Helms met with him. Other Senators that are interested have been talking with the President's representative. And we continue to work on that. I think some good progress has been made as a result of those meetings. Some conditionalities have been more or less agreed to. Of course, until it is final, it is never final. Some have been agreed to, some are still being discussed, and some probably will have to have amendments or votes on them when it comes to the floor of the Senate. 
The Senator is absolutely right. We have made a decision to destroy our chemical weapons. That is a fact. We are doing that. He is also right that a number of countries have ratified that treaty; some very important ones have not. Not only the United States has not, but neither has Russia. The indications are that they may or may not. Of course, neither has Iran. 
There are some real questions that are legitimate questions on both sides of this issue. One of them is, of course, the verification question. How do you verify what some of the rogue countries may or may not be doing? How do you deal with some of the questions about things like the poison gas that we have seen in Japan? How do you deal with an issue like tear gas being used in our country? Also, there are very important questions like constitutional questions with regard to search and seizure in our country. The administration representative indicated, yes, that is an area where there is concern, and we need to work on that. Work has been done, and we continue to work on it. 
This week, I met with the chairman of the committee and talked through where we are and how we can continue to proceed on this matter. I have talked to other Senators on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the issue, as to how we can move it forward. I talked to Mr. Berger again and I urged him to do a couple things. One of those things is to seriously address, with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, some very important parallel issues. Although they are not necessarily tied together on a parallel basis, they are related and of great concern. The State Department reauthorization. In the previous year, I think the State Department kind of indicated, no, we don't want to do anything. That is not a tenable position. I don't think that is the administration's position. 
I think the new Secretary of State has indicated that she understands and wants to do some of these things and has been talking to the chairman about that. I am hoping that additional conversations are occurring on that today between the Secretary of State and the chairman of the committee. In another parallel issue, for this very afternoon I have been able to call together a meeting of the key players, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, on the U.N. reform matters. We met once with the Secretary of State. We are meeting today with the new U.N. Ambassador, and we are getting a process to see how we deal with the United Nations reforms and, of course, the money that the U.N. would like to have from the United States. 
So, again, that is a parallel. A lot of people are involved. None of these issues are easily resolved. All of them are very important--what we do about chemical weapons, about the State Department reauthorization, U.N. reform, and with regard to what happens processwise. I know what you are asking there. 
It is our hope that we will be able to get this issue up in April. It probably would involve some hearings in the committee. But action early on, when we come back, to get it to the floor in a way where everybody will be comfortable with what amendments will be offered. There is a possibility that a statute may be offered, or a regular bill, to be considered in conjunction with the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I have given a long answer, but I am saying this to make it clear to you that I am working aggressively to address the concerns on all sides of this issue. I will continue to do so. I know you are concerned, and other concerns are concerned. You may feel that you have to do more. But I have learned over the years that as long as everybody is talking, you are probably making progress, and we are talking. I have also learned that when you have a chairman that has legitimate concerns, you have to give that chairman time to deal with those concerns. 
We are trying to do that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, one thing is that I do not want to mislead the Senator with regard to the probability of hearings. I assume that was a possibility. I do not think it needs long hearings. But I think a day or two--and I have not asked for those or called for them, and the chairman may or may not feel that they are needed. 
So I may have mislead when I was indicating that we are talking about another whole round of hearings. I agree with the Senator. I do not think a lot of hearings need to be done again. 
But I wanted to clarify that point. I didn't mean to infer that we were going through a long list or that a decision has been made. But it is something that I have asked: Is there going to be a need for a hearing on a day or so before action could occur? It could. 
There is another point. I want to commend the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who has spent a lot of time and has worked on these issues when he was in the House Armed Services Committee and continues to be very interested in them. He is very knowledgeable when you talk about article X, article XI, and all of the ramifications. He knows what is in this convention. He has very legitimate concerns, some of which have been addressed in a way that I think the Senator from Massachusetts would agree with and find acceptable. Others are still open, and there is time to work on those. 
I want to recognize the work of Senator Kyl. He may want to respond or comment on some of what has been said here today. 
I just wanted to make that one clarification.

Mr. LOTT. As the distinguished Senator knows, if he will yield, Mr. President, the scheduling does to a large degree rest in the hands of the majority leader. But it is usually done in coordination with both sides of the aisle. Like on the Mexico certification, or decertification, issue, quite often it can be objected to. I mean that, if I today proceeded to call up the House-passed version with the idea of offering a bipartisan substitute to it, we would have to get agreement to do that. The other option is to just call up decertification, which we could do, and start the 10-hour process running. 
The point, though, is that you have to work with a lot of different parties. And I intend to do that. I think the decision will come up in April, and we will work in the direction to say that we can get it up by a date certain. Once again, I think it might raise expectations beyond what is achievable. 
But we are continuing to work on that, and we are going to do it this very day.

We will have to--at some point we could have a full debate about what that drop-dead date is. That is the point here. It is not a specific date in terms of having to take up the treaty to get the work done, but it is a fact if you assume some action must be taken, you have to back off that in order to get the work done.

It is also possible that on Wednesday the Senate will consider a resolution relating to disapproving the decertification, or certification, of Mexico. Additional votes are, therefore, possible following the stacked votes that occur at 11:30. We are also still working to get a time agreement with regard to the nomination of Merrick Garland for the District Court of Appeals. That could come on Wednesday or Thursday of this week. And, of course, the Senate may also consider any other legislative or executive items that can be cleared.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today at 1 p.m., following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 22, the call for an independent counsel resolution. 
For the information of all Members, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate, and the next rollcall vote will occur at approximately 2:45 on Tuesday. That rollcall vote will be on passage of Senate Joint Resolution 18, the Hollings resolution on a constitutional amendment for campaign expenditures. 
Regarding the independent counsel resolution, under the previous order, amendments may be offered to that resolution beginning today at 3 p.m. 
It is my hope that the Democratic leader and I will be able to reach an agreement as to when the Senate will complete action on Senate Joint Resolution 22--hopefully by tomorrow evening. All Members will be notified when an agreement is reached. 
It is possible that the Senate will consider a resolution also regarding Mexico and their certification in the antidrug effort. But I presume that would come not later than Wednesday. Maybe we could even go to it on Tuesday. But right now it looks like it will be Wednesday before we get to that. 
The Senate may also begin consideration this week of the nuclear waste legislation. 
I will remind all Senators that this is the last week prior to the Easter recess period. I hope the Members will plan accordingly, as we wish to finish our business on time. It will take some cooperation this week to get through the matters we have pending. 
We are also seeing if we can get a time agreement on one of the judicial appointments. We have not been able to do that yet. We will continue to work on it.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I today join the majority of members of the Judiciary Committee in calling on the Attorney General to begin the process for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible violations of Federal law in connection with fundraising and other activities during the 1996 Presidential election campaign. 
The independent counsel statute--28 United States Code section 591 and following--provides that the Attorney General shall conduct a preliminary investigation, which is defined as `such matters as the Attorney General considers appropriate in order to make a determination, whether further investigation is warranted, with respect to each potential violation, or allegation of a violation, of criminal law, when she receives information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate' whether certain persons violated any Federal criminal law other than a class B or C misdemeanor. These persons include: 
First, President and Vice President; 
Second, persons working in the Executive Office of the President paid at or above level II; 
Third, chairman and treasurer of the President's reelection committee, or any officer of the reelection committee exercising authority at the national level during the President's term. 
The test of the sufficiency of the information received is whether or not it is specific and credible. The Attorney General has 30 days to review this information to make the determination. This is a very low threshold test. The only way she can avoid a preliminary investigation is to determine that the information is not credible or not specific. If she finds she is unable to determine within 30 days if the information is credible and specific, she still has to begin the investigation. 
Further, if the Attorney General determines that an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice of any other person may result in a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest, the Attorney General may conduct a preliminary investigation. Although this would seem to be more discretionary than the shall language otherwise in the statute, Attorney General Reno understands the importance and the necessity of the independence of the investigation into such matters. As she testified before the Judiciary Committee in 1993 when that committee was considering reenactment of the independent counsel statute:  
There is an inherent conflict of interest whenever senior Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the Department of Justice and its appointed head, the Attorney General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President. Recognition of this conflict does not belittle or demean the impressive professionalism of the Department's career prosecutors, nor does it question the integrity of the Attorney General and his or her political appointees. Instead, it recognizes the importance of public confidence in our system of justice, and the destructive effect in a free democracy of public cynicism.' 
She further testified: 
It is absolutely essential for the public to have confidence in the system and you cannot do that when there is conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, in effect, the chief prosecutor . . . The Independent Counsel Act was designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in the consideration of allegations of misconduct by high-level Executive Branch officials and to prevent . . . the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even the most subtle influences that may appear in an investigation of highly-placed Executive officials. 
Despite the fact that high-level executive department officials and other covered persons have been implicated in possible violations of Federal law, the Attorney General seems to have ignored her own warnings about the appearance of a conflict of interest or impropriety and has chosen not to initiate the procedure leading to the appointment on her own. In light of this decision, it is left to the Senate, through the action of its Judiciary Committee, to pursue the appointment of an independent counsel. 
This action has been initiated by written request to the Attorney General. Under the independent counsel statute, the Attorney General has 30 days after receipt of the request to report if the preliminary investigation has begun--and the date it began--or that it will not begin. She must give her reasons for either beginning or choosing not to begin the investigation. 
I am confident that Attorney General Reno will heed her own words in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee and seek to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in this investigation. 
There is sufficient specific and credible evidence now to initiate the process now. To do otherwise or to delay action will call the Attorney General's decisionmaking process into question. That is specifically the effect that must be avoided here. There should be no appearance of impropriety in the decision of whether to appoint an independent counsel and I am confident, upon consideration, the Attorney General will see the wisdom in expediting the decision to ask for the appointment of such independent counsel. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 18, the Hollings resolution on a constitutional amendment on campaign expenditures. It is my hope the minority leader and I can reach an agreement as to when the Senate will complete action on this resolution. I have discussed this with the Senator from South Carolina. I still think maybe there is a possibility we can get an agreement and get a vote on it tonight, but if not tonight, we will converse with the sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 18 and see when we could get a vote on it. If not tonight, it could actually not occur until Tuesday morning. But we will discuss that and make an announcement later on today. 
Rollcall votes are possible throughout today's session. It is also possible that prior to completing our business this week, the Senate may be asked to consider the independent counsel resolution. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet today. Hopefully, they can take some action in this area, hopefully in a bipartisan way. That would be helpful. 
In addition, it is my hope we will be able to reach a time 
agreement for consideration of the nomination of Merrick Garland to be the U.S. circuit judge for the District Circuit. I am thinking about the probability of that occurring on Tuesday, maybe Tuesday morning, with a time agreement. We had been thinking perhaps 3 hours equally divided would be sufficient, but we will need to get a final arrangement on that. We do have some Senators who want to speak on this nomination. 
I think a lot of the concern on this one is not so much with the nominee as with the circuit. The D.C. circuit actually has one of the lowest caseloads in the country, and it is declining. It has declined pretty perceptively, even in the last year or so. There is a question about how much need there is for additional judges on that circuit. So there will be some discussion about that. 
Again, I hope that rollcall vote can occur on Tuesday morning. We maybe could have done it today or Friday, but because of the constitutional amendment and other issues pending, we felt Tuesday morning would give us time to work it out. I expect the Senate to convene on Monday, but this time I do not anticipate any rollcall votes during Monday's session. I would like to note that, again, for the Democratic leader, that while we may be in session, I don't foresee at this time the need to have a recorded vote during the day on Monday. I do know there are Senators who have commitments who necessarily have to be away from the city, but we will want to have votes as soon as we can on Tuesday. 
Mr. President, I have no further comments at this time. I will be glad to yield the floor to the Democratic leader.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this agreement would allow the Senate to begin debate on this very important joint resolution regarding the appointment of an independent counsel at 10 a.m., on Friday. It is my understanding that the Democratic leader is discussing what amendments would be offered to this resolution. Perhaps he is meeting on that at this time. When the Senate resumes its consideration, then, on Monday, we would begin to take up the amendments, if any. In addition, it is my hope that, prior to the close of business on Friday, I will be able to inform the Senate as to not only the number of amendments we can expect, again, if any, on the other side of the aisle, but also I will be able to set a consent time for final passage, potentially as early as Wednesday of next week. It is our hope that we can get a vote on the independent counsel issue by Wednesday of next week. Then we will be able, on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to deal with the Mexico certification issue, assuming we have that worked out in a way we would want to bring it to the floor at that time. 
Again, I am still discussing that with the Democratic leader, and there is communication from both sides of the aisle with the administration. So we don't know yet if that will happen, or what form it will be in. I look forward to further discussions with the minority leader on this issue. I hope it will not be necessary to file a cloture motion on this resolution in order to bring it to conclusion by mid-week. I haven't had an indication that that will be the case. I am thankful for the cooperation we have had in getting this agreement worked out. 
In light of this agreement, and the agreement reached earlier calling for a vote on the constitutional amendment for campaign expenditures at 2:45 Tuesday, I am pleased to announce there will be no votes during Friday's or Monday's session of the Senate. The next vote will occur 2:45 Tuesday, March 18.

It is my hope that we will continue debate on the resolution on Monday. And amendments then would be in order during Monday's session.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be further heard on this, and I will be relatively brief, I must say, I think this objection is, at the very least, very unfortunate. It has been my understanding that we are operating in good faith with respect to the confirmation of Mr. PenAE6a and the markup of the nuclear waste bill. 
I have made a special effort to get this nomination up this morning. We had a lot of communication with the ranking member, the chairman and other Members interested in the confirmation of the Secretary of Energy designee, with the understanding, clearly, that the nuclear waste bill could go forward. 
Since this objection has now been raised, the Energy Committee cannot complete its business with respect to reporting out the nuclear waste bill today. It is my understanding they will reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 in order to take action on this very important nuclear waste bill. 
I say again, I have been trying to be cooperative in trying to move nominations. I worked with those who had objections in 
the committee. I helped work out a process where the chairman could schedule this nominee for a vote, and then I worked with the other objections we had on this side of the aisle from the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams. He was able to make his remarks this morning. 
We agreed that we would have a vote at 12:30, or quarter to 1, I believe, now, all this under the assumption that we were working in good faith. Now we have an objection to the committee meeting to report out a bill which has overwhelming support of the full Senate and will have overwhelming support in the committee. 
This is not a good sign, but it is just one of many bad signs that we are seeing, in my view, from the standpoint of being able to work together for the good of the country. So it is a very unfortunate decision, and it will not be without consequences. I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will be working with the Democratic leadership to get a time agreement on the vote that will occur at 2:15, I presume, on this amendment. But we want to work through that and make sure we understand exactly what the voting sequence will be. 
The purpose of this amendment is to reconfirm and beef up our commitment to the public and to our colleagues here in the Senate to insure that funds are authorized by this section for the sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal activities in connection with the 1996 Federal election campaigns. It is also to make sure that the Rules Committee has the full authority, with the support of the Senate, to get into matters relating to Federal elections generally, including the President, the Vice President and Members of Congress, and corrupt practices. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee, under this amendment, shall refer to the Committee on Rules and Administration any evidence of activities in connection with the 1996 Federal election campaigns which activities are not illegal but which require investigation of a committee of the Senate revealed pursuant to the investigation authorized under subsection (b). 
The Rules Committee is going to be an active committee. The Rules Committee will look into any allegations of problems with existing campaign laws or campaign finance laws. They will have hearings, and they have the jurisdiction and the authority to move legislatively. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee has a budget of $4.53 million for its investigation, and it has very broad authority to conduct hearings on the 1996 Federal election campaigns. But it is the Rules Committee that has the jurisdiction to act legislatively on campaign reform. 
So I emphasize, again, as I did earlier, it is our intent for the Rules Committee to act in this area. We have provided additional funding and, once again, rather than getting into a great big argument about scope, it is clear what should happen here. 
First of all, there are lots of allegations of illegal activities, foreign contributions that may have come into campaigns--Presidential or congressional--the indications that maybe even a foreign government may have had an organized plan to be involved in campaigns. We know if these activities occurred, they would be illegal, but we don't know what happened. We need a process to look into these things. We need a focused investigation into these allegations. 
Yet, there are those who say we need to broaden the scope widely, narrow the money, and limit the time. It is a prescription for not getting the job done. This investigation, with the additional authority that is being provided of $4.53 million, is for illegal activities, and they are rampant in this city. As I said earlier, the city seems to be burning while we are fiddling around with the process. 
The Rules Committee has jurisdiction that it will take advantage of. The Governmental Affairs Committee is getting additional authority to look into illegal activities. Ethics has its responsibilities. There is attempt to cover up or avoid our responsibilities. We are going to do that. 
I think this amendment that we have offered here further clarifies our intent to look into illegal activities by the special committee investigation and then to have the Rules Committee look into corrupt practices that may be involved that may not be necessarily illegal but may need to be looked at for the possibility of changing the current practices.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at the beginning, I thank all concerned for the efforts that have been put into coming to this agreement, especially the Democratic leader. There has been a lot of discussion involving Senators on both sides of the aisle and all the different committees involved. I think this is the right thing to do and we can move on, then, with the proper investigation, in a bipartisan way.

Mr. LOTT. Let me add, Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment this afternoon to the resolution calling for the appointment of an independent counsel. However, I had agreed earlier with the Democratic leader to withhold that until at least this Thursday to allow the Judiciary Committee to discuss the issue of appointment of independent counsel and see if there is some way that a bipartisan agreement could be reached there, also. 
In view of that commitment that I believe we basically entered into a week ago, I felt it was important that I keep that commitment, and therefore we will withhold action until we see what comes out of the Judiciary Committee on the independent counsel issue.

Mr. LOTT. Today, the Senate will resume consideration of Senator Glenn's amendment to Senate Resolution 39, the Governmental Affairs funding resolution reported by the Rules Committee. I hope the Senate will continue and hopefully complete debate on the Glenn amendment so that we may vote sometime this afternoon on or in relation to the amendment. Of course, I want to notify the Senate that we, as always is the case, reserve our right to offer second-degree amendments to amendments that may be offered. I understand that additional amendments may be offered to Senate Resolution 39, and I presume that there will be a substitute that will be included among those to replace the resolution that is before us. 
I am sure we will have full debate on all the amendments that may be offered as well as a possible substitute and the underlying funding resolution. Therefore, Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout the day. 
I hope we will be able to conclude action on this measure today or early tomorrow. I talked with the Democratic leader last night. He indicated that he hoped that would be possible. And when we do finish this, then there are some nominations we hope to take up and get a vote on, including the nomination of Federico PenAE6a to be Secretary of Energy. We would do that hopefully in the morning or tomorrow afternoon. 
After that, after consultation with the Democratic leadership, we would expect to go to the Hollings constitutional amendment concerning free speech. So that could take the balance of the week, maybe even going over into Friday with some debate, with votes likely occurring--and, again, we will have to work this out--maybe on final passage late Monday 
afternoon. But we will notify Senators as we go along exactly when the votes will occur on Wednesday and Thursday and if any on Friday. 
We will recess between the hours of 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly policy conference and the caucus to meet. I also remind our colleagues that this week we may have to go late into the night one night, which will probably be Thursday night, but we will work with the leadership again and notify the Members exactly what they can expect in that regard. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I thank our colleagues for the debate yesterday. I thought it went well. I want to commend and congratulate the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee. I think he is being very positive in his remarks. He is trying to get this to a conclusion, and I think we need to do that. I thank the ranking member from Ohio for the way he has handled himself. 
There are big problems in this city; it is sort of like the city is burning, and we do not want to appear to be fiddling any longer with getting a resolution that would allow this committee to go forward and do its work with a reasonable amount of money and a reasonable amount of time and with the emphasis on illegal activities as it might apply to the Presidential candidates or Members of Congress. 
I want to emphasize again that anything that might come out with regard to Senators doing something inappropriate or unethical, that, as has always been the case, would go to the Ethics Committee under the resolution that we are considering. 
Also, I want to assure my colleagues that it is my intent that we look into the question of campaign reform. The Rules Committee has the authority, has the jurisdiction and under this resolution has additional money, $450,000 additional funds, to look into how the campaigns were conducted last year, how legal activities were handled and whether or not changes need to be made. 
It is my intent in due time after proper hearings and after a lot of consultation that we will take up this issue. The inference continues to be that our goal is just to block it. We do not intend to set a magic date, whether that date is May 1, April 15, or Labor Day, for that matter. That may be a good time to set up a magic date. But we should not get locked in on dates certain. Let us just do our job. 
That is what I hope the Senate will do on this resolution. That is what we intend to do in the committee of the distinguished chairman from Virginia, to have hearings on campaign finance reform and look at all these questions in regard to how soft money is used, independent expenditures, and how labor union dues are used without labor union members' permission. 
What is the situation with illegal foreign contributions? Do we, in fact, have in this case, as has been suggested, the possibility of even espionage? This is serious. What we need is for a committee of credibility and jurisdiction to get started with their work, and I hope that we can do that with as little rancor today as possible. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan legislation that will update, revise and improve upon the Shipping Act of 1984. This legislation is a continuation and extension of work initiated in the last Congress by Representative Bud Shuster, my friend in the House of Representatives and Senator Larry Pressler, then chairman of the Senate's Commerce Committee. 
Under the leadership of Senator Pressler, the proposal from the House of Representatives was examined through an initial hearing, and it was modified to address the concerns expressed by many in the industry. Only after a critical review of the key issues and concerns was a revised bipartisan amendment to the Senate bill introduced. Unfortunately, time ran out in the 104th Congress and the Senate Commerce Committee could not hold another hearing on the proposal. Still, changes continued to be incorporated into a single new version of the amendment, and in the last week of the 104th Congress the amendment was placed in the Congressional Record. 
My legislative plan was simple and direct--introduce a bill and then hold a hearing so that public input would have a genuine opportunity to affect the legislative process. This remains my plan, and that is why I used my public ending point in the 104th Congress as my new beginning point in the 105th Congress. 
As the process began again in this Congress, we again sought input from the maritime world as we prepared this important legislation for reintroduction. In the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives was the first to act. In the 105th Congress, the Senate will be the first to act. 
Mr. President, this explanation of the legislative journey was necessary so that my colleagues will have an appreciation of the outreach that was pursued by the Senate in its drafting process regarding this shipping reform. 
Let me say that I grew up in an active port community. In fact, I still live in that port city of Pascagoula. There is nothing in our legislative proposal that is intended to harm the onshore maritime community. Believe me, I know first hand the challenges faced by ports because I have lived with them. I still remember the committee hearing on the shipping act last year where I had to give lessons in how to pronounce `Pascagoula.' On that day, I wanted to make sure people who develop and comment on maritime policy know and remember Pascagoula. 
I would like to add one more comment about the development of this legislation before I say a few words on what the bill will accomplish. The U.S. Coast Guard detailed an officer to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to assist the committee's members and staff on both sides of the isle on issues affecting the Coast Guard and the maritime world. Last year and part of this year we have had the able assistance of Lt. Comdr. Jim Sartucci. He was instrumental in collecting comments and in drafting provisions of this proposal in both the 104th and now the 105th Congress. 
I have received many unsolicited compliments about Jim's willingness to listen and merge in a meaningful way, individual proposals from all segments of the maritime world. Everyone that I have encountered has told me that Jim was both professional and fair as we worked through the process. 
Mr. President, Lieutenant Commander Sartucci has clearly reflected great credit upon the Coast Guard, the Commerce Committee, and on this legislative proposal. 
Mr. President, we now know how we got to this point in the legislative process. There are still two topics that need to be addressed today. 
First, why do we need shipping reform and second, how does the bill accomplish that reform? 
In just a few minutes, let me explain why we need shipping reform. 
Last year's successful maritime reform effort addressed the critical requirement of guaranteeing an American fleet and American crews in the context of necessary sealift capabilities for deploying and supporting our military forces overseas. Our efforts in shipping reform this year focus on the needs of America's ports and Americans who work dockside. Both big and little ports. were considered as part of the process. Ports with and without cranes. 
Mr. President, last year, I spoke at length with the Honorable Helen Delich Bentley, the former Maryland Congresswoman. She has been an effective defender of ports and maritime labor for years. She is a true champion, and I value her advice. I made a commitment to Helen then and I believe it has been honored this year with the legislative language. The legislation will provide adequate protection for small ports and small shippers. Also, the legislation will ensure that the collective power of some industry elements will not be allowed to abuse other segments of the industry. 
Having said this, it is time to deregulate the ocean shipping industry and to sunset the FMC. The path was started by President Reagan back in 1984. Senator Slade Gorton, my colleague and friend, was the principal author of this initial step and with his help we took the next step when we put together the proposal in the 104th Congress. I am very pleased that the author of the original act that we are amending has agreed to cosponsor this bill. 
Mr. President, this year Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will be leading the charge to complete this second part of maritime reform. She has a clear understanding of what is necessary to strike the delicate balance to achieve deregulation without permitting marketplace abuses. She will do an excellent job in chairing the hearing and finalizing the legislative language for the full Senate. 
Let me be very clear; this proposal only deals with liner shipping, basically container ship, legislation--not bulk cargo shipping, which represents the other half of U.S. ocean borne trade. Do not let the opponents of reform confuse the issue. The already deregulated world of bulk cargo shipping is not being disturbed. 
I must also be candid. The challenge is to balance ocean common carrier antitrust issues and large ocean carrier and shipper desires for more private business relationships with meaningful oversight to produce a fair, yet competitive playing field. I believe this legislation strikes the right balance. 
I must also say that at the Commerce Committee hearing back in 1995, both Senator Breaux and I challenged the witnesses to work with us to resolve the concerns we were hearing from our constituents. The witnesses and many others did just that. They showed up and participated in extensive, good faith negotiations. 
This bill is not antilabor. The shoreside and seafaring unions continue to work with us in a constructive manner. Their goal and ours is to put in place an ocean shipping framework that eliminates inefficient and burdensome regulations, promotes U.S. trade, and in so doing, preserves and creates American jobs. 
This bill is not about dealing with just a couple of players in the maritime community. Many members of the industry were consulted. We provided a genuine opportunity to participate in dialog as we drafted this bill. Introduction should not stop the consensus seeking process. And, I hope the discussion will continue with Senator Hutchison as she prepares for the upcoming hearing and even following the hearing. 
Let me now explain how this legislation accomplishes our goals to reform this critical industry. 
This legislation will permit confidential contracting between individual ocean common carriers and shippers, but will continue current public filing requirements for joint ocean common carrier contracts. This action balances the desire to make the U.S. ocean liner contracting process consistent with international ocean shipping practices and other U.S. transportation modes with the unique application of ocean common carrier antitrust immunity in the 
ocean liner shipping industry. At recent meetings held by the Maritime Administration on the diversion of cargo from U.S. ports, the current U.S. ocean liner shipping system was identified as a contributor to this problem. This legislation will help eliminate this U.S. port handicap. 
This legislation will retain common carrier tariff enforcement, but would eliminate the requirement to file tariffs with the Government. Common carriers would be able to take advantage of available modern technology by using a World Wide Web home page to satisfy the tariff publication requirement. This just makes common sense and reduces the cost of doing business while maintaining protections for small shippers. 
This legislation will streamline and reform the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC], and establish a responsible time line to downsize the FMC in accordance with its new mission and merge it with the Surface Transportation Board. America will then have a single, centralized, independent, Federal agency where the distinct regulatory systems for each mode of transportation are monitored and enforced in a coherent manner. 
This legislation does much to ensure that America's presence in the ocean shipping business is not subjected to unfair foreign rules or practices. The recent FMC enforcement actions taken against unfair port practices in Japan is an illustration of an essential FMC mission that is not performed by other Federal agencies. This mission will continue, and I will support it wholeheartedly. 
Let me be clear. This bill will significantly change the regulations governing ocean transportation in the foreign commerce of the United States while providing Government efficiencies and genuine reforms to protect American interests. The changes will strengthen ocean common carriers' ability to competitively price their services, in turn, making American shippers more competitive. 
Mr. President, the world's transportation community is now, and has been for some time, a seamless intermodal world. With this bill our Federal Government will finally be able to think and act in an intermodal manner. The American people get less Federal micro-management of our ocean shipping industry while receiving the protection of a government agency focused on preserving fair competition. An economically efficient, market oriented shipping industry provides America an advantage in the global marketplace. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their attention, and I hope they will give serious consideration to becoming a cosponsor to this necessary bipartisan legislative reform. Remember this is not just a port State matter; it is also an exporting State concern.

Mr. LOTT. Today, under a previous order, a number of Senators are scheduled to speak in morning business. At 3 p.m., following the allotted morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of Senate Resolution 39, the Governmental Affairs Committee funding resolution, which was reported out of the Rules Committee last Thursday. 
As I announced on Thursday, there will be no rollcall votes today during our session, and any votes ordered today will occur on Tuesday, either early in the morning or, more than likely, after the party conference and caucus lunches. I will be continuing discussions with the Democratic leader in the hope of reaching an agreement on the resolution which would allow us to complete action early this week. 
In addition, it is possible the Senate will consider the PenAE6a nomination this week. I will notify Senators as to when that nomination is scheduled and when a vote will occur. But I presume that vote would probably not occur before late Wednesday, or Thursday more than likely. 
Also, there is a likelihood this week that the Senate will consider the Hollings resolution relating to a constitutional amendment regarding campaign reform. 
I thank all Senators for their attention. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will be in a period of morning business to allow a number of Senators to introduce legislation and make statements. I understand the Rules Committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon to begin the markup of the Governmental Affairs Committee funding resolution. It is my hope that there will be an agreement reached on this for the consideration of the funding resolution. If an agreement is reached, the Senate may debate the resolution on Friday and on Monday, and, hopefully, complete action on the resolution early next week. It clearly, though, is our intent to take up the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee next week, hopefully earlier in the week, but at some point we clearly will want to bring it to a conclusion. We have had a lot of discussion, a lot of efforts to find a reasonable arrangement for the committee to go forward. I think we are close to accomplishing that. 
Also, I might say that there had been some thought that we would begin a discussion today, debate, if you will, on legislation involving the independent counsel, and we have some legislation pending in that regard. But in my discussions with the Democratic leader yesterday, he indicated that he thought perhaps we could come to some bipartisan arrangement to deal with independent counsel in the Judiciary Committee. I had hoped the Judiciary Committee could act on that today. I understand that perhaps there was an objection lodged to going forward today, and therefore it may be a week before the Judiciary Committee can act on that. 
But the Judiciary Committee, as I understand the independent counsel law, can act in a couple of ways. One, the full committee can act in a bipartisan way to begin a process of looking at whether or not an independent counsel is called for. Or a vote of the majority on the committee could also begin this process. We would like it to be bipartisan, and we will work to try to see if that can be accomplished. Since there was an indication that perhaps we could do that, I thought that the good-faith thing to do would be to make that effort in the Judiciary Committee before we begin debate on forcing that action here in the full Senate. 
Mr. President, there are a number of military nominations that the Armed Services Committee reported on Tuesday of this week. I am hopeful the Senate will be able to confirm all or at least most of those during today's session. 
Also, the Energy Committee has reported out the PenAE6a nomination this morning, and it is possible that the Senate could take action on the nomination sometime next week. I will be working with interested Senators to see what problems might exist, to see what time they need to address their concerns. It looks like we will not be able to get a vote on the PenAE6a nomination today, but I intend to call it up next week, at the very latest the middle of the week. 
As is also usually the case, I will notify our colleagues of the voting schedule as early as possible. I know they will be interested whether or not there will be votes this afternoon or tomorrow. We will get that information to all Senators as soon as we can work through some other scheduling issues with the minority. 
I thank all Members for their cooperation and their attention. I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume of my 30 minutes, but I do want to reserve the closing 5 minutes for the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. So after 25 minutes, if I am still going, I hope the Chair will give me that notification. 
I should like to begin, Madam President, by expressing my appreciation to all the Members of the Senate. We have been debating this issue now for a month or more. It has been a good debate. Every Senator has had an opportunity to express himself or herself, and I think the debate for the most part has been good--troublesome to me sometimes and discouraging in some of the things I have heard said, but still the Senate has worked its will in terms of having the time that we needed to debate this very important issue and to offer amendments. 
I thank particularly the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch of Utah, for the great work he has done, for the long hours, in fact--yes, hours--he has spent in this Chamber speaking in response to comments from other Senators, commenting on the amendments that have been offered. He has done an outstanding job. If for no other reason, I hope we would pass this amendment because of the great work and the commitment he has to this effort and to this constitutional amendment. I thank him for his great work. 
Also, Senator Craig of Idaho, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, Senator Bryan of Nevada, a Democrat who has been involved, and 10 other Democrats who have been committed to this constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, who have had the courage of their convictions to stand up and support this constitutional amendment and make speeches in behalf of it. 
Senator Coverdell has done an outstanding job in working with the people from all over this country, through the land, who are interested in supporting this amendment. Senator Snowe has done a great job in helping make sure that we had Senators who were aware of the time who would come to the floor and make their statements. Many others have done a great job. I wish to recognize the work they have done because a lot of time, a lot of thought, a lot of great speeches have been made as we have come to the conclusion of this debate on the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. 
Thomas Jefferson has been mentioned a lot here in the debate. As a matter of fact, as I just came from the majority leader's office, I was thinking about the fact that it was in that very room--yes, that very room--that the House of Representatives met in 1801 and took 36 ballots--36 ballots, would you believe it--to elect Thomas Jefferson of the United States over Aaron Burr. How close they came to making a mistake. 
I think that this, too, is of such historic significance. We should not make a mistake here today and not pass this amendment. We should vote for it. And the impact would be monumental--perhaps not as monumental as electing Thomas Jefferson, but certainly would have impact on the future of all Americans for years and years to come. It is historic. 
I am very proud that we have kept our word to the American people that we would fight for this amendment, that we would bring it to a conclusion, and that we would try to get it added to the Constitution so that we would have the guarantee, the additional leverage, the backbone that is needed to have in fact a balanced budget. So we have kept that commitment, and all Americans will have a brighter, more prosperous future when we pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. 
I noted the comments earlier today that 55 people wrote the Constitution. Well, 55 Republican Senators, every Republican Senator, will vote for this amendment today, and a minimum of 11 Democrats. It is bipartisan. We do know that this needs to be done. We need to get that additional vote that would give us the 67, and I think maybe that is still possible before all is said and done on this constitutional amendment. 
Just yesterday, we had additional proof of the need for this constitutional amendment. Six Presidents, over 1,400 Members of Congress, and approaching 1,000 Senators over the years have made an effort to get a balanced budget agreement, but through 28 years and all these Congressmen and Senators--and I want to make sure I have the exact number on the Senators. I think that number is high. We have had well over 1,500 Congressmen and Senators who said we should have a balanced budget, but we have not had one. We have not achieved one in 28 years--good 
intentions by men and women, but it has not happened. It looks like we will not have it for at least a couple of more years, at the most not until the year 2002. And, yet, in the President's budget that was sent to us, we find deficits do not go down, they go up by over $25 billion in the next fiscal year. 
We find that, instead of having tax relief for working Americans, you have a net tax increase in the President's budget. And, worst of all, 98 percent of his so-called budget savings, or spending restraints, would come in the last 2 years, after the year 2000, after the turn of the century, after this President is gone--proof positive, once again, that there is not yet a sufficient commitment by the President to get a balanced budget agreement. Without this constitutional amendment, I still have my doubts as to when it will happen. 
Now, the Senator from North Dakota commented earlier about how he had voted for a budget that reduced the deficit. Look, if everybody will agree just to raise taxes and keep raising taxes, I guess you could reduce the deficit. Of course, at some point there is a point of no return. When I hear from my own son, who calls me and says, `Dad, look, I am working hard, I have 55 people working for me, but 50 percent of everything I make is going to taxes, why is that? What are you going to do about it?' You know, that has an impact on me. The solution to balancing the budget is not to raise more taxes, as happened in 1993; it is to control spending for the interests of our children and for all Americans. 
Social Security--when all else fails, bring up Social Security. I have heard it for years. I have been worried about it over the years, and I have cast some votes that made it clear that I do not want Social Security to be threatened or abused in any way. This amendment will not do that. In fact, the only thing that we could do that would threaten Social Security is that we not get a balanced budget. That is how we would get in trouble with Social Security. 
By the way, if it is so critical, if it is, in fact, something that should not be included in the budget, why does the President, year after year, including this year, include Social Security in his budget? This is absolutely a diversion, and it is unfair to the seniors in this country that we try to scare them by indicating in any way that this would affect Social Security. The reverse is true. I will take my stand and stake my defense of Social Security against anybody's record in this body. 
Americans support this constitutional amendment. That is why you hear all these diversions. That is why you hear, `Well, but for this,' `Yes, but,' `Maybe, but I cannot do it unless you do that.' The American people are overwhelmingly for this. 
Senator Cochran, my colleague from Mississippi, and I are for it and our constituents are for it; in my State, over 80 percent. So it is relatively easy for us. But we are also for it because we believe increasing debt is the wrong thing to do. 
Let me just read some of the excuses we have heard over the years. The truth of the matter is there are a few Democrats who do not want a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. They just do not want it. But they have said: `Well, I would be for it except we want a Republican Congress to show their plan first,' or, `We want to wait until after Republicans have passed a budget plan,' or, `Only if you exempt Social Security,' or, `Yes, you must exempt emergency spending, you must exempt veterans, you must exempt housing.' How about an amendment by Senator Wellstone to exempt all education, health, and welfare; exempt all college aid and training? They would exempt all law enforcement, exempt the Tennessee Valley Authority, and highways, bridges, dams, roads, buildings, ice skating warming huts, and pork. They would exempt 77 percent of the nondefense, noninterest budget, if you went through that. And the list goes on, one excuse after another. 
Anybody who is looking for an excuse not to be for a balanced budget, looking for an excuse not to be for a balanced budget 
amendment, they can find it, they can find something to hide behind. But the American people, I believe, see through that. They have watched for years. They know that it has not been happening. They are worried about the interest on the national debt. They are worried about the future of the economy in our country. They know this should be done. 
I do think that a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget is an amendment that is worthy of going into the Constitution. Surely, Thomas Jefferson objected, back in the beginning of our great country, and would object now, to the debt we are building up--trillions of dollars. If we do not get a balanced budget--in fact, even if we do get a balanced budget agreement--the debt will probably still go up by close to $1 trillion. When will it end? 
It brings to my mind the statement we have heard before, `If not now, when? If not us, who? 
If we are not prepared to step up and pass this constitutional amendment now, we are admitting, based on what we have seen from the President's budget proposal this year, it is not going to happen any time soon. The deficits annually will begin to build up and to build up again, and so will the debt. 
We are stealing from the future of our children. They are the ones who are going to pay the price for this, and I feel very strongly that, if we put this in the Constitution with the protections that are there so that if we do have economic problems or if we have a national emergency, there is a way to get out. There is the three-fifths vote--60 votes. We get 60 votes around here quite often. 
We want to make it tough. If you make it so easy that you can just have a vote and it will all just be wiped aside, you know Congress will do that. Congress has proven time and time again they will do that. 
In the past, we have tried to pass statutes that would guarantee that we get a balanced budget, and it has not happened, because what has happened? We come along and we say we are going to exempt all these various and sundry things. Or, if it really gets tough, like we did with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we just move the date. We just pass another statute. As long as it is just a bill, as long as there is a way to avoid the tough decision, I fear the Congress will take advantage of that. 
We have proven here in this body, in the past 6 months, we can work together. We can be bipartisan. We can be civil to each other. And, when we work in a bipartisan way, when we put our minds to it, we can produce results. 
Last year, there we were passing these issues, many of them that had been in the making for years, like telecommunications and welfare reform, health insurance reform. We did not pass them by narrow margins. We passed them by wide margins. Once we made up our mind we would, we did it in a bipartisan way. That is one of the lessons I learned. I am glad this is bipartisan. But I note also we must get one more of the 34 Democrats in order to pass this constitutional amendment. 
A second lesson I have learned recently is good intentions just have not worked. It is not enough. You need this additional leverage. 
So, I urge my colleagues here today, be proud of what we have done. Make sure we are going to live up to the commitments that we have made to the American people. Join the American people. I want us all to have the courage of our convictions and be prepared to vote yes or vote no, if that is what we think is right. But I do think we also should take some lessons from our constituents. They have it figured out. They support a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget overwhelmingly. Why can we not get it through this institution? 
I believe the House will take this issue up in the next month or so, and I believe they will pass it. Some people have their 
doubts about that, but I still have confidence they will. And when they do, we will take another look at considering this issue if, in fact, it does not pass this afternoon. But this is an issue that will not go away. 
In fact, if you look at the Constitution, the last amendment that was added to the Constitution was actually pending for, I think, 200 years; the 27th amendment to the Constitution. It was language for years and years. Finally the State of Michigan ratified it and it became the 27th amendment. I hope we do not have to wait that long for this amendment, but we are going to pass this amendment and, if we do or we do not, I am going to work with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. We are going to try to find a way to get a balanced budget agreement. But I believe that this additional requirement in the Constitution will guarantee that we will do that job. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. Under a previous order, from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the time will be equally divided between the two managers for closing remarks on Senate Joint Resolution 1. The Senate will recess from the hours of 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy conferences, and at 2:15, then, the manager of the Democratic side will control 1 hour of debate with Senator Byrd being recognized for 20 minutes, the following hour will be under the control of Senator Hatch, with the next half-hour being under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee. Debate will conclude, then, with 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader. At 5:15, a vote will occur on passage of Senate Joint Resolution 1. I remind all Senators again of this 5:15 vote and ask all Senators to be in their seats for this important rollcall vote. It has been traditional, when we have major votes on a constitutional question, that Senators come and take their seats and then stand in place and cast their votes. 
I thank our colleagues for their attention in this matter, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call on the American people to use this weekend and Monday to express their views to the Members of the U.S. Senate on whether or not we should have a balanced budget. The American people can influence the vote that we will take next Tuesday at 5:15 p.m. The American people overwhelmingly support a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget because they know, they understand, without this guarantee, without this leverage, it will not happen. So the decision we make next Tuesday is in the hands of the American people. They need to let their Senators know how they feel. If their Senators have said they will be for it, commend them for it. If they have said they are going to vote against it, ask them why. Ask them what is the alternative. Ask them, where is the historical proof that a balanced budget will occur without the constitutional amendment. 
If a Senator has switched his vote from a year ago or 2 years ago, or if a Senator has switched his vote from what he said he would do in last year's elections, ask them why. How can you do that? How can you, in 6 months, change your mind on so fundamental an issue? 
Mr. President, this is a question of honesty. It is a question of truth in Government. We wonder why people are cynical, why they wonder about us, why they question us. This is exhibit A. When you give your word to your constituency in your State during the election campaign that you are going to vote for a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget and then 6 months later you say, `Gee whiz, I have learned something new, it is hard to take.' These are not new members to government and politics. These are people with experience at the State level, at the Federal level, in the House of Representatives. What is new? 
No, this is a question of basic honesty. But the American people can make that difference. If they will get on the phone, if they will call, if they will write, if they will express themselves, they can make sure that this amendment passes next Tuesday. 
The press, the Washington press, is saying it is over, they will not get but 66 votes. The fat lady has not sung. This `ain't' over. It is not over until we take the vote. I would hate to be a Senator who votes next Tuesday against this constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, especially if I had said earlier that I was going to do something else. 
I am still working on a couple of angles, too. I have been working with the rules of the Congress for 24 years, and I tell my colleagues you are never going to be absolutely sure what I am going to do. If I can find a way to do what I think is right for the American people, I will do it, and I will be innovative. I have a couple of ideas. Believe me, there are a couple of Senators in this Chamber who are sweating right now. I bet they will not be doing any press conferences this weekend. No. That is an age-old strategy when you are in Congress. If you do not want to talk about something you are fixing to do that your constituents do not agree with, you hide. Press availability is not possible. We need to do this. 
Now, the argument is made by the President, `Oh, we should just go ahead and balance the budget.' I agree. We should have done it last year. The Congress passed a balanced budget. The President vetoed it, just 1 year ago. Why did we not do it the year before, the year before, or the year before? Why haven't we done it for 28 years? Who among us believes we will do it in 2 more years or 4 more years? 
I am an optimist. I believe in the positive attitude of men like Ronald Reagan--there is a pony in there somewhere. We will find a way to do this job. But I have not seen any evidence of it yet. I have done my dead-level best to calm down the rhetoric and try to be positive and hold out hope and hold out an olive branch to Members of the Congress on both sides of the aisle and between the two Chambers and with the President. I have said we should work together for the American people. We should get this job done, balance the budget. 
Mr. President, you have just been reelected. We have a majority in the Congress. The American people want us to do some things for our children and for the future of our country. I have said we can do that. We should do that. The President suggested early on in one of our discussions that we should set up a commission for a particular matter--which I will not talk about now--and I said, `You know, Mr. President, you just got reelected, we just got reelected. That is what we are for. We should do the job.' 
We don't need a commission. Why do we always have to have this deal where we punt it off to commissions where we can see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. They did it, not us. So let's see what we can do, and then maybe we will talk about a commission. 
I said, `Mr. President, please, please, show leadership and show some courage in your budget. Show me that we can do it.' And then he sent us his budget. We didn't trash it, cuss it, and throw it out into the street and say it's dead on arrival. We weren't, obviously, happy with it. I took over a day before I had much of anything to say. I actually read it and looked at the numbers, and I called him and I said, `Mr. President, this is not what I hoped for. It is political cover.' I understand. We have made it clear that we weren't going to go through the exercise we went through last year. He was afraid, maybe, to take political risks in sending up a budget that really would get us where we needed to go. He felt like, well, we will negotiate a real result. But you can't have shell games and remove home health care from one part of Medicare over to the other, and say, gee, I just magically saved $50 billion. You can't have triggers and lookbacks and optimistic assumptions and shove all the tough decisions off on the next President. Two-thirds of what would be saved would occur after the year 2000. No, it wasn't adequate, and I expressed my concern about it. But I continue to say that, well, okay, I understand how that can happen. 
I am prepared to do my dead-level best to work with the Congress and with the American people and the President to get a balanced budget agreement this year. But I am not going to be a part of a fraud and hold hands with the President, or anybody else, and say, this is it, we got it done, unless it is real. So I think it puts additional pressure on us to have the constitutional amendment. I have been here all these years, in the House and in the Senate, and we have tried. Good men and women have said, yes, we can do this. Jimmy Carter said it; he meant to do it. Ronald Reagan said it; he intended to do it. Congress has said we are going to do it. We had the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act to force us to do it with a sequestration, but it was a statute. It was only a statute. Guess what happened. One by one, we removed all the hurdles, all the requirements that would have actually gotten us to a balanced budget. 
First, we said, oh, gee, we can't have it apply to this or to that program. I remember the negotiations. I was there. We said maybe not this program, maybe not that program. We started off and we only exempted seven programs. Then, one day, it was 21 programs. And in spite of already exempting 21 programs from an across-the-board cut of sequestration, as it was called, we got up to the `lick log' when we were going to actually have the programs cut across the board. Guess what Congress did. Changed the date. They said, oh, gee, we will move it a year. 
Congress will always find a way to avoid the tough decisions, unless it is in that revered document, the Constitution. So we have tried laws, we have had good men and women in Congress and in the Presidencies saying we are to go do it, and we have not done it. It is not easy. It takes courage, like I know the Senator from Connecticut has. He would do what we need to do to encourage growth in the economy. He would step up and cast the tough vote to control the growth in spending in some of these programs--all of these programs. 
Everybody has to ante up and kick in. But I haven't seen it. I don't like the idea of amending the Constitution. I voted to do it a few times, and probably if I could take back some of those votes, I would do so. But this is not an insignificant thing. This is our children's future. I have a 29-year-old son, a young entrepreneur who is working hard. He employs 55 people. He sells pizzas. Today, I won't give the label of the pizza, but he is what the American dream is all about. He is out there working hard, making money, creating jobs, and paying a lot of taxes. He figured it out recently. He said, `Dad, I am paying over 50 percent of everything I make in taxes.' You know, that is terrible. It is terrible. A young, 29-year-old man, whose work hours usually are the toughest between 5 p.m. and 2 o'clock in the morning. He is having 50 percent of it go to State, local, and Federal Governments. 
That is not the American way. I have a 26-year-old daughter, a young professional woman, who works hard and promotes our State of Mississippi, promotes tourism. She does a great job. I am proud of her. But I am saddling that son and daughter with an incredible burden, because I have not been able to help find a way to stop the deficit spending, to control the debt--yes, to reduce the debt of the country, and the $340 billion in interest on the national debt. Only Social Security exceeds the cost of interest on the national debt. If we don't do something and do it now and do it tough, there will be over another trillion dollars added to the debt by the year 2002. 
So I think this is something that is worth amending the Constitution for, because we are talking about the future of the country, the future of our economy, the future of our children 
and their children. If we don't do it now, who will do it? When will it be done? So we should amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget. And if we don't, the American people will know truly that we are not serious about it when we say we want to balance the budget. 
I have gone back and looked at the arguments over the years--even this year--as to why we should not pass a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. There is no end to the things that have been suggested. Some are absolutely hilarious, and some are purely political. Amendments have said basically that we should not do it until a Republican President submits the balanced budget, or maybe we should say we should not do it until the Democratic President submits the balanced budget. That is ridiculous. Then they said, well, it's because the escape hatch in times of recession or national emergency is too high--three-fifths. We should not have to have 60 votes. Just about everything we do around here takes 60 votes. Just about everything. And if it is easy to get out from under a balanced budget requirement, do you think Congress won't take advantage of that? We are masters. We have done it over and over and over again. 
Capital budgeting has been talked about. Oh, they do it in the States. Great. Let us take everything off the budget. Let's take out all the trust funds. I have been an advocate of that on occasion. But it is just a red herring. 
Social Security. Oh, that is a good one. We can always rely on Social Security to scare the bejeebers out of folks. So that is a great cover. Oh, yes, if we don't find some special way to deal with the Social Security requirement, oh, this would destroy the system. My mother, 83 years old, bless her heart, counts on Social Security. She knows I am not going to do anything to endanger that for her. I would not do that. If we don't do that, that is what will endanger Social Security. 
I could go on. I will speak again next Tuesday to try to help put this thing in a proper perspective from the beginning to the end with a quote from Thomas Jefferson and some modern quotes about why we need to do this and why we should have done it. I wanted to take a few minutes this morning to say to the American people that it is up to them. If they really want this, a way will be found to get one more vote--just one more vote. Is it a Senator from Nevada or South Carolina? Maybe it is a Senator from South Dakota, or maybe even New Jersey. Somewhere, there will be a Senator who will say: This does matter, and I am going to make the difference. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

This agreement would allow the Senate to conclude the matter on Tuesday, March 4. Having said that, I now will propound a unanimous consent for final disposition of the constitutional amendment.

I further ask that, at 2:15 on Tuesday, there be 1 hour under the control of the manager on the Democratic side of the aisle, with the first 20 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd, to be followed by the next hour under the control of Senator Hatch, to be followed by the next 30 minutes under control of Senator Daschle, or his designee, with the final 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader or his designee. 
I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, a vote occur on the passage of S.J. Res. 1 at 5:15 p.m. on Tuesday, and that paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived and all occur without intervening action.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just comment on the Democratic leader's comments of a moment ago. First of all, I think we have had a good and full debate on this issue. I said from the beginning that I hoped we would do that, and that it would be a thoughtful and provocative debate that would cause Members to think seriously about this issue. I think that has happened. 
There has been some suggestion that we put it off, and I thought about that. If there were some reason to do that, I would be willing to delay it further. But I think we should be ready to vote. We have had amendments and the debate, and we would be prepared to do that, then, on Tuesday under this agreement. But, as always is the case, we need to be aware of and respectful of extenuating circumstances beyond our control. I will join the Democratic leader in moving the vote to the next morning, or whatever, if we have that need, based on a genuine illness or family problem that could not be avoided.

Mr. LOTT. I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for yielding this time so that I may enter a unanimous-consent agreement which has been reached with regard to an amendment that Senator Hollings had intended to offer to the balanced budget amendment on campaign financing. 
I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, may turn to the consideration of a Senate joint resolution, the modified text of which is Senate amendment No. 9 filed yesterday to Senate Joint Resolution 1 regarding campaign financing. 
I further ask that no amendments or motions be in order during the pendency of the Hollings constitutional amendment, and following the conclusion of the debate, the joint resolution be read a third time and a vote occur on passage of the joint resolution, with the preceding occurring without any intervening action. 
Before the Chair puts this consent request to the body, it has been pointed out to me by Senator McCain that this consent is for a constitutional amendment regarding campaign spending limits. There are other campaign-related issues that may be pending in the Senate committees that do not amend the Constitution but are statutory language. 
So this is not to be in place of or in any way block other consideration, or to indicate that there will not be hearings and further consideration of this matter. But Senator Hollings agreed to this arrangement so that it would not be a part of or relate to the consideration of the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. Senator McCain agreed that it be done this way. It has taken the cooperation of both of them and of all the Senators. This is an important issue which should be brought up freestanding with a reasonable amount of time for discussion. 
I have indicated to Senator Hollings that, if it takes a couple of days or so, we will be prepared to do that. I think that is about what it would take, but if it takes 2 days and 2 hours, I do not know of anyone who would object to that. But it should be a very interesting debate. 
So I now make that request, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be immediately resuming consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. By unanimous consent, Senator Graham of Florida will be recognized to debate his amendment. Following 90 minutes of debate on Senator Graham's amendment, a vote will occur on or in relation to the Graham amendment at approximately 12:30 p.m. 
Following that vote, Senator Feingold will be recognized to debate on one of his amendments, and we will continue debate on several pending amendments with those votes stacked this afternoon. I do not believe we have an exact time agreed to yet when that will occur. We will notify the Members, when we have the 12:30 vote, when the next vote will actually occur. 
Following those stacked votes, we will turn to Senator Bumpers' amendment, with additional rollcall votes expected during today's session. We will also, hopefully, get a final agreement on all the amendments that may be offered, and then we will be able to give the Members some information about what to expect, if anything, on Friday and also on Monday. 
Even though we had some disappointment yesterday with one of the Senators who indicated he would be voting for this amendment last year and now has indicated he will not, I encourage my colleagues to remember the vote has not been taken yet, and I still am hopeful that we are going to find a way to have the number of votes, the 67, that is required to pass this constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. We are still working on it, and I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort. 
I thank the Senator from Florida. We will be look forward to hearing his comments on this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman, in supporting biomaterials access assurance legislation to confront a looming health care crisis in our country. 
This legislation is of vital importance to the 8 million Americans who require life-saving and life-enhancing implantable medical devices. Most of us have a family member or friend who has benefitted from these wondrous products. The availability of the biomaterials necessary for medical device production is critical to the health of millions of Americans. The ramifications of unavailability are severe and, in the end, it is those in need of the devices who will suffer the most. 
This bill helps to curtail the impending health crisis by encouraging suppliers of raw materials and component parts to re-enter the medical implant market. Under the bill's provisions, a supplier of raw materials and/or component parts cannot be sued for design or manufacturing deficiencies of the final product unless the supplier can properly be classified as the designer, manufacturer or seller of the product as a whole. 
In recent years, and due in no small part to the prospect of derivative participation in broad-based lawsuits, major biomaterial suppliers have expressed their intent to limit or cease their shipments to manufacturers in the 
medical implant device market. Often, such a supplier has minimal or no knowledge or control of the design, manufacture or sale of an implant device. Nonetheless, under current product liability law, such a supplier can be named as a defendant in a product liability lawsuit based on the design, manufacture and sale of the device itself. And, although suppliers have been found not liable in the overwhelming number of such lawsuits, they must give great consideration to potential damage verdicts and the oppressive financial burden of lawsuit defense costs before deciding to supply manufacturers with raw materials and component parts. 
The detrimental effects of the biomaterials shortage are beginning to take their toll. 
Although the United States has been a leader in the medical implant field, that may change as our ability to focus on new technologies and to contribute funds to research and development is impaired by the diversion of available resources now directed to the search for and qualification of alternative biomaterials suppliers. 
As medical device manufacturers find it increasingly difficult to obtain needed raw materials and component parts, the industry's research and development resources, otherwise devoted to improving existing health care technologies, are drained and redirected to ensure material availability to meet current production demand. In some instances, no alternative sources for materials are found to exist. 
Just as many suppliers cannot afford the risk of liability suits, many manufacturers cannot afford the terms of indemnification contracts required by suppliers. Consider the case of Baxter Healthcare Corp., which operates a manufacturing plant in Cleveland, MS, employing approximately 1,000 people. A major manufacturer of life-saving and life-enhancing implantable medical devices such as heart valves, sewing rings, and left ventricular assist devices, Baxter is highly dependent upon medical-grade biomaterials for production. 
In facing a future based upon operation within this shortage scenario, Baxter is now diverting millions of dollars from research and development to fund its quest for finding alternative materials. Like manufacturers in other parts of the country, Baxter is dealing with suppliers that are faced with product liability risks that far exceed the benefit gained in dealing with a medical device manufacturer. 
For example, Baxter needed to purchase resin--less than 10 pounds a year--with a cost on the open market of less than $3 per pound. The supplier required an iron-clad indemnification contract before the materials could be sold to Baxter, and also demanded an annual fee of nearly $100,000 over and above normal material costs for continued use of the material--in other words, a surcharge for the risk associated with potential liability. 
This drain on manufacturers, as well as the uncertainty of obtaining any materials for the manufacture of their products, is directly attributable to the biomaterials shortage. 
Mr. President, the stability of the manufacturing process is in constant peril, and patients' lives hang in the balance. Let's act to limit liability to instances of genuine fault, and not encourage more frivolous lawsuits where they are, in fact, so often detrimental to consumer interests. 
It is my hope that the Senate will recognize the seriousness of the biomaterials shortage and that we will support this effort to encourage suppliers to re-enter the medical device market and to ensure that patients have available these critical, often life-saving options. 
Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to articulate the urgency and criticality of this legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for that cooperation. We will continue to have discussions and deal honestly and fairly with each other. This is a long list. But as he suggests, I hope they will not all be offered and that we can begin then to identify a time for those amendments to be considered in a regular order and move toward completing action on this debate on this amendment by next Tuesday. 
In that regard, Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, having had several discussions with the Democratic leader as to how to bring to a close this important constitutional amendment, it appears that it is the first step toward reaching final passage time by having this list offered now, which I hope would be in the late afternoon of Tuesday, March 4. 
All Senators who intend to offer amendments to this constitutional amendment must be included in the list just submitted. Also, the Senator on the list must then offer his or her amendment for consideration prior to 5 p.m. on Wednesday. Following the 5 p.m. deadline on Wednesday, the managers will then be able to determine how much work remains leading up to the final passage vote. 
We will be able to identify the amount of time and get some time agreements on the amendments that will be offered. And, of course, we will have adequate closing time for leaders. We should be able to come up with some time late Tuesday afternoon. But we will work through that, and we will keep the Senators informed as to how that will work through. 
At this point, until we see these amendments that are offered, we still can't say exactly what will be the situation on Friday or on Monday. It is anticipated that we will, as we have been doing, have a vote or votes on Monday afternoon. But we will work through that very carefully and will keep the Senators informed once we get the list and get some time agreements entered into. 
So I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation. I think we are making some progress by obtaining this list. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. So, now, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow morning the Senate will be resuming debate on the pending Reid amendment to the balanced budget resolution. At 2:10 p.m. tomorrow the Senate will begin 5 minutes of closing remarks followed by a rollcall vote on adoption of House Joint Resolution 36, the resolution regarding U.N. population funding. 
Following that vote, the Senate then will resume debate on the Reid amendment, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the amendment at 6 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon. 
As a reminder, the Senate will debate Senator Feinstein's amendment on Wednesday morning, from the hours of 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Following the vote at 11 on or in relation to the Feinstein amendment, Senator Torricelli will be recognized to offer an amendment relating to capital budgeting. That amendment is limited to 3 hours for debate. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in allowing us to schedule these votes, and I hope we can continue to make progress on this important matter. It is my understanding that just prior to our weekly party conferences, the Democratic leader and I will be able to consult, and hopefully he will be in a position to enter into an agreement outlining the remaining amendments in order to the constitutional amendment. Once that agreement is reached, then we will be in a better position to notify our Members with respect to votes during the remainder of this week. 
It is my intention at this time to have votes on Friday on amendments, if necessary, unless we can get an agreement to the contrary. We should know about this tomorrow, and we will let the Members know for sure about votes on Friday and/or Monday. 
We want to have, and we have had, a full and fair debate on this very important constitutional amendment, and there have been amendments to that language that have been fully discussed. We continue to reach agreements on those amendments, including a Feinstein amendment, the Reid amendment, and for the Torricelli amendment. But I do think there is a point, at some time, when we need to come to closure on the amendments that are in order, have those debated and voted on if necessary, and then get to final passage. I hope we can get that worked out in the next couple of days.

<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 3 p.m. this afternoon. This will accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak on various matters. 
Following morning business today, there will be a number of items that are possible for Senate consideration. Due to several scheduling conflicts, I am uncertain at this time exactly whether or not we will be able to make further progress on Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. But it is my hope that at some time today the Democratic leader and I will reach an understanding as to the number of amendments that are expected to Senate Joint Resolution 1 as well as an indication as to when we might be able to complete action on this important constitutional amendment. 
We have worked very hard at trying to accommodate all Senators' schedules, and, of course, this morning we have a funeral service for Ambassador Harriman and other problems in that area we tried to accommodate. We have taken up a few amendments and voted, but earlier my conversations with the Democratic leader were that he did not see--I believe this is a fair statement--any reason why we could not complete this work by the end of this month. So we have today and then 5 days when we come back after the Presidents' Day recess. I hope we can get a list that would have a reasonable amount of serious amendments and then get an agreement on a time to complete that action. 
We want to make sure we have a full debate, everybody feels that they have been treated fairly, but there needs to be a limit on how long this goes on. We have been acting so far this year in good faith. We have been trying to accommodate each other's schedules, but when we come back we are going to have to move these amendments through the process and get a final vote because we do have other work we would like to bring to the floor. 
I remind my colleagues that we have scheduled a rollcall vote on the pending amendment offered by Senator Byrd. That vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, February 24, the day we come back. It is also possible the Senate will vote today on a resolution submitted by Senator Specter regarding milk prices. If an agreement can be reached, we will have a short period of debate on that resolution followed by a rollcall vote. 
We are also still attempting to clear consideration of a resolution relating to the American Airlines strike which was submitted by Senator Hutchison. This is timely, obviously. We are looking at the possibility of a strike which could cripple that airline and impact jobs in the thousands all over the country. So I am hoping that we could pass a resolution expressing our concern and urging the President to use his powers to find a way to avoid this threatened strike. 
Finally, there are a couple of nominations that were reported from committee yesterday. We may be able to clear those nominations for action. I am not sure that they would even require a vote, but we will have to work through it here in the next 3 or 4 hours. This is the last day of the session prior to the Presidents' Day recess, so I thank my colleagues for their cooperation as we try to finish business at a reasonable hour today. We will notify all the Senators when we may have actual rollcall votes. And, again, we have had good cooperation, but we have not had a lot of pressure in terms of schedule, and when we come back we really have to begin to make some progress on these amendments, and I hope we will be able to do that. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 21, the adjournment resolution. 
I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator's question. First of all, it is very hard to pick a date, to say by a date certain we will get something done. For instance, on the matter that has been pending before the Senate, Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, we had hoped we could have a reasonable and fair debate and amendments being offered--I believe the Senator from Minnesota has had three or so and maybe he had some more--and that by the end of the month we would have a vote on that after having had a good, fair debate and amendments being offered. 
But now we are having trouble getting amendments up and getting a time agreed to. Now I understand we may have, I do not know, 20 or 25 amendments lurking around out there. So now I have to begin to consider filing cloture on something that--we do not want to start the cloture wars this year. So I try to take into consideration everybody's needs, and we have problems we have to take into consideration, like funerals of relatives or the Ambassador today. So it is very hard to say a time certain. 
Another example is, before we have reform, I think we ought to find out, first of all, what laws have been violated already on the books. Today we have in the paper that China is working, perhaps, on trying to get some foreign contributions, illegal contributions in the Presidential campaign. There seems to be an article every day--every day. 
Before we start trying to reform a law, I think we ought to see a law that is already on the books that I voted for back in 1973 or 1974 that is being used or abused. Yet we are seeing an all-out fight to stop the funding for the Governmental Affairs Committee to begin its work to find out what happened so we will know what laws have been violated, so we will know what kind of reform we may or may not need. Unfortunately, as it is being delayed and the appearance of obstruction in getting that hearing started, that has an impact on when we might get to a vote on legislation here in the Senate. 
The next thing is we would like to have hearings on this issue in the Rules Committee. In fact, we will have. And yet the Rules Committee has been tied up for almost 2 weeks on trying to get the committee funding resolution and the resolution of the question with regard to the alleged illegal contributions in the Presidential campaign in 1996. 
Then, also, I have to say to the Senator, are we ready now to begin to work on a bill that maybe both sides can agree to, or will it be one where you want to stick it to our side? Are you ready now to begin to get some language in there that would say that we must have paycheck equity? In other words, when I talk to my friends in my hometown, union members, some of which I used to represent when I practiced law, and my father was one, they get irate that their dues are being used for campaign purposes across this country without their approval or designation. 
So, there is not going to be a campaign finance bill that does not address a question like that. So, is the Senator ready to include something like that in the legislation?

Mr. LOTT. I try to be calm and respond gently, but when the Senator pricks me a little bit, I have to try to respond in a way that explains why I can't just say, `April 15 on tax day we are going to take this bill up.' I need help. I need cooperation on your side. We have done that. 
The Senator from Minnesota knows that last year I worked with him, I kept my word to him even one time when there was a little misunderstanding, but we worked through it and got it done. I am willing to do that, but you have to keep in mind what we are trying to accomplish here on a number of issues that do interrelate. 
I am happy to yield for a response to that.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that means we will have a vote on the Byrd amendment around 5:30 on Monday. We will come in at 9 on Tuesday, the week of the 24th and 25th, and we will have debate during the morning of Tuesday on the Reid amendment. We will recess for the policy luncheons then and come in at 2:15 for a vote on the population planning issue. We will continue to debate the Reid amendment after that, with a vote at 6 o'clock on Tuesday, the 25th. We will come in at 9 o'clock on Wednesday and begin the debate on the Feinstein amendment and vote at 11 o'clock. 
I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation in getting these three amendments to the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget scheduled. Because of that cooperation, I did not file a cloture motion this afternoon. That is somewhat risky, because if we don't get good cooperation, if we don't work through these amendments with time agreements, that will mean that I could not file a cloture motion and require a vote until Wednesday of that week. But if the Members will work with us in good faith, on both sides, if we make progress and we move toward completion of the constitutional amendment that first week that we are back, ending the 28th, then maybe a cloture motion will not be necessary. But we must have cooperation on these amendments to either get the ones that are not serious dispensed with, or to get a vote scheduled quickly on Wednesday of that week. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

In light of those requests and the memorial service for Ambassador Pamela Harriman, I expect the Senate will be conducting morning business only until around 2 p.m. on Thursday. 
Following morning business, there is a possibility for consideration of a resolution regarding milk prices, and there is the possibility of another resolution but we are trying to see if that resolution has been filed and, of course, we will need to clear it with the Democratic leader. 
There are rollcall votes possible during tomorrow's session but we do not have an agreement on that yet. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment, on Monday, February 24, the Senate resume consideration of Senator Byrd's amendment No. 6 beginning at 3:30 p.m. 
I further ask that there be 2 additional hours of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the vote on or in relation to the Byrd amendment and finally no amendments be in order to that amendment.

I have discussed these Monday afternoon votes with the Democratic leader. We are agreed we will have votes quite often on Monday afternoons. We will try to tell you as far in advance as we can. It does seem to get the Members back and ready for work. It allows us to get committee work done on Monday afternoons or certainly on Tuesday mornings. And also I should remind Senators that that week after we come back after the Presidents Day recess, in order to complete our work on the balanced budget amendment there is a good possibility we will have to stay in late on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. That is not definite yet. It will depend on how many amendments and time agreements. We will work with the leader on that. But we have been very aggressive in trying to keep our schedule reasonable. If we need to do some late nights that week to finish our work so that we can do other things that are pending, including nominations, then we would be prepared to do that. But we will advise you in advance when we are going to have to be in session at night.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. By unanimous consent, there will be 60 minutes remaining for debate on Senator Wellstone's amendment No. 3. Senators can expect a rollcall vote on or in relation to that Wellstone amendment at approximately 3:15 today, if all debate time is used. 
Following that vote, it is my hope we will be able to begin consideration of the nomination of Bill Richardson to be the U.N. Ambassador. The Foreign Relations Committee will be reporting out that nomination this afternoon, and we will attempt to reach an agreement limiting debate to approximately 20 minutes equally divided but we will, of course, wait until the committee has officially reported it and then bring it up as shortly thereafter as possible. 
Following that vote, we will continue debate on the balanced budget amendment, and it is my understanding that Senator Reid will be prepared to offer his amendment relative to Social Security. The amendment will be debated today and tomorrow, and we hope to set a vote on or in relation to the Reid amendment for tomorrow, late in the afternoon, probably around 5:30 or so. But we have to get a final agreement on the exact time. All Senators will be notified as the votes are scheduled. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation as we approach the Presidents Day recess.

It is my understanding that Senator Boxer intends to make a statement relative to the constitutional amendment. Also, the President of the United States will be visiting with congressional leaders tomorrow on the Senate side of the Capitol--in fact, in the President's Room just off the floor of the Senate Chamber. Therefore, it is my hope that when the Senate convenes following the weekly policy party luncheons, there will be a short time agreement for debate prior to a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment regarding underprivileged youth. Members should expect a vote relative to the Wellstone amendment in the 3 o'clock timeframe tomorrow. Also, the Senate could be asked to confirm the nomination of Congressman Richardson to be Ambassador to the United Nations. Therefore, a rollcall vote is expected with respect to that nomination. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will continue the debate on the balanced budget amendment on Monday. Under a previous order, the Senate will resume debate on the Durbin amendment at 3:30 with a vote occurring on or in relation to that amendment at approximately 5:30 on Monday. Senators can, therefore, expect the next rollcall vote on Monday, February 10, at 5:30. 
Prior to that debate, Senator Wellstone will be recognized to offer two amendments. It is my hope we will be able to complete all debate on Senator Wellstone's amendments during Monday's session, however those amendments will be voted on during Tuesday's session. 
I also remind my colleagues that next week is the final week of business prior to the Presidents' Day recess. I hope we will be able to make continued progress on the balanced budget amendment, and it is possible the Senate will act on a number of nominations that will be available. In fact, we do have pending before us for consideration the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky to be the U.S. Trade Representative, although her nomination will involve probably a vote on a waiver of an existing law, and possibly an amendment to that waiver that may be offered by Senator Hollings or others; so we will have to keep that in mind. And we expect to have the nomination reported out for U.N. Ambassador Richardson. 
We also may be voting next week on the mandatory provisions included in last year's omnibus appropriations bill involving population planning funding. That will depend on whether the House is able to complete its action early in the week. But we could very well get to a vote on that issue Wednesday or Thursday of next week because we would like to complete it, if we could, before the Presidents' Day recess. 
We will continue, then, to have debate on amendments, with time agreements wherever possible, on the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. So I urge my colleagues to be understanding next week. 
We also will be out a good portion of Thursday morning for Ambassador Harriman's funeral, and therefore we probably won't be able to get started with votes until sometime after noon on Thursday. But we'll have a full day on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday next week before we go out for the Presidents' Day recess.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] will offer this amendment when the Senate reconvenes after our conference. He will then debate his amendment throughout the remainder of today's session as long as he needs. It is my understanding that Senator Durbin will be willing then to vote in relation to his amendment on Monday, February 10, at 5 p.m. 
I wish to say that we had been hoping maybe we did not need to have that vote, but in view of the fact that we are not scheduled to be in session next Friday and the funeral services are scheduled for Thursday for Ambassador Harriman, we do need to get as much work done as we can on Monday. So we will look toward having this vote at 5 o'clock on Monday and then votes early Tuesday morning, and continue on through the remainder of the week to accomplish as much as we can in terms of taking up amendments on the constitutional amendment and also confirmations that we hope to be able to move. We think we will have a couple more perhaps that we will be able to vote on in the next week. 
So with that in mind, I would like to announce there will be no further votes today and the next rollcall vote is expected to occur at approximately 5 p.m. on Monday, February 10.

At 12 o'clock, the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. I understand an amendment will be offered this morning or in the early afternoon to that amendment, by a Member of the other side of the aisle. I do not have the details of that amendment at this time, but I hope that we may debate it and dispose of it in a reasonable timeframe early this afternoon. 
Also, as a reminder, a consent agreement was reached today which limits debate to 30 minutes equally divided on the nomination of Rodney Slater to be Secretary of Transportation. It is possible we may proceed to that nomination this afternoon, and all Senators will be notified accordingly if we schedule that vote. We hope that will be done and I intend to do so, but I am still working at getting final clearance. 
I remind my colleagues the Senate will be in recess today from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock to accommodate a conference meeting this afternoon.

By a previous agreement, only opening remarks will be in order to Senate Joint Resolution 1 on Wednesday, and I would not anticipate a late night session. 
Also, I remind my colleagues that the Senate may consider any additional nominations that become available this week. I understand there is still a possibility that we would have one or two that could be available on Thursday. We are hoping that is true. 
Finally, I ask that all Members be present in the Senate Chamber tonight promptly at 8:30 p.m. so that we can proceed over as a group at 8:40 to the House of Representatives for the President's State of the Union Address.

SCHEDULE 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19970204</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 12:30, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. At 12:30 today the Senate will recess until 2:15 to allow the weekly policy conferences to meet. 
Following the conferences, the Senate may consider a Senate resolution regarding mammograms, which was submitted by Senator Snowe. It is my hope we will be able to enter a short time limitation for debate and then have a rollcall vote on the adoption of that resolution. All Members will be notified when that agreement is reached as well as when the rollcall vote can be expected. We hope that we will have that vote probably not later than 4 o'clock or so this afternoon, but we will give the specific time a little later in the morning. 
As expected, yesterday the Judiciary Committee did file their report on the constitutional amendment on the balanced budget. The report became available this morning and, therefore, under the rule, the Senate may begin consideration of that joint resolution on Thursday. It is possible that we may begin opening statements on the balanced budget amendment on Wednesday, tomorrow afternoon. I will notify all Members of that schedule after I confer further with the democratic leader. 
In addition, several committees are expected to complete their work on some of the pending nominations during this week. Once again, I will alert all Members as to the Senate schedule with respect to these nominees. We have at least a couple that are close to being reported. We hope to have a vote on those Thursday, if at all possible. 
Of course, on Thursday morning we will also be notified of the President's budget proposals, and we hope to have a quick meeting with the President up here on Capitol Hill in the President's room certainly within the next week. We are still working on the specifics and details of that meeting, so we can begin to actually roll up our sleeves and begin work on items where we think there is a good possibility for agreement so that we can move things, like the balanced budget agreement, some tax relief for working Americans, improvements in education at the local level with parents being involved on behalf of the children's interests, safer streets, safer neighborhoods, and toxic and nuclear waste cleanup. These are areas where we have a lot of common interests, concerns, and we should go to work on these big issues as quickly as we possibly can. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleague's attention to the outstanding efforts and hard work of the men and women of the U.S. Maritime Administration. I want to offer my own heartfelt thanks to those individuals for their hard work and dedication in swiftly implementing the Maritime Security Act. 
The Maritime Security Act, which was approved by the Senate on September 24, and signed into law by the President on October 8 last year. It will ensure the continued viability of the U.S.-flag merchant marine. It will guarantee that there will be an adequate number of private-sector, U.S.-flag vessels on hand for the Department of Defense in times of war or national emergency. Our Nation will continue to support a base of maritime employment to provide trained, loyal U.S.-citizen merchant mariners to crew the Department of Defense's Ready Reserve fleet of sealift vessels. 
Quite simply, without this legislation the United States might have lost its merchant marine. Some of our Nation's most honored former military leaders let us know last year, in no uncertain terms, just how costly that would be. Our Armed Forces are counting on the U.S.-flag merchant marine to bring them the supplies they need to sustain their operations on hostile shores. If history has taught us one lesson, Mr. President, we should hold a deep appreciation for the importance of the U.S.-flag merchant marine to our Nation's security. That is why the outstanding efforts of the Maritime Administration deserves recognition. 
In the days following enactment of the Maritime Security Act, the staff of the Maritime Administration worked tirelessly to iron out the contracts between the Government and the individual U.S.-flag vessel operators. This is the backbone of the Maritime Security Program. 
At the same time, MARAD staff coordinated their efforts with the Department of Defense. This ensured that only the most modern and most militarily useful U.S.-flag vessels are chosen for the Maritime Security Program. These efforts will enhance our national defense capabilities. 
The first contracts were signed last month, just before the holidays. And, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that the final contracts were just recently signed. In just 4 months, the complete 47-ship Maritime Security Fleet has become a reality. We have MARAD to thank for taking our vision and translating it into a viable program. 
I want to recognize the Administrator of MARAD, Vice Adm. Albert J. Herberger. His firm leadership at the helm of his agency has been exemplary. Vice Admiral Herberger is widely respected in the maritime industry, and his abilities as a manager, a negotiator and an administrator, coupled with his extensive military experience, played a major role in implementing this legislation. 
The implementation of the Maritime Security Program also required the efforts of many MARAD employees. I want to take a moment to recognize several workers by name: Debra Aheron, Ray Barberesi, Murray Bloom, Joan Bondareff, Cher Brooks, Thomas Bryan, Jim Caponiti, Veronica Carver, Sharon Cassidy, Rhonda Davis, William Ebersold, John Graykowski, Steven Jackson, William Kurfehs, John Lesnick, Richard McDonnell, Jeffrey McMahon, Robert Patton, Carol Powell, John Swank, Kenneth Willis, and Joan Yim. 
To conclude, Mr. President, I would like to add that the Maritime Administration will continue to administer the Maritime Security Program throughout the 10-year life of the Maritime Security Act. Although the work from the good folks at MARAD is just the beginning, we should honor their efforts. They have done so much to ensure that the American flag will still fly in the world's sea lanes. American merchant mariners will be on the decks of those ships. And, our Armed Forces will have the necessary strategic sealift capability to project America's presence overseas. 
Thank you, MARAD.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there will be no further rollcall votes this week. The Senate is expected to be in session into the afternoon for Senators to introduce legislation and to make statements. We have had indications that there are some Senators who intend to do that. 
The Senate may also be asked to clear a few routine Legislative and Executive Calendar items. We do have a few we think we will be able to get cleared and complete those this afternoon. 
Following the conclusion of today's session, it is anticipated that the Senate will be in recess tomorrow and a pro forma session on Monday. 
It is my understanding the Judiciary Committee will order reported today from their committee the constitutional amendment with respect to a balanced budget. Allowing for the 3-day requirement for minority members to submit their minority views, it is then expected the Judiciary Committee would be able to report the constitutional amendment to the Senate on Monday. If that is the case, and the report could be available by late afternoon on Monday, it would be my intention to turn to the constitutional amendment with respect to a balanced budget on Wednesday, February 5. 
I remind my colleagues, we will have the State of the Union Address by the President on Tuesday night, the 4th, and we expect to receive the President's budget submission on Thursday, February 6. So next week will be eventful. 
We will continue to work to clear nominations just from getting reports from various committees. It looks to me like there could be a minimum of two or three more Presidential nominations--I think all of them are Cabinet level--that may be available next week. We will try to work those into the schedule as soon as they are available, presumably Wednesday and Thursday, on those nominations and confirmations. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, when the First Congress convened in 1789, one of the more pressing problems for the Senate was its inability to keep a majority of Members in the Capitol long enough to establish a quorum, organize, and begin the business of Government. In response, the Senate established the Office of Doorkeeper. As the first officer of the Senate, the Doorkeeper's primary responsibilities were to keep Senators in and, as proceedings were held in closed session for the first 6 years, keep everyone else out. 
In 1795, the Senate began holding open sessions which required the opening of public galleries. And, once again, it fell to the Doorkeepers to maintain decorum and enforce the rules of the Senate. 
Mr. President, as I speak here today, and every day that the Senate is in session, there are more than a score of Doorkeepers, both on the floor of the Senate and dutifully standing post in the galleries. The Senate is grateful for the dedication and service of the ranks of the members of the Office of the Doorkeeper. In particular, I want to commend the service of three individuals who have given a cumulative service of nearly 70 years to the U.S. Senate. 
On behalf of the Senate I want to thank Messrs. Richard Gibbons, Arthur Curran, and Donn Larson. Regrettably, I am informed that each will retire at the end of this month. 
Arthur Patrick Curran has faithfully served the U.S. Senate as a Doorkeeper for the past 21 years. Initially appointed by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in 1975, 6 years later he was promoted to Superintendent of Doorkeepers and has served in that capacity until his retirement in January 1997. In addition to his normal post at the Senate Chamber, Mr. Curran has performed his duties in numerous high profile Senate hearings, joint sessions, and Presidential inaugurations. 
Mr. Curran, a native of Washington, DC, has strong links to New England and a keen interest in politics. In fact with his tall stature, bow tie, and stately appearance, he is often confused for being a Senator. On several occasions, as visitors have left the gallery, they have congratulated him for his fine speech. 
Donn Larson, Deputy Superintendent of Doorkeepers, is also retiring after many years of dedicated service to the U.S. Senate. Donn started his career with the Senate under an appointment from Senator Milton Young (R-ND) in 1959. From 1961 to 1968, he worked in the Republican Cloakroom, assisting the Secretary to the Minority. 
From 1969 to 1977, Donn worked in the Federal Government. He served with the State Department Inspector General for Foreign Assistance, as well as with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. In 1977, Donn returned to the U.S. Senate, and in 1981 assumed the position of Deputy Superintendent of Doorkeepers. 
Richard Gibbons began service with the office of Doorkeeper in the 94th Congress--1977. For a number of years, he served as the press liaison for the Doorkeeper's Office. During the 103d Congress, Richard was assigned to work solely on the Senate floor, assisting Members of the Senate. 
Each of us have known these men over the years for their tireless efforts in maintaining decorum of the Chamber and galleries and assisting Members on the floor of the Senate. Countless letters of appreciation have been written by our constituents thanking these men for there kindness and courtesies. 
On the occasion of their retirement from Federal service, I want to extend the very best wishes of the U.S. Senate and a grateful Nation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for all Senators' information, the Senate will not be in session on Friday. There will be a pro forma session on Monday, which we just pointed out, at 9:30, with no business to be conducted. The Senate will be in session on Tuesday, and it is possible that following the weekly policy luncheons on Tuesday, the Senate may consider additional nominations that will come available. There are some that are moving and, hopefully, have been reported, and maybe will be ready by Tuesday. So Senators should expect the possibility of rollcall votes on Tuesday during the session. Members will be notified of the specific times we will have those votes scheduled. 
Under a previous consent, the Judiciary Committee will be able to file a report accompanying the balanced budget amendment on Monday. It is my hope we will then be able to begin consideration on that important constitutional amendment sometime during Wednesday's session of the Senate. 
I also would like to remind my colleagues that the President's State of the Union Address is scheduled at 9 p.m. on Tuesday evening. All Senators are asked to be in the Senate Chamber at 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday so the Senate can proceed at 8:40 p.m. to the House of Representatives for the address. 
Mr. President, we do hope that we will have one or two Cabinet nominations ready next week. Again, it depends on whether or not they are reported by the committees and we get them filed and agree on a time, which all Senators agree to, and have a vote. It looks likes it will not occur before Wednesday or Thursday. We cannot make that announcement at this time. We will continue to work on that next week.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I ask for some unanimous-consent agreements and do the close, I want to commend, also, the remarks of Senator Dole that were just printed in the Record by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I attended the ceremony where Senator Dole received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I must say, it was one of the most inspiring events I have ever attended. 
First of all, I think the President deserves credit for presenting this very deserving leader of our country the Medal of Freedom. 
Second, I think I have probably never been to an event where there was more of a combination of a feeling of good will, appreciation for our veterans, patriotism and humility and humor, all wrapped in one event. It was really an inspiration. 
Bob Dole's remarks, which are in the Record, are typical of Bob. He said almost nothing about the fact that he was receiving this honor, other than the fact that he would cherish it. He, instead, chose to talk about American soldiers and the service they gave and the American experiment, Government, history--magnificent remarks. Also, he had that special moment of history where I thought for a moment he was going to be sworn in to be President of the United States instead of being given the Medal of Freedom. 
It was a tremendous occasion. I am very proud that Bob Dole received this recognition, and I am delighted we put his statement in the Record for all Americans to read it.

Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, at 9:30 tomorrow morning we will have 30 minutes of debate to be followed by a vote on the nomination of William Daley to be Secretary of Commerce. We should then expect a rollcall vote around 10 a.m. on Thursday. Following that rollcall, there will be no further rollcall votes this week. 
We are moving forward with the nominations of the President to his Cabinet. This will be the fourth one that has been confirmed. Of course, committees are meeting and acting on other confirmation hearings and other issues. Those will begin to come to the floor of the Senate next week. 
Next week will certainly be a busy period because we will have the President's State of the Union, we will begin debate on the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, and on Thursday we receive the President's budget for the year. So we will have his information on that then, and we can really begin to proceed with business that needs to be acted on this year. 
There will be a period of morning business tomorrow for Members to make statements, and the Senate may consider other legislative or executive matters that can be cleared. So I remind my colleagues once again, they should expect a vote at 10 a.m., and that will be the final vote of the day.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there are those moments as we navigate through life's journey in which our path crosses with people of genuine character and compassion. When we come about one of these persons, it is as if a window is raised allowing the spring breeze to enter our very soul. On these rare occasions, our spirit is lifted causing us to believe anew in the goodness of God and the magic of his gift to mankind. Mr. Albert Colmer Weeks of Pascagoula, MS, is one of these rare people. 
Known as `Skeeter' to his friends--who are many--his life is a testament of service, love, and dedication to his family and community. While Skeeter counts Pascagoula as his home, he was born in Ponchatula, LA, and moved at the age of 3 to Perkinston, MS, where his father served as a coach, athletic director, and later vice president and dean of men at Perkinston Junior College. After completing high school in Perkinston in 1944, Skeeter was appointed a page in the U.S. House of Representatives by his uncle and former Congressman, Hon. Bill Colmer. 
As many of my colleagues know, I also worked for Representative Colmer as his administrative assistant for 4 years. The fateful year in which I crossed paths with Skeeter in a large and substantive way was 1968. By that time, Skeeter had been working for Ingalls Shipbuilding for 9 years as director of public relations. 
As director of public relations at Ingalls Shipbuilding, Skeeter was the one individual most responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating the launching, christening, and commissioning of hundreds of ships for the United States Navy. Skeeter is a big part of the reason Ingalls is today known as America's Shipyard. His professionalism, attention to detail, and customer oriented service ethic has endeared him to many of our nation's political leaders--from President's to Cabinet Secretaries to Secretaries of the Navy--over the span of almost 40 years. 
On January 31, 1997, Skeeter will be retiring from Ingalls Shipbuilding. Behind he will leave a legacy of 38 years in service to Ingalls, the city of Pascagoula, Jackson County, the State of Mississippi, and indeed, the country as a whole. Skeeter is a veteran of the United States Navy, a 1951 graduate of Mississippi State University, and a man of honor. 
To his wife, Janet, and his children Leah and Alice, I say thank you. We have all borrowed Skeeter's time and talent for years, a gift he has freely given us. Beginning Saturday, February 1, 1997, you have him all to yourself. It is your gain, and with this gain we give you our gratitude and envy. 
As Skeeter turns the page and begins this new chapter in his life, I am reminded of a verse penned by Robert Louis Stevenson: 
So long as we love we serve; so long as we are loved by others, I would almost say we are indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a friend. 
In celebration of this special event, I am proud to declare to the U.S. Senate, Albert Colmer Weeks is my friend. Enjoy your retirement, Skeeter. You have richly earned it.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to announce at this point also for the information of all Senators, there will be no recorded votes for the remainder of the day. There will be opportunity for Members to attend committee hearings, confirmation hearings and begin to have hearings on legislation, but there will be no recorded votes this afternoon. 
It is our hope that we will be able to have debate this afternoon on the nominee to be head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Cuomo. We have not been able to get a time worked out on that, an agreement where we would be able to have a vote in the morning, but we would like to be able to get the debate done this afternoon. So any Senators who would like to speak on that may want to do that, and then maybe we can complete it in the morning, hopefully get a vote sometime early in the morning between perhaps 9:30 and 10. 
We have run into a couple little bumps in the road. We may not be able to get that agreement worked out, but we are still working on it. We also expect to be able to vote on Thursday morning then, probably again between 9:30 and 10 o'clock, on Mr. Daley to be the Secretary of Commerce. 
So we will definitely have one vote on Thursday, and we may have a vote on Wednesday on the other nomination. We will let Senators know later in the day if that is worked out. With that, Mr. President, I would be glad to yield the floor to the Senator from Virginia.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, on behalf of myself and Senator Daschle, the distinguished minority leader, a joint resolution concerning what has long been known as Juneteenth Independence Day. 
Joining us as original sponsors of this resolution are Senators Levin and Moseley-Braun, who offered similar legislation in the 104th Congress. 
The observance of Juneteenth has long been a tradition among black Americans. It commemorates the days in mid-June, 1865, when news of the end of slavery finally reached frontier areas of the country, especially in the American Southwest. 
The African-Americans who then moved into freedom, and began new lives as citizens of the Republic, kept alive the memory of that occasion for their descendants. 
Generation by generation, the experiences of the past have been preserved and shared. They have given us lessons in faith, in courage, and in perseverance. 
Today, the National Association of Juneteenth Lineage fosters the observance of Juneteenth Independence Day, not only among those families whose ancestors were directly affected by it, but also among the general public. The association will be meeting this year in Dallas from January 23 to January 25. 
The introduction of this joint resolution by the two Senate leaders is a timely expression of the Senate's regard and appreciation for the association's efforts. 
I should mention that this joint resolution is especially appropriate as we prepare to observe February as Black History Month, which, to borrow the words of the resolution, `provides an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about our common past and to better understand the experiences that have shaped our nation.' 
With that in mind, I know Senator Daschle joins me in inviting our colleagues, from all regions of the country, to cosponsor this legislation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just be recognized momentarily, I am pleased to join with the Democratic leader and Senator Byrd in presenting this resolution for Alan Scott Frumin. 
He is a Parliamentarian Emeritus who has already served 20 years. He is in his 21st year in the Senate with all of those years in the Parliamentarian's Office, and he says he has actually started understanding and learning the rules. But it has taken 21 years because it is not an easy thing to do. 
But he, obviously, has done outstanding work. He has been nonpartisan, as he should be in that position. He has been the Parliamentarian of the Senate for 8 years. 
He is a New York native with a law degree from Georgetown. He certainly has earned this distinction and this recognition. And I express our appreciation on behalf of the grateful Senate.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-lott-ms-2-19970123</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, we will be in a period for morning business in order for all Senators to introduce legislation and to make statements in connection and support of those pieces of legislation, or to make statements on other issues, if they so desire. 
As we announced last night, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session, and when the Senate completes its business today, it will stand in adjournment until Monday, January 27, for a pro forma session only. No business will be conducted during Monday's session, and the Senate will automatically adjourn over until Tuesday, January 28. 
As all Members are aware, throughout the past week, and continuing into next week, committees are holding hearings with regard to various nominations for the President's Cabinet. That is one reason why we are trying to not force activity on the floor of the Senate, so that the committees can do their work and so the proper investigations and hearings can be held. It is my hope that next week the Senate will be able to consider additional nominations that may become available to the full Senate. It looks like there may be one or two that would be available next week sometime. 
So I remind all Senators that rollcall votes are possible, and hopefully likely, beginning on Tuesday and throughout the week on those nominations or other matters that may become available. 
Finally, I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation 
in allowing us to finish action on the two nominations yesterday. It was not planned and it was not easy, because some Senators had made other arrangements. We had some Senators that wanted to go to Massachusetts for the wake of Senator Tsongas, and then we have the funeral proceedings today. But we were able to work through that, and there was a little give and take and I appreciate that. 
I will be sending a letter--hopefully joined by the Democratic leader--if not tomorrow, early next week, to also ask Senators at the beginning of the session to be helpful to the leadership by not making unreasonable requests as to when votes will occur. I was shocked last year, when I came in as majority leader, at the requests we got from Senators who said, `Can we not have a vote until 11 o'clock on Tuesday?' `Could we not have any votes between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock on Thursday?' 
If we want to have a family friendly Senate, it begins with individual Senators. We will always try to accommodate all Senators wherever we can, and we work with the staff on both sides of the aisle when there are extenuating circumstances--planes are delayed, or when there are funerals that must be attended--and that's fine. But I really think that the practice that has evolved--and I believe it has evolved over several years--where 1 Senator is willing to ask 99 Senators to inconvenience themselves for their one need, is out of control. It is ridiculous and unfair. We are not going to be able to get our work done and be able to go home at a reasonable hour at night if we can't have votes on Monday, if we can't have any votes until 11 o'clock on Tuesday, and cannot vote on Thursday afternoon. So, frankly, we are not going to honor those requests when they are ridiculous and of that nature. 
Senators should know that beginning at 9 o'clock on Tuesday until 6 or 7 o'clock on Tuesday, they will be expected to be here to vote, unless it is extraordinarily important. We are going to make sure we do it in a nonpartisan, bipartisan way. But I think we may have to prove a point here a couple of times. One of the reasons why we always want all Senators present is so they can record their constituents' views through their vote, but also because sometimes absentees lead to defeat on one side or the other. So Senators need to be here during normal working hours on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and probably some Mondays and Fridays. We will try to give as long a notice as possible. This is not an election year. We need to change our approach as to how we do our work. 
I plead with the Senators, don't continue that practice. It will not be our intent to honor it when it borders on the verge of being, as I said twice before, ridiculous. We will send a written letter to every Senator from the leaders on both sides, hopefully, asking that this request be honored. 
Seeing no Senator seeking recognition at this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am reintroducing the Older Americans Freedom To Work Act and request my colleagues' support. This legislation would remove the limitation on the amount of outside income which Social Security beneficiaries, who have reached retirement age, may earn without incurring a reduction in benefits. It would abolish the onerous earnings best and allow senior citizens to work without being penalized. 
As you know, the Social Security retirement earnings test reduces benefits to persons between ages 65 and 69 who earn more than $13,500. These reductions amount to $1 in reduced benefits for every $3 in earnings above the limit. 
This limitation is unfair and poses a serious threat to the labor work force. Demographers tell us, that between the years 2000 and 2010, the baby boom generation will be in their retirement years. With fewer babies being born, this Nation is looking at a severe labor shortage. We need the skills, wisdom, and experience of our older workers, and this measure will encourage them to remain in the labor force. 
Elimination of the retirement earnings test begins the process of providing employment opportunities for older Americans without punishing them for their efforts. In the 1930's when the earned income limit was devised, encouraging senior citizens to leave the workplace was seen as a positive act, designed to increase job opportunities for younger workers. Today, with our shrinking labor force, such a policy is senseless.

Mr. LOTT. Today there will be a period for morning business until 12 o'clock noon, with Senators to speak for up to 5 minutes each, with the following exceptions: Senator Grassley for 60 minutes--and I see he is here and prepared to proceed--Senator Feinstein for 30 minutes, and Senator Daschle 30 minutes. 
At 12 noon today, following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. Under the order that has been agreed to, there will be 2 hours and 10 minutes for debate on the nomination, with the vote to occur at the conclusion or yielding back of the debate time. 
So I presume that will be around 10 minutes after 2 or so. It is my hope that some of that debate time will be yielded back so the Senate may vote on the nomination early enough to accommodate our colleagues who wish to attend the wake of former Senator Paul Tsongas. 
Following the vote on the Albright nomination, I expect an additional period of morning business to allow Senators to introduce legislation they have been working on or perhaps to make comments on bills that were introduced yesterday. 
Finally, I will announce that, if available later this week, the Senate may consider the nomination of our former colleague, Senator Bill Cohen, to be Secretary of Defense. We are not sure exactly how that will proceed. The committee is scheduled to have a hearing today. We are looking at the possibility of whether or not it could be taken up either later today or, if not today, then late tomorrow after our delegation returns from Massachusetts. 
I had indicated to the President our desire to cooperate with him in getting his foreign policy and defense Cabinet nominees in place as soon as possible. So I would really like to see us get that done this week. I know there will be support for that on both sides of the aisle. 
Therefore, additional rollcall votes may occur today or this week and Members will be notified accordingly. I think at this point there does not appear to be a necessity for us to have votes on Friday, although I am not making that commitment yet. Just be prepared to have more votes possibly today and tomorrow, on Thursday. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, so far, January has been quite a month for our highly esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia. On January 8, Senator Robert C. Byrd observed the 50th anniversary of the day he entered public service as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. 
To commemorate this significant event, Senator Byrd returned to the West Virginia State capitol on January 11 to join hundreds of grateful West Virginians and other friends in the unveiling of a bronze statue. 
This likeness of Senator Byrd, prominently placed in the capitol's rotunda, will serve to remind future generations of his service to his State and to his country. 
Just 2 days after the Charleston, WV, ceremony, Robert Byrd achieved another major distinction. On January 13, 1997, he became the fourth longest serving U.S. Senator in the history of our republic, with a service record of 38 years and 10 days. 
Think of it, Mr. President. Of the 1,843 past and present senators, only three have served longer than Robert C. Byrd. In another 3 years, Senator Byrd will exceed the 41-year service record of my immediate predecessor from Mississippi, John C. Stennis. 
After that, Senator Byrd's only challengers will be the current record holder, Carl Hayden of Arizona--41 years and 10 months, and the current second longest serving member, our highly regarded colleague from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. 
I shall have more to say about Senator Thurmond in May of this year, when he breaks Senator Hayden's record. 
Each of us in this body, from the most junior to the most seasoned, would do well to pay close attention to Robert C. Byrd--a man of great historical knowledge. When Robert C. Byrd speaks about the role of the Senate in American Government, he deserves our most careful attention. 
On behalf of all Senators, I commend Senator Byrd for his long service to our country.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the resolution directs the Senate legal counsel to appear as amicus curiae, as friend of the court, in the name of the Senate in a case pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and ask for its immediate consideration. 
Mr. President, on April 9, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the Line Item Veto Act. This act was the product of years of legislative consideration and much protracted debate. 
Beginning January 1 of this year and through the year 2004, the Line Item Veto Act provides the President with the authority, under a set of carefully circumscribed limitations, to cancel particular items of appropriation, direct spending or limited tax benefit in any bill. 
The President must report any such cancellation to Congress by special message within 5 days after his approval of the bill containing such spending or tax provisions. Congress then has the opportunity to decide whether to pass a law disapproving the President's cancellation and mandating the spending or tax benefit. 
As I have stated, this Act was passed after much consideration and debate understanding the potential Constitutional implications. In the end, Congress determined to empower the President in this manner in recognition of the fact that strong tools are necessary if we are to achieve our goal of finally getting the Federal budget in balance. 
Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and three other of our colleagues, the former senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, joined by two Members of the House of Representatives, have filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of the act. They assert in their lawsuit that the act violates the lawmaking provisions of article I of the Constitution by authorizing the President to nullify the effect of portions of recently enacted laws. 
The lawsuit at issue was commenced pursuant to a special judicial review provision, section 3 of the act, authorizing the filing of an action by any Member of Congress to seek declaratory or injunctive relief on the ground that the act violates the Constitution. 
This judicial review provision also gives each House of Congress the right to intervene in the suit in defense of the act. Further, the law provides for direct appeal from any decision of the district court to the Supreme Court and requires both courts to expedite their handling of the action. 
The Department of Justice will represent the defendants in the lawsuit, namely the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury. As such, there appears to be no need for the Senate to intervene formally in the suit as a party defendant. 
Nonetheless, title VII of the Ethics in Government Act authorizes the Senate to appear as amicus curiae, or friend of the court, in this or any such legal action in which the powers and responsibilities of the Congress under the Constitution are placed in issue. 
Mr. President, appearance as amicus curiae in this lawsuit would enable the Senate to present to the court its reasons for enacting the Line Item Veto Act and the basis for its position that the law is consistent with the Constitution. 
This resolution I offer today will authorize the Senate legal counsel to appear in this case in the name of the Senate as amicus curiae to support the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. 
The Senate, through the Senate legal counsel, would not take any position on the other issues, such as those related to the constitutional standing of the plaintiffs in the suit to bring the action, and the timeliness, or ripeness, of the issues before the court, that may be considered by the court in the case as such issues are not covered by the explicit terms of the resolution.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have just one bit of clarification. We had hoped to have a full discussion of support for Senator Cohen on Thursday. But we do have the wake and funeral of our former colleague, Senator Tsongas. We are trying to accommodate Senators who need to leave this afternoon to go up to Massachusetts for the wake and for other commitments that were made tonight. We needed to go ahead and get this done today because Senators would not get back until late tomorrow afternoon. I apologize to Senators who may not have as much time as they wanted. I encourage those Senators to stay after the vote to speak on this, if they wish. 
So for the information of all Senators, another vote is expected on the confirmation of our former colleague, Senator Cohen, at approximately 3:25 p.m. today. 
Following that confirmation vote, there will be an additional period for morning business in which to introduce bills and make statements. However, there will be no further rollcall votes today. The next opportunity the Senate will have for votes, at this point, looks like Tuesday of next week. But we will further confirm that when we do our closing statement later today. 
I yield the floor.

We will continue to work on our nominations that we receive from the President in an expeditious manner. I am sure there will be some that will take a little longer.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just briefly make some comments here about our good friend, the Senator from Maine, Bill Cohen, I know the Presiding Officer feels this way very, very strongly, and I know she is very proud of his confirmation. 
I must say that over the course of my tenure in the Congress I have often been very honored to know Secretaries of Defense. We have had some great ones. Still today I consider many of them personal friends but I have never known one that I have been more proud of than I am today of William Cohen in this new position. 
Bill Cohen and I came to Congress together at the same time in 1973. We served in the House together. We served in the Senate together. We didn't always agree. In fact, we fought or disagreed pretty strongly the first couple of years we were in Congress, and it took years to get over that disagreement. But over that period of time in the House and Senate we became close friends, and I grew to admire him and sought out his advice and counsel which I found always very good even when he didn't agree sometimes with what I was trying to do. He gave me advice and help that was invaluable. I will also be thankful for that. 
We have much in common. We both represent small coastal States which face similar challenges and interests. 
He has truly become a great friend to me and to our people in my own home State. He has my respect and my unqualified support as the next Secretary of Defense. 
I think also we should take note of the fact that this was a grand gesture by the President. The President indicated that he wanted to have a look at some Republicans for his Cabinet. I was not sure he would do it. I know he considered several. But certainly he made a wise pick here, and it did not go unnoticed by the Republicans that he made this decision. I hope he will take the advice of his new Secretary of Defense. I think he will find it interesting and on occasion challenging and sometimes advice that he will not find easy to accept. But it will be invariably good advice. 
Bill Cohen will have his hands full as the new Secretary of Defense. Perhaps the largest challenge of his illustrious career I think now looms before him. I think it is to his credit that he was willing to step aside from his goal of moving into the private sector to come back and to go into this very important, very difficult position. 
I have become, in the last few months, increasingly concerned--actually, it has been moving in this direction for a number of years, but I am really to the point of being alarmed about what I see happening with our military, our military leadership in the Pentagon, and what we have been doing to the defense budget of our country. And so we are now reaching the point where we are, I think, developing serious problems in O&M and procurement, and so Senator Cohen is going to have a tremendous job in righting this military monolith that has now reached the point where it has problems and will have growing problems in the future. 
I know Bill Cohen has expressed those concerns as a member, a very distinguished senior member, of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Now he will be in a position to help really do something about that. 
Over the last 2 1/2 years, I must say that I think Bill Perry has performed admirably in a very difficult environment. He has often been dealt a weak hand both by insufficient funds to do the job and multiple demands that had to be fulfilled with those limited funds. But he has performed always masterfully, with intellect and integrity, and I think he has artfully managed the Pentagon at a very difficult time. So as he departs, Secretary Perry should be recognized for the fine job he did, and he truly has the gratitude of the Senate and I believe all Americans for his service to the Department of Defense. 
As majority leader and as a long-time supporter of a strong national defense, I look forward to working with Bill Cohen as our new Secretary. Many people have voiced surprise that the President would make this decision, but I was not surprised. I knew that once he talked to Bill Cohen, he would have to be impressed, and in fact he was. He recognized him as an expert in defense and security policy. He is bright and capable. He will make an exceptional Secretary of Defense, and I am very proud of his confirmation today. 
I yield the floor, Madam President.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are prepared to complete the debate on the nominee to be Secretary of State. 
I commend the committee members for the way they have handled this matter. Obviously, it was expeditious and a very pleasant experience. I thank the chairman for the way he has handled it. If he says the nominee is OK, that is very powerful in this institution. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his efforts also. 
Mr. President, today is a historic day for the Senate, for the Department of State, and for the United States. Today, we will confirm America's 63d Secretary of State. Madeline Albright will be the first woman to hold our country's highest diplomatic post. 
Most of our Members are aware of Ambassador Albright' compelling personal history. As a child, she was forced to flee her native Czechoslovakia from the century's two great tyrannies: Nazi Germany and Soviet Communism. First-hand, she learned that freedom is not free, and that resistance to aggression is imperative. 
Ambassador Albright is an American by choice. She has served her adopted land with distinction--at the National Security Council in the Carter administration, in politics and in the academic world, and most recently as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. 
When I met with Ambassador Albright last week, we had a good discussion about a range of issues. I expressed my concern over the gradual decline of the role of Congress in foreign policy--at least that is the way Congress is sometimes treated by administrations--a trend that is not in keeping with my reading of what the framers of the Constitution intended. 
Ambassador Albright told me she taught a course on `Congress and Foreign Policy' and that she very much understands and respects the role of the Congress in our power of the purse, our sole power to declare war, and the Senate's co-equal role in treaty making. 
As secretary of State, Ambassador Albright will face many difficult issues. Perhaps her greatest challenge will be articulating a vision of America's role in the post-cold-war era--a vision that is readily understood and supported by the American people and their elected representatives. 
Our leadership role in the world depends on the power of our ideals and the purpose to defend our interests. And it depends on the support of our citizens for a leadership role. I believe the American people know America must remain engaged in the world, and that they will be willing to support our engagement because it is ultimately to the benefit of each and every American. 
In just the coming months, Ambassador Albright will have a very full agenda--on Capitol Hill and around the world. There are continued concerns about Russia's future, the threats posed by rogue regimes from Iran and Iraq to Libya and North Korea, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, international crime, and narcotics trafficking, the United States relationship with Asia's emerging giant--China, pursuit of a lasting and secure peace in the Middle East, and serious attention to the problems and potential of our own hemisphere. 
Each of these will demand a very experienced and committed Secretary of State. The Ambassador's skills and wisdom will be challenged every day. 
Secretary Albright, assuming she is going to be confirmed here momentarily, will also need to spend much more time with the Congress. We have pledged to do what we can to move America ahead in a nonpartisan or bipartisan fashion. We will try to work together on arms control issues. We expect the administration to respect the Senate's role in providing advice and consent to the significant modifications they propose to the 1972 ABM Treaty. 
The administration has tried to make a case for more money for the United Nations and for international affairs spending in general. I do not believe in measuring American leadership by how many taxpayer dollars we send to the United Nations or to AID contractors--especially when our defense and intelligence capabilities have felt the impact of far more severe budget limitations. 
We are also awaiting the administration's request for funding their decision to extend the American troop presence despite the promise of a 1-year only deployment in Bosnia. On all budget issues, we will try to work together on funding the administration's priorities and our priorities in a manner consistent with the move toward a balanced budget. 
I expect to work closely with Secretary Albright to prepare the Senate and the American people for the historic expansion of the most successful alliance in history--NATO. We will work to support the historic progress toward peace in the Middle East, made possible because the enemies of Israel know that American support for our democratic ally is unswerving. 
Today, with what I expect will be an overwhelming vote, the Senate will confirm Madeline Albright as Secretary of State. The confirmation process moved rapidly and cooperatively, and I think it is indicative of what we can do in the months and years ahead. 
I want to offer my congratulations to Secretary-to-be Albright, her family and her friends on this historic occasion. I believe President Clinton made a sound choice, and I believe Secretary Albright will serve America honorably. 
With that, Mr. President, I have been asked to yield back time on both sides. I believe we are prepared to vote.

Mr. LOTT. The 104th Congress was unable to reach a consensus on legislation to implement an OECD Shipbuilding Agreement. Opponents of the agreement, as negotiated, insisted that the amendments passed by the House of Representatives be incorporated into any implementing legislation. Supporters of the agreement found these amendments unacceptable. As a result, no legislation was passed to put the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement into effect. 
If the outcome is to be any different in the 105th Congress, I would urge the Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to fully consider the amendments to H.R. 2754 passed by the House last year. Those amendments, which were sponsored by the House National Security Committee, were in response to major concerns regarding this agreement's damaging impact on our national security interests, and on the Navy's core shipbuilding industrial base. While preserving the underlying intent of the OECD agreement, the amendments adopted by the House provide some modest safeguards with respect to these national security concerns.

Mr. LOTT. In order to put into perspective the concerns of the U.S. shipbuilding industry, it may be helpful to review some of the background leading up to this agreement. In 1981, the U.S. Government terminated its subsidy program to the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Thus, in 1989, the United States went to the negotiating table as the only nonsubsidizing shipbuilding country. The U.S. shipbuilding industry had already lost all of its commercial shipbuilding market share and was bracing itself for a dramatic decrease in Navy shipbuilding orders.

Mr. LOTT. This modest loan guarantee program has begun the revival of commercial shipbuilding in the United States. For the first time in almost 40 years, our major U.S. shipbuilders are building commercial ships for export. Environmentally safe oceangoing double-hulled oil tankers are being constructed for our domestic trades. Over a 2-year period, $1.7 billion in commercial shipbuilding orders has been generated in the United States. These commercial orders are helping to sustain our major builders of Navy ships.

Mr. LOTT. As negotiations dragged on for over 5 years, the marketplace was changing dramatically and rapidly, while the objective of the negotiators seemed to remain static. There was a failure on the part of our negotiators to recognize these changes and the activities of the various participating parties during the negotiations. 
China, which had no commercial shipbuilding market in 1990, began to target shipbuilding to industrialize its economy. China now ranks third in the world for commercial shipbuilding, and it is not a signatory to this agreement. Other countries, such as the Ukraine and Poland, are also not covered by this agreement and have displayed a renewed interest in their shipbuilding sectors.

Mr. LOTT. When an agreement was finally reached in 1994, major U.S. shipbuilders expressed their objections with the terms of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement before it was signed by the U.S. and other parties. These builders articulated to the Administration their concerns with the very generous transition concessions granted to the foreign signatories, the changing market conditions with the growing prominence of China, and the ineffective `injurious pricing' or anti-dumping provision--especially in light of South Korea's massive expansion of its shipbuilding capacity throughout the negotiations.

Mr. LOTT. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has maintained throughout the debate on this agreement that the Jones Act, which requires ships transporting cargo between two U.S. ports to be U.S.-built, -owned, and -operated, is exempt from the agreement. This is only partially true. Although the agreement does not repeal the law, it establishes a framework and procedure for foreign governments to take retaliatory actions against U.S. shipbuilders and U.S. exporters for ships constructed for the domestic trades of the United States. These countermeasures include bid restrictions and bid tariffs against U.S. builders seeking international orders if they also benefit from Jones Act orders. The agreement also provides that GATT-related tariff concessions may be withdrawn against other U.S. products to offset the benefit of Jones Act ship construction contracts to U.S. builders. Moreover, the agreement states that the Jones Act is a derogation of the agreement--and I quote--`could undermine the balance of rights and obligations of the Parties under the Agreement and is unacceptable to the other Parties.'

Mr. LOTT. The House also adopted an amendment defining and exempting `military reserve vessels' from coverage under the agreement. This provision is essential to ensure that military ships--such as Army, Navy, and Marine Corps surge and prepositioned sealift ships--cannot be deemed commercial ships under the agreement because of their dual-use characteristics and capability. Without this exemption, DOD may be precluded from procuring military reserve and auxiliary ships with defense features from U.S. shipbuilders without the threat of retaliatory trade countermeasures.

Mr. LOTT. As I mentioned earlier, the only government support program for U.S. shipbuilders is the Title XI Ship Loan Guarantee Program. The program was revived and amended in FY 1994 as part of the National Shipbuilding Initiative contained in the National Defense Authorization Act. The purpose of the program was to help U.S. shipbuilders attract commercial shipbuilding orders in the face of a dramatic turndown in Navy orders and foreign government commercial shipbuilding subsidies.

Mr. LOTT. Almost every signatory to this agreement--except the United States--was granted special transition subsidy authority for a period of 3 years. Many members of the House of Representatives and Senate do not understand why the title XI program should not continue under its current terms and conditions for a 3-year period given the agreements's special deals, exemptions, and transition programs in the billions of dollars for Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Germany, France and South Korea. This inequity in the transition rules is extremely detrimental to U.S. builders were disadvantaged for 15 years while they received no government subsidies in the face of billions by foreign governments. Moreover, without a 3-year continuance of title XI, U.S. shipbuilders would be three years further behind their foreign competition. This is unacceptable to the majority in Congress.

Mr. LOTT. In closing, it is incumbent upon each Congress to ensure that our international trade agreements are in our best national interest. Rubber stamping every international agreement, regardless of its content or impact, is not in anyone's best interest. I understand that the office of the U.S. Trade Representative has invested years of hard work in reaching the OECD Agreement. Unfortunately, it falls abysmally short of the objectives established by the very industry which sought an international agreement. After all, who better understands the shipbuilding industry than the shipbuilding industry itself? And for that matter, who in Congress better understand our national security interests that the committees with jurisdiction over national security policy? 
There are major disagreements in Congress on whether this agreement is good or bad for this country. Indications from the Office of the USTR are that it is unwilling to reopen the negotiations to achieve an agreement that addresses the concerns of the majority in Congress of both political parties. If this is the position of the U.S. Trade Representative, then I can only say that pursuing implementing legislation in the 105th Congress will result in the same outcome as that of the 104th Congress. I would hope that the USTR would have learned something from last year's experience and not waste its time or our with a repeat performance.

I anticipate that many of our colleagues will be making statements during the morning business period. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. It is my hope that during tomorrow's session the Senate will be able to consider the Executive nomination of Madeleine Albright to be the Secretary of State, and I anticipate a rollcall vote on Wednesday on the confirmation of that nomination. 
I also announce to my colleagues that all Members will be notified as soon as the schedule is finalized with regard to a memorial service on Thursday in Lowell, MA, for our former colleague, Senator Paul Tsongas. 
Again, I note as we come out of our policy luncheons, Senator Daschle and I will be introducing bills. I will introduce the first 10 bills on behalf of the Senate Republican majority, and Senator Daschle will introduce the next 10 bills. We will be hearing during the remainder of the day from the leading sponsors of those bills and others who will be introducing bills and want to make statements. We will go, I am sure, a while into the afternoon. It is hoped we will not begin this session by going late into the night on a Tuesday. We would like to quit at a reasonable hour, for all concerned.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we have the opportunity here today to get off to a good start, a fast start. It is one about which we have communicated with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We have increased the number of bills that we officially introduce at the start of the session from what has in the past been only 5 to 10, and therefore the Republicans will today introduce our first numbered 10 bills as well as Senate Joint Resolution 1, which will be the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. And then the Democratic leader, on behalf of the Democrats, will introduce their first 10 bills, and then others can come in and offer bills as they see fit. The principal sponsors will come to the floor this afternoon in the hour we have designated to offer the bills and to make comments. Frankly, I see some overlap between our list of 10 bills and the Democrats' list of 10 bills. I think that is positive. 
So we want to go ahead and get started with this. We are going to move forward aggressively wherever we can to handle the President's nominations to his Cabinet. We hope to confirm within the next 2 days his first two nominees, to be Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. We hope in the 2 weeks after that to move right along with other nominees. So we are trying hard to work with the administration and set up an atmosphere that will allow us this year to pass some good legislation for the best interests of the American people, but the President, we think, deserves his Cabinet in place so that he can have people there to work with us. 
One of the glories of the Senate is that it runs as much by tradition and custom as it does by written rules, and so one of those customs we are carrying out today is introducing these first few bills that will lay out our agenda for the rest of the year. 
So it is my honor to present to the Senate and to the Nation 11 major pieces of legislation, 10 bills and 1 resolution, that we will offer today. Each of them can stand on its own as an important initiative dealing with matters that touch the lives of most Americans. Together, however, they form a blueprint for the visionary changes our country needs. I might even call them the user's manual for a better, safer and more prosperous America. These bills represent the consensus of the 55 Republican Members of the Senate. 
We did have a unique opportunity to sit together for 12 hours the week before last to talk through what we want to do in this session of Congress and what specific bills we wanted to take up. It does not mean that every Republican Senator subscribes to every part of this package. To the contrary, it is likely that every Republican Senator, this one included, will disagree with some provision or another in one bill or another. But as befits the party of the open door, we have had quite a lot of give-and-take in putting this package together, and, as always, our individual Members make their own decisions about what they will endorse. But each of these bills commands overwhelming support on the Republican side of the aisle, and I want to commend not just the lead sponsors of these bills but all the Senators and staff who worked together over the past few weeks to reach the agreement and get these bills actually drafted and ready for presentation. I am going to leave it to the primary sponsors and others who have worked on the various pieces of legislation to give the details. 
So I am going to summarize in this time that I have today what is in this platform. 
Pride of place goes to Senate Joint Resolution 1, as I already pointed out, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which will be introduced today by Senator Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and by Senator Craig of Idaho. 
This one, obviously, needs no explaining. There may be still, somewhere in the hinterlands of America, a citizen who does not understand why a balanced budget amendment is desperately needed, but I doubt it. The American people keenly realize the problems caused by excessive Federal spending, and everywhere I have gone, every poll that I have seen indicates the American people support this initiative overwhelmingly. 
I have tried to understand the arguments against a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, but to no avail, quite frankly. We have not had a balanced budget in the Federal Government in 28 years, and it will probably be at least 4 more years before we get one, if then. I have watched good men and women, including Presidents, make commitments and actually have plans to get to a balanced budget, but it has not worked. 
This year, I think we have an opportunity to work with the President to come to a balanced budget agreement. We will see his budget plan February 6. I hope he will show leadership and courage and will address some of the issues that need to be addressed that, frankly, he was not willing to deal with last year. But it was an election year, and, hopefully, he will approach it differently this time. 
But even if we come together on a plan to get a balanced budget by 2002, I still have my doubts about whether it will actually happen if we do not have the leverage guarantee of a constitutional amendment. Remember, when we pass this constitutional amendment, it then does not go to the President for his signature, it goes to the State legislatures, to the people for their ratification. 
Recent news accounts seem to indicate the administration will fight this amendment and will do it aggressively. I understand they may have some questions or objections. I expect them to make those, and we will listen to them. But this fight is not about politics, it is about the future of our children and grandchildren. It is about the burden of debt we are leaving them with, which is a cruel legacy. It is about right and wrong, and this time around, I am betting that right is going to prevail. 
Because of the importance we attach to education, one of the first bills we will introduce today will deal with this area. Just like the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget is important to us because of what we think it means to our children's future in holding down inflation and holding down interest rates and stopping the continuous increase in the interest we pay on the national debt that will lead to making it more difficult for our children and grandchildren to have home mortgages and student loans and car loans, we think that education, also, is a very high priority and also an investment in the future of our country. 
If we have a strong educational system, if we deal with the illiteracy problems, if we deal with the needs of children with special needs, it will contribute to a better America, better educated children, will lead to more production, better jobs, more jobs, more trade, more development in technology. 
So Republicans are placing a high priority this year on 
education with S. 1. The first numbered bill will be the Safe and Affordable Schools Act. It will be introduced by Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, and it is a comprehensive agenda for dramatic change. It will help not only parents--and that is where it begins, in the home with the parents--but also the States and the local communities to give their children a better education. 
It focuses, especially, on children attending unsafe schools, to give their families consumer rights and choice in education. In this regard, it builds on the good work that was done in the 104th Congress by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, who is now presiding in the Chamber. He has done a lot of great work in behalf of youngsters, and that work is confirmed in this piece of legislation. 
In higher education, S. 1 establishes what we call the Bob Dole Investment Accounts to help parents set aside the resources on their own needed for their children's tuition. 
Toward the same goal, it makes the interest on student loans tax deductible, and it gives favorable tax treatment to State prepaid tuition plans, to education aid provided by an employer to encourage more employers to provide that assistance to their workers which would benefit their children, and to student work-study awards.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, it is my pleasure to introduce the Merchant Mariners Fairness Act. My bill would grant veterans status to American merchant mariners who have been denied this status. 
In 1988, the Secretary of the Air Force decided, for the purposes of granting veterans benefits to merchant seamen, that the cut-off date for service would be August 15, 1945, V-J Day, rather than December 31, 1946, when hostilities were declared officially ended. My bill would correct the 1988 decision and extend veterans benefits to merchant mariners who served from August 15, 1945 to December 31, 1946. It would extend eligibility for burial benefits and related veterans benefits for certain members of the U.S. Merchant Marine during World War II. 
I urge my distinguished colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

I wish everyone a restful upcoming week and look forward to the 21st when we will begin the work of the 105th Congress. We will look forward to hearing the President's State of the Union Address and receiving his budget submission, I believe, on February 6.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I announce to my colleagues that one of the resolutions just adopted relates to necessary committee ratio changes for the 105th Congress. I note this allows for an increase of one seat on the Intelligence Committee from both sides of the aisle. The Democratic leader and I are allowing for this increase in the size of the Intelligence Committee for this Congress only due to the great interest in serving on this important committee from Members on both sides of the aisle and also because of the seriousness of some of the matters they will be considering and wanting to make sure that we are complying with the statute. 
One of the things we have been trying to do as we started this year is to take a look at what the rules are and what the statutes require and try to comply with that. The statute is clear about wanting to have at least two from the Armed Services Committee, two from the Judiciary Committee, and two from Foreign Relations. I think it is particularly important that we have Members from the Armed Services Committee on Intelligence because so much of what they do has an Armed Services Committee relationship. In fact, the hearings on the funding for that committee, I believe, always have to report to the Armed Services Committee. 
This change in the numbers will be only for this Congress, and then we will work in the next Congress back toward the statutory number of 8-7. We may want to come down maybe two steps, 9-8, but we should try to be in compliance with the statutes on the numbers as well as the committee jurisdiction and representation on that committee. 
Again, I state that following this Congress it would be our intention to reduce the size, but we will do that only in working with the Democratic leader. This is the only committee, also, that only has a one-seat difference, and the statute requires that. All the others have two. 
I wonder if the Democratic leader would like to comment on that?

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, in just a few minutes the Democratic leader and I will be sending to the desk resolutions which make majority and minority party committee seat assignments for the 105th Congress. I want to again thank publicly, for the cooperation that we have received on this matter, both my colleagues within the conference and also Senator Daschle and his colleagues. I think it is not the usual situation that we can file these committee assignments this early in the session. I think it is going to help us facilitate our work early. 
Following the adoption of these resolutions, the Senate will be proceeding to the House of Representatives in order to attend a joint session of Congress for the counting of the electoral college votes. 
Immediately following the conclusion of that joint session, the Senate will adjourn over until Tuesday, January 21. On January 21, the Senate will stand in recess between the hours of 12:30 and 2:15 in order to allow for the weekly party conferences to meet. At 2:15, Tuesday, January 21, Senators may begin to introduce legislation for the 105th Congress. However, no votes are expected to occur during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, January 21, 1997. 
Mr. President, did the Democratic leader have a comment he wanted to make at this point on the committee assignments, or should we proceed with the resolutions? 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the 105th Congress, there be a limitation of 15 minutes each upon any rollcall vote, with the warning signal to be sounded at the midway point, beginning at the last 7 1/2 minutes, and when rollcall votes are of 10-minute duration, the warning signal be sounded at the beginning of the last 7 1/2 minutes. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the Congress, it be in order for the Secretary of the Senate to receive reports at the desk when presented by a Senator at any time during the day of the session of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority and minority leaders may daily have up to 10 minutes each on each calendar day following the prayer and disposition of the reading of, or the approval of, the Journal. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Parliamentarian of the House of Representatives and his three assistants be given the privilege of the floor during the 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXVIII, conference reports and statements accompanying them not be printed as Senate reports when such conference reports and statements have been printed as a House report unless specific request is made in the Senate in each instance to have such a report printed. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Appropriations be authorized during the 105th Congress to file reports during adjournments or recesses of the Senate on appropriation bills, including joint resolutions, together with any accompanying notices of motions to suspend rule XVI, pursuant to rule V, for the purpose of offering certain amendments to such bills or joint resolutions, which proposes amendments shall be printed. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, for the duration of the 105th Congress, the Secretary of the Senate be authorized to make technical and clerical corrections in the engrossments of all Senate-passed bills and resolutions, Senate amendments to House bills and resolutions, Senate amendments to House amendments to Senate bills and resolutions, and Senate amendments to House amendments to Senate amendments to House bills or resolutions. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the 105th Congress, when the Senate is in recess or adjournment, the Secretary of the Senate be authorized to receive messages from the President of the United States, and--with the exception of House bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions--messages from the House of Representatives; and that they be appropriately referred; and that the President of the Senate, the President pro tempore, and the Acting President pro tempore be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills and joint resolutions. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the 105th Congress, Senators be allowed to leave at the desk with the journal clerk the names of two staff members who will be granted the privilege of the floor during the consideration of the specific matter noted, and that the Sergeant at Arms be instructed to rotate such staff members as space allows. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the duration of the 105th Congress, it be in order to refer treaties and nominations on the day when they are received from the President, even when the Senate has no executive session that day.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this unanimous consent request is that the majority and minority leaders may have up to 10 minutes each on each calendar day following the prayer and the disposition of the reading of or the approval of the Journal. It does not indicate any limitation as to what may be done in that 10 minutes. This is the language that has been used traditionally. It was taken from previous opening day unanimous consent requests that are traditionally done en bloc as we have done here today. 
I know of no incident where this has been abused or any series of abuses of this 10-minute time by the leaders, certainly not during my time, and I do not remember it during Senator Dole's time. As far back as I have knowledge, I do not think that has been done. 
I know that the leaders, Senator Daschle and I, will work together very carefully, and we have already indicated to each other we do not intend to pull surprises. And certainly if we were going to make any motion during that 10-minute period, we would have, I believe, an obligation to notify each other of such a plan. 
But I do feel that it is not limited to just debate only. I would like to have the opportunity before we limit it in any way to go back and look carefully at what the precedents have been and how it has been dealt with in the past, and make sure we understand what we could or could not do. We are in no way enlarging upon what has been done in the past. Once again, in all due diligence and caution, I would want to make sure we are not giving up a right that in fact the leaders may need in the future.

Mr. LOTT. I think that, once again, as we try very hard to make sure we preserve the decorum we should have in this Chamber and we have kind of gotten away from--the Senator from West Virginia has noted that fact to me, and I have heard him--we are going to try some things to effect that in fact and in appearance also. We have had a situation where maybe too many staff members are getting in the Chamber and blocking passages. We are going to try to address that. 
Also, if we are going to be able to work together in a cordial and civil manner, it is going to be important we be honest with each other and fair and we notify each other when we are fixing to take action and we not have surprises. 
That is the way I intend to proceed. I am sure we will have some bumps along the road. The Senate is an island of tranquility in many respects in this city. We have heavy responsibilities on which we need to act, and it is going to take give-and-take, cooperation, and I am absolutely committed to that approach. That will be the way I will proceed with regard to this 10 minutes and everything else that I try to do.

Mr. LOTT. I thank again the Senator from West Virginia for his comments. I am pleased that he noted this unanimous-consent agreement. The Sergeant at Arms is on the floor. We have discussed this matter, and we are undertaking procedures to set up this rotation of staff members. We are making sure that Senators are informed of that. We will remind Senators, probably on the 21st, of a number of these types of things so that they will not be surprised, and call on Members on both sides for their cooperation and courtesy. In fact, at the concluding part of our unanimous consent request today I will make a few comments about how we are going to try to reestablish some of the proper procedures, respect for each other's needs as Senators, and call on our Senators to be aware of that and to assist us as we try to do that. So we are not going to forget and, while we are not going to be dictatorial about it, we are going to try our very best to ask our Senators to recognize this is in the best interests of the institution and will allow us to do our work in a more efficient and effective way, I do believe.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, originally I had thought that at this point the Senate would grant a unanimous consent that would in effect make null and void the precedent set in March of 1995 with respect to legislation on an appropriations bill. Having spoken with the Democratic leader, we both feel, now, that the Senate would be better served by conducting a rollcall vote that would overturn the precedent. 
Needless to say, this vote would occur at the first opportunity the Senate has during the appropriations process this year, at least we think that would be the appropriate time for it to occur. The Democratic leader has indicated to me that he would support such an action in the early summer of this year as we begin the appropriations process, and I look forward to his cooperation at that time, when we have the vote which would reinstate the point of order with respect to legislation on an appropriations bill. 
I believe, and I think the Democratic leader would agree, that the process has been abused in recent months. There seems to be a growing use of this opportunity, and, in some of the discussions that we had at the end of the session last year, I believe that point was made by the Senator from South Dakota and perhaps the Senator from West Virginia. I think it was an unintentioned precedent that was set. I do not think it is in the best interests or the long-term interests of the Senate. I would like for us to preserve rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate. I think the Senate would be better served if we would do that, preserve that rule. So we will look for the opportunity, the best opportunity we can find, to consider changing back that precedent.

Mr. LOTT. This now establishes Tuesday, January 21, as the first day in which Members may introduce legislation. I will inform my colleagues that Members may make statements during the next day or two regarding any proposed legislation, however all Senators must wait until January 21 to formally introduce such legislation. 
I might note that we have been working very aggressively to get organized quickly. We agreed early on the committee ratios. I believe both parties now have decided most of their committee membership. The committee chairmen will be elected by their respective committees today, ratified by our conference tomorrow. I assume the same thing will occur or has occurred on the Democratic side. Hopefully, by Thursday we will have available to the Senate the list of all the committee membership and we will be ready for business. 
There are a number of committees that intend to start hearings this week on some issues, as I understand it, like airbags; perhaps some early hearings on confirmations of the President's nominations. Again, next week I understand that there will certainly be hearings on the nominees that the President has submitted to the Senate. We are anxious to cooperate with the President, work expeditiously on these nominations from the Executive Calendar, and the day after inauguration, or certainly that week of the inauguration, we hope to have some of these nominations ready for a vote of the full Senate. I believe the cooperation by the Democratic leader in this effort will allow us to concentrate on that. And then we will have our opportunity to introduce our first bills on the 21st, make our statements, and get going for business. So I appreciate your cooperation, Senator Daschle.

Mr. LOTT. I will say to the distinguished Senator that it is my intent to urge early consideration of the issues that came to the forefront during the campaign and the election last year. I have asked the Governmental Affairs Committee to be the only committee to take a look at some of the alleged violations that occurred--perhaps some illegalities even, in terms of contributions during the campaign--to see if there is anything there that will justify proceeding further. I am not prejudging that at all. 
I also have had an early conversation with the chairman of the Rules Committee and have asked him to have some early hearings--and these are not intended to be dilatory at all--hearings to get into, seriously, what happened, what needs to be done, to see if we can find a way that we can come to an agreement on a bill that can pass the Senate, one that will not be filibustered by the Democrats or by the Republicans. Clearly, we have some disagreements on what the solutions are, but I fear that if we try to put a specific date on it, it will make the likelihood of our success less likely or more difficult. 
I think that the Senate should proceed always with thought and thoroughness and try to see where we can come together. We can establish right here right now what we can't agree on. The question is what can we agree on. So we are intent on working on that. 
The various committees have some things they are going to have to work on. The Rules Committee has an assignment right now that they are going to have to work on. I am going to urge Senator Warner not to let that interfere with getting together in a bipartisan way to see if we can come up with some agreement. 
We have the confirmations which we will be trying to do. We have a lot of things coming to the forefront. I am hoping, for instance, that we can take up and consider the so-called ISTEA bill, the highway bill, before the Easter recess. It is a reauthorization we have to do. It is very important all across this country. I am not saying it is as important or more important than campaign finance reform. I am just saying there is a lot of work we need to do. 
On the 21st, it is my hope and desire, after notification of the Democratic leader, to inform all Senators what the bills are that we hope to deal with before the Easter recess, perhaps on the floor. It will not be all inclusive. 
I will be happy to talk further with the Senator from Minnesota. We are not going to try to shove this aside. I don't think we can. There are too many questions raised by this election. There are too many questions about how contributions are made, who makes them, how much they can make. I don't think we have all the answers yet, though, and to say we are going to do it in a 100-day demarcation--I have not even had a chance to look at the calendar and see what that means. It might be during the middle of the period that we said we would be out for the Easter recess. 
I have tried working with Senator Daschle to tell Members more this year than has usually been the case what they can expect or anticipate in terms of being out. I would like, at least, to have us sit down and look at the calendar and see what this means and how it affects other things, such as budget negotiations, the importance of bringing it up before the Easter recess. The law requires we act before April 15 on the budget resolution. Why don't we try to do it before April 15 and comply with the law? In order to do that, and the way that time falls, there is only 1 week after the Easter recess before the 15th. 
I am hoping we will do--the House and Senate working with the administration--the budget resolution before the Easter recess so we can come back and get the final agreement on the conference report. 
That is why I ask the Senator, if he will, to give us the opportunity to show our good faith to work seriously on this matter, but without any arbitrary deadline before we even have a 
chance to sit down and see what it means on the calendar. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just a bit of history, as I recall it. Of course, we have passed campaign finance reform bills in the past. I voted for the one that is in law now. I believe, in more recent history, there have been occasions when maybe--I know the Senate passed a bill one year. I think it wound up languishing in the House. And then the reverse, I think, has happened. I really believe from my time in watching the Senate that some time is your ally, giving things an opportunity to be carefully considered and percolate along a little bit. 
Last year a lot of people talked about how we were able to get a lot of legislation passed at the end of the session. One of the reasons is a lot of those bills had been in the mill for months, some of them 2 years, some of them 10 years. But they finally were ready, and they, in most instances, had broad support. So there is a history of our making a run at it. We make a stand, we make a statement; we get nothing. Are we interested in making a statement about our concern, or are we interested in getting something done? I think the latter is the case. 
When you talk about 4 months, for instance, are you talking about April? Once again, if you are--January, February, March, April--you are not talking about much difference from the first request. When you add again, when you look at the budget issue, when you look at the potential for when we deal with the Chemical Weapons Treaty, if we do come to that agreement, that understanding, I believe there is a significance to April 15 for that. 
I just again implore my colleague from Minnesota not to try to set a specific date. This is not going to be your last opportunity. This is only your first opportunity. You will have an opportunity to witness our conduct and judge whether or not it is being seriously discussed. There are a lot of people with a lot of different interests here that Senators have who have worked on it in the past, like Senator Feingold or Senator McCain and Senator McConnell, and others who feel more concerned about it this year than they did even a year ago. 
I have talked with a lot of Senators already and outside groups that are concerned in all kinds of ways about how we do this. We are not ignoring it at all. You are working on it. We are working on it. We are already making progress. You have a bill that perhaps is the same bill, perhaps with some modification, as the bill last year sponsored by Senators Feingold, McCain and others. But let us get started. Let us see how we do. And the Senator can witness our advent.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the objection is heard, I would like to make one additional point. 
If the Senator objects, then we will have to put in a quorum and go with another alternative, which would be to basically have to recess over until every 3 days and the House and the Senate then will have to make arrangements to come in every third day, to call our staff to be here, and to go through the costs of doing that. I just do not think that is the way we want to begin the year, going through an exercise that is not necessary, that does cost time and money, without accomplishing anything. 
I again implore the Senator to think about what we have had to say, and I ask him not to object at this point on our opening day. This is just the kickoff. Let us not fumble on the first play and look at the alternative. 
The alternative, if the Senator objects--we are not going to get a recorded vote on it. We are going to go to another alternative, which will lead to inconvenience and costs without any positive results. I hope the Senator will also factor that into his feelings. The Senator has not, and I have not, allowed this to become acrimonious or partisan. I do not want it to be. But the Senator would leave us no option at this point on our first day but to consider another route. 
So I remind the Senator one more time, too, that last year there were enough different times that I made some commitments to him that were not necessarily well received on my side. But we kept our word. We got the job done. I may not be able to do just that same sort of thing this time. But I hope that the majority leader's assurances on opening day, based on my relatively short time but the record that I have, would have weight with the Senator from Minnesota. We are asking the Senator, both of us, the leaders, to give us this opportunity to show our good intentions. Then if the Senator is not satisfied with it, come back again.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to heartily endorse this resolution. I thank the people of West Virginia for electing Senator Robert C. Byrd to these many offices, both in West Virginia and here in the U.S. Senate. He is truly a monumental Senator in terms of importance and perspective in the history of the Senate. I sat here in my chair a month ago and listened to Senator Byrd speak to the new Senators about this institution, about its history and the importance of it and the significance that it has played in the role of this country. It was extremely interesting and, also, in some respects, intimidating because he made us aware of what an awesome responsibility we have here in the U.S. Senate. I enjoyed it thoroughly. 
I appreciate his friendship. I have found that he is one that you can go to for counsel and for advice. Even sometimes when he does not agree with what you are trying to do, he will give you a straight answer as to what you could do under the rules. He has a lighter side you don't always see here, but we know he has been seen playing a little fiddle and talking about Billy Byrd, his dog. He is quite a Senator. We appreciate so much his contribution to this institution. I am delighted that we are doing this resolution recognizing his 50 years of outstanding service to West Virginia and the United States.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is customary on this opening day of Congress to lay out the highlights of the legislative schedule ahead of us and discuss whatever procedural problems or changes might be in the offing. 
First of all, I am not going to give today a finite list, or a list that we will have on the agenda that we will try to complete before the Easter recess, but I will do that on the 21st. I do want to mention some of the bills that I think have a high priority that we will be taking up early on in this session. 
It is no great secret that I would like to make the schedule of the Senate more predictable. I think that will help us all do a better job. One of the things that I could not understand when I first came to the Senate was the inability to make any kind of plans as to when we would begin; when would we end; could I get home for supper with my family; would I be able to go back to my State and be with my constituents. The uncertainty is killing in many respects, and so I am going to work very hard as majority leader this year to try to give some greater degree of predictability. I will not always be able to do it, but I will work with the minority leader as he leads the Democrats to try to make that information available as to when we will come in. We will try not to go late every night. 
We will try not to go late every night. In fact, my hope is we will finish up at a very reasonable hour, hopefully 6 o'clock every week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We may have to go late to some extent on Thursday. We will need to be in on some Fridays and some Mondays, but I will try my best, again cooperating with the Members of the other side of the aisle and their leadership, to make that information known to the Members as early as possible so they can make some plans as to when they can be with their families or be with their constituents. 
As a first step in that effort, last month I provided the Democratic leader and to all the Members on the Republican side of the aisle and to the Democratic Members, a calendar outlining the recess periods for the first session of the 105th Congress. I strongly intend to follow that calendar. But, obviously, any Senator who tries to delay our session or cause us problems can mess up those good intentions. But, barring emergencies, there is no reason why the Senate should not be able to function with a high degree of predictability about the timetable. That will require cooperation from our colleagues all throughout the year, as we get ready to have the President's Day recess period, or as we go to the Easter period, or even later on in the year. 
With that in mind, I want to mention, in a general way, several matters I hope the Senate will be able to consider prior to the scheduled Easter recess. It is not inclusive, and it may not be that we will be able to get to these issues. It will depend on conversations on both sides of the aisle, communication with the leadership on both sides, meetings with the chairmen, and it will also depend on the ability of committees to act. I will be more specific later on this month, as I indicated. 
By early February, the President should have submitted to us a detailed budget for fiscal year 1998. How that will take shape--and what degree of cooperation might be involved there--remains to be seen. But, one way or the other, the Senate will have to consider a budget for the year ahead. I hope that we will come to an agreement on balanced budget over a period of years. It will take a lot of effort, but a lot of progress, I believe, was made last year and the gap between the Congress and the President was closed perceptibly over those past months there, the last months of 1995 and early 1996. We ought to pick up where that ended and see if we cannot come to an agreement that would lead us to a balanced budget over a period of years. Needless to say, that budget is going to be one that will be negotiated between the parties in the House and the Senate, and with the President. 
Toward the same goal the Senate should, I believe, in due course, consider, again, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I know there are those who do not agree with that here in the Senate and they will certainly have ample opportunity to be heard and make their case. But I have noticed that good intentions do not accomplish the job. Even a plan to get us to a balanced budget does not always get us there, and we have not had a balanced budget now in some, I guess, 28 years or so; 1969 was the last balanced budget. So it looks like it will have been 30 years that we will have gone as a Federal Government without a balanced budget. I think the plan is not enough. I think that the constitutional amendment will add a great deal of weight to that desire and, in fact, require us to have a balanced budget. 
The Senate will, also in due course, consider the numerous nominations in the executive branch as the President restructures his administration for a second term. It is my intention to deal with those nominations expeditiously and fairly. I think the President is entitled to make his selections for Cabinet Secretaries and other administration positions and expect them to be considered early and in a fair manner by the Senate. We will do that. As I indicated earlier, we will begin hearings, either this week or certainly next week, and we hope to begin to have votes on those the week of January the 20th and 21st, right after the inauguration. Some of them may have some difficulty, may take more time, but, we are going to move forward as rapidly as we can. 
On both sides of the aisle there is considerable interest in taking up some of the reauthorizations that come due this year. These should not be diminished. They are very important. Certainly one of those is the ISTEA or Inter-service Transportation Efficiency Act; that is the highway bill. This legislation is as complicated as it is important. It will not be partisan. It will not be regional. It will not even be philosophical. It will vary from State to State. Sometimes you have States right next to each other that have different views on how those funds should be distributed between highways or mass transit, and what the formula would be for distribution between the States. I think a lot of work needs to be done, but it is very important. Transportation and infrastructure in America is essential to our economic growth and development, and the free movement of Americans all over this country. I hope we can get this done, out of committee and on the floor of the Senate and completed by the Easter recess. It will take an extraordinary degree of cooperation and consensus, but the only 
way you get that done is to get started. 
Also, in the same area of transportation, there are a number of other proposals we need to consider such as the problems that we are finding with airbags in passenger vehicles. Parents throughout America now are concerned about the safety of their children in their cars. How do we go as long as we have without realizing the danger that they impose? Now it seems like every week we hear of another incident where some child was injured as a result of the airbag. There are, I presume, some solutions. But we need to think about that and work on it. 
We should also address the crisis in American education. I am a product of what I think was a good public education system in America. My mother was a schoolteacher for 11 years. I worked for the University of Mississippi for 3 years, in their placement and financial aid office and in the alumni office. I worked with the student loan programs. I worked with the work-study program. I know the importance of financial aid. I know the importance of good, quality education. 
But over the years, since the 1960's, as we spent more and more money, it seems that the quality of education has continued to go down. You have children in high school who cannot read. You have children who do not have discipline. You have children assaulting teachers. You have drugs in junior high school. I am sure it is even in elementary school. These are major concerns. We may not have the answers in Washington. I think probably the answers really are at the local level. But we need to think about this problem and work with State officials and local officials, administrators, teachers, parents, and children to see if we cannot find some ways to improve education, the accessibility of education in America, the safety of education in America. We cannot tolerate violence and drugs in our public schools, so we need to focus on this issue and we need to do it soon. 
The Senate should affirm as a matter of principle that no child has to attend a school where he or she is in danger of assault or is exposed to narcotics. I therefore hope that we will bring legislation to the Senate soon that gives youngsters and their families the same choice in education that more affluent families enjoy in America. 
The Senate should also consider ways to give families the flexibility they need to balance their responsibilities at home and on the job. Employers and employees should be able to arrange comp time, flex time, and family-wage provisions without interference from Government. The President has indicated that he supports the flextime and the comp time, at least the flextime, and I think we ought to find out exactly what we can do in terms that have flexibility for parents on the job, but work with the employers and employees together to find these solutions. 
By the same token, employees should have the flexibility to work in concert with management for their mutual benefit. They should not be locked into an approach to labor relations that presumes conflict and discourages cooperation. So I hope we will be able to bring the TEAM Act to a vote in the near future. 
Other legislative items that we might be able to work on during the next 2 months should include reauthorization of IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This legislation is a very difficult balancing of conflicting interests. To his great credit, Senator Frist came close to working it out last fall, but, frankly, the clock kind of just ran out and we could not complete the job. This time I am confident that we will bring in more consideration of various views and complete this very important legislation. 
In the area of criminal justice, the Senate should allow the death penalty for drug kingpins. There continue to be tremendous problems in this area and this is one place where we can provide some additional penalties that will hopefully allow us to deal with the drugs that are pushed upon our children. 
For small businesses, we should permit the electronic filing of forms with SBA and other Government agencies. This is the 20th century. It is almost the next millennium. Let us get with modern technology. It saves money, it saves time, and it probably saves jobs, if we will move to this opportunity for small businesses. 
For adoptive families, we should make it easier and more secure for adoption to occur. Senator DeWine and others have been working along those lines. 
Finally, to fulfill a provision of the omnibus appropriations bill of last September, the Senate will vote sometime during the month of February on a Presidential recommendation concerning the AID's population program. This vote is locked in and required by law. 
This is not--again I repeat--not an exclusive list. By the time the Senate settles down to legislative business on January 21st, it is likely to be revised after I have had the benefit of the views of Members on both sides of the aisle and the committee chairmen and committee leaders on both sides. 
We might add other items or delete some I mentioned as being just too time consuming as we try to deal, certainly, with the budget agreement and other issues that are going to be required by law or by their urgency, in terms of possible treaties, as well as confirmations. 
Both the Democratic leader and I are hopeful this can begin a pattern of advance notification of recesses and floor agenda. But we have to stress that its successful implementation will require all Members to act in a cooperative and courteous manner with respect to the needs of all other Members. 
Let me mention one case in point. Members should be aware there is a 15-minute limitation with respect to rollcall votes. Past practice has allowed for an additional 5 minutes, so-called overtime, for Members who are running late. However, the 5-minute overtime soon turns into 7 minutes, 8 minutes, 9 minutes, or even more. The entire Senate repeatedly has been inconvenienced in that way. 
We try to be reasonable: Senators don't hear the bells; sometimes they get caught on the subway; sometimes the elevators are not operating; sometimes for very good and valid reasons they are out in the city or across State lines and they are trying very hard to get back here, and we have had to use some judgment. 
But, as we try to allow that latitude, it continues to grow and expand, and the time to take a vote can easily run up to 30 minutes, and that inconveniences all the other Senators who are here ready to do business and go on to the next amendment or perhaps the next vote. 
So we are going to try very hard to stick with the 15-minute vote with a 5-minute overtime. Once again, the leaders will have to be willing sometimes to say, `We have to cut this vote off.' I have had to do that when it has involved Senators on this side of the aisle, as well as the other side. I think maybe if we make it clear we mean business a couple of times, Senators will be more inclined to come over and vote when the time begins and within the allotted time. But, again, we will use discretion wherever it is really necessary. 
I hope we can continue to provide all Senators advance information about scheduling, especially such matters as evening sessions and Mondays and Fridays. If we all are able to plan in advance, our work will be better, I believe, because we will have certainty and will not be as exhausted as we sometimes get when we go late into the night. Our constituents will be better served, and our families will be much happier as a result of it. 
I look forward to the challenges we have before us in the Senate. I had some people say when I was home in Mississippi, `You must get tired thinking of getting back and getting to work.' 
I said, `Absolutely not.' This is what it is all about. This is a great opportunity to try to make a contribution for the people you love, your family, your community, your State, and your country. If we approach it that way, if we decide we are going to work together, hard going as it may be sometimes, to do what is right for our country, there will be no limit to what we can accomplish.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, earlier today, we witnessed the oath of office being given to the new junior Senator from South Dakota, the Honorable Tim Johnson. I join with all my colleagues in welcoming him to the U.S. Senate. I wish him well. However, I do want to take a moment to pay tribute to the gentleman he succeeded--a man of integrity, of kindness, and of singular achievement--Senator Larry Pressler. 
I have known Larry Pressler throughout his entire 22 year career of public service in the Congress, beginning with his first election to the House of Representatives in 1974. Though a young man when he first took the oath of Office, he already had distinguished himself in other fields--as student body president at the University of South Dakota, a Rhodes Scholar, a U.S. Army Lieutenant in Vietnam, and a Harvard Law and Kennedy School graduate. 
I knew then that the people of South Dakota had sent an exceptional human being. I didn't realize how right I was at the time. In 1978, he was elected to the Senate--the first of several Vietnam veterans we are honored to call our Senate colleagues. For 18 years--three terms in office--he served the Senate, his State and his country ably and responsibly. 
All who know or have known Larry Pressler are keenly aware how much he holds public service in high regard. He considers it his life's calling, and he certainly responded well to the call. He knows that effective public service begins with public trust at home--the faith that he chose to represent their views and interests in Washington will do so with honor and integrity. Little did Larry know that not long after he came to the Senate, that basic principle of public trust would be put to the test. It would come in the form of FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks who attempted to bribe Larry as part of their so-called ABSCAM investigation. Larry strongly refused. His response drew national acclaim. The Federal District Judge who presided over the trial singled out Larry's action, stating that he `acted as citizens have a right to expect their elected representatives to act.' 
That single act, perhaps more than any other, capsulized and defined the values of Larry Pressler--the values he was brought up to practice first on his father's farm in Humboldt, SD, and the same values he practiced every day for 22 years in Congress. Just as important, his action during ABSCAM reminded all of us of that vital link between effective public service and sustained public trust. 
Public trust was not just a core value Larry Pressler practiced in his own life, but a basic principle he sought to instill in government practice. He worked overtime to be sure South Dakotans were treated fairly by the Federal Government, whether it was as routine as a timely Social Security check, or as complex as environmental protection enforcement. 
Larry was the first to oppose President Clinton's nomination of Zoe Baird because he sensed early on that her past actions damaged the level of public trust needed in our Nation's chief law enforcement officer. He was right. 
Larry has been a superb watchdog of Federal agencies that oversee air safety because of his concern both for the safety and security of air travelers, and the faith travelers place in these agencies and carriers to ensure their safety. He was right on the mark again. 
Larry also has been an outspoken champion of our efforts to reform the cancerous corruption and waste that has infected the United Nations to the point of near ineffectiveness. As a supporter of the United Nations, Larry is concerned that continued United Nations mismanagement would erode the public's support and trust in the world body. Some people in the United Nations are listening. Indeed, largely 
because of the persistence and diligence of our friend and former colleague from South Dakota, the United Nations today now has an inspector general to investigate waste, fraud and abuse, and is beginning to take seriously this body's demands for real, concrete reform. 
Persistence and diligence--that best describes the style of Larry Pressler's approach to public service, and it has paid off for the State of South Dakota and the Nation. His last campaign slogan was `Fighting and Winning for South Dakota.' That's a good example of truth in advertising. Whether it was rail service or air service, wheat prices or cattle prices, Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City or the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, Larry Pressler fought and won for South Dakota. 
Internationally, Larry Pressler is known and respected for his efforts on nuclear nonproliferation, and human rights causes in China, Cyprus, Armenia, Turkey, and Kosova. I'm sure there are many around the world who will miss Larry Pressler's commitment to these and other important causes. 
But perhaps Larry Pressler's greatest achievements as a Senator came in his last 2 years in office, when he served as chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Chairman Pressler presided over one of the most productive and bipartisan periods of legislating by a single Senate committee perhaps in the history of this body. At the end of the 104th Congress, I had the opportunity to detail this extraordinary record of accomplishment. Chairman Pressler reported 97 bills and resolutions out of the Commerce Committee--more than any other Senate Committee during the 140th Congress. Of those, 87 became law. 
Of that 87, perhaps the most heralded was the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the most important economic growth legislation to become law in a decade. This piece of legislation was Larry Pressler's life for well over a year. 
It's fair to say that the Telecommunications Act would not be law today if not for Larry Pressler. It passed with extraordinary support because Larry Pressler took the time to work with virtually every Member of Congress--House and Senate--to see that their concerns were addressed. He demonstrated bipartisanship, fairness as well as toughness, but perhaps most important are the two qualities I mentioned earlier--persistence and diligence. 
Those qualities also were shared by Larry Pressler's staff. Indeed, both his personal and committee staff deserve a tribute and our thanks as well. They were a great team. Many are from South Dakota. Many have served with Larry Pressler for more than a decade. Several for as long as he was a Senator and a select few even worked for him in the House. Larry, one of our more regular participants at our weekly Senate Bible study, often joked that Abraham died leaning on his staff. Well, it's safe to say Larry Pressler succeeded leaning on his staff. I know Larry Pressler is very proud of all his dedicated staff. I also know that all the staff are proud of Larry Pressler--proud to have worked with him and for the people of South Dakota. 
They are not alone. All of us are proud to have worked with our distinguished colleague from South Dakota. I say this not just as a colleague, but as a dear friend. My wife, Tricia, and I have enjoyed the countless times we have spent with Larry, his lovely wife, Harriet and their wonderful daughter, Laura. I am hopeful there will be many more good times ahead. 
F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote: `Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.' I have seen the vitality of Larry Pressler as a persistent and dedicated public servant for his state and nation. I am confident Larry will demonstrate that same vitality as he starts a new, a private life that will bring professional success and personal satisfaction. 
So today, Larry Pressler finds himself in a position all of us will be placed in--a point where past service is subject not to the approval of voters but to the scrutiny of history. Mr. President, it is safe to say history will treat Larry Pressler quite well, and will see him as we do--as a model public servant. To paraphrase the words of Saint Paul known and referred to often by my friend from South Dakota, Larry Pressler stayed the course, fought the good fight and kept the faith.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate seated Senator Mary L. Landrieu without prejudice to the Senate's constitutional power to be the judge of the election of its Members. In so seating Senator Landrieu, the rights of any person or entity involved in the election contest petition are also preserved. 
As a practical matter, what this means is that Senator Landrieu has the same rights and privileges as any other Senator with no limitation. However, her election has been contested and, as in other cases in recent history, depending on the resolution of this dispute in the Rules Committee, the Senate may ultimately be required to consider a report from the Rules Committee or not once they find out the details of what transpired. 
Senator Warner, the chairman of the Rules Committee, and Senator Wendell Ford, ranking member, have met and discussed this matter. Senator Daschle and I have discussed it. They have retained counsel who are reviewing the material that is available, and at some point, once they have had an opportunity to review that and hear from the interested parties, namely Senator Landrieu and the candidate, Woody Jenkins, then they will make a determination depending on the facts as to whether or not an investigation and subsequent action would be required by the Rules Committee. 
The Senate may take any of several courses of action. It may dismiss the petition at that time; it may declare the election to be set aside and call for a special election to fill the seat; or the Senate may declare the petitioner the winner of the election and replace the Senator already seated. Each one of those have been done at various times in the past. 
But again, I think it is very important that we not prejudge anything. I do not think any Senator knows many of the details of what is involved. The committee of jurisdiction is working on it, and we should allow them to proceed in a careful but thorough and bipartisan way. 
Obviously, we are removed from making any determination today, and we should be. We are just seeing that the allegations are being investigated and, as soon as possible, the Senate Rules Committee, then, will make a formal decision on whether to go forward. It is my intention, and I know it is the intention of the Democratic leader and Senator Warner and Senator Ford, that the investigation will be thorough and fair, and that it will be handled expeditiously, and that it will be in accordance with all the rules that are established in the past with regard to what the Senate protocol is in these matters. 
Not only should the investigation be fair, it should be conducted in a manner that allows us to do the people's business. That is the primary reason for seating Senator Landrieu without prejudice. We want to allow the Senate to proceed to its business with all 100 Senators present, accounted for, and involved in the process, while we gather whatever facts that are there and are available and need to be known. At such time as the Rules Committee makes a recommendation of disposition, the report is highly privileged and will then be subject to the Senate for consideration. 
I think it is important that we apply the same fair principles to the consideration of the Rules Committee report, should one be issued. Under ordinary procedures, as with most business of the Senate, such a report would be fully debatable and subject to the usual rules and filibusters and cloture votes. However, I believe that the American people, and particularly this institution, would be better served if we agree in advance that ample opportunity will be given to all Senators for debate and consideration of any such Rules Committee report, but that ultimately debate will draw to a close, the matter will be decided, and we can move on to other business of our country that we have been sent here to accomplish. 
I know, in the case a few years ago, maybe it was in the 1970's, there was a matter that was contested based, as I recall it, purely on the closeness of the election. The Senate spent 6 months and over 40 votes until it was finally resolved by setting aside the election, calling for another election, and that occurred and Senator Durkin was elected. I hope we do not have anything like that occur this year. My presumption at the beginning is nothing of that kind. There may be no further action on this, other than what happened in the Feinstein matter and in the Coverdell matter, but I would feel a need to clarify what the rules would be, or to identify what the rules will be as we proceed. I will, therefore, offer a unanimous-consent agreement which incorporates my desire to be fair to all parties but also to ensure that the matter does not become mired in a lengthy or purely partisan situation.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to say I appreciate the distinguished Democratic leader's comments. I know he is sincere in those and he knows that I will keep him informed of what is happening in the Rules Committee. It could be that the Rules Committee would come to the same conclusion that they did in the so-called Feinstein and the Coverdell matters. My only goal in asking this unanimous consent is that, if it does go beyond that, that there be some way it be brought to a reasonable conclusion with ample time for Senators to be able to have debate and discussion of the issues that are involved but without it being endlessly debated, or filibustered, if you will. But my hope is we can work through that. It may not even come to that, but I understand the Senator's position and I heard what he said and I am satisfied that, if we do need to work out some arrangement as to how something would be considered in the future, we will find a way to come to an amicable agreement. I thank the Senator for his comments.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first I wish to extend my welcome and congratulations to all of the newly elected Senators. We look forward to working with you in a bipartisan way for the best interests of our country. I know that we have a few of our retiring Senators here and we want to wish them a fond adieu and the very best in the future. Senator Johnston there from Louisiana needs to be careful; he might change his mind and raise his hand and try to get sworn in again. 
This is a magnificent occasion, and it is an honor to serve as the majority leader in this great body and to work with my friend, Senator Daschle, from South Dakota.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today marks the 105th time since 1789 that newly elected Senators have stood before this body's Presiding Officer at the start of a new Congress to pledge their support for the Constitution of the United States. I would like to take advantage of this special event in the life of each new Congress to comment briefly about the origins of the oath we take. 
There is a good deal of confusion about the oath and its origin. Some believe that the Constitution prescribes its specific text and that all Senators since 1789 have taken and signed the oath in the form that we know today. Neither is true. While the Constitution specifies a separate oath for the President, it leaves to Congress the responsibility of preparing an oath for its Members and all other Federal officeholders. 
The Oath Act of June 1, 1789, was the first legislation passed by the Senate and the first law signed by President George Washington. It prescribed the following simple oath: `I XXXXX do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the Constitution of the United States.' On June 4, 1789, Senate President John Adams administered that new oath to all Senators, setting a pattern that future Presiding Officers followed, without controversy, for the next 74 years. 
The outbreak of the War Between the States quickly transformed the act of oath-taking, which had become a routine procedure after 1789, into one of enormous significance. At a time of uncertain and shifting loyalties, President Abraham Lincoln ordered all Federal civilian personnel to retake the prewar oath of allegiance. When Congress convened for a brief emergency session in the summer of 1861, Members supplemented the President's action by passing a law requiring civil officers to take an expanded oath in support of the Union. Although Congress did not then apply this August 1861 oath to its own Members, its text is the earliest direct predecessor of the oath we take today. 
When Congress returned for its regular session in December 1861, Members who believed that the Union had more to fear from northern traitors than from southern soldiers fundamentally revised the August 1861 statute in July 1862 by adding an `Ironclad Test Oath' provision. This war-inspired test oath required civil servants and military officers to swear not only to future loyalty, as required by the existing oaths, but also to affirm that they had never previously supported hostilities against the United States. Those who failed to take the 1862 test oath would not receive a salary; those who swore falsely would be prosecuted for perjury and forever denied Federal employment. 
The 1862 oath's second section incorporated a more polished and graceful rendering of the hastily drafted 1861 oath in language that is identical to the oath we take today. 
Early in 1864, the Senate adopted a rule specifying that all newly elected Members must not only orally agree to the test oath, but also `subscribe' to it by signing a printed copy. This condition reflected a wartime practice in which military and civilian authorities required anyone wishing to do business with the Federal Government to sign a copy of the test oath. The requirement included Confederate prisoners of war seeking parole and southerners who wished to be reimbursed for goods confiscated by foraging Union troops. Our modern practice of signing the oath comes from this period. 
At the end of the war in 1865, the test oath stood as a formidable barrier to President Andrew Johnson's moderate reconstruction policies, designed to allow residents of the South to participate in their own government. While the President pushed for a rapid reintegration of Southern States, those in Congress who wished to impose a harsh peace insisted on the test oath, which had been created in part to prevent ex-Confederates from taking Federal positions. Many of the oath's drafters specifically had in mind blocking the return of one of my direct Senate predecessors--Jefferson Davis. 
The Constitution's 14th amendment, ratified in 1868, permitted Congress to remove barriers to service by former Confederates through a two-thirds vote of both Houses. Congress then enacted an oath for those in this category, allowing them to ignore the test oath's first section, regarding past loyalties, and subscribe only to its second section pledging future allegiance. That 1868 oath is identical to the one we take today. 
As postwar tensions eased, Congress in 1871 dropped the requirement for a two-thirds vote of both Houses for former Confederates entering congressional service or government employment. For another 13 years, however, all oath takers who were not former Confederates were required to take the full test oath. In 1877, to further complicate matters, the Senate amended its rules to require that Senators take not only the 1862 or the 1868 oath, but also the original oath of 1789. 
Reflecting the confusion surrounding these multiple requirements, the Senate's archives contain no signed oaths for the years between 1871 and 1880. From 1880 until 1884, nearly 20 years after the war's conclusion, newly elected southern Senators who had participated in that conflict signed the 1868 oath, while all the others signed the 1862 test oath. 
On January 11, 1884, as part of a general revision of its rules, the Senate replaced specific references to the rules of 1862 and 1868 with the simple statement that is now Rule III of our Standing Rules: `The oaths or affirmations required by the Constitution and prescribed by law shall be taken and subscribed by each Senator, in open Senate, before entering upon his duties.' Seven weeks later, bringing to a close nearly a quarter century of confusion and acrimony, the Senate repealed the 1862 test oath. From that day to this, the high solemn oath `prescribed by law' has been the oath of 1868.

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before the Chair presents the certification of election for the swearing in to begin, I would like to take a moment to speak about the seating of one of our new colleagues who will be sworn in within the next few minutes. I am referring to the seating of Senator-elect Landrieu. The Senate has received petitions from the citizens of the State of Louisiana contesting the election of Senator-elect Landrieu. 
As most of you know, direct election of U.S. Senators began as a result of the 17th amendment to the Constitution in 1913. Since that time, the Senate has called into question a number of election results. However, only on four occasions have the challenges been successful in persuading the Senate to overturn the outcome of an election. The U.S. Constitution leaves it entirely up to the Senate to decide what evidence it deems relevant for overturning an election. 
At this point, the seating of Senator-elect Landrieu has been called into question as a result of investigative material by the Senate Rules Committee. The Senate Rules Committee is reviewing the evidence, and I am confident they will come to a conclusion as to whether the allegations should be dismissed or investigated further in a swift and timely manner. 
With all of that in mind, Senator-elect Landrieu will take the oath of office with her colleagues but will be seated without prejudice. The seating without prejudice has occurred a number of times in U.S. Senate history. The term means without prejudice to the right of the Senate to determine the outcome of the questioned election. 
I should like to quote from majority leader Taft of Ohio when he stated that `These Senators should be permitted to take the oath and to be seated. It is my further view that the oath is taken without prejudice to the right of anyone contesting the seat to proceed with the contest and without prejudice to the right of anyone protesting or asking expulsion from the Senate to proceed.' 
In the case of our colleague, Senator-elect Landrieu, she will shortly begin her new role as a U.S. Senator from the State of Louisiana and the Rules Committee will continue to investigate the allegations. I know the Democratic leader concurs with this procedure of seating Senator-elect Landrieu without prejudice, and we are both hopeful that the Rules Committee will conclude its investigation and make its ruling in a swift and responsible fashion. It is possible that later today, after discussions with the Democratic leader, we will be able to reach a further colloquy and perhaps a consent agreement with respect to any motion the Rules Committee may make at a later date in response to those allegations. After consulting with the Democratic leader, I hope to propound a consent agreement that would limit debate on any motion so that the full Senate would be able to resolve the matter very quickly. 
I now yield to the Democratic leader for any comments he may wish to make on the subject.
