Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United States Constitution contains two options providing for the appointment of the principal officers of our federal government. First, the Appointments Clause, found in Article II, section 2, clause 2, states that the President `shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint' such officers. Alternatively, should the Senate not be in session, Article II, section 2, clause 3, authorizes the President to unilaterally `fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate,' subject only to the proviso that the recess appointment expires at the end of the next session of Congress. 
As the Supreme Court pointedly observed in the 1997 case of Edmond v. United States, `the Appointments Clause of Article II is more than a matter of `etiquette or protocol'; it is among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.' 
With enactment of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an important step will have been taken toward securing the Senate's constitutional responsibility to render its advice and consent on presidential nominations. It is my hope that this legislation, which makes several substantive changes to the current Vacancies Act, will protect this vital constitutional `safeguard' by bringing to an end a quarter century of obfuscation, bureaucratic intransigence, and outright circumvention 
Mr. President, because I am an original sponsor of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and because the Act as it is being enacted differs somewhat from the bill reported to the Senate by the Committee on Governmental Affairs on July 15, 1998, (S. Rpt. 105-250), I wish to offer my perspective on the Act's application, time limitations, exclusivity and exceptions, enforcement, reporting requirements, and effective date and application to current vacancies.  
APPLICATION 
Section 3345 states that the provisions of the Act will apply to any officer in any executive agency, other than the General Accounting Office, if that officer's appointment is made by the President, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. Unlike current law, this change will make clear that the Vacancies Act, as amended by this legislation, applies to all executive branch officers whose appointment requires Senate confirmation, except for those officers described in Section 3349c. 
Section 3345 applies when an officer dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office (the latter provision covers, inter alia, sickness or absence, which are listed in current law, or expiration of a term of office). Should one of these situations arise, the officer's position may then be filled temporarily by either: (1) the first assistant to the vacant office; (2) an executive officer who has been confirmed by the Senate for his current position; or (3) a career civil servant, paid at or above the GS-15 rate, who has served in the agency for at least 90 of the past 365 days. However, a person may not serve as an acting officer if: (1)(a) he is not the first assistant, or (b) he has been the first assistant for less than 90 of the past 365 days, and has not been confirmed for the position; and (2), the President nominates him to fill the vacant office.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I expressed yesterday my abhorrence of the process that produced this behemoth Omnibus Bill. I said, however, that I would vote for it, because it contained some good things for the Nation. That is true, but I just could not do it. I cannot support such a twisting of constitutional intent and of the legislative process. Therefore, I voted no, so that I can sleep more peacefully tonight.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to highlight a provision contained within this massive omnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 4328, that addresses a longstanding debt owed by this nation to the veterans of the Persian Gulf War. Title XVI of Division C of this bill contains the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. In five short sections, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998 lays out a sound, scientific process by which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may make a determination, based on the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences or other sound scientific or medical evidence, that diseases suffered by Gulf War veterans are linked to hazardous materials they were exposed to during that conflict. That is, the Secretary now has a credible process to determine what diseases should be considered service-connected for purposes of providing health care and disability compensation to Gulf War veterans. 
This is not some give-away program, but a long overdue recognition that Gulf War veterans may be suffering from invisible wartime wounds just as real as any left by bullets--wounds to their immune systems, to their muscles and joints, or to their internal organs, caused by the toxic fog of chemicals, oil well fires, and medications in which they were immersed. This nation has a long history of caring for the men and women who were wounded in her service, and it is a shame that it took over seven years to recognize and honor our commitment to these veterans. 
I have seen some news reports that this provision will cost between $1 and $6 billion over ten years. I do not know what these estimates are based on. The Congressional Budget Office determined that this program would cost $40 million over the first five years, and a total of $490 million over ten years. That is not an extravagant bill to pay for a war that cost the United States over $60 billion for less than two months of actual fighting--for a mere 100 hours of actual on-the-ground combat. Almost 700,000 service personnel were in the Southwest Asia theater during the initial phase of the conflict, and over one million service personnel have pulled tours of duty in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait since 1991. Over 120,000 of these men and women are now on Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs Gulf War registries, many suffering from multiple debilitating symptoms since their service in the Gulf. 
The provisions in this omnibus bill were extracted from S. 2358, a bill I introduced with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter, the Ranking Member and Chairman, respectively, of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, on July 27. I am proud of this collaboration, which I believe produced a sound as well as needed piece of legislation. Although S. 2358 was adopted by the Senate in the closing days of this Congress, and after the process of putting together the omnibus appropriations bill had begun, no action was taken on it by the House of Representatives. Some elements of S. 2358 were included in two House-passed bills, H.R. 3980 and H.R. 4110, that were sent to the Senate, again, after the process of putting together the omnibus appropriations bill had begun. In my opinion, these bills fell far short of delivering on our commitment to Gulf War veterans. 
In both H.R. 3980 and H.R. 4110, the National Academy of Sciences was directed to conduct a study and to make recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding illnesses that might be linked to service in the Gulf. But, the Secretary was directed only to make recommendations to Congress. The veterans would not receive any immediate assistance. It would be up to Congress to make the determination of service connection, find the funds to pay for it, and convince both Houses of Congress and the President to agree that action should be taken. Mr. President, I do not believe that adding this kind of delay to the process aids our veterans. We can do better, and we did better in S. 2358. Let the Secretary do his job, and if we do not like the way he carries out his job, then we can take corrective action. 
Mr. President, I have already noted that these compromise bills arrived in the Senate late in this session, after work on the omnibus appropriations bill had begun. As the Ranking Member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I had already added S. 2358 to the list of legislation to be considered for inclusion in the omnibus package. I did this not because I approve of this way of passing legislation on an appropriations bill and especially not on a monstrosity like this omnibus bill, but because I saw an opportunity to do something useful and needed for these veterans. They do not deserve any additional delay. And when I saw that the compromise language contained only a study, and the possibility of further delay for these veterans, I became determined to include the key elements of S. 2358 in the omnibus appropriations bill. 
Now, I have been noted for my stubbornness--my friends call it tenacity or perseverance, but my opponents call it stubbornness. On this matter, I was determined, tenacious, persistent, and, yes, even stubborn. As a conferee on the omnibus appropriations bill, I was able to defend my position. This section of the omnibus bill was among the last issues decided. I sincerely thank my colleagues, Senator Stevens, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Representatives Livingston and Obey, the Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the House Appropriations Committee, who supported my efforts to include this provision in the final bill. They did this over the objections of the Administration. For their leadership and courage in defending the interests of Gulf War veterans they merit great praise. 
The veterans of the Gulf War have struggled for seven years to have their wartime sacrifices recognized for what they are--the scars of battle. I hope that Title XVI of Division C of H.R. 4328 will set this process on a track that is both credible and fair, and that will follow through on our nation's commitment, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, `To take care of him who has borne the battle. . . .'

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when one speaks of the State of Idaho, we think of her glorious and rugged landscape, her fertile valleys, her waters ideal for fishing, her world-class ski resorts, her national parks and forests, with land fit for hiking, or biking, and, of course, her reputation as the potato capital of the world. Following the end of the 105th Congress, I daresay that our associations to the State of Idaho will also include the name of Dirk Kempthorne, the state's junior Senator and one of this body's most respected Members. Although our friend from the west is leaving the Senate after only one six-year term, I, for one, will remember him fondly for years to come. 
Senator Kempthorne and I formerly served together as Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. We worked together to introduce legislation requiring the study of gender integrated training in the military. That association has been pleasant, and, I believe, productive. To be sure, I have not always agreed with his policy proposals, or he with mine. On many issues, including the balanced budget constitutional amendment and the unfunded mandates legislation, we have held opposing views. 
Throughout the lengthy debate on the unfunded mandates bill in early 1995, the Senator was conscientious, thorough, and fair. His grace and courtesy in managing that bill were impressive, particularly for someone so new to the Senate. And, as we all know, his efforts paid off after deliberate consideration and compromise. Moreover, with passage of the unfunded mandates bill, Senator Kempthorne holds the honor of being the most junior member of the Senate since World War II to author, manage, and win passage of a bill numbered Senate Bill One. 
When he leaves these hallowed halls, Senator Kempthorne will return to his home state. Boise, of course, is familiar ground for Senator Kempthorne, serving as that city's forty-third Mayor, from 1985 until 1992, when the people of Idaho elected him to his present seat in the Senate. Incidentally, he became so popular during his first term as Mayor that he faced no opposition in his bid for a second term! How many of our colleagues would like to be in that situation? How many of us would like to be so universally popular, and be held in such high respect by our constituents, that such popularity and respect would foreclose potential challengers? 
I congratulate Senator Kempthorne on his fine service here, and I wish him and his nice family happiness in future years.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are about to take up the conference report on the so-called omnibus appropriation measure, which contains funding for Fiscal Year 1999 for the departments and agencies under the jurisdiction of eight Appropriations Subcommittees: Agriculture, Commerce/Justice/State/The Judiciary, the District of Columbia, Foreign Operations, Interior, Labor/Health and Human Services and Education, Transportation, and Treasury and General Government. In addition, this omnibus package contains some $20 billion, which has been designated as an emergency, in a supplemental package for such things as: agriculture disaster assistance--$6 billion; defense, including military readiness, $6.8 billion; hardening of embassies and other security matters--$2 billion; Y2K--$3.25 billion, of which $1.1 billion is for the Department of Defense; war on drugs--$690 million; and various disaster assistance programs, such as FEMA, Community Development Block Grants, and other programs which aid those who have suffered from natural disasters in the past months, such as Hurricane Georges--$1.4 billion. Also included are a substantial number of legislative riders that have been recommended by various members of the House and Senate and have been approved by not only the Appropriations Committees but also the joint leadership and the administration. As if that were not enough, this conference report also includes a $9.2 billion tax package. 
This omnibus conference report is massive. It numbers thousands of pages. I haven't seen it yet, but that is what I am told. It provides funding totaling nearly $500 billion, or close to one-third of the entire Federal budget. If you don't think that is a lot of money--$500 billion--that is $500 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Let me say that again. That $500 billion is $500 for every 60 seconds since Jesus Christ was born. It is virtually beyond comprehension when we talk about funding of that size. Webster's Dictionary does not contain words enough to allow me to appropriately express my disappointment and my regret that we have reached the point we have, to present this colossal monstrosity to the United States Senate. 
All too often in recent years, we have faced similar situations where Congress has failed to enact its 13 separate annual appropriation bills in a timely manner and, in many cases, we have failed to enact them at all, except in an omnibus package. Just 2 years ago, under the chairmanship in the Senate of the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, the Senate was placed in a similar position. It wasn't Mr. Hatfield's fault, but the Senate was placed in a similar position of having to vote on an omnibus appropriation bill that contained six of the annual appropriation bills in one conference report. 
Then, as today, Members were asked to vote on those appropriation bills in their entirety, plus hundreds of other provisions, sight unseen, a pig in a poke, without satisfactory opportunities to understand those provisions and virtually without opportunity to amend the omnibus bill. 
In 1996, I joined Chairman Hatfield and our present chairman, Senator Stevens, in expressing my regret that the 
Senate was put into that difficult position. Senator Stevens indicated that he hoped the Senate would never have to appropriate by way of an omnibus bill again. Last year, Chairman Stevens and his counterpart, the distinguished chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative Livingston, with the support of the ranking members on each of the subcommittees, were able to complete action on all 13 appropriation bills without the need for omnibus legislation. That was last year, and that is the way the process ought to work every year. 
It is very, very costly to the U.S. taxpayers to have to govern through a series of continuing resolutions. Departments and agencies have to curtail their operations and alter their plans in many cases because they are not certain as to what their appropriation will be for the full fiscal year. We have now had five continuing resolutions in relation to the fiscal year 1999 appropriation bills. Five continuing resolutions! 
As Members are aware, we have only enacted into law three fiscal year 1999 regular appropriation bills--defense, military construction and energy and water. Furthermore, the Senate never took up the District of Columbia, or the Labor-HHS appropriation bills, and although it was taken up on the Senate floor, action was never completed on the Interior appropriation bill. Yet, here we are today faced with having to vote not only on those three appropriations bills, but also on five more in this conference report, plus many authorization measures and a tax bill. 
The process that has brought us to this point is deplorable. It is manifestly preposterous in that no Member of the House or Senate could possibly know, much less understand, all of the provisions that are contained in this conference report. It is absolutely inexcusable. It ranks, as far as the legislative lexicon is concerned, with the unpardonable sin in the spiritual realm--the unpardonable sin. It is absolutely unpardonable for Members of the Senate and the House to put themselves into this kind of situation. It should be difficult for every one of us to face the voters of this country. If the voters really understood what we are doing here, they would probably feel like voting us all out of office. Thank God, only one-third of the Senators have to go before the voters each 2 years. By failing to enact our regular appropriation bills on time, we have brought this situation upon ourselves. There is nobody here but us; there is nobody to blame but us. We are to blame for this. We brought this situation on ourselves. 
Senators are being asked to vote on this massive piece of legislation that provides funding of nearly one-half trillion dollars--approximately one-third of the entire Federal budget--without an adequate opportunity to consider it or amend it. Senators cannot amend this conference report--in spite of the Constitution, which says, with reference to revenue-raising bills, that they shall originate in the House of Representatives, but that the Senate may propose amendments to revenue-raising bills, as on all other measures, as on all other legislation. The Constitution didn't foresee this kind of a monstrosity--eight appropriations bills wrapped into one conference report, one tax bill, and a supplemental appropriation bill--right? Right. 
Eight. What a monstrosity, what a gargantuan monstrosity! 
Do I know what is in the measure? Are we kidding? No. I don't know what is in this measure. I know a few things that are in it, but only God knows everything that is in this monstrosity. Only God knows what is in this conference report. And very few people, relatively speaking, are on speaking terms with Him. 
Nobody in this Government--not one person in this Government--understands every jot and tittle that are in this measure; not one. 
We have no opportunity to amend it. In other words, the representatives of the people are being denied by the rules the opportunity to offer an amendment on behalf of one's constituencies. No Senator can offer any amendments to this conference report. And, yet, we have seen in the last several days daily press conferences where both sides--both sides, out in the Rose Garden they appeared, and out here somewhere near the Capitol--both sides were patting themselves on the backs, patting each other on the backs, and congratulating themselves and each other. For what? For finally putting together a massive gargantuan monstrosity referred to as `the conference report' containing the bills that we should have passed long months ago. 
We put off acting on these bills for months, and then, finally, when we get beyond the beginning of the new fiscal year, we finally bring in a massive piece of legislation. We don't know what is in it. Nobody in here knows everything that is in it. Certain Members know certain things about it. And then we pat ourselves on the back. What a great victory--it was proclaimed down in the Rose Garden--what a victory for the American people! What a shame. Webster wouldn't define that as a victory. 
I was invited to go down to the White House. I didn't go. I didn't consider that a victory. I am not going to be a prop, a backup prop, for that kind of victory. Why is it a victory? Several months late we all gather in the Rose Garden and pat ourselves on the back for having finally gotten around to doing the work that we should have done months ago? Is that a victory? 
Mr. President, although I strenuously object to the process, I will vote for this monstrous measure in the form of a conference report for the same reason that many other Senators will vote for it--and that is to keep the Government running. 
All that I have said is not to say that this huge legislation does not have some good things in it. There are some good things in it that we know about--good things for the Nation--and we do have to pass appropriations bills to keep the Government running. If Congress does nothing else in an entire year, it must pass appropriations measures to keep the Government running. But it is not a vote which I relish casting. 
I would be less than honest if I did not state here and now that I do not know--as I have stated already--a great deal about what is in this legislation. In that, I am not alone. This conference report is a creation, without a mother or a father--rather more like a Frankenstein creature, a being of some sort that has been patched together from old legislative body parts that do not quite fit. And just as Dr. Frankenstein was quite surprised by the results of his creation, so may we be startled by the result of ours. 
So we all gather down in the Rose Garden to proclaim what a victory this Frankenstein monster is for the American people! Hail, hail the victory for the American people. 
Hastily drafted legislation, as Senators in this body well know, often has strange and unintended consequences. I don't fault the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Stevens and the Appropriations Committee worked hard and reported the appropriations bills. We could long ago have acted upon these bills in the Senate and sent them down to the White House. We could have long ago done it. The Appropriations Committee didn't hold up the bills. I fault the entire Congress for repeatedly failing to do its work, and for bringing us to the brink all too often. 
Thirteen appropriations bills, Mr. President, and several supplemental bills comprise the sum total of what this Congress actually has to accomplish each year. Those 13 bills, and any supplementals which may be needed, make up our basic work requirement each year before we can go home. Yet, how often we have to cobble together continuing resolutions or horrific omnibus bills like this one because we will not do our work in a timely way. Out there in the real world when you don't do your work you are fired. On the real job site, colleagues, we would be gone! We would have been gone, out there on the real job site! That is us, the delayers. 
What results when we get to the end of a session and go through these agonies is Government at its worst. Someone said that making legislation was like making sausage. Don't kid yourselves. I have made sausage. It is nothing like making this piece of goods. I have made sausage. I can tell you that what we did this year in gobbling together this appropriations conference report is significantly more sloppy, more messy than making sausage. 
Congress did not even pass a budget resolution this year. How about that. The Senate passed a budget resolution. The House passed one. But they never got together in conference, so Congress never passed a budget resolution this year. 
I believe that this is probably the first time since 1974, when we enacted the Congressional Budget Act, that we have gone ahead and written appropriations bills without the discipline of a budget resolution. 
It is rather like writing checks when you have no idea how much money is in your bank account. No sane, responsible citizen would do that. But that is what we have done with the Federal budget in this unfortunate year. We have prostituted the legislative process. We have prostituted the appropriations process. Aha, what a victory! 
But the worst part about this year-end charade we so often play with appropriations bills, and especially this year's belly dance with the White House, is the way that we have flaunted the Constitution--flaunted the Constitution! 
Mr. President, I do not like to be tedious about these things, but the Constitution is not a rough draft. 
Article I, Section 1, of the U.S. Constitution says:  
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. 
Earlier this year, I filed an amicus brief before the Supreme Court of the United States along with Senators Moynihan and Levin with the aim of bringing down a gross aberration of the framers' intent called the line-item veto. 
One of the major agreements made in support of our case against the line-item veto was that the President is not empowered to legislate, and the Supreme Court upheld that. The President is supposed to faithfully execute the law, not write it. And so we argued that when the President can completely alter an appropriations bill by lining out portions of it, by repealing it, by canceling it, canceling portions of it, thus creating an entirely different bill--one that has never passed either House of Congress--he, the President, has become not just a legislator but a superlegislator. The Court agreed. God save the Supreme Court of the United States! The Court agreed. They wisely struck down this unwise and dangerous statute. 
But now look, just look now at what we have done. Look at what we have done now to the framers' handiwork at the close of the 105th Congress. We invited--we, the Congress invited--the executive branch to legislate. We said, `We can't do it. You come on in.' We invited them to legislate. Shame, shame on us! We eagerly offered the executive branch a seat at the legislative table. They are, in fact, in every way co-architects of this giant piece of legislation. 
We have allowed--not only allowed, we have invited--this White House to participate in this process, just as if, under the Constitution, the executive branch were legislators. So we have invited the executive branch to be coauthors of this giant, hybrid measure in the form of a conference report. It contains both legislation and appropriations bills about which most Members of Congress, especially on this side of the aisle, know very little. 
Why do I say `especially on this side of the aisle' we know very little about it? I will tell you why. We had two or three levels of conferences going on, all at the same time. The appropriators, Senator Stevens, Representative Livingston, the chairmen of the two appropriations committees, respectively, and Mr. Obey of the other body and I, as ranking members of the two appropriations committees, met. We met all day Saturday; we met all day on the Sabbath; we met all day Monday, Columbus Day, and we hammered out item after item after item. On the other side of the table were the executive branch people. Can you imagine that. We invited them by our having delayed action on the appropriations bills. 
Then on another level there was Speaker Gingrich and the majority leader of the Senate, Mr. Lott, both Republicans, a great political party--I have nothing against that; I have nothing against those two men, but there was the majority, the Speaker of the House, and the majority leader of the Senate. Where were the Democratic legislators at that level? There weren't any. No Democrats from the Senate or House were there to represent the minority in those negotiations. 
Who represented the minority? The executive branch--the executive branch represented the minority in the Senate and House because the minority in the Senate and House wasn't at the table. We weren't at the table. The minority in the Congress had been blacked out of the picture because our seat at the legislating table was occupied, by whom? By the President's men. I don't think the President attended any of the meetings. But he was represented. He had his representatives from the White House at the table. 
On one side of the table were the representatives of the President; on the other side of the table were the Speaker and the majority leader of the Senate representing the majority. We in the minority in the Senate and in the House were not at that table. If Banquo's ghost would have appeared there, I wouldn't have seen him. 
I deplore this process. We have run roughshod over the Constitution of the United States of America. Through this process, we have, in effect, circumvented the supreme law of the land because we have circumvented the Constitution, Section 9 of Article I and Section 1 of Article I. 
We have blurred and we have blended the very clear lines of the separation of powers set out in our national charter, and instead we have cooked up this unsavory soup which will be force fed to the American people in order to avoid a completely avoidable, but for partisan games, Government shutdown. This time there is no Supreme Court to save us from ourselves. We are quite randomly doing violence to the Constitution, and justifying it because of political expediency. Not only are we justifying it, we are claiming that it is the `second coming.' `Hallelujah, what a victory for the American people. Come one, come all. Come down to the Rose Garden! Hallelujah, what a great victory for the American people!' 
What a shame! Call that a victory! 
I extend my thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens. He has worked hard. He has done a masterful job in bringing the bills to the floor. He has worked zealously, assiduously, and effectively. I have never seen a finer chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I take my hat off to him. And I do the same with respect to his counterpart in the House, Mr. Livingston. I commend them both and I thank them both for their hard work in bringing this measure to the floor under very difficult circumstances. And I also commend the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey. Moreover, I appreciate the tireless efforts of the subcommittee chairmen and the ranking members of the subcommittees. I thank the staffs that have been hard at work, far into the nights. Our staffs on both sides worked far into the nights to cobble together these webs, fragments, and pieces of legislation. Each chairman and ranking member, and their staffs, on a bipartisan basis, have worked many long hours and weekends in order to complete this piece of legislation. 
While I do sincerely appreciate all their efforts, I hope that they will join me in my belief that this has to stop. How long, how long are we going to have to deprive our constituents of the opportunity of having their Representatives offer amendments to legislation on the Senate floor? I will never vote for another such monstrosity as long as I am privileged to hold this office. And I hope I never see another such monstrosity. I will never again support such a convolution of the legislative process as the one we have seen this year. And I hope that others will agree that this process is just as silly and as sad and as ridiculous and as disgraceful as I think it is. I hope they will join me in an effort to prevent it in the future. 
I again thank the chairman of the committee. I am sure that he does not think any more of this process than I do. Under the Constitution, the legislative branch is to appropriate. The legislative branch has control over the purse, and the legislative branch should never so conduct itself as to essentially invite the executive branch to participate in the writing of appropriations bills. 
The President has his right under the Constitution to veto a bill, but I say we ought to appropriate. We ought to pass the bills. We ought to be able to have them called up here, be able to offer amendments on both sides of the aisle--and on another day I will talk about that part of the process that is partly to blame for this situation we are in. But we ought to send the President the bills. Send them on time. If he wants to veto them, fine; he has that right under the Constitution. And the Senate and the House can try to override if they can. If they cannot, then they just cannot. But we ought not, ought not be a party to inviting the executive branch to participate in legislating appropriations bills and then gather on the White House lawn and here at the Capitol to proclaim that it is a victory for the American people. 
Shame on us!

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator knows of a Senator who wishes to speak, that is one thing. I know Senator Gramm wants to speak for 30 minutes. He inquired through a staff person as to whether or not I would make the request for him. I hope the Senator will not object to Mr. Gramm following the Senator from Oregon.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, for the first time in weeks, the news from Belgrade regarding Kosovo is encouraging. It would appear--with emphasis on the word `appear'--that Slobodan Milosevic has agreed to NATO's terms to withdraw his forces, begin peace negotiations, and allow 2,000 international observers into Kosovo. 
If Mr. Milosevic can be taken at his word, this is truly a turning point in the negotiations. Unfortunately, as we know from the trail of broken promises and from the trail of tears he has left in his wake, Slobodan Milosevic's word is worthless. Hopefully, the concurrent action NATO has taken to authorize air strikes if Mr. Milosevic does not abide by the agreement will be sufficient to persuade him to cooperate. I have my doubts. 
As welcome as these new developments are, they do not let Congress off the hook. Over the past several weeks, as we have rushed to complete our work prior to adjournment, we have tiptoed carefully around the role of Congress in authorizing military intervention in Kosovo without ever mustering up the courage to confront the issue head on. 
On the topic of Kosovo, we have lectured, we have criticized, we have urged this or that action, but we have been strangely silent on the subject of introducing and voting up or down on a resolution that would fulfill our duty, under both the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, to authorize the use of force in Kosovo and throughout Serbia. 
The Constitution invests in Congress the power to declare war. The War Powers Resolution prohibits the President from waging war beyond 60 days without Congressional authorization. Whether we are acting unilaterally, or as part of a multinational force, or as one member of a formal alliance such at NATO, the burden of responsibility on the Congress is the same. 
The bottom line here is that Congress has a duty to authorize the use of force if and when offensive military action is called for. By blinking at the prospect of an authorization of force resolution, we are abdicating our responsibility to the Executive Branch and shirking our duty to the nation. 
For weeks, Congress has wrung its hands over conditions in Kosovo while NATO was moving toward a military showdown in the region and while some of us were making solemn speeches condemning the brutality of Mr. Milosevic, our NATO allies were moving to authorize air strikes in and around Kosovo. The agreement reached with Milosevic has, at the very least, bought some time, but it has by no means removed the threat of military intervention in Kosovo. If NATO chooses to move forward with air strikes in the next few days or weeks, Congress, the only branch of Government with the power to declare war, will be just another bystander, watching from the sidelines as U.S. troops are placed in a hostile environment. 
Mr. President, none of us wants to rush this nation into military conflict. None of us wants to place the life of even one American at risk. None of us wants to give the order to shoot. But we do not have the luxury of avoiding such decisions. Whether we like it or not, Congress cannot bury its head in the sand when faced with tough issues like declaring war or authorizing military action overseas. And whether we wish to admit it or not, that is exactly what Congress is doing. When it comes to tough issues like Kosovo, Congress seems to want it both ways: we want to be able to criticize the administration, but we do not want to step up to the plate and take the responsibility of giving the administration any guidance. 
Now, this matter of responsibility is a two-way street. Congress has responsibility, but so does the administration--at the other end of the avenue. The administration has the responsibility--the duty--to consult with Congress before committing to military action. And the administration has been woefully remiss in accepting its share of the responsibility. 
This administration, like so many before it, seems to have confused the concept of consultation on the one hand with the act of advising on the other. Advising Congress of what the administration has already decided to do does not constitute consultation. And charging ahead without making a case to Congress and to the American people does not even constitute common sense. 
Like many of my colleagues, I have been troubled by several aspects of the proposed military intervention in Kosovo by the United States and NATO, particularly by the absence of a clear-cut game plan beyond the initial air strikes. Given the complexity of the problem and the potential consequences of any action we take, it is inexcusable and frankly foolhardy for the administration to wait until the eleventh hour to make its case to Congress. 
Yes, Congress has the responsibility to exercise its constitutional authority, but that does not give the administration the right to toss what amounts to a live grenade into Congress's lap and expect action before that grenade explodes. Yet, that is the situation with which we were forced to deal. We were told by the administration that air strikes could come at any time once NATO reached consensus on such action. We were alerted that American citizens were being evacuated from Yugoslavia. We watched American diplomats ping-ponging back and forth between Washington and Belgrade and Brussels. And we were given to understand that the administration would like for Congress to endorse its efforts. 
Mr. President, this is no way to conduct grave matters of war and peace. I congratulate the administration officials who have been tirelessly working to find a solution to the perilous situation in Kosovo. I am convinced that Secretary of Defense Cohen and Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke have gone the extra mile--literally--to end the bloodshed and turmoil in Kosovo, and to bring Mr. Milosevic to the bargaining table. I spent over an hour meeting with Secretary Cohen this past week, and I believe he understands fully the stakes involved in attempting to broker peace through the use of force in the Balkans. I am confident that he is well aware of the risks and uncertainties associated with the actions that have been taken and those being contemplated by the United States and our allies. 
I am not ready to give the administration a blanket endorsement--or a blank check--to carry out any plan for NATO air strikes on Kosovo. I believe there are too many loose ends, too many uncertainties. But I am equally unwilling to close my eyes to the problem and simply let the chips fall where they may. I commend Senator Daschle and Senator Biden and Senator Levin and others for the efforts they have made to deal with this situation. They are among a number of Senators who have worked to craft a resolution authorizing U.S. intervention in Kosovo, if wisdom dictates such intervention. I appreciate their taking my concerns into account as they worked to draft a resolution. They took my concerns into account by incorporating into the resolution provisions that would place some restraints on the administration, guard against an open-ended mission, in terms of its length and scope, and inject some accountability into the operation, without micromanaging the process. The result may or may not have been the best solution; it may or may not have been a resolution that I or a majority of my colleagues could have supported after reasonable debate, but at the very least, it was an effort to acknowledge our constitutional responsibility and articulate our concerns. 
Unfortunately, the clock up there on the wall is ticking, and this Senate has neither the time nor the inclination to take up such a resolution, particularly in light of the recent breakthrough in negotiations. I sincerely hope that the agreement Mr. Holbrooke has achieved in Belgrade means that military intervention will be averted, but I have little confidence that Mr. Milosevic will honor his commitment. 
I have a feeling he may do the same as Saddam Hussein has done in Iraq. Just watch. 
I would recommend that the sine die adjournment resolution contain authority to call Congress back into session. I am not talking about the President calling us back. He has that right under the Constitution. I am talking about our own leadership calling Congress back into session in order to deal with any crisis that might erupt over the period between the end of this Congress and the beginning of the 106th Congress. I further recommend that the administration immediately institute new procedures to truly consult with Congress before committing American troops to hostilities overseas. 
Mr. President, I have heard this old record played and replayed over and over and over again; a process in which we Senators on both sides of the aisle will be notified that there will be a meeting in room 407, where classified information can be divulged, at such and such a time, such and such a date. And the administration will appear there, the administration's Representatives will appear there. I have been to several of those meetings. 
Very, very seldom have I found anything, any information divulged in those meetings that I haven't already read in the newspapers. And yet the administration, whether it be this one or a preceding administration, feels that the administration has consulted with Congress. The administration hasn't consulted at all. They appear up there, and many times they appear to be talking down to us as though we are new kids on the block, they know it all and we should just be nice, nice boys and girls; they will handle everything; they know everything. 
For me, as far as I am concerned, for the most part, it has become an empty exercise to go up to room 407 and listen to the administration's people. Consultation involves far more than that. 
In addition to the elected leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives, I think the administration should consult--and I do mean consult, not merely advise--the chairmen, no matter what their gender, and the ranking members of the Appropriations, Armed Services, Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees. 
If military action becomes necessary in Kosovo, the administration will have to come back to Congress to pay for the operation, and the attitude which most administrations appear to have is that if they put American men and women into areas where hostilities are either already going on or imminent, Congress certainly will not turn its back on those men and women; Congress will fork over the money. So the administration always--most administrations in recent years--certainly seemed to have the idea, `Well, once we get our men in there, Congress will have to come along,' and we do. Congress isn't going to turn its back on our men and women who are in harm's way. But it doesn't breed confidence between the two bodies. We were told we would only be in Bosnia, oh, something like a year, about a year. That was 3 years ago, 3 or 4, several years back. 
I predict that administration officials would find the task a good deal easier if, when they come back before Congress and ask for money, they had truly counseled with Congress, built a case for their request and sought the advice of the pertinent committee leadership beforehand. 
Mr. President, I understand absolutely the serious nature of the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and the threat to regional stability in the Balkans that are posed by Mr. Milosevic's brutal repression of the ethnic Albanian Kosovars. With winter closing in on Kosovo and up to 70,000 ethnic Albanians hiding in the mountains without food or shelter, we are looking at the virtual certainty of a humanitarian catastrophe if something is not done to bring relief to those people and to ensure the safety of the other 250,000 to 400,000 Kosovars who have been forced from their homes by the fighting. 
There is a strong case to be made that dealing with the situation in Kosovo now will help to prevent it from becoming a flashpoint that could draw other nations into the conflict like moths to a flame. 
Viewed in that light, Kosovo is much, much more than a humanitarian endeavor. But we in the Congress have no right to wring our hands over the plight of the Kosovars while refusing to even debate whatever role wisdom may dictate that Congress should play. We have no right to be bold when it comes to criticizing NATO's proposed action while being timid when it comes to doing our job. Regardless of what anyone else does, Congress has a constitutional duty to authorize whatever action it deems necessary. We do no one any favor by surrendering our duty to the executive branch. 
Mr. President, we cannot adequately address the crisis in Kosovo in the time we have remaining in this Congress, but that does not mean we ought to completely abandon our responsibility. NATO is prepared to conduct airstrikes in the event the agreement reached in Belgrade falls apart. Congress should be equally prepared in its sine die adjournment resolution. Congress should be ready and should manifest that it is ready to reconvene on the call of the bipartisan joint leadership of the two Houses of Congress if the situation warrants it.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time when we work to heighten people's awareness of breast cancer and the importance of early detection through mammography and self examination. 
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women with one in nine women at risk of developing breast cancer over her lifetime. That is up from a risk that, in 1960, was just one in fourteen! In West Virginia, the American Cancer Society estimates that this year 1,200 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, while nearly 300 women in the State will die from the disease. Across the country, more than 43,000 women will lose their battle with the disease this year, while more than 178,000 women will just begin their fight. Too many people know the pain of losing a loved one to this devastating, terrible disease. 
The startling statistics on the incidence of breast cancer call for a strong Federal response, and that is what Congress has worked to provide. Since 1990, the Congress has increased cancer research funding by 54 percent. For this new fiscal year, I believe that the Senate is heading in the right direction with its version of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. This measure contains more than $15.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is an increase of $2 billion over the level appropriated last year. Within that amount, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) would receive almost $3 billion--a 15-percent increase over last year. It is my hope that the final appropriations measure for the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, and the NCI, the National Cancer Institute, will retain these sizable increases. The research performed and funded by NIH is crucial to our Nation, crucial to those suffering from this dreadful disease, and crucial to the families of those who are suffering. 
The strong national investment in cancer research is producing some promising results. For instance, an exciting new avenue being tested for breast cancer prevention is the drug tamoxifen. This therapy potentially promises to prevent 50 percent of breast cancer cases in women who run a high risk of developing the disease. 
Additionally, there are a number of new treatment options being studied, including such practices as gene therapy and hormonal agents. This combination of research and new therapies is lending hope to the many women and their families who are blighted by this devastating disease. Let us continue to invest in programs to address the scourge of cancer, breast cancer in women in particular. 
Early detection of breast cancer is critical, and, according to medical experts, mammography is the best way to find the disease in its early stages. In West Virginia, about 73 percent of women have had a clinical breast examination and mammogram. That is good, but not good enough. West Virginia still lags behind the national median of 77 percent. So we need to do more. 
In an effort to boost breast and cervical cancer prevention, I helped to launch the first-ever West Virginia cancer prevention, education, and screening project in 1990. As a result of this effort and other programs that have partnered with it, between 1989 and 1995, West Virginia experienced a 45 percent increase in the number of women receiving mammograms. We need to continue working together to increase the number of women having mammograms. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 minutes.

Mr. BYRD. When a breast cancer tumor is found in its earliest stages, a woman has a better than 90 percent chance of long-term survival. Places like the Mary Babb Randolph Cancer center in Morgantown play an important role in early detection and community education. The center proved to be a life-saver for Jorie Florek. She is a professional golfer from New York State who played in a West Virginia golf tournament to raise money for the cancer center. During the tournament, doctors and nurses from the center provided women with breast cancer information, including instructions on how to perform self examinations. Using that information, Jorie detected a lump that, unfortunately, turned out to be malignant. However, through early detection and aggressive treatment at the cancer center, Jorie is now cancer free. 
Another West Virginia success story is that of Stephanie Juristy. Stephanie was working, going to school, raising her teenage son, and planning a wedding when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995. She received treatment at the cancer center, undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, and participated in clinical trials of new treatments. Stephanie is now married, working full-time, and preparing to graduate from school. She is also an advocate for patients in Morgantown, sharing her experiences and knowledge with other women. 
Early detection, treatment, and research are all important components in the war against breast cancer. Strides are being made in each of these areas, and, hopefully, one day will lead to a cure for all cancer. And that will be a glorious--glorious--day. However, until then, we must remain vigilant and continue to encourage women to get mammograms and to self screen, and we must continue to make a strong investment in cancer research to press forward for a cure. As we recognize Breast Cancer Awareness Month, let us redouble our efforts to tackle this disease that takes such a devastating toll on our Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the bustling commotion of the ending days of the 105th Congress, members are preoccupied with efforts to enact sought after objectives important to their constituents. We are busy tying up loose ends, putting the finishing touches on projects, and looking forward to going home to our constituents and to a break in the hectic schedule of the United States Senate. Regrettably, as this session of Congress adjourns, we are also faced with the difficult task of saying goodbye to colleagues who have chosen to follow a new path in life. 
As I reflect on my years in Congress and on my association with its many members and their various personalities, their goals and, yes, sometimes, their eccentricities, I am reminded of some very important milestones in history made possible by these fine Americans. I am reminded of my good fortune to have been associated with men and women representing the American people from all walks of life and from all corners of the United States. 
In my reflections, I have thanked my Creator for allowing me to serve my country with such fine men and women, and I am, indeed, sorrowful at the upcoming loss of some of the finest men I have ever known. 
I pay tribute today to an exceptional United States Senator, a man with whom it has been my honor to serve and to have been associated with--a man of unusual conviction, passion, and resolve. He has been called the last Southern liberal, and he is proud of it. He often quotes from `To Kill a Mocking Bird.' He is THE commanding foe against the space station. 
The above discourse clearly references the actions of only one man--Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat from Arkansas. He is the United States Senator responsible for `right-turn-on-red,' his first legislative victory and one for which, I am told, he received devilish teasing from a colleague who warned that `many people might want to drive straight!' 
I will miss my friend, who is retiring following twenty-four years of service. He leaves a legacy that has made a difference, not only to the people of Arkansas, but to all Americans. His tireless efforts to end federal policies that he believes give away resources that belong to the taxpayer will long be remembered by certain mining and ranching interests out West. And more than a few NASA space station contractors will continue to run when they hear his name! Contractors who worked on the now-terminated Superconducting Super Collider can only wish that Senator Bumpers had chosen to retire earlier. 
While many a press story covered his crusades against alleged lost causes, Senator Dale Bumpers is a man that leaves this Senate with a triumphant record for the American people. In particular, Senator Bumpers has been a national leader in protecting the health of children. In fact, along with his wife, Betty, Senator Bumpers has long promoted childhood immunizations, known safeguards in protecting the health of millions of children. 
As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, formerly the Chairman, Dale Bumpers has represented the rural heart of America. He has fought for policies to help rural families, including securing funding for basic infrastructure projects that provide water and sewer facilities to small towns throughout the nation. I personally wish to thank Senator Bumpers for being a leading advocate for funding on these vital projects, and I share his concern for the millions of Americans who do not have access to a clean, ample supply of drinking water. 
Senator Bumpers has further made a significant mark on efforts to protect family farmers. In particular, we owe our gratitude to Dale Bumpers for his efforts to initiate programs to help young Americans become this nation's next generation of family farmers, a dwindling breed at risk of extinction. In honor of his service to rural America, I am proud that this Congress, in the Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, is formally paying tribute to his work by designating an Agricultural Research Service facility as the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center. This action follows the recognition by the people of Arkansas in dedicating the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food, and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas. 
Senator Bumpers' noteworthy record also extends to many other constituencies. Through his ranking membership on the Senate Small Business Committee, he has fought to help self-employed people obtain health care. He has also been an advocate of funding for rural hospitals; for Medicaid; for the Women, Infants and Children feeding program. The list goes on and on. 
Dale Bumpers' legislative skills and record are clear. He is a modern hero to the underdog. But there is yet another side of the Senator from Arkansas that deserves recognition--the Dale Bumpers who is a husband, a father, and a grandfather. Married to Betty Lou Flanagen, Dale's `Secretary of Peace,' for 49 years, he is devoted to his marriage and his family. Dale and Betty have three children and six grandchildren, and Dale often speaks affectionately of his family and of their influence on his consideration of legislative issues. Yes, Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas has a personal record of which he can be proud. 
It is with regret that I bid farewell to my friend and colleague, who is now departing the United States Senate. I believe that the Senate has deeply benefited from the work of U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers. As I say my farewell to Dale Bumpers, I want him to know that when the 106th Congress convenes, I will remember his thoughtful recital of the fictional Atticus Finch in `To Kill a Mocking Bird,' `For God's sake, do your duty.'

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first appointed to the United States Senate in 1989 by Governor Robert Orr to succeed Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator Coats subsequently won reelection and has served this body during these past nine years with knowledge, skill, and a true dedication to his Senatorial duties. As he departs this great institution to pursue future endeavors, we bid him farewell and best wishes. 
Prior to joining the United States Senate, Senator Coats made his mark in several arenas. In his early years, he served as a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, experience he drew on as a member of the Armed Services Committee. With a passion for law and politics, he worked full-time as a legal intern while attending the Indiana University School of Law at night and serving as Associate Editor of the Law Review. Later, in an effort to gain business experience, he switched tunes from barrister to become a vice president for an Indiana life insurance company, all before embarking on his legislative career in the House of Representatives, where he was elected in 1980 to represent Indiana's Fourth District. 
During his tenure in the Senate, Senator Coats has served on three powerful and influential Senate Committees--Armed Services, Intelligence, and Labor and Human Resources, and has crafted sound education, health care, and national security policy for the nation. I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Coats on the Armed Services Committee, where he has served on the Personnel, Readiness, and the Airland Forces Subcommittees. There have been a variety of national defense issues on which we have concurred, always keeping in mind the best interests of our national security and the importance of a strong and well equipped line of defense. Just this year, I appreciated his insight and support of my amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill to require separate training units for male and female recruits during basic training. 
And, of course, there have been the issues on which we have not seen eye-to-eye. I distinctly remember tangling this year on the Senate floor over Constitutional issues relating to the deployment of troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And, on the balanced budget amendment and the line item veto, we have been on opposite sides of the coin as well. Yet, Senator Coats always carries himself well, demonstrating the utmost respect for his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. For this, I hold him in high regard. 
Perhaps, Senator Coats' greatest contribution to the United States Senate has been as a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. His dedication to strengthening families began long before his political career. He is a longstanding member of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, and was recently elected national president of that organization. His service in the House included serving as a leading member of the Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families. On appointment to the Senate, he became Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Children and Families, where he has served as Chairman since 1995. He has been the author of the `Project for American Renewal' to revive civil society and America's character-forming institutions, and he is a passionate advocate for school choice, unpaid leave for family and medical emergencies, and prayer in schools. 
Most recently, Senator Coats shepherded legislation through Congress to reauthorize the Head Start and Low Income Home Energy Assistance program. In appreciation of his efforts and compassion for our nation's children and families, it was only fitting that this piece of legislation was named in his honor. The Coats Human Service Reauthorization Act is but just one example of his fine work here in the United States Senate. 
In speaking of his `Project for American Renewal,' he says, `The goal of public policy should be to revive the institutions of civil society that build character. Arguably, it is the erosion of those institutions--the family, community organizations, and private and religious charities--that has led to the most severe pathologies we now suffer.' I commend Senator Coats for his tireless efforts in behalf of these fundamental institutions, and, as he departs this body, I wish him well.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the next few days, as the Senate concludes its legislative business, one of the finest individuals it has been my privilege to know will bring to a close yet another chapter in what has been, by any measure, an extraordinary public service career. When that time comes--when the senior Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky walks out of this chamber for the last time as a United States Senator--this institution, and all who serve in it, will feel a great and lasting loss. 
When Wendell Ford came to this body on December 28, 1974, thus becoming the 1,685th individual to have served in the Senate, he did so not as a political neophyte but as an accomplished entrepreneur and a dedicated and seasoned public servant. Following service in World War II, our friend from Kentucky returned to his home state and launched a successful insurance business. But it was the call of public service, the chance to reach out and help all of his fellow Kentuckians, that meant the most to this young executive. 
And, so, in 1964, Wendell Ford began what was to become a successful political career by winning election to the Kentucky State Senate. Two years later, in 1966, he successfully ran for the position of Lieutenant Governor, and, in 1970, against all odds, he became Kentucky's Governor, a position from which he served with distinction as the chairman of the National Democratic Governors Caucus. 
Mr. President, despite his selfless service within his state, it is, of course, the near quarter-century he has spent here in the United States Senate that has earned Wendell Ford the admiration, the respect, and the undying affection of his colleagues. And, having been elected to four terms in the Senate, it is obvious that the good people of Kentucky also understand and appreciate the skill, the dedication, and the flawless integrity that Wendell Ford brings to his work. He serves Kentucky and the Nation with a wit and candor that are as timely and as refreshing as a cool Kentucky breeze on a hot summer day. 
In fact, in 1992, he began a string of historical achievements when he received the largest number of votes ever recorded by a candidate for elected office in the state of Kentucky. On November 14, 1996, Wendell Ford broke Alben Barlkey's record for the longest consecutive service in the United States Senate as a Senator from the Commonwealth, while becoming the overall longest serving Senator from Kentucky in March of this year. 
Mr. President, such milestones are not just proud, personal moments, although they are that. Rather, they speak to the immense respect, and the tremendous trust that the citizens of Kentucky have for their distinguished senior Senator. Of course, to those of us who know Wendell Ford, such respect and trust are not unfounded. 
As a Member of this body, Senator Ford has become a recognized leader in such diverse areas as aviation, federal campaign finance reform, and energy. He has, through dedication and hard work, shaped such important legislation as the National Voter Registration Act, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the National Energy Security Act of 1992, and the Energy Security Act of 1977. 
The commitment shown by our colleague from Kentucky in working on these and other profound and troubling problems that face this Nation is emblematic of the devoted public servant that Wendell Ford has shown himself to be. There will be few who will match the accomplishments of our friend; few who will bring to this body a deeper passion; and few who will legislate with greater skill. 
Mr. President, as he prepares to leave the Senate, I offer my sincere gratitude to Senator Wendell Ford for his professionalism, for his friendship, for his leadership, for his candor, and for his many years of dedicated service to our Nation. I would also like to express my admiration, and that of my wife, Erma, to Wendell's gracious and dedicated wife, Jean. Few know, of course, of the tremendous sacrifices made by our spouses. But those of us who serve in this body understand the price paid by these selfless, silent partners. None has done so with greater dignity, or with more grace, than has Jean Ford. 
And, so, I say to my friend from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, I have treasured the time we have worked together, and I wish him good luck and God's speed. He is coming home.  
Weep no more, my lady, 
Oh! weep no more to-day! 
We will sing one song for the Old Kentucky Home,

Count your garden by the flowers, 
Never by the leaves that fall; 
Count your days by the sunny hours, 
Not remembering clouds at all. 
Count your nights by stars, not shadows; 
Count your life by smiles, not tears; 
And on this beautiful [October] afternoon, [leader,] 
Count your age by friends, not years.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Random House College Dictionary defines the term `hero' first as `a man of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities,' and second as `a small loaf of Italian bread.' 
There is, of course, a wide disparity in these two definitions. I think I shall appropriately use the initial definition to describe the hero of whom I am about to speak, Senator John Herschel Glenn, Jr. I have had the honor of serving with him in the Senate for the last 24 years. 
He is a gentleman. He is a great public servant to all the Ohioans whose beliefs and values he has so ably represented in this body. 
As Senator Glenn prepares to officially retire from the Senate and take up his wings of flight once again, I shall take a few minutes to thank this distinguished Senator from Ohio for all that he has done for our Republic as a United States Senator and as a hero. 
I thank him for his achievements as a Senator. I thank him for his dedication to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, on which he has served since 1975. 
Following his personal motto: `You Keep Climbing,' Senator Glenn has moved up in the ranks. 
From 1987 to 1995 he served as the chairman of the committee, and then as the ranking Democratic member until the present time. 
As a member of the committee, Senator Glenn has worked to protect our Nation and its people, using his expert knowledge to combat the issue of nuclear proliferation, to protect our fellow Americans from all the environmental dangers 
that are associated with the byproducts of nuclear weapons, and is making the Government more accountable for waste and fraud. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, on which I am pleased to serve with him, Senator Glenn has worked to ensure that the United States military remained ready and strong in the perilous aftermath of the cold war. 
He has shared a concern over the dangers of chemical weapons. He has joined with others of us in attempting to ensure that our military has absorbed the lessons of the gulf war and is prepared to protect our troops from low levels of chemical weapons. 
On these two committees, Senator Glenn has served as a voice of reason and common sense. 
Senator Glenn is a hero for all of us to emulate as a result of his honor and dedication to his country, his family, and his own high standards. 
I have asked this question in the Senate before: `Where have all the heros gone?' 
To this question I have no definitive answer, but I do know where this hero is going to go . . . again. 
Senator John Glenn is a steam engine in britches; he is atomic energy in the flesh. 
The senior Senator from Ohio has been a daredevil virtually all of his life. 
Not one to know when to slow down, Senator Glenn has risked life and limb, both on the Earth's surface and in the vastness of space which encompasses it, for one thing, and one thing only--the United States of America. 
John Glenn has been uniquely blessed to have had the opportunity to 
soar above this Earth of ours, soar like an eagle, surveying the beauty of creation that is God's Green Earth. 
To quote William Shakespeare in `twelfth night,'  
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them. 
Senator Glenn is one who has achieved greatness through his service to his country; he is truly a great American hero. 
Not only a veteran of World War II, having served in combat in the South Pacific after he was commissioned in the Marine Corps in 1943, John Glenn is also a veteran of the Korean war. 
Having survived 149 combat missions as a marine, our hero--our hero, my hero, your hero--our hero wanted to move on to a more challenging career as a test pilot of fighter and attack aircraft for the Navy and Marine Corps. And then, looking for new and extreme ways to test his mortality, on February 20, 1962, Astronaut John Glenn gently squeezed his body into the Friendship 7 rocket and became the first American to orbit the Earth at almost 18,000 miles per hour. 
Think of that. When I was young, I read a book by Jules Verne titled, `Around the World in 80 Days.' John Glenn went around the world in 89 minutes. 
This may well have been the pinnacle of John Glenn's life and career. 
On that fateful Tuesday in 1962, not only was America waiting with nervously clenched fists for news on Lt. Col. John Glenn's condition after his return to Earth, but the whole world was watching. 
People from all nations prayed for the safe return of this brave man. 
Mr. President, I quote from an article entitled `Man's `Finest Hour.' I have been saving this article, now, for almost 37 years--`Man's `Finest Hour',' by the late David Lawrence, which was originally published in the March 5, 1962, edition of U.S. News & World Report: 
Miracles do happen when the world shows its humility in prayer. 
The voices that besought Almighty God to save the life of Colonel Glenn can speak again, as even more of us petition him to save humanity from nuclear war. 
For those prolonged minutes of prayer on Tuesday, Feb. 20, constituted man's `finest hour'. 
Now, if the Good Lord is willing, on October 29, our friend and colleague--and hero--John Glenn, still brimming with vital energy, will be leaving the relative comfort of Mother Earth far behind. 
It is always a melancholy time when the institution of the United States Senate has one of its finest Members move on. But it is a glad time when one of its Members moves on to something greater. 
`Excelsior, ever upward.' That is the motto of John Glenn. He has bigger fish to fry, so he is ready to get away from Washington, DC--far, far away. 
Senator Glenn's return to space aboard shuttle Discovery will add another significant page to the annals of history. 
The capacity in which Senator Glenn will be operating on the Discovery is representative of the way in which he had lived the last three decades of his life, despite his global fame--modestly and without great fanfare. 
I am certain that he will perform his mission on Discovery with the same diligence and sense of duty that he has shown in serving his great State of Ohio in the United States Senate. 
The world in 1998 is a lot different from that world of 1962, when John Glenn was first catapulted into space. Similarly, the space shuttle Discovery is about as close in design to the Friendship 7 rocket as an old Oliver typewriter--I was trying to remember the name of an old typewriter I had around the house when I was a boy--about as close in design to the Friendship 7 rocket as an old Oliver typewriter is to a home computer. 
The one thing that shall remain constant in this most recent launch is that the world will once again be watching, gripping chairs, biting fingernails, and saying its prayers for the Glenn family. For John Glenn, and for all the crew members of Discovery, and for Annie, that sweet little wife of Johns. 
It is hard to relate, to those Americans who were not yet born in 1962, the thoughts and emotions of the world on Tuesday, February 20, of that year. 
Technology has become so advanced that flights into space are routine. 
Men and women are able to live for months at a time in floating space stations. 
America tends to take for granted the risks that our Nation's astronauts take to perform scientific experiments, carefully placing communications satellites into orbit, and repairing important instruments of observation--all of which make life on Earth much more enjoyable. 
In 1962, the risks were greater and there were many unknown factors that experience has now brought to light and revealed and smoothed over. 
Senator Glenn's return to space brings that all back, and reminds us of the tremendous changes wrought by Americans within the career of one man. 
So, this evening I take this opportunity to wish the best of luck to John Glenn and to Annie and to others of his family. 
I anxiously anticipate Discovery's safe return to Earth, and I extend my best wishes, and those of my wife Erma, to Senator Glenn and to Annie for many years of health and happiness after he returns to Earth and leaves the Halls of the Capitol behind. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Senator Glenn. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have recently read several articles in the press which are cause for concern. One such article appeared in the Sunday, October 4, edition of the Washington Post, titled `Bid to Trump Inquiry Shelved.' 
The piece discussed White House efforts to produce a letter signed by at least 34 Democratic Senators declaring that they would not vote to convict the President, should the House decide to write articles of impeachment. According to the report, Minority Leader Tom Daschle has discouraged such an attempt. 
I commend the Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, for his wise and judicious counsel on this matter. He has done the White House, he has done the President, he has done all Senators, and, indeed, the entire nation a great, great service. 
I am concerned about the ugly and very partisan tone that has enveloped many discussions of this matter, and about the extreme polarization which has already occurred. The House Judiciary Committee has voted to begin an impeachment inquiry. I have had nothing to say about that. I don't intend to have anything to say about that. This is the House's business. There is a constitutional process in place. That process has begun. The ball is in the field of the House of Representatives at this point. We here in the Senate should await the decision of the House of Representatives as to whether or not articles of impeachment will, indeed, be formulated. 
Senators may at some point have to sit as jurors. Let me say that again. Senators may at some point have to sit as jurors in this matter and will be required to take an oath before they do. I read this oath into the Record a few days ago. I want to read it again, because the Senate will shortly be going out, not to return at least until after the elections, and perhaps not until the new Congress convenes in January. 
To repeat this oath at this point, might be well advised. The Bible says, `a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver,' and so I think it is a good time to repeat this oath, which will be incumbent upon every Senator, should articles of impeachment come to this Chamber. Here it is: 
I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God. 
Note the word `impartial.' We all need to remember the solemn responsibility we may be required to shoulder. 
I would suggest by way of friendly advice to the White House, don't tamper with this jury. Don't tamper with this jury. I have been in Congress 46 years. I have been in this Senate 40 years. There are some people here who take their constitutional responsibilities very seriously. This will not be politics as usual if articles of impeachment come to this body. 
My friendly words of advice to my colleagues are these: We may have to sit as jurors. Don't let it be said that we allowed ourselves to be tampered with, no matter who attempts the tampering, no matter how subtle the attempt. How can we commit ourselves to vote for or against articles of impeachment without having seen them, without having heard the managers on the part of the House prosecute the articles, without having heard the impeached person's lawyers and representatives or even the impeached person himself make the defense? 
How can we as Senators, who will be prospective jurors, commit ourselves at this point, or at any point, as to how we will vote on such articles? We cannot do it and live up to the oath that we will be required to take. It is a solemn matter, it is not politics as usual, and I personally will resent--and I hope every other Senator will personally resent--any effort on the part of anybody in these United States to tamper with Senators as prospective jurors. I will personally resent it on behalf of the Senate and on behalf of the Constitution. I urge all Senators to be on their guard. 
There has been a great deal of gratuitous advice given by people on the outside, and some on the inside, who know very little, probably, about the history of impeachment, about the history of the Senate, about responsibilities of Senators under the Constitution in such an event. We don't know what the House may decide to include in articles of impeachment when and if they ever come to the Senate. There can be an inquiry by the House, yet never be any articles formulated. That is up to the House. But if the House decides to formulate articles of impeachment, we have no choice here in the Senate but to vote up or down. We can't amend such articles. We have no way of knowing what the House may consider to be an impeachable offense. An impeachable offense does not have to be an indictable offense at law. 
So I warn Senators, and I warn those at the other end of the avenue, to exercise the utmost care lest somebody be unjustly prejudiced because of tongues that wag too easily and too early. 
I also condemn the circus atmosphere which has overtaken this city. There are attack dogs on both sides, on the talk shows and in the press, and their wild and rabid rhetoric is hardly contributing to an atmosphere of reason or respect. I believe that everyone must stop playing for advantage. And by that, I mean Republicans and Democrats alike; I mean people at both ends of the avenue and in between. 
If the Senate votes on impeachment articles, that will be the most solemn, the most sobering, and the most far-reaching vote that Senators in this body will ever cast. Voting for a declaration of war does not compete with voting to convict or not to convict a President. We won't be voting to convict a Federal judge and to remove that judge from office. In this case, it would be the ultimate vote on the ultimate question that could ever face this Senate. So I say to my colleagues: Be careful. 
Mr. President, just to illustrate how close we are to making a total farce of the situation, I note that Larry Flynt, publisher of a magazine called Hustler, has offered $1 million to anyone who will come forward with evidence of a sexual liaison with a Member of Congress or other high-ranking official. How much lower can we go? Now, that makes a farce of the Constitution. 
Such tactics and countertactics only serve to convince the people of this Nation that whatever course we eventually take will amount to nothing more than partisan politics at its very worst. Now, we all play partisan politics, but this is one thing that won't bear touching with partisan politics on either side, Republican or Democrat. This is the Constitution which we have sworn that we will support and defend. One may say, well, there is no impeachable offense. This is something we don't know. If Senators commit themselves prematurely and then find, in reading the articles, that there is one article that is very, very difficult to vote against, it may be your own seat that you are imperiling. 
I urge all Senators, many of whom are going home to stand for reelection, to avoid making commitments on this matter and to resist lobbying attempts, no matter how subtle, and no matter who attempts to lobby them. We must resist pressure from all sides. 
The people are watching. This should not, this cannot, this must not, become bad, boring, beltway `politics as usual.' This is a matter in which partisan politics should play no role. I say this to my Republican friends as well. There is far, far too much at stake for the President, for the Presidency, for the system of separation of powers, for Members of Congress, and for our country as well.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with the new school year now in full swing, our youngsters are brimming with the excitement of making new friends, radiating enthusiasm for new studies, and preparing for the challenges that lie ahead of them. Students are tackling new reading assignments and committing algebraic formulas to memory. During recess hour, they are frolicking in the school playground with new classmates and old friends, enjoying the waning days of shirt-sleeve weather. They feel safe and secure--free from threatening situations and out of harm's way. 
But as our children leave home each morning for the school day, we as parents, grandparents, educators, and legislators, must regretfully remember that, just a few months ago, some of our nation's schools looked more like virtual war zones with bloodshed and the tragic loss of life. From Paducah, KY, to Springfield, OR, the notion of schools as a safe haven was shattered by the sound of gunfire, and we must now begin to face the formidable challenge of rebuilding that serene and tranquil school environment that each and every student deserves. 
Today, responding to my concerns about this trend, I am unveiling a new branch of my web site which contains the most up-to-date and accurate information available from authoritative sources on school safety. I have designed this web site to be an electronic resource book, complete with descriptions of school safety initiatives underway in West Virginia, updates on federal funding available for violence prevention efforts, and the latest information on legislation moving through the Congress. I hope that this addition to my web site will serve as an important tool for parents, students, educators, and lawmakers in addressing the issue of school safety in West Virginia and in other States. 
In concert with the release of my school safety resources web site, I am also introducing companion legislation in the Senate today to Representative Bob Wise's recently introduced legislation, H.R. 4515, to provide for the establishment of school violence prevention hotlines. Often, a potentially harmful student confides in his closest friend about his intentions to launch a violent attack on school premises. Or perhaps, teachers notice a change in a student's demeanor or an action completely uncharacteristic of a happy, well-balanced child. Occasionally, the parents of an otherwise cheerful, amicable son or daughter detect hostility in their child's voice when talking about a particular group of students. All of these scenarios may be just a bad day on the surface or semantics misinterpreted, but they also may be the first signs of a potentially threatening student. 
My legislation would provide funds to local education agencies and schools that have established or proposed to establish school violence prevention hotlines. It is essential that parents, students, and teachers have an outlet where they can report threatening situations to authorities who will watch over the student's behavior and alert school officials. School violence hotlines can prevent a disturbed student in need of help from taking that next, sometimes fatal, step. 
I have long been concerned about the increasing incidence of violence in the classroom and have supported numerous efforts to combat this kind of outrageous behavior and strengthen discipline for all students. After receiving a disturbing report in 1990 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which stated that nearly twenty-four percent of West Virginia's students between grades nine and twelve carried a gun, knife, or other weapon to school at least once during that year for self-protection or use in a fight, I began looking for ways to better address the problem of school violence. In 1994, when Congress passed the Improving America's Schools Act in an effort to reauthorize and improve the existing Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I offered two amendments aimed at reducing the level of school violence. 
First, the Congress adopted my proposal directing local school districts to refer to the criminal justice system any student who brings a weapon to school. Possession of a weapon on school property is a crime, and when a crime occurs, the police should be notified. While school discipline is an appropriate and essential first step in reprimanding a student for such a violation, it is simply not enough. Possession of a firearm on school grounds is an outrage and a true impediment to the environment that teachers are striving to foster. 
The second amendment that I authored in 1994, which was approved by Congress, required the U.S. Secretary of Education to conduct the first major study of violence in schools since 1978. In July of this year, the National Center for Education Statistics, in concert with the Department of Education, released the results of this study, which was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,234 regular public, elementary, middle, and secondary schools in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
In a snapshot of the 1996-1997 school year, the study revealed that, with more than half of U.S. public schools reporting at least one crime incident, and one in ten schools reporting at least one serious violent crime during that school year, violence continues to beset schools across this country, all too often resulting in fatal situations. 
Back in my day, no student would have considered such lawless and unruly behavior. We knew right from wrong, as it was instilled in us from our parents, sometimes with the aid of a switch that we were made to fetch ourselves. We were told that the classroom was a sacred precinct. I was told that if I got a whipping at school I would get a thrashing at home. 
The classroom was a place where quiet prevailed and where students cherished the opportunity they had to learn, and that was the attitude we adopted. Unfortunately, today, students, many of them it seems, must be threatened by an impending obligation before the criminal justice system to make them behave and, often, even that has proven inadequate in keeping guns out of the hands of children and off school properties. Mr. President, what is it going to take to keep our students safe--metal detectors in every elementary and secondary school in the nation? Is that the direction in which our country is headed? 
In the wake of reports of violence and tragedy at schools across the country, Congress is, once again, honing in on the issue of school safety. In more recent efforts, as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations Bill, the Senate approved $210 million for a new national safe schools initiative to assist community-level efforts. Of that funding, $175 million is to increase community policing in and around schools. 
Just a few weeks ago, as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Labor/Health and Human Services,/Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out legislation which contains more than $150 million for a comprehensive school safety initiative to support activities that promote safe learning environments for students. Such activities may include targeted assistance, training for 
teachers and school security officers, and enhancing the capacity of schools to provide mental health services to troubled youth. 
Since the release of the 1990 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, my home state of West Virginia has made great strides in addressing school violence, and is setting a true precedent for communities around the country in helping to establish safe schools which support learning for all children and the professionals who teach them. According to the West Virginia Department of Education, incidents involving a weapon have decreased by sixty-nine percent during the years 1994 through 1997, perhaps, in large part, due to short- and long-term initiatives underway in the State of West Virginia. 
Mr. President, our nation has been grappling with the issue of improved school safety for years, and I am frankly alarmed that American school children continue to face increasing crime and violence. It is time to stop wringing our hands over this issue and take action. 
We have a school system today run in many instances by hoodlums who are converting sacred temples for learning into terror camps with innocent children becoming casualties in scholastic `free fire' zones. We have teachers working in fear, too anxious even to teach their students properly. We must get guns out of the schools and put an end to this sense of panic which is pervading our nation's elementary and secondary education system. I am hopeful that these initiatives we have promulgated in the Senate this year will begin the mission of setting our nation back on track. 
One of the most important things that we can provide to our children is the opportunity for a good education. I was afforded the opportunity to obtain a good, solid education back when I was a student attending class in a two-room schoolhouse. Today, we have mammoth schools, with all kinds of high-tech equipment, computers, and amenities that I never had or had never even heard of, or couldn't even imagine in those years. Yet our students are not learning. We owe our young people today the chance to learn and excel in an environment free from guns, knives, and other weapons. 
One of the National Education Goals, as included in the Goals 2000 legislation enacted in 1994, states `all schools in America will be free of drugs and violence and the unauthorized presence of firearms and alcohol, and offer a disciplined environment that is conducive to learning by the year 2000.' To accomplish that goal--it is almost going to be impossible--we must send a message loud and clear that we will not tolerate weapons in our schools. 
Protecting our children is not simply a matter of public policy. It is a matter of basic values, of teaching children right from wrong and punishing those who insist on doing wrong, of instilling them with respect for the law and providing them with limitations. Students must know that they will be punished for doing the wrong thing, or for choosing the bad route. 
Mr. President, in the blink of an eye, we have lost the lives of precious young children to school violence--children who may have grown to be teachers, doctors, businessmen and women, and perhaps even future Senators. We in Congress have a responsibility to stop this deadly trend from striking other innocent families. The time has long since come and gone for decency and sanity to re-enter the schoolhouse door--let's get moving. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as all Senators are aware, at midnight on Wednesday, September 30, Fiscal Year 1998 expired. And with the expiration of the fiscal year came some most welcome and almost unbelievable news that, for the first time since 1969, the unified Federal budget was in surplus for Fiscal Year 1998. We do not know the exact figures yet. That will not be known until the Treasury Department completes its calculations of actual revenues and expenditures that occurred up through midnight, September 30, but we do know that the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office of that unified budget surplus is $63 billion. The President has announced that the official administration projection of the Fiscal Year 1998 unified budget surplus is about $70 billion. This unified budget surplus, whether it be $63 billion, or $70 billion, or some other figure, is a result of a dramatic turnaround from the massive budget deficits that were projected just a few short years ago. 
Who should be given the lion's share of the credit for this dramatic turnaround in the country's fiscal fortunes? The President wants to claim a large share of the credit. The Republican-led Congress likes to say that things did not really change until they took over control of the House and Senate, and that they deserve the majority of the credit. Many financial analysts give a substantial amount of the credit to the policies of the Federal Reserve, which have attempted to manage the country's fiscal fortunes through adjustments in interest rates. 
Suffice it to say, credit should be given to all of the above. Speaking from first-hand experience, I believe that Congress does deserve substantial credit for the turnaround from the triple-digit-hundred-billion-dollar deficits of the twelve years under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Those triple-digit deficits accumulated to the point where the nation's debt rose from just under $1 trillion on the day that President Reagan took office to more than $4,097,000,000,000 on the day that President Bush left office. In other words, in the entire history of the country, from the day that President George Washington took office to the day that President Reagan took office, the nation's accumulated debt amounted to less than $1 trillion. Twelve years later--the day that President Bush left office, it stood at $4,097,000,000,000. 
Throughout the period of the 1980s, Congress attempted to rein in these massive Federal deficits, for example, with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequester mechanism that was part of the 1985 Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. This mechanism, Senators may recall, required an across-the-board sequester of all Federal programs (with few exceptions) sufficient to bring down any deficits that exceeded those provided for in annual budget resolutions. In 1990, it became clear that the sequester that would be necessary to achieve the requirements of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings would have decimated the entire Federal establishment, including a cut in the budget of the Department of Defense ranging between 25 and 35 percent. Rather than allowing those sequesters to proceed, Congress and the Bush Administration had no choice but to convene what turned out to be a very lengthy and difficult budget summit. I participated in that summit, as did a number of my Senate colleagues who are still in the Senate--Senators Domenici and Gramm, for example. After many months, including weekends and around-the-clock sessions at Andrews Air Force Base, that summit resulted in substantial changes in our budget discipline which have played a positive role in helping to rein in Federal deficits since their inception in 1990. 
Under those mechanisms, sequesters of not only discretionary funds take place when so-called discretionary caps are exceeded, but also, for the first time, mandatory programs are under a pay-go system as well. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, any new mandatory spending must be fully offset. That 1990 Act also put in place a process for considering emergency spending, which is allowed to go forward outside the budgetary caps, if such spending is declared an emergency by both Congress and the President. 
By and large, that emergency mechanism, I believe, has been beneficial and has been used in accordance with the intentions of the summiteers. That emergency designation is allowed for spending outside the caps for events that are sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent. Such events include natural disasters, military deployments around the world, and so forth. 
The fact that the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act has been successful is not just the opinion of this Senator. It is shared by many, including the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, who in recent testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, made the following statement in relation to that legislation, and I quote:  
I think that--frankly, much to my surprise, as I think I have indicated to you over the years, that the budgetary processes, which were put into place by the Congress a number of years ago, have worked far better than I would have ever anticipated them working. And I would be quite chagrined if we abandoned them because when you have a good thing, it seems rather pointless to dismantle it. 
I think those words by Mr. Greenspan are right on the mark. 
Subsequent to the 1990 changes in the Budget Act and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, I believe that credit should also be given to those who voted for the 1993 budget package which passed each House of Congress by a one-vote margin and without a single vote from the Republican side of either body. That package was anathema to the Republicans. Yet, despite the dire predictions of economic doom which came from the Republican side of the aisle at the time, the economy has performed very, very well ever since the enactment of that legislation. All of those who have been involved in reducing Federal deficits can be justifiably proud of what is now a unified budget surplus for Fiscal Year 1998 in excess of $60 billion. 
But, while we are basking in the glow of high praise and compliments all around, we must also take a heavy dose of realism. For reasons that I shall now attempt to explain in some detail, this is not the time to abandon the fiscal discipline we have undertaken for a number of years. I believe very strongly that any budget surpluses in the coming decade should be used for retiring the Federal debt, rather than for massive tax cuts or increases in Federal spending. 
Mr. President, on July 15, 1998, the Congressional Budget Office issued its summer baseline projections for Fiscal Years 1998-2008 for the unified Federal budget. Now, let me stop here and explain what the term `unified Federal budget' means. The unified Federal budget includes not only the operating budget of the various departments and agencies throughout the Federal government, but it also includes the Postal Service and--get this--Trust Fund surpluses, the most important one of which is--guess what--the Social Security Trust Fund. By including these Trust Fund surpluses in the unified budget, one ignores the fact that none of the Trust Fund surpluses is available for anything other than the purposes for which the Trust Funds were 
established. In other words, it is to a large extent misleading and certainly amounts to budgetary wizardry to count these Trust Fund surpluses when one says that there is an overall unified Federal budget surplus. Nevertheless, for the moment, let us talk about what has happened to the projections of our Congressional Budget Office experts as far as they relate to the unified Federal budget between the period March 15, 1998, and July 15, 1998. 
The unified budget surplus projections for the 11-year period 1998-2008 provided to Congress in March of this year by the Congressional Budget Office totaled $679 billion. 
Let me say that again. 
The unified budget surplus projections for the 11-year period 1998-2008 provided to Congress in March of this year by the Congressional Budget Office totaled $679 billion. 
By July 15, 1998, just 4 months after its March 1998 projections, the Congressional Budget Office sent to Congress its summer report, which I have. In that report, CBO projects that unified budget surpluses for the period 1998-2008 will total more than $1.6 trillion. That is a change of some $932 billion in surplus projections for the next 11 years. So over a period of just 120 days, from March 15, 1998, to July 15, 1998, the Congressional Budget Office changed its projections of unified budget surpluses for the next 11 years from $679 billion to $1.611 trillion. 
What caused the Congressional Budget Office, our premier independent budgetary experts, to make such a massive change in budget surplus projections in such a short time? The best that we have been able to determine is that the largest the contributor to the upward revision of future surpluses resulted in a change in CBO's treatment of revenues. Previously, CBO had argued that there had been a surge of unexpected revenues in the recent past, but that such surge was temporary. Now they argue that there are good reasons to think that this unexpected surge in revenues will continue indefinitely. This results in an ad hoc addition of approximately $50 billion each year of the latest 11-year budget forecast. 
Does this mean, Mr. President, that the Congressional Budget Office is inept and that perhaps the Congress should seek the services of another budget prognosticator? Certainly not. Rather, my purpose in highlighting this significant change in estimates is to support my belief that, in all decisions affecting revenue and spending for future years, we must tread carefully on the planks of budgetary estimation. Like an old man crossing a footbridge strung over a chasm, only a small misstep can mean the difference between a successful crossing and spectacular failure. 
CBO would be the first to tell you that they have consistently missed budgetary forecasts, as has the Office of Management and Budget. That is to be expected. No human being can ever predict accurately what revenues will come into the Treasury in a given year, or what expenditures will go out of the Treasury, or what the unemployment rate will be, or what the inflation rate will be, or whether there will be a recession, or the duration and virility of recessions. In short, Mr. President, there is no reason to believe that the CBO's current forecast of the budgetary picture over the upcoming 10 years will be any more accurate than have been its previous forecasts. Also, very importantly, Senators should remember that budgetary estimates can rapidly change and they can change for the worst, just as they have turned for the better in recent years. We saw this firsthand during the early 1990s when we suffered a severe and lengthy recession; there is no reason to think that it cannot happen again. There is no reason to think that it will not happen again. Consider the remarks of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, again, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at a recent hearing by the Senate Budget Committee. This is what he said:  
According to CBO's figures, a recession comparable to the 1991 downturn would eliminate the unified surplus and create a budget deficit of more than $50 billion within 2 years. Over the next 10 years, more than half of the $1.5 trillion in projected unified surpluses would be eliminated. 
That was Mr. Greenspan talking. 
With this in mind, we should never underestimate just how unpredictable and capricious budget projections can be. 
In virtually every CBO report, cautionary statements are made, such as the following, which is included in the CBO's most recent budget update: 
. . . there is a risk that future events will cause a significant divergence from the path laid out in the new forecast. The economy could be more adversely affected by the Asian crisis than CBO assumes; the tightness of the labor market could cause a significant jump in the rate of inflation; or the stock market could drop precipitously. 
We have seen that happen all too many times of late. 
Conversely, the Asian crisis could have little additional effect on the United States; productivity growth might remain higher than CBO anticipates, which would permit a continuation of rapid noninflationary growth and stronger profits; or labor force participation rates might again increase rapidly, easing pressures on the labor market for a few years. Such alternative outcomes could have a substantial effect on the budget, increasing or decreasing its bottom line by $100 billion or more in a single year. 
That is the end of the quotation. 
To this point, Mr. President, I have concentrated my remarks on the `unified Federal budget', which, as I stated earlier, combines not only the operating budget of all Federal departments and agencies, but also the Postal Service and Trust Fund surpluses. In so doing, the unified Federal budget hides from view the question of whether, in its operations, the Federal budget is in deficit or is in surplus. 
Let us now look at a couple of other Federal budget calculations that are available to us through the Congressional Budget Office. What, for example, are CBO's baseline projections for the next 5 years for on-budget deficits or surpluses? On-budget calculations, it should be noted, exclude Social Security surpluses and the Postal Service, which, I might add, are supposed to be treated as off-budget by law. CBO's on-budget calculations project that we will suffer deficits for Fiscal Years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003. In other words, if one leaves Social Security surpluses and the Postal Service out of the budget calculations, there is no surplus at all until the year 2002, at which time CBO says there will be a $1 billion on-budget surplus. 
Let me read that again. CBO's on-budget calculations project that we will suffer deficits for Fiscal Years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003. In other words, if one leaves Social Security surpluses--we are talking about Social Security surpluses. We are talking about something that interests a lot of people, something that involves millions of people in this country, something that is of concern to the great mass of people out there, old and young, women, men, children--if one leaves Social Security surpluses 
and the Postal Service out of the budget calculations, there is no surplus at all until the year 2002, at which time CBO says there will be a $1 billion on-budget surplus. Deficits for the other fiscal years total $138 billion. Therefore, over the coming 5 budget years, CBO projects that, if we exclude Social Security surpluses and the Postal Service--if we exclude them--we will suffer deficits in 4 of those years totaling $138 billion and a surplus of only $1 billion in one year--2002--making a net on-budget deficit over the next 5 years of $137 billion. 
Hence, it becomes obvious that for the next 5 years, there is no Federal budget surplus at all if one excludes Social Security and the Postal Service from the calculation. In fact, there is a net deficit of over $130 billion. 
Now, let us take a look at CBO's calculations of what is called, in budgetary terminology, the `Federal Funds Budget.' This budget, by definition, excludes not only Social Security and the Postal Service but all Trust Funds. In other words, the Federal funds budget excludes Social Security, the Postal Service, the Highway Trust Funds, the Airport and Airway Trust Funds, the Medicare Trust Funds, the Civil Service and Military Retirement Trust Funds, the Unemployment Trust Funds, and many, many more. CBO's projections are that we will have Federal funds deficits for 9 of the next 10 years. For that period, Fiscal Years 1999-2008, Federal funds deficits are projected to total $592.2 billion. Over that period, only the year 2008 is projected to show a small surplus. 
What this means is that when all obligations of the Federal Government are taken into account, including the IOUs to all Federal Trust Funds, we will not have any surplus until the year 2008--even if these new, rosy CBO forecasts come true, and even if Congress restrains itself from spending any of those projected surpluses or cutting taxes. 
Now, let us shift our attention to a discussion of the National Debt. Federal Debt is divided into two categories--namely, Debt Held by the Public and Debt Held by Government Trust Funds. Under present policies, CBO's latest projections show that Debt Held by the Public will decrease from $3.7 trillion in 1998 to $2.3 trillion in 2008. 
This is so because Debt Held by the Public does not include any of the debt owed by the Treasury to Federal Trust Funds. Therefore, if CBO's $1.6 trillion in projected unified budget surpluses come to pass, those surpluses will go toward reducing Debt Held by the Public. However, Debt Held in Government Trust Funds will rise, according to CBO, from $1.8 trillion in 1998 to $3.9 trillion in 2008. In other words, the surpluses in the Government Trust Funds that I have previously named will continue to grow and add to the debt owed by the U.S. Treasury to those Trust Funds. When one combines both types of Federal debt, namely, Debt Held by the Public and Debt Held in Government Trust Funds, one arrives at what is known as Gross Federal Debt. This, to me, represents the truest picture of the debts being incurred by the Federal Government that will eventually have to be paid. CBO projects that Gross Federal Debt will rise from $5.475 trillion in 1998 to $6.222 trillion in the year 2008. In other words, even if all of the projected surpluses of CBO come true over the next 11 years, and even if all of the $1.6 trillion in projected budget surpluses come true, we will still face a massive mountain of Gross Federal Debt which will have grown from $5.5 trillion to $6.2 trillion over this same period. 
Mr. President, I have attempted in these remarks to paint a realistic picture of the condition of the Federal budget, including a true picture of whether we are incurring deficits or surpluses and whether we are increasing or decreasing overall Federal debt in the coming 10 years. It should be perfectly clear to any rational person that there is no real surplus and that, even if CBO's latest 10-year forecast proves to be accurate and if Congress restrains itself from cutting taxes--there is a great hue and cry, a great push for cutting taxes--even if Congress restrains itself from cutting taxes or increasing spending, Gross Federal Debt will continue to rise by some $700 billion, even under CBO's rosy scenarios. Furthermore, this could all change massively, as I have pointed out, with one recession like the one suffered by the Nation in the early 1990s. 
It is against this backdrop that the House recently passed what they call the `Taxpayer Relief Act of 1998.' According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this House-passed tax cut would reduce Federal revenues by $80 billion over the next 5 years and by $176 billion over the next 10 years. Keep in mind that tax cuts, once enacted, are permanent and the loss in revenues to the U.S. Treasury continue not just for 5, 10, or 15 years, but forever, unless they are repealed. 
So, if the Congress lost its collective mind, and if the President joined Congress in losing our collective mind and signed such a reduction in revenues, those permanent tax cuts would come to pass regardless of whether CBO's latest projections of unified budget surpluses come true or not. Furthermore, we should keep in mind that over the next 5 years, there is no budget surplus at all--none--if one excludes the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses from the calculations. In effect then, the House-passed tax bill uses Social Security to pay for its $80 billion, 5-year cost to the Treasury. 
We should also keep in mind that the Gross Federal Debt is going to continue to rise even without any tax cut. It follows that such a tax cut would increase the Federal debt by $80 billion over the next 5 years; by $176 billion over the next 10 years; and by ever-increasing amounts each year thereafter. 
It should be noted, Mr. President, that the House-passed tax cut bill is in direct violation of the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act. That Act, as I stated earlier in my remarks, requires that any increase in mandatory spending or any tax cuts must be fully offset under what is called the `Pay-As-You-Go' rules. Those rules, which have been wisely extended through the year 2006 by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997, allow for a point of order against any such un-offset tax cut. This means that the House-passed tax bill when, and if it comes before the Senate, will be subject to a 60-vote point of order. 
I hope that Senators will come to their senses on both sides of the aisle and do what they know is right for the American people and vote against any tax bill that reduces Federal revenues, keeping in mind that even if all of the projected surpluses of CBO come true over the next 11 years, and even if all of those surpluses are applied to the Federal debt, we will still have massive Gross Federal Debt, which will grow from $5.5 trillion to $6.2 trillion over this same period. To fritter away billions of dollars at this time on massive tax cuts would be the height of irresponsibility and would signal to all the world that we cannot be relied upon to rid this great Nation of not only its deficits, but also its gigantic national debt as well. And that should be our solemn goal. It is ironic that after struggling mightily to overcome the 12 years of recordbreaking, triple-digit-billion-dollar Federal budget deficits under Reagan and Bush, the Republicans are now calling for cutting Federal revenues by huge amounts based on what could turn out to be flimsy projections by the Congressional Budget Office, which, even if they come true, will have done little more than put a small dent--just a small dent--in overall Federal debt. 
Mr. President, you do not need any poll to do the right thing here. I say to Senators, this is a no brainer. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Senate Concurrent Resolution offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. In brief, the resolution calls for action by the U.S. government on several fronts to address the steel import crisis. More importantly, it reassures the U.S. steel industry, and steel workers, that the United States Congress is concerned about the state of the steel industry and is committed to ensuring that a fair trade policy prevails. 
The aim of this resolution is straightforward: to respond to the import crisis affecting the domestic steel industry. In this regard, the Senate Concurrent Resolution calls for enforcement of U.S. trade laws, equitable sharing of steel import surpluses, the establishment of a task force to monitor U.S. imports of steel, and a report from the President with a plan to respond to the surge of steel imports. 
Senator Specter's resolution is a companion to H. Con Res. 328. The resolution is supported by the leadership of the Senate Steel Caucus and it is endorsed by the domestic steel industry. 
For those not familiar with the steel import crisis, as the markets have struggled in Asia, Russia, and other regions of the world, and the purchasing power evaporates within these countries' borders, foreign steel producers are diverting record levels of steel products from stalling economies into the United States. Desperate to find hard currency, our trading partners are flooding the U.S. market with imported steel that is creating a glut that is placing thousands of U.S. steel jobs at risk. This is a looming crisis that could have a domino effect, which may jeopardize the security of families across the nation and the communities in which they live. 
Regrettably, the impact of current trade and capital flow throughout the so-called modern global economy is becoming a familiar story. The effects of far-flung economic trouble not only play havoc with the U.S. steel industry, but also ripple through the auto industry, the farming industry, and a host of other domestic industries. 
Live and let live? Is that the appropriate U.S. reaction to this crisis? 
Through the International Monetary Fund, the United States reacts to the crises of our trading partners overseas with generous participation in bailout programs. We have risen to the occasion many times to help other nations facing grave economic dilemmas. But, can we afford to continue to help if our trading partners thank us by attempting to export their way out of their crises at the expense of the U.S. economy? 
I would like to share one sentiment expressed to me about this situation in a letter by Mr. Jim Bowen, President of the West Virginia AFL-CIO: `Working Americans have always generously helped out those in need, but they can't be expected to do so by sacrificing their jobs and their families' security.' And hear the words of Mr. Stephen Parks, a manager with Ameristeel in St. Albans, West Virginia: `We are cost-competitive with the best in the world. But we cannot compete fairly with foreign economies driven by the impetus to export their own unemployment through subsidization or which export solely for the purpose of acquiring tradeable currency at any cost.' 
Many of my colleagues have recently urged action on behalf of the nation's farmers. I certainly sympathize with the problems facing American farmers whose overseas markets have been adversely affected by these same economic downturns. This is no less a crisis, and, equally, deserves swift and sure action by the Congress. As this Congress begins the serious business of examining the international financial crisis, and formulating the appropriate U.S. response, the measures called for in this resolution are simple logic. After hearing the words of managers and workers in the U.S. steel industry, I believe that this resolution might also accomplish another worthy goal: restoring the confidence in our international trade agenda. 
Let us be realistic. This international steel crisis did not occur overnight. In fact, the crisis is in part a result of decades-long government-sponsored illegal subsidies by our trading partners that this nation has not aggressively sought to correct. These subsidies have kept too many steel producers around the world eagerly fostering overcapacity because of unfair competitive advantages. Now, not only are the steel producers in Asia, Russia, and other parts of the world suffering, but so are American steel workers, who have played fair, and trusted our trade enforcement mechanisms. 
As called for in the resolution being submitted today, we must move forward with the full and timely enforcement of our trade laws. We must do that before any serious thought is given to the adoption of trade measures to liberalize trade with additional nations not currently on the books. Existing trade agreements must be enforced and the long-term implications of these agreements must be understood. I hope that the responsible government trade officials share my concern. 
I understand that the United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, met with 
steel industry representatives in early September and, while I was unable to attend that meeting, I am advised that in her press release the Ambassador reaffirmed the Administration's `commitment to strong U.S. trade laws designed to prevent injury to U.S. industry and workers from unfair trade practices and from import surges, and to the expeditious and effective enforcement of these laws.' I was pleased to learn of these encouraging words from the Ambassador, and I hope that she will be successful in carrying out this agenda. 
In this regard, I believe that this Congress should assist USTR in moving this agenda forward. Let us help the Ambassador by stating clearly to our trading partners the Congress' stance on this matter. I am confident that Ambassador Barshefsky intends to negotiate the deal of all deals. In good faith, she intends to negotiate a global free trade paradise where all can compete on a level and transparent playing field. 
Unfortunately, I have heard that very intent voiced many times by U.S. and foreign negotiators--and so have the U.S. steel workers. They heard it in 1974, during the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). That agreement cost this country hundreds of thousands of steel jobs. Many listeners may remember the result that deal had on Allentown. Well, I also remember Clarksburg, Wheeling, and Weirton, West Virginia, all losers in that trade agreement.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee in the Senate. Let me commend him and his committee for reporting this bill. That committee has worked long and hard and very industriously in an effort to craft legislation that, in its final analysis, goes a long way toward protecting the prerogatives of the Senate under the Constitution, in particular with reference to the appointments clause, which appears in article II, section 2, of the Constitution. 
Madam President, nearly two weeks ago, on September 15th, I had the high privilege of addressing my colleagues in the Old Senate Chamber as part of the Leadership Lecture Series sponsored by the distinguished Majority Leader. In my remarks, I emphasized two points which I thought were important for all Senators to consider. First, I maintained that, if the legislative branch were to remain a coequal branch of our government, then it must be eternally vigilant in protecting the powers and responsibilities vested in it by the Constitution. Secondly, I noted that, throughout its history, the Senate has been blessed with individuals who were willing to rise above party politics, and instead act in the best interest of this nation and this institution. 
The legislation before us today goes to precisely the type of concern I raised in my remarks. S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, would strengthen existing law, thus protecting the Senate's constitutional `Advice and Consent' role in the process of nominating and appointing the principal officers of our government. And, because this bill speaks to the very integrity of the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances embedded in our Constitution, it is a measure which I believe all Senators can support, regardless of party affiliation. 
To give my colleagues some idea of the dimensions of this problem, earlier this year, I asked my staff to survey the various cabinet-level departments to ascertain how many of these so-called `advice and consent' positions were being filled in violation of the Vacancies Act. I can report that the trend is disturbing: Of the 320 departmental positions subject to Senate confirmation, 59, or fully 18 percent, were being filled in violation of the Vacancies Act. At the Department of Labor, for example, one-third of all advice and consent positions were being filled in violation of the Vacancies Act. At the Department of Commerce, 9 of 29, or 31 percent, of those positions were being filled in violation of the Act. And, at the Department of Justice, 14 percent of the advice and consent positions were being filled by individuals in contradiction of the Vacancies Act. Clearly a problem exists. 
As my colleagues know, the process used by the President to staff the executive branch is laid out in the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. That clause, found in Article II, section 2, states, in part, that the President 
. . . shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments. 
Because vacancies in these advice and consent positions may arise from time to time when the Senate is not in session, the Constitution also provides that 
The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session. 
Madam President, in an effort to secure the Senate's constitutional authority under the Appointments Clause, Congress established a statutory scheme that lays out not only the order of succession to be followed should one of these senior positions become vacant, but which also sets a strict limit on the length of time an individual may temporarily fill such a position. That legislation, which has been in place since July of 1868, is known as the Vacancies Act, and is codified in sections 3345 through 3349 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. 
For those who may not be familiar with the Vacancies Act, this is the essence of what it says. First, section 3345 provides that if the head of an executive department--a member of the President's Cabinet, for example--dies, resigns, or is otherwise sick or absent, his or her first assistant shall perform the duties of that office until a successor is appointed. Second, section 3346 states that when a subordinate officer--generally those positions at the deputy and assistant secretary levels--dies, resigns, or is otherwise sick or absent, that officer's first assistant also moves up to take over the duties of the office until a successor is appointed. And third, despite either of those self-executing methods for temporarily filling a vacant position, section 3347 authorizes the President to direct any other officer, whose appointment is subject to Senate confirmation, to exercise the duties of the vacant office. In any event, absent a recess appointment, those three sections of the Vacancies Act provide the exclusive statutory means of temporarily filling a vacant advice and consent position. 
But whichever method is used--either automatic succession, as contained in sections 3345 and 3346, or presidential selection, as contained in section 3347, Madam President, the key to protecting the Senate's constitutional role in the appointments process lies in section 3348 of the Vacancies Act. That section plainly states that, should one of these positions become vacant due to death or resignation, it shall not be filled on a temporary basis for more than 120 days, unless a nomination is pending before the Senate. Originally, Madam President, when the legislation was enacted in 1868, the period of time was only 10 days. And then in 1891 that period was extended to 30 days. And in 1988 that period was extended to 120 days. 
It is precisely that time restriction on the filling of these vacant positions that is, I believe, the linchpin of this issue. Without that barrier, without the 120-day limitation on the length of time a vacancy may be temporarily filled, no President need ever forward a nomination to the U.S. Senate. Instead, the President--any President, Democrat or Republican--can staff the executive branch with `acting' officials, who may occupy the vacant position for months, or even years at a time, as the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. Thompson, has already alluded to. 
In short, to eliminate the time constraint in the Vacancies Act, or to effectively eliminate it by tolerating noncompliance, is to wholly undermine the integrity of the U.S. Senate's constitutional advice and consent authority. So this is a serious matter. 
Yet, despite the seemingly plain language of this 130-year-old Act, the Department of Justice has challenged the force of the Act on the grounds that those provisions are not the only statutory means of filling a vacancy. In fact, for more than a quarter of a century, through Democratic administrations and Republican administrations, the Justice Department has simply refused to comply with the requirements of the Vacancies Act. Instead, the Department claims that the Act is somehow superceded by other statutes which give the Attorney General overall authority to run the Department of Justice. 
On December 17, 1997, I wrote to the Attorney General requesting clarification of the Department's position with respect to the Vacancies Act. Specifically, I wanted to know whether or not the Attorney General believed that this 130-year-old statute had any application to the Justice Department. On January 14 of this year I received a response to my letter in which the Department reiterated its position that the Attorney General's authority under 
sections 509 and 510 of Title 28 `. . . is independent of, and not subject to, the limits of the Vacancies Act.' 
For the benefit of those who have never read those two sections of Title 28, let me refer to the relevant language so that everyone will understand the fallacy of the Justice Department's argument. Section 509 states that, with certain exceptions that are not at issue here today, `all functions of other officers of the Department of Justice and all functions of agencies and employees of the Department of Justice are vested in the Attorney General. . . .' Section 510, meanwhile, states that `the Attorney General may from time to time make such provisions as he considers appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, employee, or agency of the Department of Justice of any function of the Attorney General.' 
Those two very broad, very general provisions--the first placing all functions of the Department under the control of the Attorney General, and the second allowing the Attorney General to delegate those functions--are being used to justify what amounts to an end run around the Vacancies Act, which is protective of the Senate's rights under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. 
As I have noted, defiance of the plain language of the Vacancies Act is not an isolated case. In 1973, for example, the Department of Justice refused to admit that L. Patrick Gray, who had been appointed acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation following the death of J. Edgar Hoover in May of 1972, was serving in that capacity in violation of the time limitation contained in the Vacancies Act. In 1982, the Department's Office of Legal Counsel dismissed out of hand--dismissed out of hand the restrictions of the Vacancies Act as simply `inapplicable' to the Department--meaning the Justice Department. In 1984, the Department again asserted that `. . . the specific provisions of 28 U.S.C. 510 override the more general provisions of the Vacancies Act.' And, in 1989, the Justice Department determined that the Vacancies Act `. . . does not extinguish other statutory authority for filling vacancies and that the Act's limitations do not apply to designations made pursuant to those authorities.' 
Madam President, I submit that that position is untenable, and is untenable for two simple reasons: First, there is no historical basis--absolutely none--for the suggestion that Congress ever meant sections 509 and 510 of Title 28 to exempt the Department of Justice from the requirements of the Vacancies Act. And, secondly, the logical extension of the Department's argument--now get this, the logical extension of the Department of Justice's argument would render meaningless--meaningless the entire advice and consent prerogative contained in the Appointments Clause, article II section 2, of the U.S. Constitution. 
Turning first to the Department's claim that sections 509 and 510 of Title 28 somehow preempt the Vacancies Act, I note that those provisions trace their origin to, and are a codification of, a 1950 congressional action known as Reorganization Plan No. 2. As my colleagues may know, throughout the 1950's, Congress passed a series of plans designed to reorganize the various executive branch departments. The purpose of Plan No. 2 was to establish direct lines of authority and responsibility within the Department of Justice, and to give the Attorney General overall responsibility for the effective and economic administration of the Department. 
However, there is nothing--I repeat, absolutely nothing--in the language of Plan No. 2 that would indicate that it was ever meant to supersede the Vacancies Act. On the contrary, as the Senate's report which accompanied the measure made clear at that time, and I quote from that committee report, `Plan No. 2 does not give to the Department of Justice any more powers, authority, functions or responsibilities than it now has.' What could be more clear? 
Finally, it is worth noting that the general language contained in Plan No. 2 is virtually identical to language found in the reorganization plans for the Departments of the Interior, Labor, Commerce, and Health and Human Services. In fact, every one of the 14 cabinet-level departments has these general provisions in its basic charter. Every one! Every one of the 14 cabinet-level departments. And it is precisely that common linguistic thread that leads to the second fatal flaw of the Justice Department's analysis. 
If we accept this fallacious argument--that these broad, housekeeping provisions somehow override, or are, in the Department's words, `independent of, and not subject to' the more specific provisions of the Vacancies Act--then any executive branch department--any executive branch department whose functions are vested in the department's head, who, in turn, can delegate those functions to subordinate officers, would be exempt from the provisions of the Vacancies Act. Of course, exemption from the Vacancies Act would then mean that an individual could be appointed to an advice and consent position for an indefinite period of time. Who thinks that the Founding Fathers meant for that to be? 
Consequently, to accept the position of the Department of Justice is to accept the position that the United States Senate--that is this body--with the concurrence of the House of Representatives, has systematically divested itself of its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to Presidential nominations. 
Madam President, I wonder how many Senators believe that. I wonder how many of my colleagues are prepared to accept such a specious argument. How many of my colleagues truly believe that the Senate has simply handed over one of the most effective checks against the abuse of executive power? How many will agree that we have given away what the Supreme Court has rightly characterized as `. . . among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme'? It was referring to the Appointments Clause in the Edmund v. United States case of 1997. 
I, for one, do not subscribe to that specious argument, nor do I believe that any other Senator would support such a contention. 
After all, don't we swear an oath, `so help me God,' to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, before we enter into office? 
At the same time, it is not fair to say the fault for this situation lies entirely in the executive branch; a part of it lies with us. An honest assessment of this matter will show that Congress must bear a good deal of the responsibility for its failure to aggressively demand strict compliance with the provisions of the Vacancies Act. 
For 46 years I have been in the Congress, and I have noticed a steady decline in the desire, the willpower, and the determination of Members of Congress to speak out in protection of the powers of the legislative branch. 
When I came here it wasn't like that, but more and more and more, it seems that there is an inability, or at least an unwillingness, on the part of Congress to stand up in support of its constitutional powers against the executive branch and those in the executive branch who would make incursions into and upon the constitutional powers of the Congress. 
Each of us, individually and collectively, must concede that this institution, this Senate, and the other body, have been less than strenuous in protecting the constitutional rights and powers of the legislative branch. 
Congress did, of course, make an attempt to assert the supremacy of the Vacancies Act when it last amended the statute some 10 years ago. That was the second year of the 100th Congress. I was majority leader in the Senate at that time, and on April 20, 1988, the Senate's Committee on Governmental Affairs, in a report accompanying a broader bill of which the Vacancies Act amendments were a part, stated thusly:  
. . . the present language, however old, makes clear that the Vacancies Act is the exclusive authority for the temporary appointment, designation, or assignment of one officer to perform the duties of another whose appointment requires Senate confirmation. The exclusive authority of the Vacancies Act would only be overcome by specific statutory language providing some other means for filling vacancies. As such, the Committee expressly rejects the rationale and conclusions of other interpretations of the meaning and history of the Vacancies Act. . . . 
That was the language that was contained in the 1988 committee report. 
And yet, despite that language, it remains a fact that the Vacancies Act has not been complied with. As a result, the time has come, and the time is now, for Congress to take the matter into its own hands and address the situation foursquare, right head on. That is what we are attempting to do here. I believe that S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, is the vehicle that will accomplish that goal. 
This bill was introduced on June 16 by Senators Thompson, Thurmond, Lott, Roth, and myself. Three months before, on March 16, I had introduced S. 1761, the Federal Vacancies Compliance Act. Although my bill took a slightly different approach, I believe it is fair to say that it served as a basis for the bill before us today. I was privileged, through the courtesy of the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Thompson, to be the lead witness at the March 18 hearing held by the Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Levin was there; Senator Glenn was there; Senator Durbin was there; and other Senators, I believe. 
This legislation here today is the result of months of study, months of discussion, and months of difficult negotiation. By extending the time limitation on how long an acting official may serve, it is a bill that clearly recognizes the realities inherent in today's nominating process. It is a bill that goes out of its way to accommodate the inauguration of a new President by giving the new administration up to 8 months to forward nominations, something not currently contained in the Vacancies Act. So we are going the extra mile in an effort to accommodate the problems of the executive branch. And it is a bill that works to encourage the timely forwarding of nominations. Most importantly, though, it is a bill which will, once and for all, put an end to these ridiculous, specious, fallacious arguments that the Vacancies Act is nothing more than an annoyance to be brushed aside. 
Madam President, it is time for this institution to state, in no uncertain terms, that no agency--no agency--will be permitted to circumvent the Vacancies Act, or any other Act for that matter, designed to safeguard our constitutional duties. We cannot, as James Madison warned in Federalist 48, simply rely upon the `parchment barriers' of the Constitution if we are to remain a coequal branch of this government. 
I urge my colleagues to reflect upon this issue, and, in so doing, to hopefully conclude, as I have, that what is at stake here is something much greater than the Vacancies Act. I hope all Senators will understand that, each time a vacancy is filled by an individual in violation of the Vacancies Act, yet another pebble is washed off the riverbank of the Senate's constitutional role, and that, as more and more of these pebbles tumble downstream, the bank weakens, until, finally, it collapses. But above all, I hope my colleagues will agree that we have a responsibility to the American people and to this institution, the Senate of the United States, to shore up that riverbank, to stop the erosion that has taken place, and to reverse the wretched trend of acquiescing on our constitutional duties that seems to have so ominously infected this Senate. 
Let us wait not a day longer in defending the Senate's rights of the Constitution. We are told by the great historian Edward Gibbon that the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus were seven youths in an old legend who were said to have fled to the mountains near Ephesus in Asia Minor to escape the prosecution of the emperor Decius, who reigned in the years 249-251 A.D. Pursuers discovered their hiding place and blocked the entrance. The seven youths fell into a deep slumber, which was miraculously prolonged, without injury in the powers of life. After a period of 187 years, the slaves of Adolius removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice. The light of the sun darted into the cavern and awakened the sleepers, who believed that only a night had passed. Pressed by the calls of hunger, they resolved that Jamblichus, one of their number, should secretly return to the city to purchase bread. The youth, Jamblichus, could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native country. His singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker, and when Jamblichus offered to pay for the food with coins 200 years old and bearing the stamp of the tyrant Decius, he was arrested as a thief of hidden treasure and dragged before a judge. Then followed the amazing discovery, said Gibbon, that two centuries had almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his companions had escaped from the rage of a pagan tyrant. The emperor Theodosius II believed a miracle had taken place, and he hastened to the cavern of the Seven Sleepers, who related their story, following which they all died at the same moment and were buried where they had once slept. 
Madam President, the moral of the story, as far as I am concerned, is this: The Senate has slept on its rights for all too many years. 
Let us awaken to the threat posed by circumventions by the executive branch of the appointments clause and act to preserve the people's rights and the people's liberties, assured to them by the checks and balances established by our forefathers. 
In the proverbs of the Bible, we read: `Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.' The landmark of the appointments clause was established by our forefathers. We can suffer its removal only at our peril, at the Senate's peril, and at the people's peril. Let us, as Senators, not be found wanting at this hour. 
It would require more than `a mere demarkation on parchment' to protect the constitutional barriers between the executive and legislative departments. It will require nothing less than an ambition that counteracts ambition. Senators, vote for this legislation. Vote for cloture today so that we can move on with the legislation. In the words of Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 76, `It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. And, in addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.' 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Yes. I expect the Parliamentarian is right on that. I would not argue with that, nor would I probably support it. 
If the Senator will allow me, the Constitution doesn't say that the Senate has to confirm the nominees. It simply says the President cannot have the full responsibility and power himself to name people to important positions. This is a matter that has to be shared under the Constitution between the President and the Senate. This constitutional provision--the appointments clause--I am trying to protect today is being given the runaround by the Justice Department and several other Departments, and I want to protect that constitutional power that is given to the Senate. As to whether or not the Senate acts on nominations, the Constitution doesn't require the Senate to act, but I think that the Senate does act, and would continue to act, on nominations within a reasonable period of time. 
Having been the majority leader of the Senate during three different Congresses, I can say to the distinguished Senator that when I was majority leader we had nominations left on the calendar at the end of a Congress, in all three of the Congresses in which I served as majority leader. When we adjourned sine die that Executive Calendar was not wiped clean. We all did the best we could, but we did leave some nominations on the calendar. And I certainly share the Senator's feeling that the Senate ought to act expeditiously, in a reasonable fashion, but when it comes to requiring the Senate to act on all nominations, I don't think the Constitution requires that. And I might have to part company with the Senator at that point. But some of his other suggestions, I think, are very well made.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. And I thank him for yielding. The Senator, as I think I understand, suggested that if we are going to deal with one part of the equation, namely, the nominating process by the executive, and protect ourselves in that regard, we ought to be equally interested in dealing with the other half of the equation by requiring action by the Senate to confirm or reject nominees. 
May I with great respect suggest--and I am doing this for the record. I am sure I am not ahead of the Senator in thinking this--I am trying to address the constitutional side of the equation and stop the administration, not only this administration but also previous administrations, from conducting a runaround of the constitutional advice and consent powers of the Senate. I am suggesting we deal with that constitutional side of the equation. 
Now, the other side, which the distinguished Senator mentions, if he will pardon my saying so, I think what he is talking about is the political side of the equation. That part is not included in the Constitution. The Constitution doesn't require the Senate to act on any nomination. But that is the political side. I would like to deal with the constitutional side, and that is the purpose of this legislation. And then we can do the best we can on dealing with the political side. The Senator is quite right; neither side comes into this matter with perfectly clean hands. That is an old equity maxim. 
It reminds me of Themistocles who happened to say, one day, `that he looked upon it as the principal excellence of a general to know and foresee the designs of the enemy;' Aristides answered, `that is indeed a necessary qualification; but there is another very excellent one, and highly becoming a general, and that is to have clean hands.' The same thing would apply here. Neither party has clean hands when it comes to moving all nominations sent by a President to an up or down vote. As majority leader during the Presidential years of Mr. Carter and again during the 100th Congress, I can remember that the calendars were not always cleared of items that had been reported by committees when adjournments sine die occurred. I hope that we will not get bogged down in this way about a purely political matter when a far more important constitutional matter, important to the prerogatives of the Senate in the matter of appointments is at hand. 
And let me state to the Senator the number of nominees that were left on the executive calendar when I was majority leader, at the time of sine die adjournment. 
When I was majority leader--I will just take one Congress, for example, the 100th Congress.

Mr. BYRD. I will just say this. To show that we all sometimes fail to have clean hands, when I was majority leader in the second session of the 100th Congress--I don't mind saying this--the civilian nominations totaled 516, including 112 nominations carried over from the first session; 335 of these were confirmed, 170 were unconfirmed, and 11 were withdrawn. So, this is a failing that can be ascribed to both Democrats and Republicans when they are in control of the Congress. 
But, yet, I come back to my original premise; namely, that the Constitution did not require me to call up all those nominations off the calendar. It didn't say I had to do that. But it did say, with respect to nominations, that appointments to vacancies were to be shared by the President and the Senate, and that is what this bill is contemplating to enforce and what I am fighting for today. 
I thank the distinguished Senator.

But, again, I am concerned about that part of the responsibility which the Constitution places on both the executive and the legislative. I think the legislative is being given the run-around by the Judiciary Department. It has not just been during this administration. It has been, as I say, going on for over 25 years, and this is an opportunity for us to correct that, I hope we would vote for cloture and perhaps some of the Senators' amendments--which are certainly worthy of consideration and probably of adoption, some of them--could be given a chance to be offered and debated. I hope we would invoke cloture, indeed, to have an opportunity to do that.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am reminded of that situation which occurred in 63 B.C. Sallustius writes about. And it is referred to as the conspiracy of Catiline. After Caesar had spoken in the Roman senate, protesting against the death penalty for the conspirators, for the accomplices of Catiline, Cato the Younger was called upon by Cicero, the consul, to speak. Cato demanded that the accomplices of Catiline be put to death under the ancient laws of the republic. 
From Cato's speech I quote only the following strain: `Do not think that it was by arms that our ancestors raised the state from so small beginnings to such grandeur, but there were other things from which they derived their greatness. They were industrious at home, just rulers abroad, and into the Senate Chamber they brought untrammeled minds, not enslaved by passion.' 
Now, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate not to let their minds be trammeled with passion. Keep them untrammeled and focused on the injury that is being done to the Senate by the executive department in the flaunting and circumventing of the appointments clause, which this legislation addresses and is intended to secure for the Senate its rights and prerogatives under the Constitution. 
Democrats and Republicans who reverence the Constitution and who pride themselves in having been given the honor to serve in this institution--the legislative branch--I hope will stand up for the institution and bind ourselves to the mast of the Constitution, as did Odysseus when the divine Circe bade him to stay away from the Sirens' isle. 
I hope that we will keep in mind that we are making several improvements in this bill as it is written. And as the distinguished chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee has so eloquently pointed out within the last few minutes, even without amendments this bill is a liberal advancement--liberal from the standpoint of the administration, whatever administration it might be, Democratic or Republican. It gives more time to the administration. 
So if we turn down this opportunity, I hope the opportunity will come again. But if it does not, then the administration is the loser, as well as the Senate--but the Senate is the greater loser because of the constitutional requirements under the appointments clause which give the Senate a share in the appointments of individuals to important positions in the executive branch and the judicial branch. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Americans, commonly speaking, refer to our form of government as a `democracy.' I often try to talk with our little pages--both Republican and Democratic pages--out in the lobby from time to time. I tell them the story, `Acres of Diamonds,' Tolstoy wrote, `How Much Land Does a Man Need,' and I tell them the story, that Russell Conwell, one of the early chautauqua speakers, said he had given 5,000 times. I tell them various other stories, and I always try to help them to learn some things about the Senate, about our Constitution, and about our form of government. Recently, I said to the little pages, `Now, is this a democracy? What form of government is ours?' And I said to them about the same things that I am going to say here with reference to a democracy versus a republic. 
Again, Americans, commonly speaking, refer to our form of government as a `democracy.' One reason for this is because politicians of all political parties generally refer to our government as a democracy. Politicians generally do that. Glib references are constantly being made anent our democracy. But our form of government, strictly speaking, is not a democracy. It may more properly be called a representative democracy, but, strictly speaking, ours is a republic. `We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands'--not to the democracy for which it stands. 
Incidentally, I was a Member of the other body when the House passed the law on June 5, 1954, inserting the words `under God' into the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Exactly 1 year from that day, on June 5, 1955, we passed a law requiring the words `In God We Trust' to appear on our currency and coins. There are the words on the wall in this Senate Chamber just below the clock, `In God We Trust.' We passed that law in the House on June 5, 1955. I will always be proud that I was a Member of the House of Representatives when we passed those two pieces of legislation. 
So we pledge allegiance `to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic'--not to the democracy, but to the Republic--`for which it stands.' We operate by democratic processes. Ours is a democratic society--I have no quarrel with that--but we do not live in a pure democracy. This is a Republic. We ought to get it straight. High rhetorical phrases referring to our form of government as a democracy constitute somewhat idle talk, and we politicians especially ought to know better. 
I sent over to the Library and got a civics textbook by R.O. Hughes, vintage 1927. I studied civics in 1927. That was the year Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic and Jack Dempsey fought Gene Tunney to regain the heavyweight title, but he didn't regain it. That was the year when Babe Ruth, the Sultan of Swat, hit his 60th home run. So this civics textbook was vintage 1927, and it was right on the mark. Here is what it said: `We call the United States a federal republic.' The textbook also defined a republic as `a government in which the sovereign power is in the hands of the people, but is exercised through officials whom they elect.' Now, there it is. The textbook also defined a democracy: `A democracy is a government in which all power is exercised directly by the people. It is next to impossible for this to be done except in small communities, but the spirit of democracy prevails in many republics and some monarchies.' 
That 1927 civics textbook had it right. In my hometown of Sophia, WV, 1,186 souls--as of the last census--could very well operate as a pure democracy. 
All of the people could gather together, and they could pass laws; that would not be difficult at all--like the early city-states of Greece. 
The 1927 civics textbook also defined a `monarchy' as well as an `oligarchy' and an `aristocracy.' 
Curious as to what a modern textbook on civics would have to say on this subject, I picked up a book, copyright 1990 by Prentice-Hall, Inc., and found no reference--none--to republics and monarchies. Instead, the book referred only to dictatorships and democracies. The 1990 civics textbook states that one way to describe government `is by saying whether it is a dictatorship or a democracy.' The book defined a democracy as follows: `Democracies are quite different from dictatorships. In a democracy the final authority rests with the people. Those who govern do so by permission of the people. Government is run, in other words, with the people's consent. The United States of America is an example of a democracy.' 
That is really inaccurate, `The United States of America is an example of a democracy.' It is not. 
Let me quote what I would consider to be the ultimate authority. This definition does not square with Madison's definition. If Senators want an argument about this, don't argue with me, argue with Madison. This definition does not square with Madison's definition, yet this is what students who study from this 1990 civics textbook are being taught. 
The same textbook goes on to state: `Democracies may be either direct or indirect. A direct democracy is one in which the people themselves, usually in a group meeting, make decisions about what the government will do. Direct democracies do not work very well in large communities. It is almost impossible to get all the people together in one place.' 
That is what the book says. 
Then the book proceeds. It says: `An indirect democracy is one in which a few people are elected to represent everyone else in the community. For this reason, indirect democracies are also called representative democracies.' 
It is kind of a convoluted way of getting around to saying the right thing, referring to a representative democracy. 
Continuing to quote from the book: `These representatives are held responsible by the people for the day-to-day operation of the government. If the people are unhappy with the performance of their representatives, they may vote them out of office during the next election.' 
What a profound statement. That is the civics textbook of 1990. Until I opened up that textbook, I had never heard, I have to say, of `direct' democracies and `indirect' democracies. So now, my Pledge of Allegiance would have to be stated as follows: `I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the indirect democracy for which it stands,' and so forth. 
Are you confused? 
James Madison, one of the principal framers of the Constitution, alluded to `the confounding of a republic with a democracy' in the Federalist #14, written on November 30, 1787. He proceeds to delineate a true distinction between these forms: `. . . in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.' 
Madison was confronting the critics of the Constitution, some of whom sought, by the artifice of confusing the terms democracy and republic, to maintain that a republic could never be established except among a small number of people, living within a small territory. As Madison so ably pointed out, this observation was applicable to a democracy only. 
Madison describes the territorial limitations of democracies such as the `turbulent democracies of ancient Greece,' saying: `. . .the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point, which would just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand; and will include no greater number than can join in those functions; . . .' He proceeds to say that the natural limit of a republic `is that distance from the center, which will barely allow the representatives of the people to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs.' 
Madison argues that the territorial limits of the United States do not exceed the limit within which a republic can operate and effectively administer the affairs of the people. Again, in the Federalist #10, where Madison discusses the sources and causes and dangers of faction, he defines a `pure' democracy as being `a society, consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.' 
Let me say that again. 
Madison defines a `pure' democracy as being `a society, consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.' And Madison indicates that such a form of government `can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.' 
Listen to this--Madison again--stating that, `democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention,' 
Madison proceeds to add that they `have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property.' He adds: `Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.' 
It is quite different with a republic, however. Listen to Madison as he extols this form as a better approach to dealing with faction: `A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure, and the efficacy which it must derive from the union.' 
Again, Madison clearly distinguishes between a democracy and a republic: `The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are, first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, `--meaning in the republic--' to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter `--meaning the republic--' may be extended.' 
Madison in the Federalist #10 then examines whether the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people will be more consonant to the public good in a small rather than in a large republic, and he comes down in favor of a more extensive republic as being `most favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal.' Madison clearly decides in favor of the larger territory. But let's let him speak for himself: `The greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican, than of democratic government' is a `circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former `--the republic--' than in the latter.' 
In summation, Madison said, `Hence it clearly appears, that the same advantage, which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction'--George Washington, we will remember, warned us about faction in his farewell address. Madison said, `Hence it clearly appears, that the same advantage, which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic--is enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it.' 
Hamilton, in Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention, referred to the `amazing violence and turbulence of the democratic spirit.' Madison himself, in his notes, referred to the dangers of a `leveling spirit,' when he said: `No agrarian attempts have yet been made in this country, but symptoms, of a leveling spirit, as we have understood, have sufficiently appeared in a certain quarter to give notice of the future danger. How is this danger to be guarded against on republican principles?' 
Madison was probably referring to the Shays' Rebellion which had occurred just the year before the convention, in 1786, when he spoke of the symptoms of a `leveling spirit.' 
Madison was espousing the establishment of a Senate as `a body in the government sufficiently respectable for its wisdom and virtue, to aid on such emergencies, the preponderance of justice by throwing its weight into that scale.' 
Madison went on to observe `That as it was more than probable we were now digesting a plan which in its operations would decide forever the fate of republican government--talking about the constitution--we ought not only to provide every guard to liberty that its preservation could require, but be equally careful to supply the defects which our own experience had particularly pointed out.' 
What a wise, wise man, Madison. What wise men who gathered there in Philadelphia during those hot summer days between May 25, 1787 and September 17 of that year and hammered out the Constitution of the United States. What a document! 
In the discussions concerning the mode of selection of members of the first branch of the national legislature, Mr. Sherman opposed election by the people. 
We hear a lot about this `democracy' of ours. Many of the framers were concerned about democracy. Some of them didn't want any part of it. They didn't want a democracy. 
Mr. Sherman opposed election by the people, insisting that it ought to be by the State legislatures. According to Madison's notes, Mr. Sherman expressed himself accordingly: `The people, he said, immediately should have as little to do as may be about the Government. They want information and are constantly liable to be misled.' 
Roger Sherman, a delegate from Connecticut, was joined in this feeling by Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts who, as Madison explained, averred: `The evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy. . . . He . . . had been taught by experience the danger of the leveling [sic] spirit.' 
George Mason of Virginia favored the election of the larger branch by the people. According to Madison, Mason `admitted that we had been too Democratic but was afraid we should incautiously run into the opposite extreme.' They didn't want to go to the extreme on either edge. 
Governor Edmund Randolph of Virginia, who had offered the resolves, around which the debates would swirl throughout the Convention. 
These are Madison notes from which I am quoting Governor Edmund Randolph of Virginia who had presented the resolves on the 29th day of May, 1787. It is so easy for me to remember that day because the 29th day of May is my wedding anniversary. It happens to be my wife's wedding anniversary also, naturally, May 29. We have seen 61 anniversaries already in our lifetime. And so here is the quote of Governor Randolph. 
He `observed that the general object was to provide a cure for the evils under which the United States labored; that in tracing these evils to their origin, every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy.' He was of the opinion, therefore, that a check `was to be sought for against this tendency of our government,' and he believed that a Senate--a Senate would achieve this end. 
In speaking of the Senate of Maryland, and the length of Senatorial terms in that State, Hamilton said: `They suppose seven years a sufficient period to give the Senate an adequate firmness, from not duly considering the amazing violence and turbulence of the democratic spirit. When a great object of government is pursued, which seizes the popular passions, they spread like wildfire, and become irresistible.' This was Hamilton speaking, referring to the Senate of Maryland. 
It is evident from Madison's notes on the Convention that a pure democracy, as a form of government, did not appeal to the delegates at the Convention, and that a fear of the `leveling spirit' of democracy was prevalent at the time and leading members of the Convention were aware of this concern. 
Therefore, as Alexis de Tocqueville stated in `Democracy in America,' `the Americans have a democratic state of society', we should be more careful than to allude to our form of government as a `democracy.' If we want to say it's a representative democracy, that is one thing. But it is not a `democracy'. To do so is to use our language loosely. And we all use our language loosely from time to time. I do. But I never refer to this government as a `democracy.' I prefer to stick to the strict definition as explained by Madison and refer to ours as a republic--which I proudly do. 
The framers were wise men. As Butler of South Carolina said `We must follow the example of Solon, who gave the Athenians not the best government he could devise, but the best [government that] they would receive.' 
Our founding fathers gave us a republic. 
As Dale Bumpers reminded me a moment ago--a few minutes ago, when a lady approached Benjamin Franklin at the conclusion of the convention's proceedings on September 17, 1987, she said, `Dr. Franklin, what form of government have you given us?' 
Franklin didn't answer saying, `A democracy, Madam.' His answer was, `A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.' 
Our Founding Fathers gave us a republic, and we public officials, politicians and other molders of opinion should formulate our spoken and written language accordingly. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank Senators for their courtesy in listening. I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his observations. I am grateful for his presence at this time and grateful for the perceptions that he has expressed to us based on his experiences in living in the great State of California. 
I thank him. I think he is a scholar, a real scholar of our form of government and interested in keeping this republic as Benjamin Franklin so wisely admonished the lady. I thank him very much.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support H.R. 4057, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act and I commend my colleagues on the bipartisan and expeditious manner in which this important legislation was adopted by the Senate. This bill will reauthorize the programs of the FAA for two years, including the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which is due to expire on September 30. The purpose of the AIP is to provide grants to fund the capital needs of the nation's commercial airports and general aviation facilities. Without this important FAA reauthorization legislation to continue the contract authority for the AIP, the FAA would not be able to distribute airport grants that are vitally important to not only the State which I am honored to represent, West Virginia, but also the entire nation. 
A major focus of H.R. 4057 is promoting competition and quality air service which, Mr. President, the State of West Virginia needs desperately. Since the deregulation of the airlines, West Virginia travelers have suffered from increased airfares and greatly reduced service. Consequently, the inefficiencies in the present air transportation system and the high costs have denied air passengers and air freight shippers in West Virginia reasonable access to the national and international air transportation system. 
Mother Nature has blessed the State of West Virginia with a beautiful but most unforgiving terrain. Steeply undulating mountains and deep gorges are punctuated by sweetly serene valleys and hollows, and West Virginia is kind to those who need to travel through the State by automobile. Yet, despite the rigorous terrain of the State, most people have to drive great distances even to catch an airplane for what is usually the first of several stops en route to their final destination. In eastern West Virginia, residents travel to either Dulles or Reagan National Airports in Virginia; in the northern reaches, residents drive to Pennsylvania or Ohio; and in the southern portion of the State, they may have to drive to North Carolina to get to a major hub. Not only is the limited availability of flights and destinations a problem for air travel originating within West Virginia, but so is the exorbitant cost of air transportation to and from the State. For example, a round trip air ticket from Reagan National Airport to Yeager Airport in Charleston can cost almost $700. That is almost $700 to travel under 400 miles--and when you are done, you are only as far away as Washington, D.C. Leaving from Washington, $700 can take you to Europe and back! This does not make sense to most hardworking West Virginians, and it discourages other travelers from visiting to experience West Virginia's many wonders for themselves. 
With the advent of the 21st Century just around the corner, the West Virginia air travelers and businesses that rely on air freight will welcome this legislation. West Virginia's expected economic expansion in the 21st century will depend on its ability to compete not only in the national economy, but also in the ever-growing global economy. To successfully compete, quality, affordable, and efficient air transportation is needed to successfully round out West Virginia's increasingly modern infrastructure of highways, railways, and waterways. 
Mr. President, this bill, H.R. 4057, contains other necessary language to help West Virginia progress into the new millennium. Major provisions of this bill are not only the AIP program, but also the Small Communities Air Service Development Program, and slot exemptions for nonstop regional jet service. 
The Small Communities Air Service Development Program will be a four-year, $30 million, small communities grant program. Executed through the Department of Transportation, this program will encourage commercial air service to small communities all over the United States, including those in West Virginia. By providing matching funds of up to 25 percent, a consortia of local communities in West Virginia is expected to compete for the grants of $500,000 per year available per community. 
It was Thomas Edison who said, `Restlessness and discontent are the necessities of progress.' Mr. President, this captures the way that I feel about additional slot exemptions for nonstop regional jet service at Ronald Reagan National Airport. I share the concern expressed by the distinguished Senators from the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia regarding increased noise pollution in the localities surrounding Reagan National Airport. On the other hand, twelve additional slots to increase traffic between Washington and smaller, non-hub airports increases the likelihood of additional airline traffic to underserved areas like West Virginia. Improved air travel to and from States like West Virginia will be critical to my State's remaining competitive in the future and accessible in the present.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, once again, I come to the floor to express my opposition to fast-track procedures. Fast-track procedures were soundly defeated last year by this body, but were resurrected by the Senate Finance Committee as part of a trade bill reported under its jurisdiction. 
In reviewing the trade bill reported by the Senate Finance Committee, I am reminded of a remark attributed to Napoleon in referring to one time political-supporter-turned-foe, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Perigord. Purportedly, Napoleon referenced Talleyrand as `a silk stocking filled with mud,' believing that Talleyrand's costume and charm covered nothing but light-mindedness and egotism. Regardless of the legitimacy of Napoleon's remark, `a silk stocking filled with mud' is exactly my expectation of what would result from the provisions of the trade bill reported by the Senate Finance Committee. The bill's supporters have proclaimed a trade package promising lucrative U.S. economic gains, and have tried to stake out a claim to the moral high ground in the name of free trade. The rhetoric may extol a very pretty package, indeed, but, I am not sold by packaging. American workers simply cannot afford pleasing packaged rhetoric that in reality might leave them in an uphill fight, through an international thicket, to save their jobs. 
In addition to the certainty that current fast-track trade negotiating authority offers no guarantee to the average American worker, my colleagues should take heed that, likewise, no certainty exists that rosy international economic predictions linked to fast-track authority would come true. Take a look at the current global economic crisis. There are no guarantees. 
I have listened to my colleagues who urge support of the fast-track process, but I cannot, and I will not, vote to undermine a responsibility assigned to Congress through the Constitution. That responsibility is `to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' and to `lay and collect * * * Duties, Imposts and Excises'--a responsibility that this legislation appears bent on diminishing. 
Clearly, under the Constitution, the Senate is to have a meaningful role in trade negotiations. Likely, the Founding Fathers recognized the different institutional interests that affect trade negotiations and, thus, crafted provisions to provide checks and balances to ensure that the broad interests of the states--and the people--are protected. By side-stepping the Senate's authority in trade negotiations, we are circumventing the framework set up by the Founders to help guarantee that the total national interest is met. We are playing dangerously with the basic premises 
that underlie our system of checks and balances, and separation of powers. 
I note that many of my colleagues feel that the fast-track legislation under consideration sufficiently revises past trade negotiating authority to ensure that Congress' constitutional role in the regulation of foreign trade is preserved. Particularly, in this regard, supporters are touting the bill's beefed-up notice and consultation provisions as achieving the proper balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. 
I am supportive of continuous dialogue between the Administration and the Congress throughout any trade negotiating process. That would seem like a commonsense approach to me. But guidelines and cursory oversight provisions simply do not fulfill the Senate's constitutional role in foreign trade, and these new consultation and notification provisions can not overshadow the bill's basic shortcomings. That basic flaw is that the Congress through this measure hands the President broad authority to initiate, negotiate, and present trade agreements to the Congress. The Congress must then consider those agreements by an up-or-down vote with little or no debate and no opportunity to offer amendments. 
That is where we get off the track. They may call it the fast-track process. But that is where we leave the constitutional track. That is where we leave the track, which under the Constitution, says that the Senate has the right to offer amendments. 
While the Members on the committees of jurisdiction may have the opportunity to influence and develop the implementing legislation, for all practical purposes, this bill obliterates the voices of most of the Members of Congress when it comes to international trade agreements. 
The Constitution says that revenue measures shall originate in the House of Representatives but that the Senate may amend as on other bills. But here in this so-called fast track, the agreement is presented to the Senate to accept--up or down, with no amendments in order. 
Take it all or nothing. Frankly, I have little faith that consultations with the administration will have much impact--this or any other administration, if we are to be guided by recent administrations. 
Such consultations--with this or any administration--usually do not yield significant results. They have not thus far, in recent years certainly. 
So consult and notify as you will, but I am well aware of the likelihood that the President will sign an agreement, an implementing bill will stealthily materialize, and Senators will be provided with an immense document which they have little ability to change. 
It is take it or leave it. This is where we leave the track. This is where we part company as far as I am concerned. Under this bill, Senators' `meaningful' role in trade pacts will continue to be a yes-or-no vote on legislation that can affect millions of American workers and their communities. 
Perhaps I would be more enthusiastic about fast-track procedures if I believed that past trade agreements implemented under fast-track rules were beneficial to the nation as a whole. 
Regrettably, I believe that past agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which I voted against, have poorly represented the concerns of the average American worker. 
By eroding the carefully crafted checks and balances provided under the Constitution, our current trade policy poorly represents the broader interests of American society. 
Why can't the Senate be given an opportunity to at least offer 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 amendments? I am not suggesting that the Senate ought to be the arbiter over every little, teensy-weensy item in a trade agreement. I am not suggesting that at all. Obviously, we can't do that. But to say that the Senate cannot amend, can offer no amendments is off the track. To me that doesn't comport with the Constitution which provides that the Senate may offer amendments to bills. 
Trade agreements, in principle as well as in practice, always have winners and losers. I believe the underlying issue for the average American worker is precisely who benefits most from our trade negotiations. I believe that the average American worker perceives that a select few U.S. industries keep winning, while other domestic industries keep losing, and that the promised `trickle down' of benefits from the winners to the losers never actually trickles. 
Some will say that the benefits have not yet had time to trickle down. But data available today demonstrate a most distressing trend toward U.S. income inequality. That is: the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer. Under fast-track rules, Senators cannot challenge trade provisions that appear inappropriate or unfair. They cannot question trade provisions which seem to contain juicy deals for specific industries or companies, but hold few guarantees for the average American worker just trying to make ends meet, take care of family responsibilities, and save a little bit for retirement. 
Thus, it should be no mystery to Members of Congress as to why the American public is increasingly skeptical about our trade policies. During the NAFTA debate there were promises that the agreement would create lucrative economic gains for Americans--all Americans. American workers remember this promise, and they have judged that the promised gains have not materialized. 
We need to wise up. Our trade negotiators are under strong pressures from certain influential industry sectors in our economy to negotiate deals which benefit them. To achieve these deals, our negotiators often offer our trading partners concessions, such as tariff reductions that adversely affect less influential U.S. industries. Such concessions, I believe, are not usually properly reviewed. Too often, the benefits achieved in our trade agreements are insignificant compared with the costs to the individual workers, and the total costs to the economy. Worse, many of the negotiated provisions to benefit U.S. industries fail to materialize because our trading partners fail to implement the promised reforms. 
Therefore, we end up imposing enormous costs on various groups and segments of our economy and wind up with nothing to show for the damage. We end up with that pretty silk stocking filled with worthless mud. 
Average American workers live in my state of West Virginia. They work hard for their money, very hard indeed. They labor in the coal mines, on small family-operated farms, in steel, glass or chemical manufacturing plants. These hard-working families deserve a fair slice of the pie. These and other American workers elected the various members of this body to look after their interests in national trade matters. Senators simply cannot adequately fulfill this obligation under fast-track procedures. 
The Constitution established a system of government that has served the United States well for over 200 years. It created a nation filled with the promise of opportunity for all. It is our duty to do our best to make certain that the interests of every American are considered when it comes to matters of trade. 
We live in an increasingly globalized world economy. I am not a protectionist and I am not against fair and free trade. But I would vote to preserve the Senate's essential role in its right to amend bills and in regulating foreign commerce. I would vote against fast-track procedures, as I have in the past, procedures that camouflage provisions that simply might not be acceptable to the majority of Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the institutional and practical problems that fast track presents. The Constitution is clear: Congress is assigned the power `to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations: and to `lay and collect duties, imposts and excises.' 
The Constitution is also clear on the point that the Senate has the power and the right to amend legislation that comes before this body. 
Let us not again so easily relinquish our constitutional power when it comes to issues of such importance to American working families. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in June 1997, Senator Glenn, Senator Levin, and I requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) to examine the Department of Defense's (DOD) approach for addressing U.S. troop exposures to low levels of chemical warfare agents. That report is being released today. This kind of exposure, most recently experienced in the immediate aftermath of the Persian Gulf War--and possibly during it--is likely to become an ever greater threat, as more nations seek a battlefield advantage by employing the `poor man's bomb,' chemical weapons. Our concern was to ensure that the Department of Defense had, in fact, learned the lessons of the Persian Gulf War and had taken effective steps to address any weaknesses that might result in the soldiers of future wars being needlessly harmed by exposure to low levels of chemical weapons. It is one thing to suffer casualties on the battlefield due to the misfortunes of war; it is quite another thing to inflict on American service men and women unnecessary wounds caused by a lack of foresight and planning. That is unacceptable. 
Unfortunately, what the GAO discovered is that, as far as chemical weapons and chemical battlefields are concerned, the United States military is still in Cold War mode. DOD's focus in this area is still to enable U.S. forces to survive, fight, and win in the dreaded all-out nuclear, biological, and chemical battlefields of the Cold War. DOD has no strategy to address low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents. None. Nada. Zip. Despite the fact that existing DOD-conducted research indicates that low-level exposures to some chemical warfare agents may result in adverse short-term performance and long-term health effects, the Department of Defense has not stated a policy or developed doctrine on the protection of troops from low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents on the battlefield. Apparently, DOD prefers to concentrate on `winning,' and hand off any chemical casualties to the Department of Veterans Affairs with a `no longer my business' attitude. I think we need to look at the bigger picture and give the safety of our military personnel the consideration they certainly deserve. 
Even in the wake of disclosures by DOD that approximately 100,000 U.S. troops might have been exposed to some harmful level of chemical nerve and blister agents resulting from the destruction of a single Iraqi munitions dump, less than two percent of DOD's chemical and biological defense research and development program funds have been allocated to low-level chemical exposure issues in the two years since those disclosures. DOD claims that there is `no validated threat' of low-level chemical exposure to warrant greater effort, even as it continues to analyze other incidents during the Gulf War that may result in more troops being notified that they may have been exposed to low doses of chemical warfare agents. Moreover, the GAO report notes that DOD did a study just last year analyzing the impact of state sponsored terrorist attacks using low levels of chemical warfare agent to clandestinely disrupt U.S. military operations. 
It seems both prudent and reasonable to at least begin the conceptual work to address the issue of low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents. But what GAO found instead was a few uncoordinated efforts by concerned offices to look into this current and future threat. This issue demands a top-down approach, in which the broad strategy or framework can guide the development of research, new technology, and operational practice to better defend American men and women, our sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, when they don the uniform of the United States and defend our interests in the hardest and most courageous manner. 
For this reason, and based upon the material which the GAO investigators had uncovered, I authored an amendment, which Senator Glenn cosponsored, to this year's Department of Defense Authorization bill to require the Secretary of Defense to review and modify chemical warfare defense policies and doctrine. The review calls upon DOD to address providing adequate protection from any low-level exposure, whether singly or in combination with other hazards, and whether to a single agent or to multiple agents and hazards over time. This amendment also requires the Secretary to address the reporting, coordinating, and retaining of information on possible exposures, including monitoring the health effects of those exposures by location, so that other mistakes of the Persian Gulf War are not extended to future battles. Additionally, this amendment calls upon the Secretary to develop and carry out a research program on the health effects of low-level exposures that can guide the Secretary in the evolution of policy and doctrine on low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents. I am very pleased that the amendment was retained in conference, and I look forward to the report on the review, which is due on May 1, 1999. 
I am also pleased with the fine and useful work done by GAO on this report, particularly by Dr. Sushil Sharma and Mr. Jeffery Harris. I hope that the Department of Defense finds their analysis and their conclusions helpful as it begins the review mandated in the Department of Defense Authorization conference report. And finally, I thank Senator Levin and Senator Glenn for their interest in this matter.

Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object Mr. President, I have advocated the passage of this bill. On a number of occasions I have asked the leader to proceed with this bill as soon as he could do so. And I introduced the legislation several months ago--I believe last year even--that went to the committee chaired by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson. I asked the chairman to hold hearings on the bill, which he did. I appeared before the committee and spoke in support of the bill. 
And that bill has been reported from the committee with some changes, which I support. So I support this bill 100 percent. But I am constrained to object this evening because of one or two colleagues on my side of the aisle who wish to object. I am sorry to have to do that. But with that explanation, Mr. President, I do object.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was pleased to read an article in the September 15 edition of the Washington Times, titled, `Classics Back in Fashion at Some Schools.' 
Speaking precisely to the point that I have made countless times during my years in the Senate, this article reiterates the need to get back to the basics in education. I would like to get back to the little two-room schoolhouse in which I started along about 1923. I laud those schools that have taken this valuable step back and are getting back to the basics in order to reintroduce classical education into their classrooms. 
Who better to teach our students today than the true historians, the poets, and the playwrights of yesteryear. I long for the old McGuffey readers--I still have a set of those old McGuffey readers in my personal library--where the students read poems and wholesome stories that taught them good morals, how to act, how to grow up and be good citizens. The old McGuffey readers. The historians, the poets, and the playwrights of yesteryear, such as Euripides, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, and Sophocles, who were the four great master poets of tragedy throughout the years and were outstanding as writers of tragic plays, their works were among the classics that have built history, influenced the framers of our Constitution, and can serve to enhance our ability to better understand the present and to set goals for the future. 
Today, our students are caught up in the MTV generation--some of them--watching mind-polluting television sitcoms, listening to shock radio, and repeating the degrading language that they acquire by digesting this steady diet of unhealthy perversity. 
Sadly, many modern classrooms often offer nothing to counteract this flood of popular junk and ignorance, which are smothering our country's students. The classics have been ignored in recent years and replaced by psuedoliterature filled with profanity and violence, and textbooks which do a better job of teaching I don't know what than basic algebra. It alarms me to think that students cannot even begin to identify the great heroes of our past or the authors of the Federalist Papers. 
If our Nation hopes to produce better students, students who can match or outperform the competition in international exams, we must return to the basics, return to the great books and history, such as `Plutarch's Lives,' Milton's `Paradise Lost,' Milton's `Paradise Regained,' Daniel Defoe's `Robinson Crusoe,' Emerson's essays, Carlyle's `History of the French Revolution,' the Bible, the `Iliad' and the `Odyssey.' Alexander the Great kept a copy of The Iliad under his pillow. 
It was called the `casket copy'. He submitted Homer's `Iliad' to Aristotle, and asked Aristotle to critique it. Then Alexander the Great prized it above all other literature. 
Shakespeare's 37 plays: I quoted extracts from Shakespeare's 37 plays one year in the Senate. 
These are all replete with the history and philosophy that are integral elements in a well-rounded, uplifting education. 
When I talk about an education, I mean one that goes through one's lifetime. It doesn't stop with graduating from high school or from college or from getting a Ph.D. in physics, as two of my grandsons have done. It means continuing to educate one's self throughout one's life. 
Solon, one of the seven wise men of Greece, said, `I grow old in the pursuit of learning.' That is a goal that all of us should emulate: `I grow old in the pursuit of learning.' 
I try to follow in Solon's footsteps in that regard. During the last break I read Cicero's `Republic'--not Plato's `Republic.' I had already done that some time ago, but Cicero's `Republic,' and Cicero's `Law'--and De Tocqueville's `Democracy in America'--two excellent volumes. 
Ours is not a democracy. We are talking about a form of government. Ours is not a democracy. We live in a democratic society and we promote democratic principles. But, as for our form of government, it is not a democracy. So many people loosely and glibly refer to it as a `democracy.' 
One needs only to read the Federalist Papers No. 10 and No. 14, to get a good definition of what is a `democracy' and what is a `republic.' Madison, in both of those essays, defines and distinguishes between a democracy, as a form of government, and a republic. 
So let us continue to study and to learn. Learning can be one of the most rewarding of the human activities. But it must be a lifelong journey. 
It ought to be a lifelong journey which carries one across the rivers of changes in events and into the recesses of man's immortal spirit. There is no better way to build upon shallow and superficial knowledge than to ponder the lessons of the past. There is no better way. As Cicero said, `To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born, is to remain always a child.' 
I encourage all schools to give their students this opportunity to grow, to share the lessons of the past, to share history, to read ancient history. Herodotus who wrote about Persia, and who wrote about Egypt, lived somewhere between 484 and 424 B.C: Xenophon, Thucydides, Sallustius, Polybius, Zosimus, Orosius, Ammianus, Appianus, Arrianus, Caesar himself who wrote the Gallic Wars, Florus, Procopius, Eutropius, Cassius Dio Cocceianus, Livius, Tacitus, Plutarch, Gibbon on The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Read histories of England. Of Rome and Greece. 
Read these histories, and read American history, and read the history of the U.S. Senate. These are illuminating. They are uplifting. And we can learn by past events how, in many instances, to deal with current events. 
Napoleon said, `Teach my son to study history. It is the only true philosophy.' 
Enjoy the vision of the poets and the philosophers and begin to shape leaders, who can take us confidently into the future because they so well understand the past. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. I express my deep appreciation to the distinguished Senator for his comments. It has been my privilege to serve over these 40 years in the Senate with some great Senators from Alabama. 
Senator James Allen was an expert in the rules and procedures. He had been Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, and I believe he told me that as presiding officer over the Alabama lower house, I believe it was, he used the rules of the U.S. Senate. He certainly was very conversant with the U.S. Senate rules, a master of the rules of the Senate, a very able man, and courageous. He had no difficulty in taking a stand even if he stood alone. We were sorry at his untimely passing. 
There were other great Senators from Alabama--John Sparkman, who promoted and wrote important legislation dealing with housing; Lister Hill. I can see Lister Hill--that is his desk, I believe it was that desk right there--speaking. He had a fine way of speaking. I believe he told me that he had been named after Dr. Lister--a great English surgeon, Dr. Lister. Senator Hill told me, if I am not mistaken in my recollection, that Dr. Lister had performed an operation on a man who had gangrene in one of his legs. They didn't have the anesthetics in that day and time that they have today. This man went through this excruciating experience and then wrote the poem `Invictus.' And the surgeon was a Dr. Lister. Senator Hill was given the name Lister, after that great English surgeon. 
I am proud to recall these fine Senators from Alabama who were here when I came to the Senate. I have lately come to appreciate the work of the distinguished Senator who is now standing at the desk of the majority leader, and I appreciate his kind words. I have treasured his letters, and I know that ours is a friendship which will be a lasting one. I shall cherish it. 
I thank him for relating his experiences in the little country schoolhouse. It doesn't have to be a massive building with beautiful columns and hallways decorated with shining pieces of furniture. The teacher makes the school. James A. Garfield, hearkening back to his schooldays, said that if he had his old teacher, Mark Hopkins, on one end of the log and he himself on the other there was a university. Those are not the exact words, but they were well spoken. 
I am trying to remember a poem about a teacher. It doesn't come back to me just now, except in part:

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I look about at my distinguished colleagues seated in the august Senate chamber, I find myself mentally transported to another gathering of distinguished leaders, in another elegant chamber, that occurred exactly two hundred and eleven years ago today. 
The date was Monday, September 17; the setting, the Philadelphia State House. It had been a long, hot summer, and only 38 of the 55 delegates attending the Constitutional Convention were still in attendance. One can imagine the commingled sense of pride, nervous excitement, and exhaustion that filled these men as they filed into the State House chamber and took their seats. For awaiting them that day was a task that they must have eagerly anticipated for several months--and that many of them feared might never arrive. It was to be the fruition of their diligent, patient, frustrating summer of debate, discussion, and dispute. Finally, they would put their signatures to the document, freshly copied on parchment in neat script, that they had spent the summer composing. And so it was that, after a protracted and at times painful labor, on September 17, 1787, the Constitution was signed. Today, this document, little changed since its creation in Philadelphia, celebrates its 211th birthday. 
Before the signing ceremony took place, Benjamin Franklin rose to speak one last time to his colleagues. Some of them still had reservations about the document that the Convention had drafted, and Franklin, as he had so often that summer, used his customary self-deprecating charm and understated wisdom to try to win them over. Acknowledging that the draft Constitution might well contain some `faults,' Franklin added, however:  
I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain may be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men, all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views. From such an Assembly can a perfect production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies, who are waiting with confidence to hear that our councils are confounded like those of the Builders of Babel. . . . 
Mr. President, I, too, continue to be astonished at the perfection of this document. The more I study it, the more I see it in action--as we all do here, on a daily basis--the more I marvel at the handiwork of those 55 men in Philadelphia. What transpired that summer in Philadelphia's State House was truly one of the great events in the history of this Republic--it is not a democracy; it is a Republic--or in the history of the world. Indeed, it is no stretch to call this Constitution, as Gladstone did, `the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.' 
Part of the strength of the Constitution lies in its ability to accommodate situations and developments that the Framers could never have anticipated. Just as Seneca tells us that the test of a strong man is adversity, so the true test of the Constitution may be how well it handles the unexpected. So far, Mr. President, the Constitution has passed that test with flying colors. It has seen us through two centuries of staggering technological, economic, social, and political transformations. 
We may well be entering a new period of upheaval which will further test the Constitution's strength and elasticity. Some have even suggested that we are entering `a constitutional crisis.' I, for one, have greater faith in the Framers' handiwork. The Constitution sets up a clear process for investigating and resolving allegations of wrongdoing by the Executive and other civil officers. The House is assigned the power of impeachment and the Senate the power to try impeachments. The current situation may well not result in impeachment, but if it does--and that is just one possibility--then I am confident that, as long as we in the House and the Senate fulfill our constitutional duties solemnly and judiciously, we will see the nation through this and any future difficulties. 
Sadly, just as current events reaffirm the importance of knowing and following constitutional processes and procedures, a new poll indicates that America's youth are largely ignorant of the Constitution and its origins. It seems that every few months a new poll appears which plumbs the depths of ignorance among some of our children. Each time, we hope that we have finally reached the bottom of the abyss; each time, we are disappointed when a new survey a little later indicates that the depths are deeper and darker than we ever realized. 
The latest sounding of the depths comes to us through the courtesy of a poll by the National Constitution Center, which shows that while American teenagers are Rhodes Scholars in popular culture, in many instances many are sadly deficient in matters constitutional. The study found that by a wide margin, 59 percent to 41 percent, more American teenagers can name the Three Stooges than can name the three branches of government. Less than 3 percent of teens could name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, while almost 95 percent could name the television actor who played the `Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.' And less than one-third could name the Speaker of the House, while almost 9 of 10 could name the star of the T.V. show `Home Improvement.' 
It gets worse, Mr. President. Why, just one-quarter of the teens could name the city in which the Constitution was written! Only one-quarter knew what the 5th Amendment protects. Only 21% knew how many Senators there are. And less than half knew the name given to the first ten amendments. 
These should not be difficult questions to answer. This is not a matter of knowing whether the Constitution allows states to grant letters of Marque and Reprisal--it doesn't--or citing cases over which the Supreme Court has original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction. One should not need a degree in constitutional history, or a course in constitutional law, to know the name of the Speaker of the House. Indeed, answering many of the questions I cited requires only a cursory familiarity with current events. What's more, over half of the teens interviewed said they read or listen to the news for at least 15 minutes daily, over half said their teachers discuss politics at least a few times a week, and yet, only a handful could recall the names of Newt Gingrich or William Rehnquist. 
Where does the fault lie, Mr. President? With our schools, for failing to provide students with the most rudimentary background in civics and government? With the media, for its shallow and trivializing coverage of important issues? Or with parents, for failing to prepare their children for their responsibilities as citizens? With the entire national culture, for placing greater emphasis on the fashion tips of supermodels and the escapades of rock stars than on the accomplishments and heroics of great men and women of the past and present? 
Perhaps all of these entities must share some responsibility for this sad state of affairs. But my purpose today, Mr. President, is not to cast blame. I speak not in anger but in sadness, out of a concern for the welfare of our country and the future generations which will assume its leadership. This country will not long continue to occupy its unique position among the nations of the world if it does not adequately prepare its children to pick up the reins of power that the older generations currently wield. We need to prepare our children to be active, informed, involved citizens. We need to make them aware of how our governmental system operates and what part they play within it. We need, in short, to teach them about the Constitution. 
For it is the Constitution that lays out the Federal system of government. It is the Constitution that establishes the separation of certain powers and the sharing of other powers among three distinct but overlapping branches of government, and between one Federal and multiple State governments. The Constitution is the secular bible of this Republic, and, given its importance, its brevity, and its accessibility, it is not too much to expect that every citizen have at least a passing familiarity with it. 
Even this is not enough, however. The Constitution, as I suggested at the beginning, is the product of a particularly momentous course of events. Simply reading the words of the Constitution without knowing something of those events is like learning about World War I by reading the Treaty of Versailles. We cannot teach our children to understand and respect this document unless they learn its history. They must learn about the considerable intellectual and physical energy that those 55 men at Philadelphia expended in drafting this document. They should read some of those debates, and they should read The Federalist Papers and discover for themselves the principles, hopes, and fears that motivated the Framers. 
For the Constitution was not simply handed down to us as the Old Testament God handed down the Commandments to Moses. To believe that would be a disservice to the remarkable men who toiled long and hard to produce the document. The Constitution is our tangible connection with those men, and with the founding events of this Republic some two centuries ago. 
So, I close where I began: with 38 men gathered in a room at the Philadelphia State House some 211 years ago. While they may not have fully appreciated the moment of the occasion--how could they?--they had some inkling of it. And, of course, it was Franklin again who best captured the spirit of the moment. Gazing at the back of the President's chair, upon which the sun had been painted, Franklin commented:  
I have often and often in the course of the Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun. 
Today, 211 years later, that sun continues to be in the ascendant. I hope and pray that it will remain so for another 211 years.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, but there is some phraseology in the majority leader's request that I wish to inquire about. And I have noted the same phraseology in the requests from time to time lately, but at this moment, since we are both on the floor, I will ask the question.

Mr. BYRD. If I may ask the majority leader to yield, and I won't take long, but having been majority leader myself, I know that there are a number of things involved there, and there may be one particular item on a particular occasion, and for a particular reason, that Senators would want to have operative according to the usual rules. 
I urge that we not--Mr. President, that we not speed the operation up to the point that Senators' rights may be eclipsed. And I am not suggesting that the majority leader intends that. He has already indicated--and I knew what he was doing--he was trying to speed the operation up in a way that would be more efficient. But there are things involved in that particular phraseology which might take 30 minutes to discuss here if we started to do so. 
I just hope that the distinguished Senator will have his staff look at that language and that we might be able, Senators, to reserve their rights while even agreeing to such a request, if the circumstances required it.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on July 16, 1997, President Clinton directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review its nitrogen oxide (NOX) transport standards under the Clean Air Act. Subsequently, on November 7, 1997, the EPA announced a proposed ozone transport rule to reduce the regional transport of ground-level ozone across a 22-state region of the eastern United States, and the agency is now poised to announce its final ruling on NOX emissions and ozone transport. The 22 states that have been targeted by this rule are some of the nation's most heavily populated, and include a large concentration of major industries, utilities, and automobiles. 
Based on past experience, it is not surprising that the Environmental Protection Agency has, once again, decided to pursue a heavy-handed and arbitrary approach toward its regulation of NOX emissions. While the EPA argues that its recommendations reflect the cooperative work of 37 states through the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) process, OTAG actually recommended a range of options to be considered on a state-by-state basis. The EPA, in its proposed rule, has chosen the most extreme of those recommendations--an 85% reduction in NOX emissions within the 22-state region. Far from being a flexible, tailored reduction for individual states based on their own contributions to the problem of ozone and air quality, this is a draconian, one-size-fits-all, command-and-control approach and does not take into account regional differences. I am concerned that this plan, which is apparently based on insufficient scientific information, poses potentially substantial harm to the economies of the affected states without delivering on the substantial environmental benefits it claims. 
A key concern with the EPA's recommendation is that it is based on modeling results that are inconsistent with modeling conducted by OTAG. The EPA has made a finding that Midwest and Appalachian states significantly contribute to nonattainment in the downwind states. The OTAG modeling actually concluded that the air-borne transport of ozone is only a major concern within a radius of 150 miles of the emission source. Using the OTAG results, emissions of nitrogen oxide from the Midwest and Ohio Valley simply do not affect ozone levels in the Northeast at a significant level, and the suggestion that emissions from the Mississippi area affect the eastern seaboard is even more unjustified by the empirical evidence. The OTAG modeling indicates that the greatest contributions to the ozone problem in the Northeast are emissions from sources in the Northeast and, particularly, from the growing numbers of automobiles congesting the roads and filling the air with their fumes. As my colleague, the senior Senator from Rhode Island and Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in an April 16, 1997, letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, `Contrary to a public belief too readily accepted without any evidentiary foundation, our problem does not come primarily from distant smokestacks in the Ohio River Valley.' 
Recommendations based on OTAG's modeling ranged from targeted reductions only in specified non-attainment locations to the EPA's extreme choice of an 85% reduction across the board in all states. If the EPA forces the so-called `upwind' states like West Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia to reduce their emissions by the recommended 85%, the effect will be economically harmful, yet will do little in the long run to reduce the Northeast's ozone problem or improve its overall air quality. This recommendation is neither equitable nor cost-effective. 
The consequences of the EPA's decision for the Midwest and Appalachian states will be severe. For example, my own state of West Virginia is currently in compliance for ozone. West Virginians are proud of this record and are working hard to maintain a clean environment. Unfortunately, however, despite this commendable record of compliance, the EPA is proposing that West Virginia reduce its NOX emissions by a whopping 44%. This is a huge overnight shift in policy--from compliance to gross under-compliance in the twinkle of an eye--which would force significant, costly changes to industries and utilities in my state, but for what purpose? For what purpose? 
Mr. President, studies conducted by industry officials estimate that it will cost $500 billion for every 10% decrease in NOX emissions, costs that will be passed onto consumers. If the EPA's proposal is implemented, electricity rates will climb precipitously in States like West Virginia, but this sacrifice reportedly will do little to improve air quality in the Northeast. According to a recent study by the Alliance for Clean Air Policy (ACAP), the EPA's 85% reduction will require an initial investment of $6 billion and an annual compliance cost of $1.2 billion by utilities in the 22-State region. Other industry cost estimates are even larger. Businesses and consumers in the Midwestern, Appalachian, and Southeastern States will bear the bulk of these costs. Electric power utilities will be forced to install selective catalytic reduction equipment on a large number of existing plants, but there is little experience in the United States with the use of this type of technology. What we do know is that selective catalytic reduction, SCR, technology is extremely costly and will require difficult retrofitting for many powerplants over a period of several years in order to meet the EPA's recommended reductions. By all appearances, the emissions reductions mandated by the EPA in the Midwestern and Appalachian region are unjustified and they are unfair. 
We sometimes forget that, too often, bureaucratic rules have major impacts on a personal level. Electricity rates in West Virginia and the Midwest are considerably lower than those of the Northeast. If the EPA issues its rule forcing States to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 85%, Midwest and Appalachian utility rates will rise significantly. Meanwhile, as much of the United States is enjoying the benefits of a strong economy, the Appalachian region is still struggling to pull itself, in some areas, out of poverty. In recent years, West Virginia has aggressively sought out and won new business opportunities. 
Toyota is making a very important announcement even today, within the next hour, of additional plans that it has for its plant in Putnam County, WV. 
West Virginians who previously had to leave the State for career opportunities are now able to come back home to well-paying jobs that can comfortably support their families. If this stiff new rule goes into effect, families in West Virginia will find it harder to pay their electric bills; retirees on small pensions will face choices that could threaten their health and well-being; and companies, facing narrower profit margins, may consider moving their operations elsewhere because they would no longer receive the benefits of low-cost electricity. Further, communities that have invested in new infrastructure and have strained to help grow new and existing businesses could see their economic base dwindle. I am weary of regulations that lead to unnecessary economic dislocation. I want to be sure that the citizens of Appalachia can afford to heat and light their homes, and that they can receive reliable, consistent service from their utilities. I also want to be sure that each State recognizes and takes responsibility for its own air quality standards. But, I do not believe that a few States should have to shoulder the economic burdens for the EPA's hypothetical air quality improvements.  
Certainly, there are better, more scientifically and economically sound alternatives to the severe rule proposed by the EPA. A number of alternative proposals have been submitted that are projected to reduce NOX emissions and at the same time meet the attainment of the new 8-hour ozone standard in many states earlier than currently scheduled. In fact, 13 Governors have submitted alternative strategies for addressing this important issue. These alternative proposals include one by a group of six Governors, led by West Virginia Governor Cecil Underwood, who have submitted a very comprehensive proposal. Other similar alternative proposals have been submitted individually by the Governors of Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. These alternative plans share the same core elements and represent aggressive steps to achieve a significant reduction in NOX emissions. 
The alternative recommendation put forth by the aforementioned coalition of six Governors representing West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia is a very comprehensive proposal. The first phase recommends a 55 percent reduction of NOX emissions by April 2002, followed by a 65 percent reduction in NOX emissions by April 2004. This alternative would also require significant reductions from other large non-utility sources by April 2003. By contrast, the EPA proposed an overall 85 percent reduction from major utility sources, 70 percent from major industries, and 50 percent from small industries by May 2003--a target few companies anticipate meeting without substantial costs. The EPA's compliance schedule also may threaten the reliability of electrical supplies in these and adjacent States. 
In the second phase, the coalition plan calls for assessing the reductions that will be necessary to meet the new EPA-mandated 8-hour ozone standard by 2009--3 years ahead of the EPA's schedule of 2010-2012. As proposed, the assessment will be completed by 2001, the control requirements established by 2003, and additional controls in place in a reasonable period by 2007. 
I support initiatives like those put forth by the 13 Governors. They demonstrate a spirit of cooperation and have numerous advantages. A phased approach would avoid disruption in the reliability of electricity services and would achieve substantial cost savings for businesses and consumers. In recognition of the limited impact of long-distance ozone transport, NOX controls for achieving the 8-hour emission standard should be tailored at the local, State, and regional levels. The phased approach builds upon the OTAG recommendations for addressing regional transport concerns and would encourage allowance trading as a compliance tool. Finally, a phased approach would be consistent with the Clean Air Act requirements and would allow States to take the lead in developing technically sound strategies for attaining the 8-hour ozone standard. 
Clearly, alternative proposals exist that are achievable and that would provide cleaner air for millions of Americans sooner than would be provided in the Clean Air Act, without the adverse economic consequences that appear inevitable as a result of the EPA's proposal. Moreover, these types of alternative approaches are consistent with the July 1997 Presidential Directive calling for a flexible, common-sense approach to address this important and complex issue. 
The Governors have worked to craft reasonable, science-based, balanced, and cost-effective proposals. I hope that the White House will recognize the spirit of cooperation and commitment that these Governors have made to air quality standards that address both the environmental and the economic interests of their States and surrounding States. 
I also hope that these alternative proposals are given serious consideration before any final action is taken to issue a new rule. Let us not get in too big a hurry here. If a compromise is not reached regarding this very important matter, I am concerned that it will be tied up in the courts and thus prevent the States from taking the actions to which they have committed themselves, while also delaying a real, beneficial reduction of nitrogen oxide. Mr. President, I urge the administration to work with the Governors to reach an environmentally and economically sound and common-sense solution that is in the interest of our Nation as a whole. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Nation is awaiting the public release of the Starr report. The rhetoric concerning the President's future has become superheated, and is nearing the point of spontaneous combustion--and no one has even had a chance to read, let alone reflect upon, all 445 pages of that report. It will be all too easy for individual pages and charges to be pulled out and waved around to fan these flames, but that does an injustice to the dignity and stature of this Nation. So I would like to pour a little cold water on these flames, and to urge everyone--all of us--to cool it. 
The world was not created in a day. And we cannot rush that clock on the wall, as much as some of us might like to do. The clock will take its time. And time will move no faster, no slower than it moved in the days of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. 
With the receipt of this report, a very grave constitutional process has begun. I want to emphasize that. Let me say it again. With the receipt of this report, a very grave constitutional process has begun. And we need to respect that process and all that it may mean for the Nation now and into the future. 
I would like to outline that process, which is covered in its entirety in just a few brief passages of the Constitution. 
And they are to be found on page 59 of my book on the Senate. Of course, they can be found in the Constitution itself. 
Article I, section 2, clause 5: 
The House of Representatives . . . shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. 
Article I, section 3, clause 6: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath of Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present. 
Article I, section 3, clause 7: 
Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law. 
Article II, section 2, clause 1: 
The President shall. . .have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment. 
Article II, section 4: 
The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
Article III, section 2, clause 3: 
The trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury. . . . 
Now, Mr. President, my colleagues are all well aware of the very difficult path we may be starting down now that the Starr report has been received. The House will take the first hard steps, and the Senate may--I say, may--have to follow. If we hope to restore the confidence of the Nation in their Government, and in the Congress in particular, Members must be allowed to carry out their task free from the kind of hype and speculation and inflammatory commentary that is swirling all around us. 
I say this as much to the public, perhaps even more so, and the media, as I do to my colleagues. Give us the time and the elbowroom to live up to our solemn constitutional obligation to the Nation. 
We, in the Senate, of course, do not know at this point whether there will be any impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives. That remains in the hands of the other body. That is not in our hands. Only if and when the House were to formulate and approve articles of impeachment would any articles then come to the Senate. The Senate would then, and only then, under the Constitution, be called upon to make its judgment, up or down, without amendment, on each article. 
This is a very solemn matter and this Senator will not be influenced by the hype. I shall do my very best if that time comes--and it may never come, it may never come--but if it were to, I would do my very best to render a fair judgment, not only to the person impeached but also to the Nation, to the people, always keeping in mind the solemnity of the occasion and the kinds of precedents and standards that we, ourselves, would be setting for all of the generations to come. It is not going to be a matter to be decided tomorrow or next week or the next 2 weeks or the next 3 weeks in this Chamber. The other House will act as it sees fit, based upon the evidence in the report. We would be sitting as jurors if and when articles of impeachment were ever sent to us by the other body. 
It is a constitutional process. Let's keep that in mind. We must be true to the Constitution, and true to the Nation. We must be fair, and we must be seen as having been fair. 
Let me, in closing, read the oath which each Senator would be required to take in the event--and I emphasize, in the event--that the Senate were ever faced with an impeachment trial. The public should know that this is the oath to which each Senator must subscribe. 
Here is the oath. It is on page 61 of the document titled, `Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the United States Senate,' revised edition, prepared pursuant to Senate Resolution 439, 99th Congress, 2d Session, submitted by Senator Robert C. Byrd and Senator Robert Dole, by Floyd M. Riddick, Parliamentarian Emeritus of the U.S. Senate and Robert B. Dove, Parliamentarian of the United States Senate, August 15, 1986.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday is Grandparent's Day. Like Mother's Day, this holiday has its origins in the great State of West Virginia. The Presiding Officer at the moment is from Ohio, a distinguished Senator from Ohio. He is a neighbor. His State is a neighbor of ours. This holiday began in West Virginia. 
In 1956, a lifelong mountaineer and the wife of a coal miner, Mrs. Marian McQuade, was asked to assist in organizing a `Past 80 Party.' I would qualify for that party if it were held today. Well, this group continues today to annually honor and celebrate octogenarians and other seniors in West Virginia. Mrs. McQuade began gathering participants to join in these festivities by contacting nursing homes. She learned of the chronic loneliness that many of the seniors in these homes experienced, and she was deeply saddened. Her heartfelt concern engendered the idea of a special day, a specific day to celebrate grandparents. 
In May 1973, West Virginia became the first State with a specially designated Grandparent's Day. Five years later, Mrs. McQuade received a phone call from the White House. This call informed her that President Carter had signed a law that designated the first Sunday after Labor Day as National Grandparent's Day. The holiday was shifted to the fall for symbolic reasons, as Grandparent's Day celebrates those in the autumn--ah, the autumn--of their lives. The first official national observance of this holiday occurred in September 1979--autumn, when the leaves are turning from green to gold to red and to brown. 
The statute creating Grandparent's Day states that the purpose of Grandparent's Day is `to honor grandparents, to give grandparents an opportunity to show love for their children's children, and to help children become aware of [the] strength, information, and guidance [that] older people can offer.' This is a day to celebrate sharing between the generations. It is a day for the older and younger generations to commune with one another. It is, above all, a day to celebrate the family. 
All too often in our increasingly fast-paced world, we fail to reflect. Perhaps on this Grandparent's Day we can enjoy the leisure of reminiscing on earlier days and, in so doing, opening a dialog between the generations. Such a confabulation benefits all who participate. 
Sharing time with grandchildren provides the grandparent not only with longed-for companionship, but also may inspire great personal joy and a renewed liveliness. The young are like a rejuvenating elixir, restoring a youthful spring in one's step. The young possess a certain charm, reminding us of what it feels like to be young again, and through them the spirit is enlivened. The aged may even see in the younger generation certain reminders of their own early ambitions, and foresee the potential that these sprouts have to take root and grow. And when these seedlings begin to bloom, finding their own success, there is no greater pride than that of the grandparent who encouraged, who listened, and who applauded along the way. And the majority leader will see this one day, as he recently had a grandchild come into his family. 
While grandparents' steps are enlivened by spending time with their grandchildren, the children learn upon which path these steps ought to be taken. Children, although they may, at times, view their elders as antediluvian and inveterate, will sit enraptured as they listen to stories recounted by their parents' parents. I remember how they used to sit around me when I played the fiddle. Oh, to live those days over again! 
The young will often, perhaps strangely, volunteer to assist with otherwise tedious chores to be by the side of grandparents. From the tales told and the time spent tending to tasks together, youngsters learn family history, and they ought to listen to it and they ought to be interested in that family history. They learn family history, traditions, and glimpse a wiser perspective of their world. Also, that is what many of us older persons need today--a wiser perspective of our world. Narratives and demonstrations of the maxim `hard work works' have the power to convey and ingrain the principles of success that are eternal verities. It is hard to imagine or recall, with our cars, microwaves, cell phones, and laptops, just how hard our parents and grandparents labored to do things that seem so simple today. We turn up a thermostat instead of chopping wood. But if one wants to warm himself twice, he only needs to chop his own wood. We hit `spellcheck' rather than retyping term papers. When faced with future adversity, growing children may look back on such nostalgia to carry them through their own trying times. 
I am lucky to share in my grandchildren's lives, I feel the pride of being a grandparent, and I recall Mrs. McQuade's story. I remember how she found that some seniors were neglected and forlorn, living lives of lonely destitution. Who knows, that may come to any one of us in time. Sadly, for some, this is still the case. 
Although many of their loved ones may have passed on, other seniors, thanks to advances in medicine and to Federal programs that provide a safety net of social services, continue to carry on. Many find ways to remain active in their communities, organizing events or sharing their time with others. Some have even taken on the burden of raising their children's children or acting as surrogate grandparents to those children who have lost their natural grandparents or who never knew them. Our older Americans have sweated and labored to defend and fight for our Nation, educate our young, mine the fuel to keep our homes warm, and shelter the values which we treasure the most. 
A greater obligation to our venerable matriarchs and patriarchs who have served as such wonderful role models to not one, but two, generations is our duty. 
This is why I am proud to add my name as a cosponsor of a bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. This Act helps to assess the needs of seniors and provide services to fill these needs. Funding through this Act provides nutrition, disease prevention, and in-home health service programs for the elderly. The Older Americans Act will also provide for community service employment for senior citizens with low income, so that they may continue to demonstrate the strength of their work ethic. Furthermore, the Act will allow state and local aging agencies to operate as advocates to promote the rights of older persons. As more and more Americans enter the older generation, it is critical that the mechanisms which have provided assistance continue to be able to lend support. We must not forget the lessons which these men and women have passed on to us and to our children. To do so would be to debase their contribution to the prosperity of our own posterity. The generous contributions our seniors have made will continue to propagate long after the grandchildren of today leave this world. Remembering our older Americans, and the importance of their influence on many young, fresh lives, is perhaps the most apt offering we can bestow as we celebrate Grandparents' Day. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. In doing so, may I thank my friend from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, for his patience, and all others on whose time I have transgressed. 
I thank him also for his contributions to the work of the Nation, for his knowledge, for his clearheadedness, for his evenhandedness, and for the inspiration that he gives to me and all of my colleagues.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. Byrd. So, at least until next Wednesday, I will say that the Senate will be on other very important business, the DOD authorization bill. If that bill is not finished by the conclusion of business on Tuesday, and by that time it appears that the Senate is ready to go forward on the treaty, then Senator Nunn has indicated a willingness to either set the DOD authorization bill aside and take it up following the action on the treaty or, as I suggested to Senator Dole, Senator Nunn, Senator Boren, and Senator Pell, perhaps for a day or two we could proceed on a two-track basis, get work started on the treaty, and finish the work on the DOD authorization bill. We can make that decision as of next Wednesday.

Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, later this afternoon I hope to offer the omnibus trade bill. I would like to get it before the Senate later today for opening statements. On tomorrow, then, following the conference report on the budget action, the Senate would return, probably, to the trade legislation. I remind all Senators that I indicated last week that we will be operating on at least a two-track system here for the next few days. The campaign finance reform bill will still be around. The trade legislation will be up. We will have to take action on the conference report on the budget.

Mr. Byrd. The Senate will operate on a two-track system, under the consent order that was entered. It gives the majority leader at any time the consent to go to the trade legislation--the omnibus bill, or the bill that was reported out of the Finance Committee. I have chosen to proceed with the omnibus approach. That was the approach that was discussed for months, and committee chairmen have acted accordingly. They have been dutiful in reporting out the legislation. 
So, beginning on tomorrow, there will be longer days and shorter nights, in contrast to the natural seasons of the year.

Mr. Byrd. So by the middle of next week, certainly, I expect us to be on the trade legislation. We will have a two-track system. We will work on trade during the early part of the day up into the midafternoon or a little later than midafternoon. Then we will go to campaign financing reform. I would like to retain the flexibility to switch that mode, but that is my present plan, to go with trade first, then campaign financing reform. We can shift that, of course.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we appear to be only days away from receiving the Independent Counsel's report on President Clinton. The pressure on Congress is escalating. Talk of impeachment is in the air along with suggestions of resolutions of reprimand and censure. Some have even suggested that we ought to get on with impeachment and `get this thing behind us.' 
There had to come a time, sooner or later, when the boil would be lanced. The problem is, that with the lancing, a hemorrhaging may be only one of those continuing symptoms of a greater lancing--perhaps even an amputation--that still lurks in the shadows up ahead. 
There is no question but that the President, himself, has sown the wind, and he is reaping the whirlwind. His televised speech of August 17 heaped hot coals upon himself, coals causing wounds which continue to inflame and burn ever more deeply. Coming, as the speech did, so soon after the President's appearance before the Grand Jury, his words were ill-timed, ill-formed, and ill-advised. Perhaps if he had only delayed his televised speech for 24 hours, he may have, upon reflection, avoided some self-inflicted wounds that have since festered and continue to fester. 
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, 
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit 
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, 
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. 
When the scribes and Pharisees brought before Jesus a woman taken in adultery, saying that, under Moses, the law commanded that she be stoned, they sought to tempt Jesus that they might accuse him. He said unto them: `He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And that ancient admonition, that he who is without sin should cast the first stone, applies to every human being in this country today. Someone else has said: `No man's life will bear looking into.' These admonishments should give all of us pause and should encourage reflection and self-examination. In this instance, the President, himself, has, by his own actions and words, thrown the first stone at himself and thus made himself vulnerable to the stoning by others. 
What a sorrowful spectacle! To maintain that Presidents have private lives is, of course, not to be denied, but the Oval Office of the White House is not a private office; it is where 
much of the business of the Nation is conducted daily; it is the people's office; and the only real privacy that any President can realistically claim is in the third-floor living quarters of the White House with his family. What the President had hoped to claim was `nobody else's business' has now become everybody else's business. 
His speech was a lawyer-worded effort--as in the reference to `legally accurate' testimony--and the people have long since grown tired of having to pick and sift among artfully crafted words that have too often obscured the truth rather than revealed it. 
The White House's apparent strategy of delay and attack over so many long months has only succeeded in stringing out a judgment day that is increasingly threatening, and has only made bad matters worse. Former President Nixon, in an earlier tragedy for the Nation and for all of us who were here and lived through it, tried the same thing--delay, delay, delay, and counter-attack, attack, attack--and it failed in the end. 
We seem to be living recent history all over again. As the Book of Ecclesiastes plainly tells us, `There is no new thing under the sun.' Time seems to be turning backward in its flight, and many of the mistakes that President Nixon made are being made all over again. 
We also must stop and remember that this is a sad time for the President and his family, a sad time for his friends and supporters throughout the country, a sad time for the devoted members of his staff who have labored and sacrificed and given so much for a man in whom they implicitly believed. It is a sad time for members of his cabinet and heads of agencies who publicly defended him and who depended on his word. 
But it is an even sadder time for the country. As a schoolboy, I looked upon George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and Abraham Lincoln as my idols to be emulated; I looked upon Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey and Charles Lindbergh and Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison and Nathan Hale and Daniel Morgan and Nathaniel Green and Stonewall Jackson as my heroes. I was taught, as most of us were, to revere God. I was taught to believe the Bible, and that a judgment day would surely come when we would all be punished for our sins or be saved by our faith and good works. 
The old couple who raised me taught me by their example and their words not to lie but to tell the truth, not to cheat but to be honest; but what will parents tell their children today? Can they tell them to plow a straight furrow and that honesty is still the best policy? To whom can our young people look for inspiration? 
I recently asked a question on this floor, `Where have all the heroes gone?' I ask that question again today. Where have all the heroes gone? Fortunately, we do have a Mark McGwire and a Sammy Sosa, both of whom have captured the Nation's admiration with their home runs. But where are the Nation's leaders to whom the children can look and be inspired to work hard and live clean lives? 
The political and social environment in which parents must today raise their children is, unfortunately, an environment in which anything goes; politicians try to be all things to all people; family values and religious values which made us a great Nation are looked upon as old-fashioned, unsophisticated, and the product of ignorance and rusticness. Profanity and vulgarity, sex and violence are pervasive in television programming, in the movies, and in much of today's books that pretend to pass for literature. The Nation is inexorably sinking toward the lowest common denominator in its standards and values. Haven't we had enough?  
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; 
It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day 
A gash is added to her wounds. 
Yes, talk of impeachment and censure and resignation is in the air. It is on almost everybody's mind with whom I have talked. 
As we find ourselves being brought nearer and nearer, as it would seem, to a yawning abyss, I urge that we all step back and give ourselves and the country a little pause in which to reflect and meditate before we cast ourselves headlong over the precipice. 
To say we ought to get on with impeachment and `get the thing behind us' is a bold thing to say; but boldness, to the point of cavalierness, can come back to haunt us. 
I suggest that we Senators should let the House do its work and wait to see what action that body takes. The Senate cannot vote on Articles of Impeachment--we all know that--until the House formulates such articles and presents them by its managers to the Senate--if it ever does so. I also suggest that putting `this thing behind us' is not going to be an easy thing to do. If Congress reaches that stage of voting on Articles of Impeachment it is going to be a traumatic experience for all of us, both here in this city and throughout the country. The House is in no position to formulate Articles of Impeachment prior to its receipt and consideration of--and I emphasize consideration--the Starr report. The Judiciary Committee--I am talking about the Judiciary Committee in the House--will undoubtedly want to hold hearings before it formulates any Articles of Impeachment if such appear to be called for. 
That is the House's charge; that is the House's responsibility, not ours. If and when such Articles are presented here to the Senate--they are not amendable here, and the Senate, in such cases, is limited to an up-or-down vote on each Article--that will be a matter of the utmost gravity. All Senators will be sworn. I tell you. That will be a matter of the utmost gravity. Caution should be the order of the day. 
If, sometime in the future, the American people should come to believe that this President, or any other President, has been driven out of office for what they may perceive to be political reasons, their wrath will fall upon those who jumped to judgment prematurely. That is not something that we can so easily `put behind us.' Both the media and those of us who may ultimately be called upon to sit in judgment should exercise restraint in pressing toward a particular conclusion before all of the facts are known. There is a constitutional process in place. We should all let it work. 
It is my suggestion that everyone should exercise some self-restraint against calling for impeachment or censure or for the President's resignation. 
Who knows? I may do that before it is all over. But not now. We should exercise some self-restraint against calling for impeachment, or censure, or for resignation--until the other body has had an opportunity to study and sift through the Starr report. 
There are many avenues down which we could travel as we grapple with this matter. Among them is the path of official censure which some have suggested. Others may think that censure is `meaningless.' Let me state for the record that that is not my view. I have written in my work on the Senate that censure has no constitutional basis. 
It doesn't mean that censure is unconstitutional. Just as `holds' that are placed on bills and resolutions have no basis in the Senate rules, they nevertheless have grown up as a custom here, and such `holds' are practiced. 
I have observed that censure is not mentioned in the Constitution. But, certainly censure is not `meaningless.' It is a serious and emphatic expression of condemnation and disapproval. Censure by the Congress is a major blot on the record and reputation of a public official. While at this point, I prefer to reserve judgment on that course, it should not be simply brushed off as `meaningless.' 
And we must not fail to consider the lessons of history. For my part, I have seen history repeat itself. I served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and was the Democratic Whip during the weeks and months of the Nixon tragedy. Some of the aspects of that tragedy can be seen in the problems that are today confronting us. Some aspects are different. Much is the same. 
By April 1973, there had been talk of impeachment of President Nixon, with some people saying that he should resign. On May 23 of that year, I said, `As of now, there is no reason for President Nixon to resign, and talk of impeachment is at best, premature, and, at worst, reckless.' Citing the lack of hard evidence `to date,' I also said, `It is a time for restraint and sobriety in our words, our actions, and our judgments.' 
I later said that impeachment would require `hard evidence' of Nixon's complicity in Watergate and would also require strong `public opinion to support' impeachment and conviction. And I say to my colleagues here today, it will require strong `public opinion to support' impeachment and conviction of any President in the future. 
`We all shrink from taking a step that is the most drastic step authorized in the Constitution,' I said. I added that `the bare possibility of resignation of Mr. Nixon at some point is a more likely event than impeachment.' Those are my quotes as I look back. 
On January 28, 1974, I was a guest on `Washington's Straight Talk,' a 30-minute public television interview show. In reference to the impact that the Watergate Affair was having on the President, I stated: `There is no question but that his influence has been greatly eroded. I doubt that he can ever regain the confidence of the American people.' I also said that impeachment of the President `is becoming a more realistic possibility, but there is still no groundswell for impeachment.' I was talking about a Republican President in that instance. `There is an uneasiness on impeachment because of the paralysis that would come with it,' I said then. 
I cosponsored a resolution directing the Committee on Rules and Administration--on which I served and still serve--to review all existing rules and precedents that applied to impeachment trials in order to recommend any revisions to the rules that might be necessary. The result of our work was an exhaustively researched publication, titled, `Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the United States Senate.' The Senate was, indeed, gearing up for an impeachment trial--if needed. 
But, on Thursday, August 8, 1974--almost a quarter of a century ago--President Nixon resigned, his resignation to be effective at noon the next day. And promptly after noon on Friday, August 9, Gerald Ford was sworn in as the 38th President. 
Mr. President, just as I urged caution and patience in 1973 and 1974, I urge that same course now. I suggest that we try to restrain ourselves and wait until the House of Representatives has had an opportunity to examine the contents of Mr. Starr's report. It will be forthcoming soon, I hear. Perhaps before the week is out. Let us, as Senators, remember that if the House ultimately votes to impeach this President--and we all should be careful not to attempt to influence the other body--when I say `we all' I have reference to ourselves, to the executive branch and to the media--in any way in a decision which should rest with the House, and it alone--we Senators, who must sit as jurors if the worst ever comes to worst, will carry a heavy burden in that event. We must not compromise any final decision by rushing to judgment in advance. I trust that we will all weigh carefully, in our own minds and hearts, the possible consequences to the nation of our words and actions and judgments if that duty ultimately should beckon us. If it does, there will be many difficult questions. 
What is an impeachable offense? We read in last weekend's newspaper. And what is meant by `high crimes and misdemeanors'? We heard the question asked on television. Gerald Ford, in remarks to the House of Representatives in April 1970, stated: `The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers [it] to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two-thirds'--not just 60--`of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.' 
Even though the debates and actions at the Philadelphia Convention regarding impeachment appear on the record to have been comparatively sparse, they seem to indicate clearly enough that the framers intended the phrase `high Crimes and Misdemeanors' to subsume corruption, maladministration, gross and wanton neglect of duty, misuse of official power, and other violations of the public trust by officeholders.' 
The interpretation of the Constitution's clause on impeachable offenses entered into the ratification debates. James Iredell, speaking at the North Carolina Convention, declared that the `power of impeachment' given by the Constitution was `to bring great offenders to punishment. . . . for crime which it is not easy to describe, but which every one must be convinced is a high crime and misdemeanor against the government.' Iredell, who would later serve as a Supreme Court justice, said that the `occasion' for exercise of the impeachment power `will arise from acts of great injury to the community, and the objects of it may be such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary tribunal.' 
Alexander Hamilton, hoping to influence the critical New York decision on ratification, explained in The Federalist No. 65:  
A well constituted court for the trial of impeachments, is an object not more to be desired than difficult to be obtained in a government wholly elective. The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety to be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself. . . . What it may be asked is the true spirit of the institution itself? Is it not designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct of public men? 
A misconception that has surfaced during impeachment trials is the notion that criminal or civil standards of proof are somehow required in order to convict. Such standards run the gamut from the lowest threshold, proof by `preponderance of the evidence,' which must be met by plaintiffs in most civil cases; to the next highest standard, proof by `clear and convincing evidence,' employed in some classes of civil cases; to the most rigorous standard, `proof beyond a reasonable doubt,' imposed for criminal cases. Of course, Mr. President, a Senator may apply any standard of proof he or she desires, or may choose to apply no set standard whatever. But, given the history of impeachment in the United States and the fact that neither civil penalties nor criminal punishments are applicable in impeachment cases, any talk of standards of proof seems rather pointless and likely to be unproductive. 
If they have taught us nothing else, the events of recent months at least should have taught us the essential importance of restraint. As Members of this body, we are all likely to be sorely tested in this matter. The nation will look to us for leadership. And in critical times, real leadership often requires one to turn one's back on the daily hue and cry and quietly sort through the noise of competing interests for the one overriding, essential interest. Such a course demands restraint and discipline. We, who may one day be called upon to bear the brunt of the responsibility of deciding the fate of a president, must reach for those qualities at this time. 
And so, I respectfully urge everyone in this town to calm down for a little while and contemplate with seriousness the impact that our actions may have on the well-being of the nation, and the paralysis which we may 
be spawning if we continue to be mesmerized with each new rumor, and each new titillating whisper. The President's situation--and the Congress', the media's, and the public's all-consuming obsession with it--has contributed to a loss of focus on, and attention to, many aspects of our national life that have far-reaching consequences; and we shall see a continuation of that loss of focus when and if the time ever comes that we have to vote on an impeachment resolution. Nowhere is this more true than in the realm of foreign policy. In the few snippets of newspaper and news shows which attempt to turn our attention from our unfortunate domestic travails and focus instead on events overseas, we can see the troubling signs of a long and difficult winter ahead. 
In the Balkans, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army has reportedly rounded up ethnic Albanian men and boys of fighting age in the province of Kosovo, labeling them all `terrorists.' This action bears the bloody stains of earlier Serbian `ethnic cleansing' in neighboring Bosnia that eventually led to a massive intervention by NATO. What action, if any, should the U.S. take? I fear that our lack of attention may allow the situation to get even further out of hand. 
In Iraq, troubling questions have been raised about an unwillingness to deal with continued Iraqi intransigence over weapons inspections. Russia's economy and indeed her very government appear on the verge of dissolution. North Korea has launched a long range missile right over our ally, Japan. In China and elsewhere, many tens of thousands of people face the coming winter hungry and homeless as a result of floods and fires and droughts. And, not least, acts of terrorism against U.S. embassies and interests continue to threaten. All of these unhappy circumstances will challenge the U.S. economy and U.S. leadership. It ill behooves us all to become so enmeshed in the current web of scandal that we ignore or obscure opportunities to deal with these serious challenges before they escalate into full-blown crises. 
We cannot continue to swirl in this miasma of misery if we are to judiciously carry out our duties as the representatives of the people. Impeachment is among the most serious, if not the most serious, duty meted out to us in the Constitution that we are sworn to support and defend. Let us wait for the facts to come out before we rush to judgment as to the action we should take. Let us wait for the House to determine those facts from the report that will shortly be presented to it. And then, hopefully, we can all see what the facts are. 
There are serious challenges to our nation ahead. Here in the Senate, we may be called upon to help restore such forgotten qualities as courage, integrity, dignity, fairness, and thoughtfulness to a situation marked, for the most part, by the absence of those characteristics. For my part, I shall pray that we who serve here will do our best to restore the sense of serious contemplation and quiet duty expected of us under the Constitution and by the good people of this nation during times of testing and crisis. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his words, which I take very seriously, and for his kindness, as always, to me. 
I hope that I have spoken wisely. I hope that I will not be misunderstood. I simply think that before we reach a judgment on this President or any other President--and I said this when Mr. Nixon was in the docks, as it were--I hope that we Senators will not advocate impeachment or censure or resignation at least until the Starr report has reached the House and the House has had an opportunity to conduct hearings, if it so chooses, and has formulated articles, if it so chooses. There will be plenty of time then for Senators to reach that judgment. In the meantime, we have much to do. I thank the distinguished Senator.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Interior and Related Agencies. I speak in support of the fiscal year 1999 interior appropriations bill. This is an important bill which provides for the management of our Nation's natural resources and funds research critical to our energy future. It supports the well-being of our Indian populations and protects the historical and cultural heritage of our country. I hope the Senate will move swiftly through the bill. 
It has been my privilege, Mr. President, to serve as the Ranking Member for this bill at the side of our very able Chairman, the senior Senator from Washington. Senator Gorton has done an outstanding job in crafting the bill and balancing its many competing interests, and crafting the Interior bill is not an easy task. The Interior bill remains one of the most popular appropriation bills, funding a diverse set of very worthy programs and projects. The bill is full of thousands of relatively small, yet very meaningful details. Our Chairman is a master of the complexities of the bill, and it is a pleasure to work on this appropriations bill with Senator Gorton. He has treated Senators fairly and openly. This bill was put together in a bipartisan manner, and it reflects priorities identified by many Senators, by the public, and by the agencies that are charged with carrying out the programs and projects funded in the bill. 
The breadth of the activities covered by the Interior bill is vast--ranging from museums to parks to hospitals to resources to research--with most of the funds being spent far away from the Capitol and far away from Washington. This bill funds hundreds of national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other land management units. The bill supports more than 400 Indian hospitals and clinics and thousands of Indian students. A wide variety of natural science and energy research and technology development is funded through this bill, providing immediate and far-reaching benefits to all parts of our country and to our society as a whole. 
This bill makes its presence known in every State--from the rocky coasts of Maine to the mountains of California, from the coral reefs of Florida to the farflung island territories of the Pacific, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. And the number of requests that Senator Gorton and I have received from Senators for project funding in the Interior bill numbers more than 1,400--1,400 requests for specific items. This reflects its broad impact. While it is impossible to include every request, Senator Gorton has done an admirable job of accommodating high-priority items within the allocation, an allocation that is $660 million below the President's budget request and $290 million below last year's enacted level in new spending authority. Since the bill is at its allocation, any additional funding sought by Senators will need to be offset. 
Mr. President, highlights of this bill include: 
A total of $233 million for land acquisition, which is $37 million below the President's request and $38 million below the level of funding included in title I and title II of last year's bill for land acquisition. 
A continuing emphasis on operating and protecting our national parks. Park operation funds are increased by $55 million, including $15 million targeted for the special operations initiative, $10 million for an across-the-board increase for all parks, and $14 million for maintenance. 
A total of $10 million for the President's Millennium initiative, `Save America's Treasures.' In addition, specific funding for critical historical and cultural resources is contained in the normal funding categories--items such as restoration of the Star Spangled Banner at the Smithsonian Institution, presevation of Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, protection of buildings at the Edison National Historic Site, and stabilization and protection of the Longfellow National Historic Site. 
A continuing focus on the maintenance backlog needs of the land management agencies. Specific increases include: +$6 million for BLM facilities maintenance; +$10 million for FWS refuge operations and maintenance; +$18 million for NPS maintenance; and +$13 million for Forest Service road maintenance. 
A total of $155 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing operation of the reserve without selling any of its oil. 
An increase of $45 million above the President's request for the Indian Health Services program to help cover fixed costs. The administration's budget gave no consideration to these needs for IHS. 
A net increase of $35 million for energy conservation programs--including increases for weatherization assistance, the building equipment and materials program, the industry sector programs, and the transportation programs. 
Mr. President, while this bill provides needed resources for protecting some of our Nation's most valuable treasures, we still have a long way to go. The agencies funded through this bill are starting to make progress towards addressing their backlog maintenance issues, thanks in great measure to the leadership of the Congress, the expansion of private-public partnerships, and the development of innovative user fees. 
But we are by no means out of the woods. Many deplorable conditions remain; many important resource and research needs are unmet. We must continue our vigilance towards unnecessary new initiatives as well as unwise decreases, our support for the basic programs that provide the foundation of the Interior bill, and our careful stewardship of the resources and assets placed in our trust. 
Mr. President, the chairman and manager of the bill has already stated for the record many of the salient points that are covered in the bill, many of the items, many of the programs and projects. There is no need for my repeating them here. 
Lastly, Mr. President, I extend a warm word of appreciation to the staff that have assisted the chairman and myself in our work on this bill. They work as a team and serve both of us, as well as all Senators, in a very effective and dedicated manner. On the majority side, the staff members are Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Leif Fonnesbeck, Mary Ellen Mueller, and Kevin Johnson. On my staff, Sue Masica, Kurt Dodd, Craig Leff, and Carole Geagley have worked on the Interior bill this year. This team works under the tutelage of the staff directors of the full committee--Steve Cortese for the majority and Jim English for the minority. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to share my deep appreciation for the wonderful words that members of the subcommittee and full committee have spoken about Sue Masica, the minority clerk for the bill, who recently accepted a position with the National Park Service. Sue was the best of the best. She will be sorely missed by myself and by the other Senators. Her dedication, acumen, and team spirit epitomize the Senate and the appropriations process. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill, and I urge the Senate to complete its action promptly. 
And I urge all Senators to support the bill in its final passage. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I join with my two illustrious leaders in saluting Senator Thurmond--truly an outstanding Senator. None of us has ever seen a Senator like Senator Thurmond. He has served in the U.S. Senate 44 years. He has accumulated scores of honors, awards, and accolades. 
Today, he adds yet another accomplishment to his roster of achievements: the casting of his 15,000th vote in the Senate. 
This is a remarkable milestone for a remarkable individual. 
I would suggest if anyone wants to read a truly remarkable autobiography or biographical sketch, they read in the Senate Congressional Record about Senator Thurmond. I have never seen anything like the accounts of his career. 
Casting fifteen thousand votes in the United States Senate represents a record of service that few in this Chamber can hope to achieve in a lifetime. For Senator Thurmond, it is only part of the story. 
It was only after a rich and varied career that spanned more than three decades--a career as a teacher, a decorated World War II soldier, a governor, and a lawyer in private practice and he studied Blackstone; Blackstone; not many lawyers can say they studied Blackstone--that Strom Thurmond embarked on a new chapter in his life. In 1954, at the age of 52, he became the first--and only--person to be elected to the Senate on a write-in ballot. That is a remarkable achievement in itself. He remains today the oldest and the longest serving Senator in history, a true legend in this institution and in his home state of South Carolina. 
Although he has worn many different hats over the years--teacher, soldier, lawyer, governor, Senator--the common threads that are woven throughout his life are those of patriotism and service to his fellow citizens. His first job out of college, after graduating from Clemson University in 1923, was as a teacher and athletic coach in his hometown of Edgefield, South Carolina. It wasn't long before he was named county superintendent of education while studying law--Blackstone--in his spare time. By 1930, he had his law degree and was serving as city and county attorney in his hometown. 
He was elected state senator in 1933 and began service as a circuit judge in 1938. So he has been in all of the branches of Government--the judicial branch, the executive branch, and the legislative branch. Four years later, after 1938, he left his promising judicial career behind to volunteer--volunteer--for service in World War II. He was soon flung directly into the eye of the storm, landing at Normandy on D-Day with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. The distinction with which he served in World War II earned him five Battle Stars and 15 decorations, medals, and other awards. Now, who can match that? 
At the end of the war, Strom Thurmond returned home and was elected governor of South Carolina. It was only after a run for President in 1948, the completion of his term of office as governor, and a brief period of private law practice that Senator Thurmond turned his sights to the United States Senate. His length of service and the thousands of votes he has cast in this institution are proof that he has never looked back. 
At a time in his life when most would have put the rigors of the workplace long behind them, Senator Thurmond continues his public service. He serves ably as chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee and as the senior member of the Judiciary and Veterans Affairs Committees. As President pro tempore of the Senate, he is meticulous in attending to his duties, often as I have said being the first to arrive in this chamber in order to call the Senate into session. 
For many years, the walls of Senator Thurmond's office in the Russell Senate Office Building were lined, floor to ceiling, with hundreds of plaques and pictures and certificates of appreciation for his service to the people of South Carolina and to the nation. Those awards and citations marked the moments in history that Senator Thurmond has witnessed, and influenced, from his position as a United States Senator. No doubt he could connect many of his 15,000 votes with the events chronicled and memorialized on the walls of his office. Many of those mementoes have been transferred to the Strom Thurmond Institute of Government and Public Affairs at Senator Thurmond's alma mater, Clemson University, but for those of us who have been privileged to see them, it was a striking sight. 
And yet, if one were to visit Senator Thurmond's office when all of those citations were displayed there, one would find that the Senator would not direct your attention to the case displaying his military medals. He would not point out the photos of him with Presidents and world leaders. He would not urge you to read the commendations from esteemed organizations in his state or in the nation. No, Senator Thurmond would draw your attention to the photos of his four children, Nancy Moore, a promising college student whose life was cut short by a tragic automobile accident; Strom Jr., a lawyer like his father--I doubt he studied Blackstone; Julie, who works for the Red Cross; and Paul, who works for the Senate Government Affairs Committee. Those children are the crowning achievements of Senator Thurmond's career; among all of his historic votes and all of his honors and awards, they are the accomplishments of which he is most proud. 
The sheer number of votes that he has cast is a wonderful achievement for which we honor Senator Thurmond, but as a fellow Senator, a father, and a grandfather myself, I salute Senator Thurmond not only for the number of votes that he has cast but also for his lifelong dedication to the Senate, to his family, his patriotism, and his service to the people of America. 
Mr. President, 1,843 Senators have served in this body since the Senate first met on April 6, 1789. I can remember Strom Thurmond when I first came to the Senate. As I look around me, he is the only Senator in this body whom I recognize as a Senator who sat here when I took my oath of office for the first time as a Senator. 
I can remember his wife, his first wife, as she sat in the galleries and looked down at the Senate, listening to Strom as he spoke. Then when she was taken away by the Father of us all, I came to the Senate that day and I saw Strom Thurmond, sitting right there at his desk, as I recall. I walked up to him, held out my hand and told him I was sorry. That same stern, strong look that we so often see on Strom Thurmond's face was the look that he gave to me; a strong, firm handshake; straight as an arrow, stern as an Indian, he thanked me for my expression of condolences. 
It has been said that `the measure of a man's life is the well spending of it, and not the length.' By any measure, Senator Thurmond is an example of a life both great in length and well spent. I congratulate my esteemed and illustrious colleague on his remarkable career and on his remarkable life. 
I thank my Creator for having blessed me with the many thousands of friendships that I have enjoyed over the years, so many scores of which have been other Members of this Chamber, among whom only one do I look upon as senior to myself. I congratulate myself on having lived to serve with this man, and I hope that God's blessings will continue to be upon Strom Thurmond. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Indiana will allow me, there have been other references made here of a personal nature involving Senator Thurmond. I would not want to let this occasion pass without my making one such reference. 
It was on April 12 of 1982 that I lost my grandson in a truck accident. Memorial services were held 2 days later. My colleague, Senator Randolph, came to that memorial service--my then colleague. My present colleague, Senator Rockefeller, was Governor of the State of West Virginia at that time. He came. There was one other Senator who attended that memorial service for my grandson. 
And that Senator was Strom Thurmond. I can never forget that, and I would have been remiss in letting this opportunity pass without my having publicly expressed my gratitude to Strom Thurmond for his having attended that service on that day, a day that I can never, never forget. I thank him from the bottom of my heart. 
I think Senator Thurmond wishes to say something and so I shall take my seat.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Specter announced earlier today the release of a voluminous and comprehensive report of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs special investigation unit on Gulf War illnesses. I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania and the other Members of the Committee, including my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, on this report, which was over a year in the making. In great detail, this report and its appendices provide the justification for legislation that Senator Specter, Senator Rockefeller, and I introduced on July 28, S. 2358, the Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. 
The history of this sorry saga of war, illness, and bureaucratic bungling it details has not improved with time. Indeed, age has turned this victory wine into sour vinegar, not a vintage to be savored. Since the signing of the cease fire in Iraq in 1991, soldiers have been complaining of symptoms that have been poorly dealt with by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the years have passed, we have learned that these soldiers, sailors, and airmen had to operate in a toxic atmospheric cocktail of environmental and battlefield hazards, topped off with a chaser of vaccines and pills that may have interacted poorly with all the other hazardous exposures. We have learned that our equipment to detect and protect our troops may not be good enough, and that their training and doctrine is inadequate. We have even learned of the role that the U.S. played in arming Iraq with chemical and biological warfare technology and materials. Finally, DOD and the VA record keeping was poor, the databases inadequately designed and incompatible, so that the ability to identify battlefield exposures--when known--is not available to the VA when requested by a sick soldier. We won the war, but the price paid by these soldiers has been unacceptably high, perhaps needlessly high. And DOD and the VA have done little to correct the problems. The official motto seems to be `That which does not kill us, we ignore--unless forced to address it.' 
Like other Members, I have tried to correct these matters as they have come to light. I successfully offered an amendment to ensure DOD and the Intelligence Community consultation when pathogens useful to a biological warfare program are approved for export, so that we have a better opportunity to track countries that have the capability, if not the intent, to produce biological warfare agents. I obtained funding for the first peer-reviewed scientific studies of the possible health effects of exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents. An amendment I authored that was adopted by the Senate but rejected in conference would have provided military health care to the children of Gulf War veterans born with birth defects that might be linked to their parent's wartime exposures. 
This year, I offered amendments to the Department of Defense authorization bill to improve the oversight and approval process for granting waivers to use investigational drugs without informed consent of the troops, and to require a review of chemical warfare defense doctrine to address exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents. This last effort is based on a soon-to-be released General Accounting Organization (GAO) study that I requested last year in conjunction with Senator Levin and Senator Glenn. I am sorry to say that, despite DOD's 1996 show of concern over possible chemical exposures at Khamisiyah [Kam-ih-see-yah] and other Iraqi sites that may have resulted in the exposure of U.S. personnel to varying levels of chemical warfare agents, little has been done to address the lack of training that should better enable our troops to recognize and take effective action to protect themselves from these potential health threats. We have also requested GAO to look into the adequacy of U.S. detection and protection equipment and efforts to address hazardous, but not lethal, levels of chemical and biological warfare agents. This study will be completed next year. 
While I hope that my efforts and the efforts of other Members and Committees can push DOD and the VA into facing the serious new health consequences of war on the modern battlefield, even these cannot adequately substitute for an epiphany in those departments that will result in a sincere and thorough examination of this issue, and in proactive and coordinated steps to correct the deficiencies outlined in this comprehensive report. 
There is no smoking gun in this report, no explosive new evidence that says `whodunit' and why. But like previous reports by Congress, the GAO, and the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses, this report confirms that our veterans were exposed to a poison cocktail of hazardous materials, that many are now ill, and that the bureaucratic response has been slow and stumbling. It is likely that there will never be a clear and final answer for our sick soldiers and their families as to exactly what ails them. But this report does offer many corrective recommendations aimed at preventing the veterans of the next war from having to go through the years of frustration and outrage that the sick veterans of the Persian Gulf War have endured. It also offers a solid foundation to move forward and address the legitimate health concerns of Persian Gulf veterans that are contained in S. 2358, the Persian Gulf Veterans Act of 1998. Gulf War veterans in West Virginia and across the country are getting sick as a result of their participation in the Gulf War, which may have exposed them to a variety of hazardous materials and chemicals while serving their country. But instead of receiving medical care, these veterans are given bureaucratic excuses. It is time to end the litany of excuses and to give our veterans the health care they deserve. I again thank my friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for his efforts, and the efforts and my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. I congratulate and thank the committee for its efforts. I look forward to the successful passage of S. 2358. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend, Mr. Specter, for his courtesy in allowing me to proceed at this point. I now yield the floor.

If the managers of the bill would entertain a question, it is my understanding from their explanation that their intent in including the notification requirements in sections 540(a) and 572(b) is to support these activities, and to ensure that information the Congress asks for is provided by the administration. I want to be sure that, assuming the administration keeps the Congress informed about how appropriated funds are to be spent, the Congress intends for these programs to receive the necessary funds. Am I correct?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, I took the Senate floor to call attention to reports that the Secretary of Defense was prepared to offer a proposal that would ease the penalties for adultery in the military. The report set off alarm bells in my own mind because moral responsibility in the military cannot be compromised without undermining the core values of the services --values such as honor, integrity, and loyalty. 
As a result of my remarks, Secretary Cohen called me at home on Sunday--I believe it was Sunday--to assure me that he had no intention of watering down the Defense Department's policies concerning adultery and fraternization. In fact, he said, the new rules he was considering would strengthen those policies. 
I appreciate the seriousness with which Secretary Cohen views this matter, and I applaud his efforts to come to grips with policies that have precipitated uneven treatment of military personnel and have resulted in morale-damaging charges of double standards. 
The proposed new Pentagon policies were announced earlier this week, and I commend Secretary Cohen for upholding the military code of justice and resisting pressure to reduce the penalties for adultery. I wish I could have confidence that the new policies are sufficient and will fulfill Secretary Cohen's intent of ensuring even-handed treatment of adultery in the military. Unfortunately, I fear that the new policies fall short of the mark in that respect. Moreover, I fear that these new guidelines send conflicting signals to commanders in the field: Yes, on the one hand, adultery is still a crime in the military; but no, on the other hand, it will not be criminally prosecuted unless it is so flagrant that it disrupts or discredits the military. 
I fear that some could read into these guidelines a message to the troops that lying and cheating are okay as long as you don't get caught. I do not for a moment believe that that is the message the Defense Department intends to communicate. 
The stated intent of the new policies is to standardize good order and discipline policies among the Services, and to clarify guidance on the offense of adultery under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In the case of fraternization, the new guidelines seem clear cut--they will impose a military-wide ban on fraternization, bringing the Army into line with the fraternization policies currently enforced by the Navy, Air Force, and yes, the good old Marine Corps. 
The impact of the guidelines as they apply to the handling of adultery cases in the military is where the message gets muddled. The new guidelines, according to the Pentagon, do not change the Uniform Military Code of Justice. They do not lower the standards of conduct demanded of America's military forces. They do not preclude a court martial or dishonorable discharge for adultery. That's what the guidelines don't do. What they do accomplish, in my opinion, is much harder to quantify. 
Under these guidelines, adultery would remain a crime in the military, but it would only be criminally prosecuted if it brought discredit to the military or disrupted the good order and discipline of the armed services. That caveat, while currently an element of proof of the offense of adultery under the Uniform Military Code of Justice, is given added weight and emphasis under the new guidelines. 
Now, I have been accused, from time to time, of being old-fashioned, strait-laced, and of wearing 19th century clothes and a stickler for the rules and a stickler for propriety. I plead guilty on all counts, other than the 19th century business with respect to my clothing, but I do not believe that one has to be old-fashioned to recognize that adultery is a dishonorable act that intrinsically brings discredit to the offending party and, in the case of the military, to the uniform that he or she wears. I do not believe that honor and integrity anywhere, especially in the military, have ever gone out of fashion. And I do not believe that one has to be strait-laced to recognize that lying, cheating, and deceiving--all elements of adultery--intrinsically subvert good order and discipline. 
Yet it seems to me that these guidelines shift the emphasis of adultery in the military from the crime to the consequences. Rather than clarifying the offense of adultery, it seems to me that these guidelines confuse the issue. What constitutes `discredit to the armed forces' if not a crime--and adultery is a crime in the military? What constitutes the disruption of `good order and discipline' if not lying, cheating, and deceiving in the commission of a crime? 
Honor, integrity, and decency are universal values and principles. They are absolute. They do not fade with the passing of time or cease to matter behind closed doors. When a person takes an oath before God and country, as the military do, that oath is taken without qualification or reservation. It is not limited by time or place or who knows about it. 
Mr. President, I believe that Secretary Cohen is dedicated to maintaining the high standards of the United States military. I know that he has put a great deal of time, thought, and effort into restoring consistency to the application of the military code of conduct. I commend him for his efforts, and I urge him to continue working on this extremely important and sensitive aspect of military service. 
The men and women who serve in the United States military are remarkable individuals. They willingly endure the hardships that military life imposes on them and their families. They willingly sacrifice personal freedoms for the good of the nation. They willingly take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend this great nation, with their lives if necessary. 
For the life of me, I cannot square that level of total commitment with official guidelines whose recommended remedies for the crime of adultery include `counseling' or `an adverse fitness report.' 
I cannot square the core values of the United States military with a guidance regarding adultery that appears to encourage commanding officers to overlook the crime of adultery if it is `remote in time.' 
Mr. President, how remote is remote? What kind of clarity does that guidance impart? Is last month remote enough in time to avoid a criminal prosecution for adultery? How about last week--is that enough? 
Last month? Last year? Would this `clarification' have salvaged Air Force General Joseph Ralston's nomination to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? Would this guideline let Army Major General David Hale off the hook for abruptly retiring while he was under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct? 
Is discretion what we are really talking about here? Do these guidelines send a signal to our troops that the crime of adultery is not really that bad as long as you are discrete and don't disrupt your unit? Are we giving a whole new meaning to the sentiment, `The better part of valor is discretion'? 
I do not for a moment believe that this is Secretary Cohen's intent. I do not for a moment believe that our Nation's military leadership wishes to erode the standards of conduct for the military. But I do express a warning that these guidelines, well-intentioned though they may be, will not solve any problems. These guidelines will not erase the perception that the military applies a double standard to senior officers and enlisted personnel. And most important, these guidelines will not strengthen the necessary trust and cohesiveness that help to make America's military forces the finest in the world--we think. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, August is from the Latin Augustus, the eighth month of our calendar year, a time of harvest and of plenty, named after Augustus Caesar. Augustus Caesar, or, more formally, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. He was the grandnephew of Julius Caesar, and he was the first emperor of Rome, from 27 B.C. through 14 A.D. August is also an adjective, derived from the Latin verb meaning to increase, and in English meaning: to inspire awe and reverence, impose, something that is imposing and magnificent, or dignified and majestic. The adjective augustan refers also to the age of Augustus Caesar and his reign and suggests that anything so described is classical and elegant. The term Augustan age specifically refers to a period of Latin literature during the reign of Augustus Caesar, when elegance and correctness were highly valued. Oh, that we might return to that age at least in one sense, when elegance and correctness--not political correctness, but correctness--were highly valued. 
Augustine, a diminutive form of Augustus, was the name of two saints, Saint Augustine of Hippo (354-430 A.D.), a Latin church father and bishop of Hippo, in northern Africa, known for his `Confessions' and his work `The City of God.' The second Saint Augustine--the dates we are not sure of but we can believe that he lived until about 604 A.D. He was a Roman monk who went to spread Christianity among the English and who was the first Archbishop of Canterbury. 
We can see from this that the name Augustus is fraught with significance and with portent. It is a name to be lived up to with great deeds and great learning. It is also the name conferred upon the newest member of Senator Ted Stevens' growing family, Augustus Engleken Stevens. 
My guess would be the middle name is Anglo-Saxon. And this is the third child of Senator Stevens' third son, Ben. 
It is also the tenth grandchild to join the impressive Stevens clan. This newest Caesar to rule with his chubby and imperious fist, and to issue edicts in a piercing wail, was born on Monday, July 27, at 3:20 p.m., weighing in at a healthy 7 pounds, 10 ounces. 
I congratulate Senator Stevens and his wife, Catherine, on this blessed addition to their family. As they well know, there is no greater joy than to gather into one's arms a tiny, peaceful bundle, and to gaze down upon that small, sleeping face, to gently stroke the soft, velvety down of hair and rounded cheek, and to listen closely for the faint murmurs and coos that slip almost unnoticed from that perfect cupid's bow of a mouth. What happier moment could there be, than to see that little mouth open in a sleepy, toothless yawn, or to catch a glimpse of a little foot--not much longer than a peanut, with toes so small that they could not possibly have working bones inside them--kicking out on bowed leg from within the folded blanket? 
In choosing a name as ancient and as illustrious as Augustus, his parents--I surmise--have high hopes and grand ambitions for their infant son. I am sure that grandfather Ted has great, grandiloquent schemes afoot as well, to bounce him on a hobbyhorse knee, or to take him salmon fishing in pristine Alaskan waters. I suspect that those who see Ted on the Senate floor, shepherding appropriations bills through contentious debate to final passage--fists pounding and voice booming--might not recognize Senator Stevens in his happier and more serene role as grandfather. But to be a grandfather is to be a happy man. 
And what feelings of immortality, to be a grandfather. Holding this youngest member of his family, born in the waning days of this second millennium, the namesake of one whose life spanned the opening days of the first millennium, and poised to come into his own birthright in the third millennium, Senator Stevens can see history unfold into the coming ages. Through children and grandchildren, one has a glimpse of the glorious future, the immortality of the human race, tinged with the bittersweet sorrow of time passing too swiftly and of children who grow up much too quickly. 
Lest I overwhelm young Augustus with the great weight of such high expectations and such intimations of immortality, I hasten to wish him a happy childhood, complete with much exploring, great adventures, barked shins and skinned knees, of quiet moments of wonder and learning, of great books to be shared with his parents and grandparents, and of countless hugs and kisses. Be a boy, Augustus, with moments good and bad, tender and terrible. Be like the Augustus in these lines by Heinrich Hoffman (1809-1874), who said: 
Augustus was a chubby lad; 
Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had: 
And everybody saw with joy 
The plump and hearty, healthy boy. 
He ate and drank as he was told, 
And never let his soup get cold. 
But one day, one winter's day, 
He screamed out, `Take the soup away! 
O take the nasty soup away! 
I won't have any soup to-day.' 
Welcome, young emperor, and carry on, bringing ever your illustrious grandfather under your sway with the dictatorial charms of a much loved child. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators, and I, again, thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. 
Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for offering this amendment regarding the continued participation of U.S. forces in the NATO operation in Bosnia. She has been a persistent and thorough overseer of the situation there. I share her concern that Bosnia not become another forgotten war, another long term military mission whose purpose and even existence is largely ignored, unremarked upon unless something terrible happens. In that unhappy event, of course, much shouting and finger-pointing would ensue, amid calls to `bring our boys home, now.' 
It is Congress's Constitutional duty to provide for the maintenance of the military, as we are doing in this bill, and that includes those instances in which U.S. troops are pressed into service. We have an obligation to the men and women in our military services not only to provide for them, but also to provide our concurrence and oversight on the ways and places that they are employed. I believe that that calls for something more compelling than Sense of Congress resolutions, such as those that have been passed, one that has been passed during the debate on the Department of Defense Authorization bill last month, but I recognize that, sadly, the majority of my colleagues do not share my opinion. So I applaud Senator Hutchison for steaming ahead on the strength of her convictions, despite the somewhat daunting odds. 
U.S. troops have been in Bosnia since the Dayton Peace Accords were signed in December 1995. Some 25,000 U.S. troops formed the U.S. contingent of the NATO-led force that replaced the failing United Nations peacekeeping effort there since 1992. The original mission of the NATO force was quite limited--to separate the warring factions, contain the heavy weapons that were bombarding defenseless towns and cities, and begin to mark the hazardous and indiscriminately strewn minefields so that civilians could take over the arduous task of clearing mines. The U.S. had to lead, because our European allies would not rally behind anyone else. This task, we were assured at that time, would take `about one year.' And that was in 1995. 
As that initial year drew to a close, the military tasks were declared essentially complete, and the situation on the ground was, indeed, transformed. While far from enjoying the kind of security that we in the United States take for granted, people could at least seek water without dodging shells and gunfire. The civilian efforts to reestablish Bosnian society, however, had barely begun. NATO leaders agreed to leave substantial numbers of troops in place to keep the peace while the civilian rebuilding effort continued. That is understandable. Again, the U.S., we were assured, must take the lead, because if we left, our European NATO allies would march out right behind us. We were told that the troops would be needed only through June 1998. That was in 1996. 
Now it is July 1998, almost August. We have been told that the considerable progress being made in rebuilding a government and civilian infrastructure requires the continued reassurance of a NATO peacekeeping force. Elections are scheduled for September, and more work needs to be done to establish a competent and impartial justice system that has the trust of the populace. Therefore, the Administration announced a substantial shift in U.S. policy on Bosnia in December 1997--there would be no further estimates regarding the end of a U.S. presence in Bosnia. The U.S. and NATO would leave when sufficient progress was made in achieving certain benchmarks. The complete and detailed benchmarks are classified, but the unclassified summary that I have seen is fairly lengthy. It basically says that when Bosnian government and institutions resemble those of the United States, then our troops might leave. 
Mr. President, that is a pretty big order. Bosnia has never previously resembled the United States, with free press, alternative media, free and fair multiparty elections, a clean and impartial judiciary, free access throughout the country, and so forth. For most of this century, Bosnia was part of communist Yugoslavia. Prior to that, it was part of a monarchy, and before that, it was part of the Ottoman Empire. This leads me to suspect that U.S. troops might be in Bosnia for a very long time, indeed, before Bosnia becomes a happy, peaceful, multi-ethnic republic. And this assumes, of course, that everyone in Bosnia shares this same aspiration, and that no one will try to undermine the progress towards this utopian vision. 
Now, Mr. President, I do not want to create the impression that I am against helping the suffering people of Bosnia to establish a sound government that can lead them into a peaceful and prosperous future in the family of nations. The amendment of the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, also does not call for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Bosnia. This amendment appreciates the investment that has been made for peace in Bosnia and does not jeopardize that still fragile situation, but it also recognizes the considerable costs of that investment. 
I believe that Senator Hutchison's effort addresses three very basic questions regarding the continuing role of U.S. forces in Bosnia. These are the questions: 
First, does this Senate really want to acquiesce to an open-ended commitment in Bosnia for the foreseeable future? The United States has spent $8.6 billion, or about $2 billion a year, to maintain our presence in Bosnia from Fiscal Year 1996 through Fiscal Year 1999. If you include the U.S. share of the United Nations operation in Bosnia from 1992 through 1995, the total cost is about $9.5 billion. 
That is a lot of money. That is $9.50 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born, 2,000 years ago. For every minute since Jesus Christ was born, 2,000 years ago, $9.50. For every minute. That is what it equals. 
This bill provides $1.86 billion for Bosnia operating costs for Fiscal Year 1999, under an emergency declaration. 
There are approximately 6700 troops inside Bosnia now, down from almost 10,000, and another 3,000 more are supporting them from bases in Hungary, Italy, and on ships in the Mediterranean. These troops and these funds are not available to meet other crises that might arise, such as that developing in Kosovo, and they are not available to protect U.S. core national security interests. Further, the support troops employed in this mission are drawn heavily from the Guard and Reserves, creating hardships for our part-time military and their employers. The President will need to request continued Reserve call-up authority in August to maintain the Bosnia operation. These readiness questions must be measured against the estimate of how many troops are needed to provide continued reassurance for civilian reconstruction in Bosnia--what is the minimum number of troops required to provide that reassurance? And for how long? And at what cost? Let us not be satisfied with the status quo, if a lower number is adequate or if a shorter time is sufficient. There are too many other demands being placed upon U.S. Armed Forces for us to be spendthrifts in this regard. 
Second, does the Senate wish to continue to allow the United States to be led by the reluctance of others? Must the United States continue to provide a substantially greater number of troops than any of the other NATO allies, as is now envisioned? If we cannot pass the baton of leadership because our European allies will not lead, then should we not at least push them into carrying an equal military burden for a situation that is, after all, on their borders, not on ours? I know that it is easier to be a follower than a leader, easier to be a critic rather than a playwright, but as the Bosnia operation settles into a routine, surely some of this burden could be assumed by our allies. 
Third, does the Senate want to abstain from placing limits on the role that U.S. forces should play in Bosnia? Or do we want to enhance the safety of the men and women we are supporting on the ground there by prohibiting them from performing the kinds of activities that put them in harm's way by making them appear to side with one ethnic group over another? NATO forces have played an increasing role in the capture of war criminals, and have taken over radio transmission towers linked with propaganda practices. A news story from early July reported that U.S. special operations teams came very close to mounting a `snatch and grab' exercise designed to capture Serb military leaders before commanders on the ground declared that the intelligence was insufficient to ensure a reasonable chance of success. The longer we stay in Bosnia, and the more manpower we have to spare, the more such jobs we will be drawn into doing. It is the American way, to say, `we'll pitch in.' And we are suckers for the underdog. But that can be dangerous in a place as rife with centuries-old animosities as Bosnia. These ethnic and religious factions know how to carry a grudge, how to nurse an injustice, through centuries if need be. 
With these questions in mind, consider the current situation in the Balkans, as Senator Hutchison has. Bosnia is relatively stable. No one is shooting at each other, and no one is shooting at the NATO forces. But, Kosovo, on its borders, is not stable. There, the situation is rapidly degenerating. Already more than 10,000 refugees have fled into neighboring Albania to seek refuge from Serbian dominated Yugoslav military forces who are ruthlessly squashing a separatist movement in ethnically Albanian Kosovo, which had been an autonomous region of Yugoslavia until 1989. The situation is complex and, frighteningly, contains the potential to draw in neighboring nations and even NATO members. This is the dreaded `spillover' that was much discussed when the ethnic conflagration in Bosnia erupted in 1992. 
NATO officials have already contemplated what forces might be necessary to contain the conflict in Kosovo. Even with over 20,000 troops spread along the mountainous border between Kosovo and Albania, they concluded, the probability of success would be low. Air strikes are under consideration. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, but the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic has an unsavory history of playing both ends against the middle to achieve his goals. 
It is clear that the cost of maintaining a large presence in Bosnia could be fairly high if forces are needed to contain the conflict in Kosovo and keep it from engulfing a large part of the Balkans. Our NATO allies will happily continue to let the U.S. carry the heaviest load in addition to the burdens of leadership, if all it takes is to threaten to beat us through the exit door, should we decide to leave. To hear them say it, it would be quite a stampede, no matter what the consequences are for Bosnia and their own continent's future. 
The amendment offered by Senator Hutchison calls for a gradual ramping down of the U.S. presence in Bosnia, reducing our forces there to 5,000 by October 1, 1999, a number roughly equivalent to that of Britain, the next largest contributor to the NATO mission. The amendment of the Senator from Texas also limits the mission of those remaining forces to the security role assigned to them in 1995. This honors U.S. NATO commitments in Bosnia, protects our men and women in the military from being put in a position of playing favorites and therefore creating enemies, while freeing up troops, energy, and funds for other pressing security matters. 
The United States cannot continue to pick up the largest burden of every NATO military mission. While our allies have been reducing their military budgets and forces since the cold war ended, the United States military has been strained by the increasing number of calls to respond to crises around the world--in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Iraq, Bosnia, and next, perhaps, in Kosovo. Our generosity in picking up the bulk of the tab has, I fear, marked us as a patsy, a patsy who can be suckered into bankrolling everyone's problems with funds and troops. If we keep doing it, what incentive is there for anyone else to develop the expertise, training, and tools to take over appropriate parts of that role? 
I wish that the administration would put its support behind this amendment. I think it would strengthen the administration's position in talking with our allies in Europe, and it would seem to me that would be a very beneficial thing, insofar as the administration is concerned. 
Mr. President, I believe that Senator Hutchison has offered a blueprint for the continued U.S. participation in Bosnia that supports our NATO commitment, even our leadership role, but not at the cost of maintaining a disproportionate force size. The most important thing we can do here today is to let the soldiers and airmen out there so far away know that we are watching, and that we care enough about them to act in their best interests. They are not America's forgotten heroes, out of sight and out of mind unless trouble comes their way. We are there with them, in thought and in deed, and we will not keep any more of them engaged in lengthy and lonely overseas deployments for any longer than is absolutely necessary. I will vote for the Hutchison amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. BYRD. I wish to thank the opponents for offering 10 minutes to me, but I feel that I will just ask that my speech be printed in the Record. 
On a matter of this gravity, I am disappointed that the Senate has entered into an agreement to speak for what would amount to about 1 hour and 15 minutes for both opponents and proponents. Of course, the distinguished Senator from Illinois is preeminently correct in what he has said about the Constitution and what he has said about the efforts toward aggrandizement on the part of this administration and most recent administration when it comes to the war powers. 
We have in the Senate particularly, may I say, additional responsibilities over those of the House in this area of war powers because of the Constitution and provisions therein, and it seems to me that we ought to take a little more time when it comes to debating an amendment of this importance. This is an amendment that is calculated to protect the prerogatives of the Senate when it comes to our constitutional powers and duties, and here we are limited to 1 hour and 15 minutes. 
In saying this, of course, I am complaining, but I also want to thank Mr. Durbin and I want to thank Mr. Stevens for their consideration and kindness in offering to give me some additional time.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has nominated Brigadier General Allen E. Tackett for the rank of Major General. Brigadier General Tackett, a resident of Miami, West Virginia, graduated from East Bank High School and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Charleston, Charleston, West Virginia. He began his military career over 35 years ago as a Private in the Special Forces. Advancing from a Private to a Major General is an accomplishment which exemplifies his dedication to the National Guard, our country, and our State of West Virginia. 
Brigadier General Tackett is a military graduate of the Special Warfare Center, Jumpmaster Course; Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced Courses; Command and General Staff College; and the Special Warfare Center, Techniques of Special Operations. 
Brigadier General Tackett's major decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Medal, Humanitarian Medal, and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. He was awarded, through rigorous training and proven efficiency, the coveted Special Forces Tab and Master Parachutist Badge. 
Three years ago, Brigadier General Tackett assumed his current prestigious command as Adjutant General, West Virginia National Guard, with leadership responsibility for six thousand men and women serving in the West Virginia National Guard. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to cast my vote for the confirmation of Brigadier General Allen E. Tackett as Major General, and I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted to table an amendment to the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill that had been offered by the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. So there will be no confusion with respect to my position on this issue, I wish to advise my colleagues of the reason for my opposition. 
First, I am, as are others, deeply concerned with that anomaly in the tax code known as the `marriage penalty.' I can think of no rational reason why two individuals--individuals who have vowed a lifelong commitment to each other through the sacred institution of marriage--should, in certain cases, have their combined income taxed at a higher rate than that of two unmarried persons. At a time of declining social values, it simply does not make sense for the Congress to sanction policies which clearly work to the detriment of family stability. 
However, despite this concern, I could not, in all good conscience, support the Daschle amendment for the most basic of reasons, namely, that Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States requires that all revenue bills originate in the House of Representatives, not here in the Senate. As I am sure my colleagues know, that is a prerogative that the House vigorously defends. Consequently, I believe that had the Daschle amendment been adopted to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, which is a Senate-originated bill, that that bill would have been subjected to a constitutional point of order in the House. In short, adoption of the Daschle amendment would have killed this very important appropriations measure. 
Again, Mr. President, notwithstanding my vote earlier today, I wish my colleagues to know that I remain committed to working toward the goal of alleviating the marriage penalty in the tax code.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have just returned from a most moving ceremony in the great Rotunda of the Capitol. The flag-draped coffins of Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson, who died while doing their solemn duties protecting the public, the employees, and the members of the institution they served, rested imposingly on catafalques, mere yards from where these two brave men were brutally cut down by an armed assailant on last Friday. The sublime majesty of the great marble dome rising above us was somehow magnified by the solemn and eerie silence which was broken only by an occasional cough. The sense of loss was palpable. Sadness permeated the very air. 
Such times as these cause all of us to ponder anew the fragile brevity and uncertainty of the human condition. Officer Chestnut was apparently writing directions for a tourist--doing a kind deed--when his life was suddenly ended. I am sure that when he arose and dressed for work on Friday morning he expected nothing more than an ordinary day, followed by a night at home with his family and the simple pleasures of a sunny weekend. 
Officer Gibson, as he began his day, likewise, probably had no expectations of the bloody gun battle which would, in just hours, mean his death. It is at times like these, when we witness the anguish of families and friends trying to cope with the incomprehensible reality of brutal and sudden death, that some may wonder how a just God could allow such seemingly mindless violence and misery. In the face of such tragedies, some may even question the very existence of a Creator. We reach for answers that elude our grasp. Why do such things happen? What, after all, is the point of human existence? It seems that our faith is tested most severely when good men senselessly die. 
Yet, the proof of a living Creator is in abundant evidence all around us. It is in the perfection and order of the natural world in which we live. It is in the beauty and endless variety of the millions of species which inhabit the planet. It is in the mystery and complexity of the human genetic code. It is in the intangible and unconquerable bravery of the human spirit. It is in the magnificence of the wonders which modern science daily unveils. And I, for one, find no disparity between scientific discovery and God's living word in the Holy Bible. 
Genesis, the first book of the Bible, gives the account of all Creation, tells of the establishment of the family, the origin of sin, the giving of divine revelation, the development of the human race, and the inauguration of God's plan of redemption through its chosen people. Genesis takes the reader to the moment when the omnipotent Creator spoke into being the matchless wonders of sun, moon, stars, planets, galaxies, plants, and moving creatures, and man, whom He made in His image. It is the first book of the Pentateuch, which both Scripture and tradition attribute to Moses. 
If a student expects to find in Genesis a scientific account of how the world came into existence, with all questions concerning primitive life answered in technical language familiar to the professor or student of science, he will be disappointed. Genesis is not an attempt to answer such questions. It deals with matters far beyond the realm of science. Yet, I have not personally read of any disagreement within the science community concerning the chronological order of the events of creation as set forth in the book of Genesis. Instead of disagreement, it has been my perception that there is agreement. 
The opening sentence of the first chapter of Genesis states, `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.' That is as far back in time as one can get--`in the beginning.' And it could include a billion years or ten billion years or 500 billion years. 
The second sentence of Genesis, Chapter 1, reads as follows: `And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.' I doubt that any scientist would disagree with this. 
According to the account in Genesis, God then divided the light from the darkness, and scientists agree that there could have been cosmic light before the sun, moon and stars were created. The Creator then proceeded to divide the waters and to let the dry land appear. The dry land was called `earth,' and the gathering together of the waters was called `seas.' 
The next step as related by Genesis was the bringing forth of grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit. 
Then, according to Genesis, God said, `Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 
`And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind.' 
On the scientific side, facts from fossils, plus other data, have shown that mammals (animals with solid bones, warm blood, lungs that breathe air, and nourish their young with milk) form the final stage in a long series of development, which began with tiny sea-dwelling creatures. Scientists seem to think that an early type of fish was the ancestor of amphibians and thereafter evolved into mammal-like reptiles. The primitive amphibians also branched into creatures with wings and thus became birds and other fowl. Great changes occurred over time. Primitive true mammals, according to science, lived during the age of reptiles and these were the probable ancestors of the mammals alive today. 
Returning, now, to the biblical account of Creation, by the conclusion of the `fifth day,' God had said: `Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind,' and, in the `sixth day,' God said: `Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.' 
We have reached the `sixth day' in the biblical account. A day, in God's divine revelation to Moses, evidently meant a period of some undetermined length. In Psalm 90--a prayer of Moses--we are told: `Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. . . . For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.' 
Regardless of the length of the Creation `days', in the sixth, all preparations had been completed for the advent of man. `So God created man'--we are told--`in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.' 
On the seventh day, God rested from his work. Hence, both science and the Bible seem to agree, in broad terms, regarding the chronological order of the events of Creation. 
The modern explanation of evolution dates from 1859, when Charles Darwin published the `Origin of Species.' According to Darwin, members of each species compete with each other for a chance to live, as well as with members of different species. In this competition any helpful variation gives its owner an advantage over others in the species that are not so well adapted. Members with such variations, therefore, will win the struggle for existence. They will live and reproduce their kind, while forms not so well equipped will die. Darwin called this process natural selection; it is also referred to as `survival of the fittest.' 
According to a national poll that was published earlier this year, only 40% of the nation's scientists are said to believe in God. I was amazed that 60% of the scientists, according to the poll, share no belief in a Creator. Darwin, however, apparently did not share such disbelief. Some years ago, I read his `Origin of Species.' In this brilliant work of a great British naturalist, I came across this incisive question, posed by Darwin himself: `Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?' 
What a pertinent question? I think we human beings are prone to forget that the Creator, as Darwin observed, may work by intellectual powers unlike those of man. 
In comparing the eye of a human being to an optical instrument made by man, Darwin had this to say: `If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with fluid, and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further, we must suppose that there is a power, represented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way or in any degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be preserved until a better one is produced, and then the old ones to be all destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds'--this is the question that Darwin poses--`and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might best be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?' 
Thus, Darwin appears to acknowledge a Creator back of the Creation--a master mind back of the work. I suggest that the 60% of today's scientists today who, according to the poll, doubt the existence of a Creator, read what Darwin has to say in this regard, if they have not already done so, and if they have already done so, it may be valid for them to read Darwin's observation again. 
Darwin's work is sprinkled throughout with conjecture, assumptions, presumptions, and, in some cases, just plain guess work. For example: the reader often finds such words and phrases as: `Has probably played a more important part', `there can be little doubt', `we may infer', `seems probable,' `I have come to the conclusion,' `it cannot be doubted,' `I am fully convinced' --this is Darwin talking--`it must be assumed,' `seems to have been,' `appears to have played an important part in the origins of our breeds,' `seems to have been the predominant power,' `it is probable that they were once thus connected,' `thus it is, as I believe,' `bearing such facts in mind, it may be believed,' `we may conclude,' `seem to have been the chief agents in causing organs to become rudimentary,' `is probably often aided,' `is perhaps intelligible by the aid of the hypothesis of pangenesis, and apparently in no other way,' `it may be,' `every character, however slight, must be the result of some definite cause,' `one chief cause seems to be,' `some additional rudimentary structures might here have been adduced,' `we have only to suppose that a former progenitor possessed the parts in question in a perfect state,' `the more complex instincts seem to have originated independently of intelligence,' `appears to have been gained,' `such variations appear to arise from the same unknown causes,' `it is not improbable,' . . . and so on and so on. 
Darwin, posing the question, `whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe,' responds. Listen to his response to his own question: `And this has been answered in the affirmative by the highest intellects that have ever lived.' 
Twelve years after the publishing of the `Origin of Species,' Darwin published `The Descent of Man.' In his second book, Darwin applied his theory of evolution to the human race. In Chapter IV, Darwin makes an interesting admission. Here is what he said:  
I now admit . . . that in the earlier editions of my `Origin of Species,' I probably attributed too much to the action of natural selection or the survival of the fittest. I have altered the fifth edition of the Origin so as to confine my remarks to adaptive changes of structure. . . . I may be permitted to say as some excuse, that I had two distinct objects in view, firstly, to show that species had not been separately created, and secondly, that natural selection had been the chief agent of change, though largely aided by the inherited effects of habit, and slightly by the direct action of the surrounding conditions. . . . Hence, if I have erred in giving to natural selection great power, which I am far from admitting, or in having exaggerated its power, which is in itself probable, I have at least, as I hope, done good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate creations. 
Darwin was not alone in his effort. Since the earliest days of man's exploration of his universe, science and religion--when not simply ignoring each other--have often been at odds. Throughout the ages, it seems that the more man has learned about the physical nature of the universe and its creatures, the greater the gap between religion and science has become. 
To many in the scientific community, the world has largely become divided between that which can be scientifically and mathematically explained away, and that for which the mathematical equation or scientific basis has not yet been discovered. The Creator has had no role. He has been left out. The fabulously intricate pattern of occurrences, which had to exist in order to account for the strictly scientific view of the creation of the universe, has been viewed as merely chance--a lucky shot!--with no connection to any sort of greater intelligence. How absurd! 
Mr. President, I have in my pocket a gold watch and a golden chain. Watches are not in the habit of assembling themselves. There has to be a designer. There has to be a maker back of the watch, a creator back of the chain. There has to be a greater intelligence, a Creator. 
On the other side, to many of those in the religious community, too tightly held religious doctrine has precluded all possibilities suggested by scientific investigation of the physical world. 
Happily, however, scientists and men of the cloth both appear to be rejecting doctrinal absolutism and discovering some common ground. 
Recent articles in Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report, point to a change in attitude among scientists and theologians. Rather than opposing one another, the study of science and the practice of religion may at last be able to enhance one another. Science may be recognizing that rules, or tangible events, or even the laws of physics may not always be entirely explainable. As we search for scientific truth we may also provoke a faith that instills in the previously cynical, a wonder for the unexplainable and a tacit admission that there must be a higher power. 
In innumerable cases, science is apparently unearthing instances of perfection in the physical world which are so far beyond even the wildest imaginings of the human mind that chance could not account for them, and even nondevout scientists have tended to conclude that such minute miracles can only have been wrought by some form of divine design. 
Newsweek, in its edition of July 20, said, `Physicists have stumbled upon signs that the cosmos is custom-made for life and consciousness. It turns out that if the constants of nature--unchanging numbers like the strength of gravity, the charge of an electron and the mass of a proton--were even the tiniest bit different, then atoms would not hold together, stars would not burn, and life would never have made an appearance.' As Nobel-prize-winning Physicist and Christian Charles Townes put it, `somehow intelligence must have been involved in the laws of the universe.' And, consider the words of Physicist-turned-priest John Polkinghorne, who said that the most fundamental component in the belief in God `is that there is a mind and a purpose behind the Universe.' 
Similarly, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report relate the story of Allan Sandage, one of the world's most preeminent, respected, and accomplished astronomers, who spoke at a recent meeting of cosmologists gathered together to consider the theological implications of their work. Sandage, who reportedly admits to having been `almost a practicing atheist as a boy,' has come to the conclusion through his work that Creation can only be explained as a `miracle'. `It is my science that drove me to the conclusion that the world is much more complicated than can be explained by science. It is only through the supernatural that I can understand the mystery of existence.' 
I find it rather exhilarating that men like Sandage and Townes and Polkinghorne, who have devoted so much of their lives to questioning their universe in order to discover its secrets, have come to a conclusion that to me was answered long ago through simple, basic, unquestionable faith, and simple, common-sense reasoning. 
There are those who will only ever be comfortable with a world of rules and measurements, in which events are quantifiable and reliable, and a `miracle' is defined only as that which has not yet been thoroughly dissected and concretely explained. There are also those who will always reject scientific theory if it seems in any way to challenge their religious doctrine. 
But it seems to me that scientists such as Allan Sandage, who embrace both religion and science, can teach a valuable lesson to us all. A black-and-white science of stiff rules and blinders is fatally flawed. It is the scientist who looks to the heavens for divine intervention and is willing to admit that not all things are explainable, who has the greatest opportunity to achieve medical breakthroughs, uncover the mysteries of outer space and develop life-changing technologies. His is an intellect which is truly free, for he allows for all possibilities. 
The two great disciplines of the world, science and religion, represent the ceaseless human probing for answers to the mysteries of life. They are, at their cores, nothing more than man's quest for truth. 
As we search, may we never close our hearts to the abundant evidence of His love and his miracles all around us. 
Even in the midst of great sorrow and profound tragedy, He is there and His love will prevail and will triumph. So my heart goes out today to the families of the two brave men whose lives and dedication we honored today in this magnificent Capitol, itself a symbol of man's belief in things which cannot be seen. And I hope that these loved ones will remember the words of hope from the Scriptures and the words of William Jennings Bryan:  
If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold and pulseless heart of the buried acorn, to make it burst forth from its prison walls, again the mighty oak, will He leave neglected in the Earth the soul of man, created in his own image. 
If He stoops to give to the rosebush whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come? 
If matter, mute and inanimate, though changed by the forces of Nature into a multitude of forms, can never be destroyed, will the imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay? 
No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not a single atom in all His creation, has made provision for a future life in which man's universal longing for immortality will find its realization. I am as sure that we live again as I am sure that we live today. 
With those words of William Jennings Bryan, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, not too long ago, the Senate returned to work from celebrating the Fourth of July, Independence Day. By now, the flags that flew so gaily in front of our houses have long since been furled or folded, tucked away in dark closets until next year. The banners and bunting that adorned main streets throughout the country have been taken down, and the high school band's uniforms are again hanging in orderly rows to await September's football games. Our military veterans, cheered at Fourth of July parades as the legacy of those proud men who wrested our freedom from the hands of Redcoats, have again been put out of most people's minds until somber Veterans Day rolls around in November. But it is with the memory of Independence Day still fresh in my mind that I consider how well we as a nation treat the veterans who have protected our freedoms so well. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs does a pretty good job of taking care of individual veterans, despite the fact that funding for veterans programs has been declining in real dollars for many years. But, like most bureaucracies, the VA does not always move nimbly and with great precision to identify big trends as quickly as one might like. In large part, that may be because the VA must depend on the even larger and more cumbersome Department of Defense to provide it with the background information on what happened to our veterans while they were on active duty that may require the ministrations of the VA after a conflict. In the case of the Persian Gulf War, the Department of Defense did not, by its own admission, do a very aggressive job early on in trying to get to the bottom of what happened in the Gulf. As a result, we have been engaged in a long and circular debate regarding the large numbers of sick Persian Gulf War veterans, and the trail that will lead us to the answers to what really happened in that theater of operations is growing colder by the day. 
Mr. President, I have been working with the Committee on Veterans' Affairs on this issue, and I am pleased that Senator Rockefeller, Senator Specter, and I have been able to draft a bill that will bring to a close a part of the debate that has been eroding the confidence of our soldiers in their government's support for them, and eroding the confidence of our veterans that their nation cares for them. I thank my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, for his courtesy in working with me, and I thank Senator Specter also for his cooperation. The encouragement and support offered by the Chronic Illness Research Foundation and the veterans service organizations, particularly the American Legion, the National Gulf War Resources Center, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition, have also been critical to this joint effort. That debate is the now 7-year-old argument over what really happened to our soldiers, sailors, and airmen during the Operation Desert Storm to make so many of them sick. As of March 31, 1998, there were 112,123 active and former military personnel on the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs' Persian Gulf Registries. That is a lot of sick people, and I understand that new registrants continue to sign on at a rate of 80 to 90 each week. 
In the 7 years since the `hot' phase of that conflict ended, a fog of words has further 
obscured the fog of war that enveloped these military men and women in its fetid, inky grasp. Panel after panel has been convened, congressional committee after congressional committee has conducted hearings, report after report has been issued. Mountains of paper have been created. Yet, substantial, concrete action to end this debate has not been taken, though many recommendations have been issued. 
The President's own Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses warned in their October 1997 final report that the government's credibility was at stake and urged that a `permanent, statutory' program of benefits and health care for the sick Persian Gulf veterans be established. This bill that we have introduced today begins that important work. It ends the long argument about what happened in the Gulf and who might have been exposed to what, and focuses on the `now what?' phase. This bill establishes a mechanism for the National Academy of Sciences or some other comparable body to periodically review the scientific and medical literature to identify what specific illnesses or diseases might arise from exposure to all of those hazardous materials that were present in the Gulf or that can otherwise be associated with service in that theater of war. The experts provide the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with that list, and the Secretary reviews and establishes regulations to establish those illnesses and diseases as service connected for the purposes of providing medical care and other benefits to Gulf War veterans. The Secretary will also receive recommendations from the National Academy regarding further medical research needed to answer questions about illness and service in the Gulf. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is requested to outline a program of medical research based on those recommendations and other information that may warrant further research. 
In an effort to jump-start this review process, the bill contains a lengthy list of materials to which numerous government and expert scientific panels have suggested the Gulf veterans may have been exposed. This list was drawn from legislation, H.R. 4036, introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Christopher Shays and Representative Bernard Sanders of the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight after 2 years of hearings and review. Their tireless efforts have been invaluable. This bill asks the National Academy to begin its review with that list, and to report within 6 months on its findings. Our concern is to expedite this process with as much speed as is prudent, given the long wait that these veterans have already faced. 
Remember the chiaroscuro images of that conflict--the bright sand inked over with grimy, oily debris, the road dust sprayed down with oil, chemical alarms blaring, pesticides and insecticides liberally sprayed to keep disease-carrying insects at bay, and of men and women pumped full of last minute vaccines and ordered to take nerve agent pretreatment pills whenever the chemical alarms sounded. Top it all off with the image of man-made thunderclouds forming over the vast ammunition pit at Khamisiyah when U.S. troops destroyed tons of captured Iraqi shells, some unknown quantity of which was loaded with chemical mustard and nerve agents. It was a dirty, dirty war, concentrated over a fairly compact area filled with almost 700,000 U.S. troops. We can be fairly confident on the basis of many previous studies that all of these listed hazards and potential hazards were present in that theater of war, even though we will never be able to say 
which hazards each individual soldier, sailor, and airman was exposed to and at what dosage. But wounds created by chemicals maim just as readily, if not as visibly, as bullets. 
This situation, and this legislation addressing it, are similar to the way that the terrible legacy of Agent Orange from the Vietnam War was finally, agonizingly, resolved. In that case, finally, Congress simply declared that we know that these herbicides were present in country in enormous quantities, but we do not know, and likely never will know, precisely who may have been exposed to them and in what dosage. Therefore, we will simply acknowledge that if you were there during the time that Agent Orange and the other similar herbicides were being used, you may well have been exposed, and if you come down with a disease or illness which can be plausibly linked to that exposure, we will assume that you may have gotten it as a result of that exposure and act accordingly. 
It took a long time to get to that point, but it was the right thing to do, and it helped to restore the crisis in confidence that had shaken our servicemen and our veterans. The situation in the Gulf is hauntingly similar, a refrain from the same song. Almost 700,000 men and women were in the Gulf when the shooting started and operated in a fluid battlefield that included many potential hazards. Collection of data was not done or could not be done in a way that allows us to reconstruct every nuance of that situation 7 years later. Even veterans medical records are not as complete as we would now like them to be. So we find ourselves in a chicken soup of possibilities, debating endlessly about whether this pea or this carrot or this piece of meat was here or there in the soup at any point in time, when really all we know is that all the ingredients for a soup were in the pot. So, let us stop analyzing that broth at the expense of taking any further action and get on with turning it into a restorative and nourishing balm for our ailing veterans. This legislation does not presume exposure of every veteran to every possible hazard. Rather, it looks at these hazards and to the illnesses already being seen in the veteran population and determines what diseases and illnesses can be associated with that service or those hazards. If the veteran has that disease or illness, then it is presumed to have been as a result of his exposure to that hazard or hazards or to that service. 
Vietnam veterans had to wait almost 20 years before their medical crisis was resolved, and is still being resolved. We must show that we as a Government can learn from that experience and push forward so that the veterans from the Persian Gulf War do not have to wait so long. I think it is possible to learn from history, and recent history provides the freshest lessons. If we do not act decisively now, these newest veterans will be one more year closer to reaching that sorry halfway hurdle. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this bill with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998, to be considered by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs as it meets to address pending legislation. I hope that the Committee will receive it favorably, and that the Senate can move to address the needs of our nations newest conflict veterans and stem the crisis of confidence that the slow and often stumbling Government response to this health care dilemma has created in our servicemen and women, and in our veterans. 
Mr. President, the men and women who go into combat for the rest of us deserve our lasting gratitude. They also deserve to have their wounded compatriots properly and aggressively taken care of and that is what President Lincoln meant when he said, `To take care of him who has borne the battle, and his widow and children' which the Department of Veterans Affairs has adopted as its motto. When we fail to do this, we undermine that covenant, and we put cold and daunting doubt in the hearts of those who might otherwise consider volunteering for that hard duty. 
To those who are concerned, as I am, about readiness in our military, I say that this is the final element of all the recruiting, advertising, and patriotic appeals to join the military and serve the nation in uniform. This is the element that seals the deal--the commitment to care for our soldiers who are wounded in service. It must be there, and our men and women in uniform must be confident in its compassion and in its endurance, or no signing bonus will keep volunteers in the military. We took too long to follow through with our veterans from Vietnam, and we are in danger of making the same mistake with our veterans from the Persian Gulf:  
A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards. More than that no man is entitled to, and less than that no man shall have. 
So said President Theodore Roosevelt on another Independence Day 95 years ago, on July 4, 1903, following the Spanish-American War. I believe that this Congress wants to, and will, live up to that sentiment.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one week ago today, a small ceremony took place in the Pentagon at which the three senior leaders of the United States Army unveiled a series of posters depicting each of the seven core values of the Army. They are noteworthy values--Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless-Service, Honor, Integrity, Personal Courage. They send a strong message to the world about the values that shape America's fighting forces. 
Three days later, Defense Department officials sent a very different message from the Pentagon regarding core values when they took the wraps off a proposal that would relax the military code of honor concerning adultery. According to the news accounts I have read, Secretary Cohen is expected to propose within the next few weeks a new approach to dealing with cases of adultery in the military that would limit prosecutions--limit prosecutions--and ease automatic penalties. 
Mr. President, I respectfully ask, what on earth has gotten into the leadership of the Defense Department? 
Each of our services is founded on a set of bedrock principles. I have just recited the Army's. For the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, the core values are honor, courage, and commitment. The core values of the Air Force are integrity, service, and excellence. 
These values form the moral guideposts for the men and women of America's armed forces. 
Whether we are talking about the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines, we are talking about a group of exceptional individuals in whom we as a nation place extraordinary trust and from whom we exact exceptional standards of courage, leadership, and moral conduct. 
These standards, demanding though they are, have served our nation well for more than two hundred years. They are the virtues that undergirded the American Revolution and helped General George Washington's Army endure the bitter winter at Valley Forge. They are the principles that elevated the American Civil War from a duel between states to a crusade that cemented the unity of a nation. They are the values that guided our troops to victory over the most evil power of the twentieth century--the forces of Adolph Hitler--during World War II. 
Honor, Duty, Respect, Integrity, Courage and Commitment make up a noble list. This roster of virtues is one that our men and women in uniform have, from this nation's founding, embraced with pride. 
I admire the dedication of our military forces. I admire their willingness to hold themselves to a higher standard. I believe that the core values they embody are as important as all the skills and training and equipment this nation can marshal in making America's armed forces mighty and powerful, the best in the world. That has always been the way with American military forces. We saw in World War II the most powerful, the mightiest armed force in the world, the best armies that ever walked the earth. 
And so I ask again, what on earth has gotten into the leadership of the Department of Defense? 
Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the Marine Corps has responded to the call to lower the bar on adultery with the equivalent of Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe's response to the Germans' demand to surrender during the Battle of the Bulge. In a word, `Nuts!' 
And so I salute the Marine Corps for taking that stand. 
Let me just say that again. I think it needs to be said, and I hope that the Secretary of Defense will hear me. 
I am pleased to note that the Marine Corps has responded to the call to lower the bar on adultery with the equivalent of Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe's response to the Germans' demand to surrender during the Battle of the Bulge. In a word, `Nuts.' 
God bless the Marines. God bless the Marine Corps. And God bless that word `Nuts,' because that is the response of the Marine Corps. 
For a service whose motto, Semper Fidelis, means `Always Faithful,' the Marine Corps' unwillingness to compromise its core values is commendable. I salute the Marine Corps. I hope that the leadership of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will follow suit. At a time when the reputation and the morale of the military have taken a serious battering as a result of the conduct of some of its leaders, I am frankly amazed that the Secretary of Defense would even entertain such an ill-conceived proposal. 
The recent and highly publicized instances of adultery, sexual harassment, and rape within America's military have wounded the prestige of our armed services and have ruined individual lives, families, and careers. The uneven handling of several high profile cases--ranging from swift and harsh punishment meted out to enlisted personnel and junior officers to an apparent blind eye turned to the misconduct of certain high-ranking officers--has only exacerbated the problem and led to the perception of a double standard in the military. 
I sympathize with the many problems facing our military leadership in today's volatile international environment. Resources are scarce, forces are stretched thin, and tensions are mounting in potential trouble spots around the world. But leadership requires the ability to set a good example and stand by one's principles, regardless of how difficult that may be. The solution to the moral and ethical turmoil threatening to engulf today's U.S. military forces is not to lower the standards to the level of the least common denominator. The solution is to restore and to apply the discipline and unique military code of conduct equally and across the board. 
In this country, we have always looked up to the military for leadership and role models. What kind of a message does this proposal send to our young people, who are struggling to define their values in a society that increasingly seems to hold core values in contempt? How are parents supposed to explain this sea change in the military's moral code to their children? What is the Defense Department thinking? Why on earth is the Pentagon sending such mixed messages to the men and women in uniform? Even that nonsensical term `political correctness' does not require this. 
If the Secretary of Defense is willing to entertain a proposal that would essentially treat adultery--conduct that inherently involves dishonor, lying, and cheating--with a wink and a nod, what comes next? Will it be okay to cheat on an exam at the military academies if the instructor is too tough? Will `little white lies' be acceptable to get out of unpleasant duties? Will the occasional dereliction of duty be overlooked as long as no one gets hurt? Will the Marines be asked to change their motto from `Always Faithful' to `Usually Faithful' or `Sometimes Faithful'? If so asked, I have a feeling the Marines will say `nuts.' 
The core values of America's military services are not there for window dressing. Taken together, they form the basis of a sacred trust. It is a trust that must extend to placing one's life in the hands of one's comrades. It is a trust that goes up the chain of command and down the chain of command and across the chain of command. It is trust that is absolute--there can be no shades of gray on the battlefield. There can be no shades of gray at the helm of the ship in the storm. There can be no shades of gray in the cockpit. 
I hope that the Secretary of Defense will rethink this misguided proposal to weaken the rules governing adultery and fraternization in the military. The effect can only be to erode the time-honored military principles that have served our Nation throughout its history, in peacetime and in war. Our nation's military leadership, including the Secretary of Defense, who once served here as a very able Senator and respected colleague, must draw a line in the sand when it comes to the moral conduct of the armed services. The services must not be seduced into exchanging their code of conduct for a code of convenience. 
Again, I salute the Marines for their unwillingness to compromise their standards, and I call on Secretary Cohen to reject this and any other proposal that would compromise the integrity of this nation's military forces. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I again thank my friend from Minnesota, Senator Grams, for his kindness and courtesy.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my shock and utter amazement regarding the cover story in the June 15 issue of Time magazine. It is entitled `Everything your kids already know about sex.' 
Now, I know that any octogenarian like myself is going to be immediately viewed as a dinosaur and a prude on a subject such as this, but I tell you that this article should alarm every parent and shake up every community in America. 
The piece opens up with an account of a 14-year-old couple, who walk into a Teen Center in Salt Lake City, Utah (of all places) and inquire about steps which they might take to heighten their arousal during sex. This is a 14-year-old couple, I remind Senators. It continues with example after example of youngsters as young as 9 years of age who are experienced sexually, and who have had multiple sexual partners before ever reaching the legal age of consent. Here we are talking about youngsters as young as 9 years of age. Many of these sexually new-age babies (and that's what they are, babies) claim that they get all the information they need to be proficient in the sexual world through such prime time TV shows as `Dawson Creek,' which boasts of a character, Jen, who loses her virginity at 12, while drunk, or another favorite show, `Buffy the Vampire Slayer', in which Angel, a male vampire, `turned bad' after having sex with the 17-year-old Buffy. 
What, in the name of common sense, I ask, is going on in this Nation? Why are we letting our kids watch this morally degrading, thoroughly demeaning, junk on the airwaves? Why in heaven's name don't the purveyors of such trash feel any sense of responsibility toward the youth of our nation? 
Have the parents of these kids just given up trying to guide and protect them and teach them some sense of moral responsibility about their own bodies? I am afraid I have no answers, only legions of questions about what sort of a society is going to evolve from all of this unhealthy glorification of sex. 
I know this much. We have got to find a way to inject some measure of spirituality into our culture, some sort of reverence for something besides erotica, and we have got to find some kind of counterpoint to the cheap, amoral, directionless, thoroughly disgusting popular mores which are blasted daily at our kids over the airwaves. 
I believe one thing we could do in this Congress is to find an acceptable way to return prayer to our schools and to encourage religious values in the life of this nation. 
A lot of people who believe this have been driven into a closet. They won't say these things probably because they will be viewed as old fuddy-duddies and as being behind the times and old-fashioned and all that. I know of no other course which might provide a strong counterpoint to the hedonistic viewpoint which so dominates everyday American life. 
All of our poor children face the prospect of growing up, do they not, with no appreciation of anything but the seamy side of life and no understanding of the spiritual values that so enrich and refine human existence and have played such a vital and important and prominent part in the history of our country, history of our Nation since its beginning? 
Does no one worry about the steady diet of crass perversion we are feeding to our youngsters? Surely the American people expect us to address the moral bankruptcy that is eating away at common decency in this Nation. We have spent weeks publicly gnashing our teeth about our children's health. We hear these speeches all the time here about our children's health, and rightly so. Rightly so. And the evils of smoking, and again rightly so. We should. But what about their mental health? What about their spiritual health? I hear little said on these subjects. What about the sexually transmitted diseases which such casual sexual behavior fosters? I tell you, I am worried, and I believe we need to come to grips with the ugly reality of a society that is sliding further into decadence and decay right before our very eyes. 
On February 6, of last year, I introduced a constitutional amendment that could foster voluntary prayer in our schools and in public assemblies. I believe that it may do so without doing violence to the prerogatives of those who, as is their right, do not wish to pray. The amendment is simple, and I read it: `Nothing in this Constitution, or amendments thereto, shall be construed to prohibit or require voluntary prayer in public schools, or to prohibit or require voluntary prayer at public school extracurricular activities.' 
I hope that the Judiciary Committee of the Senate--and I urge the Judiciary Committee of the Senate--will at least hold hearings on this matter. I am sure they could find some time on the calendar to hold hearings on this important subject, if not this year, certainly next year. 
We have reached a point of crisis in our land, and to continue to ignore the mounting evidence is blatantly irresponsible on the part of those of us who claim to be leaders. 
I know that there are concerns about the first amendment, and I hesitate to offer an amendment that would, in effect, amend the first amendment in some respect, but I am worried a great deal more about the destruction of our Nation. As far as I am concerned, if something about the first amendment needed to be modified or changed to save this very Nation, then I am willing to at least discuss it and debate it and make a determination on whether we should. I do not view the first amendment as being absolutely sacrosanct. I am becoming very concerned about the trend that we see happening in this country and about the direction in which the Nation is going and in considerable measure because of some of the interpretations of the Constitution, some of the interpretations of the first amendment that we have seen emanating from our courts. 
I urge all Members of the Senate and all parents to read the Time magazine piece and wake up and smell the coffee. The alarm bells are ringing all over America, and we have got to come to grips with what is happening and try to answer the call. 
Now, I will not be around on this globe many more years perhaps, but I do have children and I have grandchildren. Incidentally, I have a grandson who acquired his Ph.D. in physics yesterday at the University of Virginia. And he has a brother just 3 years older than himself who secured his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Virginia 3 years ago. So these are outstanding examples of the fine young people we have in this country, wholesome young people. They are not all bad, by any means. Most of them are not. But we do not often enough hear about the good things our young people are doing. They are in the laboratories. They are in the libraries. They are studying, trying to get ahead, and we are not as aware of what they are doing as we are of those who make mistakes, and we all make mistakes, but of those who perhaps are not doing as well. 
I am concerned about the future of the Nation. I am concerned for my own posterity's sake, as I say. I do not have the answers. A blind man can see that something bad is happening to our society. One does not have to travel far to find out what is causing a large part of it. One has only to go to the living room and turn on that tube and watch for a day the junk that has been programmed. They will see from what source many of our problems are emanating.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the continued problem of trade-distorting subsidies given by the Korean Government to its domestic steel industry. Unfair trade practices by the Korean Government are causing the U.S. steel industry--including one of West Virginia's largest employers, Weirton Steel Corporation--to lose millions of dollars. These losses impact U.S. communities, which must carry the burden of Korea's unfair practices by contending with a lower tax and job base. 
I joined my colleagues in the Senate Steel Caucus in signing letters to U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky and U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary William Daley regarding violations by the South Korean Government of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Subsidy Code. Regrettably, the responses to those letters were not satisfactory. 
My amendment would simply require the United States Trade Representative to report on Korean steel subsidies. Accurate information on unfair trade practices is vital to the future of the U.S. steel industry and its workers. This amendment would send the Korean Government a clear message that we expect our trading partners to adhere to fair trading practices, but, more importantly, it would send a message to American workers that this Congress is prepared to defend our own commercial interests and take action against the Korean Government's infringement upon U.S. rights under the WTO agreement. 
U.S. imports of steel from South Korea have increased by nearly forty-five percent during the first four months of 1998. These surging Korean steel imports are possible due to the Korean government's continued use of illegal subsidies--subsidies that unfairly disadvantage the U.S. steel industry. The negative impact of these Korean subsidies cannot be ignored. Illegal foreign steel sales are severely undermining the economic stability in regions throughout our country that rely upon steel for jobs--literally taking money out of the pockets of these workers as well as their neighbors, who depend upon this industry for their livelihood. 
For the U.S. steelworkers in the Upper Ohio Valley and throughout our nation, we must continue to pursue efforts to end the entry of foreign products into this country that unfairly place our domestic industries at risk. We must restore confidence in our trade laws. 
I appreciate Members' support of this initiative.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to applaud the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, and the subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, for their work on the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. They have crafted a good piece of legislation that will help to meet a variety of needs across the country. 
One of the important and pressing issues addressed in this legislation is school safety. During the past several months, we have seen several tragic incidents of school violence. These acts are not limited to specific geographic regions or family backgrounds, nor do they have a single catalyst. Those who have committed such cowardly acts have done so for different reasons, at different times, in different schools. But these acts of school violence have at least one thing in common--they have spurred all of us to take a closer look at what can be done to better protect our children at school. 
In this Commerce-Justice-State legislation, the Senate offers one new tool in that effort. We have earmarked $210 million in the bill for a new national safe schools initiative geared to assist community-level efforts. 
Parents should not have to worry, when they put their children on the bus to school in the morning, that those children will not return home safely in the afternoon. In an effort to provide local school districts with more resources to reduce the levels of violence in our classrooms, I supported this initiative to strengthen local violence prevention and technology efforts. 
Within the $210 million, $25 million will assist communities in developing and implementing local school safety approaches. Another $10 million is for the National Institute of Justice to develop new, more effective safety technologies and communications systems that can provide communities with quick access to the information they need to identify potentially violent youths. 
Perhaps most important is the $175 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services Program to increase community policing in and around schools. This would be an extension of the COPS program which has been widely hailed as a successful deterrent to crime. In West Virginia, some school districts already partner with the local police department to have what they call `police resource officers' in the schools. Officers and educators alike believe that having a familiar police presence in the hallways and a cruiser in the parking lot helps to reduce violence at school. 
Ensuring that our classrooms are safe demands that we do everything possible to find safe places for our children to learn and play and grow. While there is no single answer or solution to this pressing problem, the funding in this bill is an important step toward that common goal. 
Mr. President, also in this legislation is an amendment I added on behalf of the thousands of families in West Virginia's Upper Ohio Valley and throughout the country who rely on the steel industry for their livelihoods. These are the people who work in the shops and in the mills, and who pay the taxes, and whose sweat keeps America running. My amendment calls for a report by the United States Trade Representative on trade subsidies provided by the South Korean government to its domestic steel industry. Illegal foreign steel subsidies are severely undermining the economic stability in regions throughout our country--literally taking money out of the pockets of American families and putting it into the accounts of foreign governments. 
The American steel industry for too long has been forced to compete in an international marketplace that was unbalanced by foreign subsidies, especially those of the South Korean government. By offering this amendment, I want to send a clear message: the United States will not allow foreign governments to undercut fair trading practices. This Congress is prepared to defend our country's commercial interests and take action when those interests are threatened. 
West Virginia companies, like Weirton Steel, should not be expected to compete in a marketplace that places unfair obstacles in their paths. When foreign governments subsidize industries, they tip the playing field, change the rules, and make it unfair. Those overseas subsidies directly impact the jobs and livelihoods of working men and women and their families here at home, as we have seen in Weirton.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I would also note that the Committee Report expects the EPA to submit a report to the Committee by December 31, 1998, with a follow-up analysis by the General Accounting Office ninety days later. As the Senator may know, Senator Craig and I submitted language to the Interior Appropriations bill directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to submit a similar report, but this report is to be submitted in conjunction with DOE's Fiscal Year 2000 budget submission. Given the short period between the likely enactment of this Act and the December 31 deadline, would the Senator agree that it might be more reasonable for the EPA to also submit its report along with its Fiscal Year 2000 budget submission?

Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. The EPA should provide a more detailed plan for better evaluating its programs, but I believe this is a more appropriate date to require such a report. It would not be wise to arbitrarily cap funding for vital energy and environment programs that encourage domestic energy efficiency, decrease costs, and promote domestic energy security. These programs should be evaluated on their own merits. The Federal Government serves a vital catalytic role in supporting and developing cutting edge research programs that the private sector can then take into the marketplace. The true benefits of these technologies and programs may not be evident for a number of years. Through these efforts, the United States has a tremendous opportunity to profit from new technologies, both at home and abroad, while at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today marks the 211th anniversary of one of the more momentous, but little-understood, perhaps, events in our country's history. I will just take a few minutes to remind ourselves of that event and to consider just how the course of this Nation's history might have been forever altered if not for what transpired on July 16, 1787. 
It should be of special significance to Members of this body, because it was, fortunately for us, that those who attended the Philadelphia Convention were some of the ablest, brightest figures of the time; in fact, of any time. 
Ah, Mr. President, to have been a fly on the wall at that gathering! Truly, this was a gathering graced by an accumulation--nay, an abundance--of wisdom, learning, grace, and dignity of a like not seen since the conclaves at Mt. Olympus! From Virginia alone, there were Washington, James Madison, George Mason, and Edmund Randolph; from Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry and Rufus King; from Pennsylvania, James Wilson, Gouverneur Morris and Benjamin Franklin; and from New York, Hamilton. Here was a constitutional dream team for the ages! And what a starting five! What foe could resist a lineup featuring Wilson's full-court vision, Madison's patience and tactical prowess, Hamilton's aggressive offense, Franklin's experience, and George Washington's dominating presence in the center, as the one who presided over the gathering. 
These five were just the tip of the iceberg. Fifty-five men in all presented themselves at the Convention, representing every State, save one--Rhode Island. And with passion and gusto they soon set about devising a plan to guide the country past the shoals and rocks and storms that beset it and into a new sea of tranquility and prosperity. 
Nowadays, many of us overlook the tremendous physical and mental effort that were expended in drafting the Constitution. In reading this short document--here it is, I hold it in my hand--in reading this short document, with its precise and careful phrases, it is easy to forget the toil, the sweat, the frustration, the shouting, the argumentation, the thinking, speechifying, and the pleading that went into its creation during that hot Philadelphia summer. For progress was unavoidably slow, and the greatest sticking point--`the most threatening that was encountered in framing the Constitution,' according to Madison--was the question of whether States should be represented in Congress equally or on the basis of population. 
This question was far from academic, of course. In order to create a Constitution acceptable to the States, the delegates needed to assuage the fears of the small States that they would be swallowed up in a more centralized union. The smaller States looked to Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, with fear and with distrust. The small States feared that a Congress based on population would soon fall under the sway of the large States. New Jersey's delegates declared that it would not be `safe'--the word is theirs, not mine--they would not be safe to allow Virginia 16 times as many votes as Delaware. They rejected the Virginia Plan, which was presented by Governor Edmund Randolph, with its legislature of two houses, and instead proposed a Congress with a single legislative chamber in which the States had an equal vote. 
The Continental Congress, of course, had been a single Chamber, a unilateral legislative branch. It was followed by the Congress, under the Articles of Confederation, again, one body. It was legislative, executive and, to some considerable part, judicial all in one. There was no Chief Executive in the form of an individual. It was the Congress under the Confederation. 
Days, and then weeks, of prolonged and acrimonious debate failed to resolve the issue. Some suggested redrawing State boundaries so that all the States would be of roughly equal size. The Convention considered, and then failed to agree upon, equal representation of States in the lower House of Congress. Several times, Connecticut advanced a proposal, initially made by Roger Sherman, calling for equal representation of States in the Senate. This, too, failed to win support. Madison--James Madison--labeled it unjust. Massachusetts' Rufus King angrily announced that he would not, could not, listen to any talk of equal representation in the Senate. James Wilson declaimed that the small States had nothing to fear from their larger brethren in the large States. To this, Delaware's Gunning Bedford retorted, `I do not, gentlemen, trust you!' and warned his colleagues that the small States might themselves confederate or even find `some foreign ally of more honor and good faith who will take them by the hand and do them justice.' Bedford was roundly rebuked for his words, but the threat of foreign alliances lingered in the stale and sticky summer air. 
There was no air-conditioning, much like it was in this Chamber up until 1929, when air-conditioning first came to this Chamber. 
Efforts to resolve this question `nearly terminated in a dissolution of the Convention'--it came that close; the effort to resolve this question--according to Luther Martin of Maryland, whose own impulsiveness and heated language did little to calm matters. Washington, that charismatic sphinx who presided over the Convention but kept his thoughts mostly to himself, confided to Hamilton in July that he `almost despaired' of success. And Sherman of Connecticut lamented that `[i]t seems,' he said, `we have got to a point that we cannot move one way or another.' 
On Monday, July 16--Monday, July 16--some 2 months after the Convention began--the question was finally resolved. Perhaps it was fear of failure that led the delegates to settle, for they knew that the country's future was in their hands--their hands. Perhaps it was exhaustion, for they had already spent many long days and weeks in earnest debate. It may have been because of the heat that had tormented them for so long. Maybe that finally broke that day. Or perhaps the open exchange of opinions, that wrenching but vital process of questioning, debating, and argumentation--that process had successfully whittled away extraneous detail and opinion to arrive at an essential verity. Franklin had described the Convention as `groping . . . in the dark to find political truth'; perhaps they had at last stumbled upon it. In any event, this day, 211 years ago, the delegates agreed that Congress would be composed of a Senate with equal representation for each State and a House based on proportional representation. This was the Great Compromise, as it was, and has ever since been, called. 
Perhaps, Mr. President, we would do best to avert our mind's eye from the horrors that might have befallen this country had the framers not struck the Great Compromise. Perhaps we would be better off simply to thank them, and to also thank Providence, for the miraculous document--the miraculous document; there it is in my hand--the miraculous document that is our Federal Constitution. Perhaps . . . but one thing is clear; without the Great Compromise, the Senate as we know it would not exist. 
Without that compromise, without that Great Compromise, the Constitution might not even exist; the Senate, as we know it, you can be sure, would not exist. For this body was conceived that day, 211 years ago today, in Philadelphia when the framers agreed to an upper House of Congress in which each State--each State--had an equal number of votes, each State had equal representation. This is the forum that was born on that day. This is the body--the unique; the body sui generis--that was born on that day, the Senate of the United States. 
But for the Great Compromise, the Senate--that beloved institution to which so many of us have dedicated our lives, our hopes, our reputations, our strength, our talents, our visions--might never have seen the light of day, let alone played an often pivotal and dramatic role in our national history over the course of more than two centuries. 
Mr. President, we would all do well to recall from time to time that the chamber in which we sit owes its existence to a remarkable instance of compromise and conciliation. 
Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia might never have met, might never have known one another, might never have had an opportunity to work together in the interests of our respective constituencies, in the interests of this great Republic. 
When next we in the Senate are unable to reach agreement--when we find ourselves plagued by seemingly insurmountable obstacles--when we become frustrated at the obduracy and narrow-mindedness of our opponents--perhaps then, we should remember that minds far more intelligent, 
visions far more far seeing, persons far more learned--Ah, that learned group of men, they knew about the classics. They knew about Rome and Athens, Persia, Polybius, Plutarch. They knew about Montesquieu. They knew about the colonial experience, the history of England, the history of the ancient Romans. 
They were able to find common ground on a matter of far greater import and controversy than much of what we discuss here today. And we should then think to ourselves that just maybe we, too, can find some compromise, some meeting of the minds such as our framers found on that day so long ago in Philadelphia. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we might pause tomorrow, July 17, to remember that it was on July 17, 1789, 2 years later, that the Senate of the United States passed the Judiciary Act. The Senate was not expected to originate legislation. That didn't mean it could not, but it was anticipated that the House would originate about all the legislation and the Senate would tamper with it, improve it, refine it, and so on. 
But in the U.S. Senate, on July 17, 1789, history will always mark the passage of the Judiciary Act, which created the judicial system. Oliver Ellsworth was a key player in that matter. He later became Chief Justice of the United States. But he was never as a justice what he was as a legislator. Oliver Ellsworth. It all causes one to marvel at how that first Senate came to grips with these problems and legislated for the first time on so many of these things. And it was in that first Congress that the two Houses learned to work together and have conferences on bills, where they resolved the differences between the two Houses. 
Our forebears were remarkable men. That 
was a remarkable time in history. I will never fail to believe that Providence had its hand in the destiny of this country when those marvelous things happened in Philadelphia. When one pauses to think about it, the real miracle--and there were many miracles that happened there--was when men of different minds and different experiences, different temperaments, viewpoints, and attitudes, were able to mold their opinions and give and take, compromise, and come to a conclusion. That was a miracle in many ways. 
It seems to me that the greatest miracle of all was the convergence of circumstances and people that took place with the Convention. Perhaps 5 years earlier it would not have happened, because the country had not yet fully experienced all of the weaknesses and shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation. A consensus had not yet formed as to the necessity for a new Constitution. Its experiences under the Articles taught it many things to avoid in this new Constitution. And it was fortunate that the Convention was not delayed until 5 years later, as we consider the events that occurred in France with the French Revolution and all of the horrors that took place there with the execution of King Louis XVI. 
The fruit ripened just at the right time. That, to me, showed the hand of Providence, and that was somewhat of a miracle in itself. 
I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. The $57.2 billion in new budget authority that this bill proposes will benefit millions of Americans, both urban and rural. In addition to funding food and nutrition programs such as Food Stamps, WIC, and the school lunch program, the bill funds almost $1.7 billion worth of badly needed agricultural research and extension programs to improve the productivity of our farmers as well as the nutritional value of our food supply. It allocates $1 billion for farm assistance programs such as farm ownership and operating loans. It helps restore and protect our farmlands and watersheds by designating $792 million for conservation programs. It ensures the safety of our nation's food and medicine by allocating $952 million to the Food and Drug Administration. Finally, by providing $2.1 billion for rural development programs, the bill addresses one of my long-standing priorities--implementing and maintaining basic community infrastructure. This bill will bring water and sewer systems to 840 small rural communities. It will allow almost 62,000 of rural America's working families to purchase homes, and, by providing funding for the construction or rehabilitation of 6,900 rental units, this budget addresses the desperate need for affordable housing in America's heartland. 
For my own state of West Virginia, this bill provides an increase of $1,250,000 for research on Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture at Leetown, West Virginia which includes $1,000,000 to initiate trout genome research. The bill also provides an increase of $300,000 for the Appalachian Fruit Research Station at Kearneysville, West Virginia to improve profitability of this important part of the West Virginia farm sector. 
In addition to these and other research programs important to my state, this bill also includes a number of important conservation measures. Among these include assistance for the Knapps Creek watershed project, flood control in the Tygart River and Upper Tygart Valley watershed, continuation of the important Potomac Headwaters project, funding the grazing lands initiative in West Virginia, and many other programs important for West Virginia farmers, rural communities, and protection of our environment. 
The chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee, Senators Cochran and Bumpers, are very knowledgeable of the many competing interests that require funding in this bill. They are to be commended for their ability to craft a bill that meaningfully addresses the challenges confronting our farmers, rural communities, and the Food and Drug Administration, given the budgetary constraints within which they had to work. I applaud their efforts and that of their staff: Galen Fountain and Carole Geagley for the minority and Rebecca Davies, Martha Poindexter, and Rachelle Graves for majority.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, although I have great respect for the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and I recognize that he is one of the Senate's foremost experts on matters that affect the Nation's farmers, I nevertheless strongly oppose the pending amendment. The amendment merely expresses the `Sense of the Senate,' and in so doing would not, if adopted, result in any legislative action in any of the areas addressed by the amendment. Nevertheless, in my years of service in this body, I cannot recall having seen an amendment that attempted to address so many diverse issues at one time. It amounts to a virtual smorgasbord, a Dagwood sandwich, a grab bag, a hodgepodge designed to enable one to issue a zillion press releases rolled into one. It is intended to be all things to all people. It is analogous to wearing a pinstripe suit, a plaid tie, paisley trousers, and a polka-dotted shirt at the same time. 
The amendment raises ten very important matters and expresses the Sense of the Senate that each of these ten matters should be enacted or undertaken by the President and Congress in short order. I will not take the time of the Senate to address in detail each of the areas contained in the amendment. But, for the interest of the viewers who may be following this debate, it urges the President and Congress to pass fast track trading authority--which authority, in my view, would grossly undermine the constitutional prerogatives of the Legislative Branch to oversee trade agreements; it states that Congress should pass and the President sign S. 2178, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act; it calls for full funding of the International Monetary Fund--some $18 billion--over which there is substantial controversy at this time as to how much funding should be given to IMF and what reforms should be undertaken by that organization in order to be able to access any appropriations that may be provided to them; it states that Congress should pass and the President should sign sanctions reform legislation so that the agricultural economy is not harmed by sanctioned foreign trade; it urges Congress to uphold the Presidential waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act relating to normalizing trade relation status to China; it calls on the House and Senate to pursue a package of capital gains and estate tax reforms; it calls on the President to pursue stronger oversight on all international trade agreements affecting agriculture; it then shifts to the question of providing full deductibility of health care insurance for self-employed individuals--urging the President to sign such legislation; it then calls on Congress and the Administration to pursue efforts to reduce regulations on farmers--never mind what regulations, it just says to reduce regulations on farmers; and finally the tenth matter in the amendment calls on the President to use administrative tools available to him to use Commodity Credit Corporation and unused Export Enhancement funds for humanitarian assistance. 
Mr. President, this is an amendment which is ill-conceived and should not be attached to this Agriculture Appropriation Bill. It is a very far-reaching resolution, basically outlining an ambitious agenda for the Senate on a number of very contentious issues. I do not want to prematurely endorse action on all the items on this list, particularly before I have had a chance to study the actual language on which he proposes we act. I remind my colleagues of the old adage, `Act in haste, repent at leisure.' Each of these matters in the amendment is very important and deserves extensive consideration and debate by the Senate. We should not attempt to address them in this manner at this time. 
I urge Senators to oppose this amendment. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate voted on a motion made by Senator Daschle, the distinguished Minority Leader, which would have waived the Budget Act with respect to a point of order raised against his tobacco amendment to S. 2159, the Department of Agriculture appropriations bill. 
I voted against the Daschle motion because I believe that, after having debated tobacco legislation for nearly four weeks, the time has come for the Senate to move forward on the pending appropriations bills. Although I appreciate the Minority Leader's heartfelt desire to see a tobacco bill enacted during this Congress, I also appreciate the fact that that goal is not likely to be met in the few remaining days before adjournment. Thus, prolonging this issue is not, in my opinion, in the Senate's best interest. 
Mr. President, while I could not support the Minority Leader's motion to waive the Budget Act in this particular case, I will not, of course, rule out supporting such a motion in the future. Should we, as the minority Members of this body, continue to be effectively precluded from offering amendments, I would then be willing to join my colleagues in seeking to have those amendments debated on any available legislative vehicle.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, much has been said about the so-called `lost art' of writing. The ubiquity of telephones and, more recently, electronic mail, or `cyber-chat,' as well as the acceptability of alternative presentations in lieu of written essays in schools, can all be cited as contributors to the growing inability of many people to compose and edit well-organized and effective written documents. E-mail, which is daily becoming more and more common, a common method for communicating, is an easy, instant way to get a message out, but the very quickness of the transmit inhibits the kind of thoughtful consideration of the message and care in editing that are the hallmarks of good letters and great literature. 
Someone has said that letters are our personal ambassadors. We politicians need to be very much aware of that. Letters are our personal ambassadors. And the trend toward relying more and more exclusively on e-mail means that the future's historical archives will become littered with broken sentence fragments, incomplete thoughts, and embarrassingly ignorant spelling. Think about it. Mr. President, can you imagine the Federalist essays by Jay, Madison, and Hamilton--can you imagine those Federalist essays, had they been typed in such a stream-of-consciousness manner and then spewed across the fiber optic web the way some messages are nowadays? 
I am sure that Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, the authors of the Federalist Papers, did not speak as cogently and fluidly as they wrote. Perhaps nobody does, or very few persons do. But they were no slouches at the speaker's rostrum. I doubt that they would have been very good on television. I have thought about that a good many times, and wondered how Daniel Webster or Henry Clay or John C. Calhoun would have come across on television. How would they do on 20-second sound bites? They would do as poorly as Robert C. Byrd, I would anticipate. 
As Francis Bacon observed, `Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.' Think about that also. That is very true. `Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.' And so we write more exactly than we speak. 
These Founding Fathers were certainly well read and they were good writers and, therefore, very knowledgeable and exact, precise, weighing every word. 
When we speak of infrastructure, such as reservoirs and dams, we talk about the Army engineers. When we seek their recommendations about a particular dam or reservoir, they will give us advice, and it will reflect the B-C ratio, the benefit-cost ratio. Anything that is recommended by the Army engineers would have to have at least $1 in benefits for every $1 in costs. That is the benefit-cost ratio. 
Therefore, in speaking of the Founding Fathers, which is a term that needs to be examined--`Founding Fathers'--and especially those who wrote the Federalist essays, I think in terms of the benefit-cost ratio. They made every word count. Every word carried its full weight. It had a proper place in the construction of the essay. It wasn't used lightly. It was used thoughtfully. So there was the B-C ratio. 
Well, that is just a little idea of mine. But these men were knowledgeable, they were exact, and their writing was enhanced by their thoughtfulness, and, in turn, their speaking ability was enhanced by their writing, especially in the case of Daniel Webster. 
When Webster made a speech, when he spoke on January 26 and January 27, 1830, in his debate with Hayne--schoolboys all across the Nation, it used to be, were required to memorize some of Webster's speeches. I don't guess they are required to memorize those speeches anymore. As a matter of fact, memorization is not looked upon as being very beneficial or helpful in some schools, I suppose. Times have changed. 
But Webster was a good writer, and he memorized the speeches, many of them. Then he took them home, took them to his boarding house near the Capitol Building, and kept them for a few days, edited them, changed them, for the purposes of publication. Therefore, they were not exactly the speeches that we schoolboys memorized, they were not the exact speeches that Webster gave before the Senate. They were improved upon, just as we edit our own speeches. But we don't take them home. We don't take them to our boarding houses and keep them out several days. We edit them the same day. Many Senators probably have their staffs edit their remarks. But Webster, in doing so, had in mind exactly what Bacon referred to: `Writing maketh an exact man.' 
I said that the term `Founding Fathers' needed a little examination. Who were the Founding Fathers? Were they the signers of the Declaration of Independence? Were they the Framers of the Constitution? Were they the Framers of the first American Constitution, the Constitution under the Articles of Confederation? Were they the signers of the second Constitution, the Constitution of 1787? 
In those days, women did not participate in the conventions--but would the Founding Fathers also not include those individuals who met in the various State conventions to ratify the Constitution? Would they not include the writers of the Declaration of Independence? Would they not include the Members of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation? They surely debated much that went into the second Constitution. Would they not include the legislatures of the States that then existed? 
So when we talk about the Founding Fathers, many people associate that term only with the framers of the second American Constitution. And certainly the framers were Founding Fathers, but not all the Founding Fathers, I am saying, not all 
the Founding Fathers were framers of the Constitution. So there is a little difference. It isn't a serious matter by any means, and I am not taking issue with anyone, but I have thought about that term. 
It is hard to imagine that their spoken words could possibly be undercut by any of the all too common fillers that plague common conversation today, those `ums' and `uhs' and `likes,' and especially that inanity of inanities, `you know.' That is the most useless phrase. That is pure deadwood. It doesn't carry its weight in a speech, `you know.' 
Any time one turns on a television--which I don't do very often; perhaps that is why I have a lot of old ideas--he will hear a string of `you knows' from the anchormen and women, `you know.' 
What does it mean, `you know'? What do I know? You know? That is taking advantage of the other person when you say, `You know.' `You know.' How silly, how useless a phrase. That certainly would not carry its weight under the B-C ratio--the benefit-cost ratio--that inanity of inanities; that inanity of inanities, `you know.' 
Oh, how I hate that pernicious phrase, `you know.' This is simply a filler. The tongue is operating in overdrive and the brain is somewhat behind the tongue, `you know.' 
We are told by Plutarch that--well, I am providing a rather good example of what Plutarch was saying. He said that Alcibiades was the greatest orator of his time. 
Plutarch wrote that Demosthenes said that Alcibiades was the greatest speaker of his time and that when he came to a place in his oration and was having difficulty remembering the exact word, he paused--he paused--he simply paused until the right word came. He did not fill the gap with `you knows' or `ahs,' `uhs,' or `ums,' and so on. He simply waited until the right word came. 
Try it sometime. Record your own remarks. See if you are using that phrase. Our remarks are awash in `you knows.' And they are uttered all around us by people who are unaware of how they are filling the time between words when the mind is still struggling to complete the thought. They are filling the time with that inanity of inanities--`you know.' 
Speaking now as a listener, I contend there is almost nothing more irritating and distracting than suffering through countless `you knows' while trying desperately to discern what message the speaker is attempting--vainly--to convey. 
If I were teaching a class, that would be one of the things I would come down very hard on. I know that most people have no idea that their speech is packed chock-full of `you knows,' and it just becomes a habit. And if one listens to it very much, he will fall victim to the same bad habit. For the first thing he knows, he will find that his remarks are being filled with `you knows.' And these are sometimes strung together in staccato multiples: `you know, you know, you know?' It is simply filler--meaningless--sound to fill dead air while the speaker's unprepared brain hunts down the sentence's conclusion. 
Perhaps it is because Americans are such creatures of the television age, used to actors, or those who think they are actors, news broadcasters, even politicians, reading seamlessly from scripts, cue cards, and teleprompters. We are not used to hearing pauses of any length so we unconsciously try not to allow even a few seconds of quietude to fill the air. 
We have become unused to true public speaking and debate in which informed individuals prepared their minds with facts and arguments, listened to each other, and retorted and rebutted extemporaneously. Such debate demands close attention and even, shockingly, moments of silent, deliberate thought while a rejoinder is mentally composed. 
I never hear the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, using that phrase. I have noticed that he pauses from time to time, but he does not use the phrase `you know.' I think of him as a fine example of a teacher at whose feet I would be honored to sit. 
These small pauses, like the quick closing and opening of the stage curtains between acts, allow the speaker to savor the argument he has laid out, while his opponent prepares a clever and pointed rebuttal. Few can do that anymore, even those so-called professional debaters--the talking heads of media and politicians. If the response is quick, it is quite likely to be a prepared, canned, one-liner sound bite which sells the sender's message regardless of whether or not it is completely pertinent. 
It is possible to expunge `you knows' from public discourse. I have seen it done by conscientious individuals, as I indicated a little earlier, but it is no easy task. Like poison ivy, `you knows' are pernicious and persistent. It takes strong medicine to kill back that lush growth, and diligent weeding to keep opportunistic tendrils from creeping back into common use. To rid one's speech of `you know,' one must first learn to listen to himself or to herself. One must learn to train himself to recognize that he uses `you know' or other distracting filler words. As a test, ask someone to tape you or to count the `you knows.' 
Various members of my staff, as and when and if they hear another staff person saying `you know,' they point their finger immediately at that person. And in that way they help to break the habit. I think many people will be unpleasantly surprised at the results of such a test. 
Then enlist these same friends to alert you when an unconscious `you know' pops out. They will enjoy that part of the task. And then work at it, work at it, work at it. The more you do, the more you will notice just how often you use such needless and asinine fill-ins. Weed them out of your speech, and you will increase your reputation as a good speaker and a thoughtful person. There is a common saying to the effect that `I would rather be silent and be thought a fool, than to open my mouth and prove it.' Speech peppered with `you knows' has much the same effect. 
As I have observed already, Alcybides was noted for his practice of simply pausing silently when the chosen word momentarily escaped his mind's ability to marshal and bring it safely to his lips. Then, when he could continue, he simply resumed speaking. And he was the finest orator of his time. Clearly, a moment of silence is preferable to `you know.' Think of it: `Four score and, like, seven years ago, you know, our Forefathers, uh, brought forth, you know, upon this continent, you know, a new nation, you know, conceived in, uh, liberty, and, you know, you know, dedicated to the proposition that, uh, uh, like, all men are created, like, equal.' With that kind of delivery, President Abraham Lincoln could not have stoked the nation's determination to see the Civil War through to its conclusion. Or let's imagine Martin Luther King: `I, uh, have a dream, you know.' Not a very stirring message when it is lost in the verbal litter. 
Ridding your speech of such verbal trash may not make an individual a leader of nations or of men--that requires great thoughts as well as a clear and stirring delivery--but leaving them in can surely blight the path to greatness, you know. 
Mr. President, I have some remarks on another matter, but I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, my friend, my true friend, Senator Kennedy is on the floor. I am going to ask if he wishes to speak at this time?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy. As I have remarked before, and I shall say again, he is one who would have appropriately graced a seat at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. I can see him working in that audience on the floor and off the floor, arguing forcefully and passionately, and advocating his position on a matter and doing it well. 
So I will proceed. I will try to be brief, more so this time than other occasions.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have recently drawn much attention to the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, released in February of this year. My visceral, my visceral reaction to the poor scores of high school seniors on the mathematics and science portions of this exam was one of great dismay and disbelief. How could United States students be performing so poorly given the massive amounts of money invested each year in our nation's education system? 
My spirits have since been lifted in the past month when hearing about the progress that my own home state of West Virginia is making on the education front. In my years as a United States Senator, my state has been scoffed at more times than I can remember, or want to remember. Well, today, I come to the floor to boast a little bit about what we are accomplishing back in the mountains and foothills of West Virginia. 
For the second time in a row, West Virginia has posted the highest education marks of any state in the `Quality Counts' report released annually by Education Week magazine. West Virginia has tied only with Connecticut for top honors in the study, which grades states on standards and assessments, quality of teaching, school climate, and adequacy, equity, and allocation of resources. In achievement, no grades were granted but states were ranked by the percentage of students who scored at or above the proficient level in mathematics and science on the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Seven states, including West Virginia, made significant gains in the percentage of fourth graders who scored at the proficient level or above on the 1996 mathematics test. What is even more striking about these scores is the fact that West Virginia ranks forty-ninth in per capita income and family income, an economic statistic which is often correlated with lower student achievement. 
Earlier this year, West Virginia was recognized as a national model in geography education by the National Geographic Society. National Geographic Chairman Gilbert Grosvenor commended the state as `one of the best examples in the country of putting essential geography into a statewide system.' The Fordham Foundation, a private organization committed to quality-based reform of elementary and secondary education, conducted a recent study evaluating different geography standards used by states in setting their academic curricula. West Virginia was one of only six states that received honor grades for adopting excellent standards for geography that are clear, specific, comprehensive, and rigorous. 
Good students and teachers are an integral component of getting ahead in education. 
West Virginia could not have made the progress in education that it has made in the past few years without solid homes, ambitious students, and good teachers. The whole process depends, in great measure, on quality teachers, since even the most driven and ambitious students can falter at the hands of an unqualified, incompetent teacher. Just recently, Susan Lee Barrett of Nicholas County, WV, was named as the West Virginia Teacher of the Year. Ms. Barrett is a teacher at the Cherry River Elementary School. She was selected based on her leadership in education reform. I hope that many other teachers in West Virginia and around the Nation will emulate the ambition and dedication to her chosen field that Ms. Barrett has so evidently displayed. 
I also take great pleasure in learning of the headway West Virginia is making as a leader in education. Over the past few months, my office has been inundated with positive news about many West Virginia schools and students. These bright spots deserve recognition for their efforts and innovation. As Plato wrote in his day, `Excellent things are rare.' How true that is. Excellence is something that we all can recognize--the Nobel Prize or a play by Shakespeare or Aeschylus or Euripides or Sophocles; however, it is not something that most of us see or experience on an everyday basis. For that reason, excellence should be acknowledged and it ought to be rewarded. 
The Department of Education recently announced the selection of the 1998 national blue ribbon schools, which are recognized for strong leadership, high-quality teaching, up-to-date curriculum, policies, and practices. In West Virginia, Weir High School, which is in the northern panhandle of West Virginia, and Weir Middle School, both of Weirton, WV, were named for this award. Weir High School is unique for its active role in preparing students to meet the demands of today's high-tech society. With increased global competition and industry downsizing, Weir High School provides its students with many important resources, including a computerized library resource directory, Internet accessibility, satellite television access, computer-assisted drafting, laser disc technology, and electronic research. Weir High School students are making great strides as a result of such unprecedented use of technology, and I commend the school and its able faculty for its leadership in that area. When I went to school, we never heard of such things. We not only didn't have access to it, we never even heard of it. 
In addition to an educational technology focus, Weir High School should be extremely proud of its veteran teaching staff--a staff that demonstrates an unparalleled level of commitment and dedication. That is what it requires: dedication and commitment. Among its faculty members, the school boasts of a Tandy finalist, Ashland Teacher of the Year, West Virginia Math Teacher of the Year, West Virginia Biology Teacher of the Year--think of that--several Hancock County Teachers of the Year, Who's Who Among American High School Teachers, and West Virginia Governor's Honor Academy Favorite Educators. 
Following in the footsteps of its neighboring high school, Weir Middle School has made great progress in technology, curriculum, National and State test scores, community involvement, student environment, and meeting State and National education goals for all students. The school motto, `An Open Door to New Beginnings,' is observed and followed daily. 
Accordingly, Weir Middle School recently introduced a new program, WEIR, We Encourage Individual Responsibility, to encompass total staff and student involvement in promoting learning and the teaching of standards. 
West Virginia, with stars shining across its educational firmament, is home to many other schools producing excellent students. To name a few, Kiley Anne Berry, a sophomore at East Fairmont State College, in the northern portion of the State, is 1 of 20 distinguished students selected from across the Nation--not just across West Virginia, but across the Nation--to participate in an international Youth Science Festival in Seoul, Korea. Heather Wilson, an eight-year-old from Jefferson County, in West Virginia's eastern panhandle, was selected earlier this year as a National Runner-Up in the Reading is Fundamental 1998 National Reading Celebration, an annual reading program challenging students to meet or exceed an age-based reading goal. Several students at Clay County High School of Clay, WV, were distinguished in the `We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution' national finals. More than 250 other West Virginia students in grades five through eight were honored for their exceptional academic talents as part of the Johns Hopkins University Talent Search. And the list goes on. 
I could spend several more minutes, or even hours, talking about distinguished West Virginia students and West Virginia schools, and education in general. I will, however, conclude now. But I urge all schools, teachers, and students, nationwide and in my State of West Virginia, to follow these pacesetters--pacesetters. Our education system in the United States is ailing and we need to get back on track. These schools and students that I have talked about today are succeeding, and I encourage others to keep pace and emulate this progress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I recently learned of an extremely alarming riot which occurred on the campus of Michigan State University. On May 2, 1998, nearly three thousand students abandoned their dorm rooms and various other corners of the university's massive campus to protest a university decision to end drinking at Munn Field, a popular campus spot where students gather before and after football games. Outraged students tore through a fence surrounding the field, thereafter charging into downtown East Lansing, home to the university, to set ablaze one of the area's busiest intersections. Police officers were pelted with flying bottles, rocks, and bricks, and were only able to quell the scores of protesting students with shots of tear gas. 
Michigan State University does not stand alone. Both Washington State University and Plymouth State College in New Hampshire have experienced similar protests. Mr. President, our Nation has a serious problem, which only continues to worsen with each passing day, yet, we in Congress have all but ignored this epidemic plaguing our nation's young people. Rather, we have stood on this floor ranting about the pernicious effects of tobacco, while its evil twin continues to rampage across college campuses throughout the country. I support the efforts we have undertaken to crack down on youth use of tobacco, but is it not time, I ask, to broaden the equally staggering problem of alcohol abuse among our young people? 
I hope that the President and the administration will engage in a similar crusade against alcohol abuse--similar to that which they have led with respect to the use of tobacco. 
I hear nothing said about alcohol--not a word. The country seems to be silent. It seems to have lost its voice when it comes to alcohol abuse. 
Alcohol, Mr. President, is the drug of choice--the drug of choice among teenagers and college students--not tobacco, not marijuana, not heroin, but alcohol. Surveys show that over 85 percent of all college students imbibe alcohol. That is a disgrace. 
Let me read that again. Over 85 percent of all college students imbibe alcohol, whether it be a beer, wine, or some other potent concoction tossed together at a fraternity party. More than 40 percent consume five or more drinks at one sitting within a 2-week period, otherwise defined as `binge drinking.' It really isn't the `in thing,' Mr. President, and I hope that young people will learn that. 
In the past year, the media have reported several incidents in which college students have tragically died due to alcohol poisoning or excessive inebriation, including deaths at Louisiana State University and the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In Virginia alone, five students died within a one-month timespan in alcohol-related accidents. 
If this were some new plague that was being visited upon the country, people would be asking for a remedy. 
The amendment I have included in the managers' package recognizes ten universities, colleges, or community colleges across the nation that have responded to this crisis with innovative and effective alcohol prevention policies. Under my amendment, each institution receives a grant of $50,000 in recognition of its efforts, subsequently to be used to help maintain and improve each respective program. In addition, my amendment requires the Department of Education to distribute a publication identifying these schools and their policies to high school counselors for the information of prospective college-going students and their parents. It is my hope that parents and responsible students--I should say responsible parents and responsible students--will use this information to select schools that are most active in helping students to be students, not drunks--students. 
Mr. President, over the years, the culture of college has gradually changed from one of academics and concentrated study to one consumed with partying--partying, and nobody benefits from it. Gathering at the library with classmates to prepare for an exam has taken a backseat to sitting around swilling beers at keg parties or ordering a round of shots at the closest bar. 
Sadly, the process does not always begin in college. Often times, experimentation with alcohol begins in high school, or even earlier in the homes. That is where it begins many times. The examples are set by parents. 
According to the 1995 `Monitoring the Future' study conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 55 percent of 8th graders have experimented with alcohol--55 percent of 8th graders have experimented with alcohol. When I was attending a little two-room school back in the mountains of West Virginia, it would never have been thought of, nobody would think of a student's going to school experimenting with alcohol. According to the study, 71 percent of 10th graders and 81 percent of high school seniors have experimented with alcohol. What are they doing in school? What do their parents think about that? What are their parents doing about it? Are the parents doing the same at home? 
Even more alarming, perhaps, is the widespread occurrence of binge drinking--measured by five or more drinks in a row at least once in the prior 2-week period. As indicated by the Monitoring the Future study, binge drinking stands at 15 percent for 8th graders, 24 percent for 10th graders, and 30 percent for high school seniors. What a shame. 
Today, alcohol is infesting the lives of vulnerable young children at the hands of irresponsible parents and schools, and students are not just walking away from the empty beer bottle with a so-called `buzz.' In 1996, approximately 2,315 drivers between the ages of fifteen and twenty lost their lives in alcohol-related traffic deaths. 
Yet, all the rage is about tobacco. I don't have any criticism of that rage, but why not alcohol also? Nobody hears a peep, not even a peep, about alcohol abuse. 
More than 40 percent of all 16- to 20-year-old deaths result from motor vehicle crashes, about half of whom die in alcohol-related crashes. Nobody reads about tobacco-related crashes. These are alcohol-related crashes. Where are the administration speakers? Why don't they speak out about alcohol as well? Where are the churches? Where is the great moral force of the churches in this country anymore? 
Alcohol is a factor in the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds--accidents, homicides and suicides. There you have it. In approximately 50 to 60 percent of youth suicides, alcohol is involved--not tobacco, but alcohol--booze. That is stuff that inflames one's mind. Furthermore, links have been shown between alcohol use and teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. 
So, Mr. President, with the drinking onset age becoming younger and younger, colleges each year face an influx of students who already know this drug all too well. Students walk on to college campuses today with booze on the brain--we have heard of water on the knee or water on the brain; these students have booze on the brain--completely apathetic to curriculum, major requirements, and freshman seminar choices. 
Fraternity parties run amuck with students hankering to get their hands on a beer or whatever may be the alcoholic beverage of the night. According to a national survey recently released by researchers at Cornell and Southern Illinois universities, nearly three of every four fraternity leaders engage in binge drinking, averaging approximately fourteen drinks per week. Fourteen drinks per week! 
Student alcohol abuse is the number one problem on college campuses across the nation, yet, precious little is being done to combat this destructive trend. In 1989, as part of the amendments to the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, Congress passed a minimum set of requirements for college substance abuse policies as a condition of receiving funds or any other form of financial assistance under any Federal Program. These regulations require institutions of higher education to certify to the Department of Education that they have implemented a policy that prohibits the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of drugs or alcohol on college property, or as part of a college activity, and to distribute to college students a document describing campus policy on alcohol and other drugs. 
While many schools reluctantly meet these minimum federal requirements, there are a select few that go far beyond the call of duty to combat alcohol abuse on campus. It is these schools, these candles that are glowing in the darkness, that deserve recognition for their efforts. I have read articles highlighting a northeastern school which has implemented substance-free housing on campus, reducing binge drinking by as much as 30 percent in the past few years as a result of the program. It is this kind of progress which must be sought by parents and educators. However, such significant headway does not happen overnight, and certainly requires much work and dedication. 
Again, my amendment names ten institutions of higher education each year with proven effective alcohol prevention policies and awards each a grant of $50,000 to help get at the root of the problem. These awards would not be conferred haphazardly to schools that craft a pretty brochure on alcohol abuse, but do virtually nothing to enforce what has been put down on paper. Vacuous words do not have much meaning, but action does. There are some terrific programs out there, such as the one at the aforementioned northeastern school, which should serve as models for other schools still grappling with alcohol abuse problems. My amendment awards those schools that make a difference. 
Accordingly, my amendment lays forth explicit criteria which schools must meet in order to be eligible to receive a National Recognition award. Applicant colleges must have specific policies implemented on campus, including restrictions on alcohol advertising in campus publications and at sporting events, the establishment or expansion of alcohol-free living arrangements for all students, and the development of partnerships with community members and organizations to further alcohol prevention efforts on campus. In addition, my amendment creates a review board, with members to be appointed by the Secretary of Education, to review and evaluate the applicant's implementation of these policies on campus. 
Earlier this year, Secretary Shalala urged members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to sever their ties with the alcoholic beverage industry, and called on colleges to eliminate alcohol advertising from sporting events. I second that motion. After all, this is simple common sense. It is unequivocally evident that alcohol and sports do not mix, yet colleges continue to endorse alcoholic beverage sponsorship of athletic events. One particular school, until recently, actually herded basketball players from the locker room onto the home court by way of an inflatable silver tunnel resembling a can of beer! 
My amendment included in the Higher Education Act begins to touch upon some of the fundamental areas which must be addressed in halting this deadly substance from further permeating college campuses. As we have learned this year from the tragic deaths of several promising young students at some of our finest universities just this past year, the decision to drink alcohol can sometimes mean life or death, even when an automobile is not involved. 
Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge Senator Wellstone, and thank him for his work on the Labor and Human Resources Committee in addressing the issue of college drinking prior to S. 1882 coming to the floor. Senator Wellstone was successful in including an extremely important counterpart to my amendment which creates a grant program for colleges to establish alcohol and drug treatment, counseling, as well as alcohol and drug education. I want to commend Senator Wellstone for his efforts and dedication to fighting alcohol abuse on college campuses. 
Mr. President, when I was a member of the West Virginia State Senate, 48 years ago, I was a witness to the execution of a young man named James Hewlett at the West Virginia State Penitentiary, in Moundsville. I asked to be a witness because the law at that time required a certain number of witnesses, to an execution. I asked to be a witness and the warden accepted me as a witness. Before the execution, I told the warden that I wanted to talk with this young man who was going to be executed at 9 p.m. He had shot a cabdriver in the back and left the cabdriver to die by the side of the road after robbing him and then drove off with the cab. This young man was later apprehended in a theater at Montgomery, WV, and was convicted and sentenced to die in the electric chair. 
He did not wish to have a Chaplain in his cell. He scoffed at the idea of religion. But, as the days and weeks wore on, he asked for a Chaplain, because the Governor did not commute his sentence. And, so, the young man knew that he was going to die. 
I went into the doomed man's cell that evening and shook his hand. He was perspiring. I said, `I often speak to young people, 4-H groups, Boy Scout groups and Girl Scout groups, and I thought that you might have a message that I could pass on to these young people.' 
He said, `Well, tell them to go to Sunday school and church. If I had gone to Sunday school and church, I probably wouldn't be here tonight.' 
I turned to go after a few more words. He said, `Wait a minute. Tell them something else. Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.' Those were his very words. That was almost 50 years ago, but I have told that story over and over to young audiences. `Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.' 
I said, `Why do you say that?' 
The chaplain in his cell spoke up and said, `Do you see that little crack in the wall up there?' 
I looked up at the wall and said, `Yes.' 
He said, `If he were to take a couple of drinks, he would try to get through that little crack in the wall. That's what alcohol does to him.' 
I said goodbye and left, went back over to the warden's office and, at the stroke of 9, we were back in the death house where we watched the execution. That was the story of Jim Hewlett, `Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.' 
About 30 years later, I was visiting in the northern panhandle of West Virginia and someone said to me, `Why don't you pay a visit to the home of Father so-and-so. He's very ill, and it might help if you just stopped by and said hello.' I personally did not know the clergyman. 
I said, `Well, tell me where to go,' and I went. And the priest was there. He was very ill. I don't know how the subject matter arose, how I came to tell this story to him, but I told this same story of having talked with Jim Hewlett just before the execution. 
I told it in greater detail than I am now telling my colleagues, and the priest just sat and listened. He never said anything. When I finished, he said, `Yes. That's the way it was. You see, I was the chaplain in that cell that night when you came to visit Jim Hewlett.' 
That young man said to me--those words I will never forget --`Tell them not to drink the stuff I drank.' 
So I plead to our young people, those young pages who are here in this great Chamber and those who are listening and watching on television: Avoid alcohol. Stay away from it. There is nothing good in it. And the point is, you may get into an automobile and kill an innocent person--a woman taking her children to school, to the library, to the hospital or to church. You may kill them. Smoking tobacco is bad, but tobacco won't cause you to drive while drunk. 
I am not upholding tobacco, but what I am saying is, in this country, we have been engaged in a great crusade against tobacco, but nobody lifts a finger, nobody says a word, there is not a peep said about alcohol abuse. 
I implore the young people in this country to stop, look and listen before you `drink the stuff' that Jim Hewlett drank. 
I thank the managers for accepting my amendment, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 11 months ago, this body resoundingly passed S. Res. 98, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, cosponsored by the distinguished Senator who presently presides over the Senate, the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, and myself. 
The Byrd-Hagel Resolution sent a strong message to the Administration regarding the then-impending Kyoto Protocol. The Resolution directed the Administration not to submit the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for its advice and consent until developing countries, especially the largest emitters, make `new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions' similar to those to which developed nations would be bound if the Protocol were implemented. The resolution also called on the Administration to show that such a Protocol `would not result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.' 
In anticipation of the President's trip to China, I recently sent a letter to him urging him to use his influence to persuade the Chinese to take `a progressive leadership role among the developing world' so that we can begin to fully address this complex and serious issue. I noted that, `after 2015, China is expected to surpass the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. While the Chinese contribution to global emissions in 1995 was 11 percent, it is expected to reach 17 percent by percent by 2035. In that same time period, the U.S. emissions will shrink from 22 percent to 15 percent.' 
While the international effort to bring China on board may seem like a difficult task, it is still possible if we seek win-win opportunities. While China has taken a number of steps to clean up its own environment, China's domestic efforts must increase given the serious nature of their environmental problems. I urged the President to encourage China to support the market mechanisms that were successfully incorporated in the Protocol by the Administration's negotiators. 
Through flexible, market-based mechanisms, we have a tremendous opportunity to work with the developing world, allowing for economic growth and also reducing world, allowing for economic growth and also reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. As I have previously said, the United States and the rest of the developed world is not attempting to limit the economic growth of China or any other developing nation. China has the right to develop economically. But, based on the growing body of evidence and the potential consequences of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, all economic development should be done in a responsible manner. The Chinese must recognize the importance of their role, and they should not ignore their responsibilities in addressing this shared problem. Global warming is a global problem. 
It is not just an American problem. It is not just a European problem. It is a global problem. And as such, it requires not just an American solution, not just a European solution, but a global solution. 
I wrote the President stating that, `the combination of these efforts would be the right course of action and underscores how the Chinese could accept binding commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Taken together, these steps would lead to a real reduction in emissions as well as global participation in the Kyoto Protocol.' 
Mr. President, I believe we should challenge the Administration to recognize the concerns of the Senate and the American people with regard to the Kyoto Protocol and its possible impact on the U.S. economy, but in saying this, I am also willing to seek a constructive dialogue focusing on addressing this important issue. Of all the significant concerns that the President will discuss with the Chinese during his visit, I believe that this is one of the most critical for the long-term relationship of both our nations. We have to begin to work together because our shared environmental futures are at stake, and the well-being of our people's futures--these are at stake.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on another item, I take this opportunity to speak about him during his absence, and I am referring to the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. 
Mr. Coats will be leaving the Senate after this year. He is voluntarily doing so. He is a very able member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I serve on that committee with Senator Coats. He is very knowledgeable about national defense, about military matters. He takes his responsibilities seriously. He is extremely articulate in his exposition of the problems and the defense needs of our country, and he is quite influential among the other members of the committee and of the Senate on both sides of the aisle as well. 
I admire him. He was a very dedicated protagonist--a very dedicated protagonist of the line-item veto, and it was on those occasions when we would debate back and forth between us, and among us on both sides of the aisle, that I learned to respect Senator Coats--learned to respect him for his ability to debate, for his equanimity, always, in debate. He is always most charitable, very deferential, and courteous to a fault. He has always treated me fairly and kindly. On yesterday, when we discussed the Supreme Court's decision--which I favored, and which did not follow the viewpoint of Mr. Coats--Mr. Coats was most magnanimous in his words concerning those of us who opposed the line-item veto. 
So, basically he is a gentleman, and what more can one say? A gentleman; he considers the views of others, he listens to the words of others patiently and with respect, and is much to be admired. I admire him. 
He has indicated, along with Senator McCain, that it is his--it is their intention to come forward with another proposal. And of course I will respect their viewpoint and listen to what they have to say and read carefully what they propose, and will again oppose anything that purports to shift the people's power over the purse as reflected by their elected Representatives in this body and in the House of Representatives--shift that power to any President. 
Yesterday was a great day in the history of our Nation, an exceedingly important day, because, beginning with President Grant after the Civil War, all Presidents, with the exception of William Howard Taft, have endorsed and espoused the line-item veto. For much longer than a single century, Presidents have wanted the line-item veto. George Washington, the first and greatest President of all Presidents, in my viewpoint, recognized the Constitution for what it was and for what it is. He said that when he signed a bill, he had to sign it or veto it in toto, he had to accept it or veto it in its entirety. 
Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787. He presided. He listened to all of the debates. He, obviously, listened and joined in the conversations that went on in the back rooms and the meeting places of Members when they were not in convention session. He knew what their thoughts were. He knew what Madison's thoughts were; he knew what Hamilton's ideas were; he knew what Elbridge Gerry's feelings were; he knew what Governor Edmund Randolph's ideas were. But George Washington knew that that Constitution did not allow, it did not permit, it did not give the line-item veto to any President. 
I am grateful to the majority on the Supreme Court for having acted to save us from our own folly. I am somewhat disappointed and amazed that there would even be a minority on the Supreme Court on this issue. I cannot comprehend a minority of the Members of the Supreme Court seeing any way other than as the majority saw it. I voted against Clarence Thomas to go on the Supreme Court, but Mr. Justice Thomas yesterday saw clearly what the Constitution requires. 
Who yesterday stood to defend this unique system of checks and balances and separation of powers? Clarence Thomas was one of the six. He redeemed himself in great measure, in one Senator's eyes--my own! I was proud of Chief Justice Rehnquist who agreed with Mr. Justice Stevens in the majority opinion. I was proud of Mr. Justice Kennedy in his concurring opinion. 
For the first time, Congress had committed this colossal error of shifting to the President a power over the purse that he does not have under the Constitution. Congress failed the people of the United States, in whom all power in this Republic resides and from whom all power is given. And the Senate failed. For the first time in more than a century and a quarter, the Congress yielded to political impulses and gave to the President a share in the control of the purse that the Constitution does not give him. 
For those who have read Madison, who have read the Federalist essays, they saw in Federalist 58 Madison's words when he said, `This power over the purse may in fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any Constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.' Those are Madison's words. 
So, Mr. President, where are our eyes? Read the Federalist essays, read the debates that took place in the convention--according to Madison's notes and the notes of others who attended that convention. Where could we possibly imagine that that Constitution gives to us puny pygmies--the power and the authority or the right to attempt to end run the Constitution by giving to the President the line-item veto by statute? 
What a shame. What a shame. How would those framers look upon us? But the framers wisely provided for that eventuality when they created the judiciary. And our forebears in the first Senate, which met in 1789, also provided for that eventuality when they enacted the Judiciary Act and created the court system. 
I am a more exalted admirer of the Supreme Court today than I have ever been in my 29,439 days of life. It isn't my birthday; I have just lived 29,439 days. I keep count of my days, take my life one day at a time--29,439 days. And yesterday I became a more enthusiastic and avid admirer of the Supreme Court of the United States than ever before because, to me, this, this decision by the Court preserved the system of checks and balances and separation of powers. 
So God bless America. God bless this honorable Court. 
I also pause to thank those 28 other Senators who, on March the 23th, 1995, stood with me in voting against that inimical, perverse Line-Item Veto Act that sought to give the line-item veto to the President of the United States. 
And I thank those 30 other Senators on both sides of the aisle who stood with me in voting against the conference report on that legislation, the Line-Item Veto Act, on March the 27th, 1996, a year and 4 days later. That was when the Senate stabbed itself in the back. Those 31 who stood in defense of the constitutional system of checks and balances and separation of powers on that day, those 31 were vindicated by the Supreme Court's decision on yesterday. 
Thank God for the United States of America! 
God save the Supreme Court of the United States!

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on still another note, it seems like such a short time ago that we rang in the New Year. It is almost July, and the midpoint of the year has passed. How quickly we have gone from gray skies, lowering clouds, and seemingly incessant rain, with some snow, some hail, strong winds, to bright sunshine and the first fruits and vegetables of the season. Already the brief moment of the wild strawberries, those tender morsels of condensed sunshine and spring showers, has passed, but juicy blackberries are ripening along their protective bramble arches, ready for picking in time to fill a pie that may grace a festive Fourth of July picnic. In West Virginia, whole families can be spotted, buckets in hand, along the fence rows where brambles grow, especially those old rail fences, gathering blackberries for pies and jam. Of course, the younger the picker, the more blackberries that end up inside the picker rather than inside the bucket, but that is just one of the messy, finger-staining joys of summertime. And the fingers are stained, as are the lips and the chins and the drippings on the clothing. 
When I think of the Fourth of July, visions of family picnics crowned by the very literal fruits of that berry-picking labor are among the many happy thoughts that surface. Like that blackberry pie topped with melting vanilla ice cream, Fourth of July memories are a sweet blend of small town parades with volunteer firemen in brightly polished trucks and high school marching bands bedecked in their finest regalia; of local beauty queens sharing convertibles with waving mayors and Congressmen and Senators; and flags . . . flags everywhere, waving in the sweaty palms of excited youngsters and proudly flying before houses on quiet side streets where no parade will ever pass, but where grandpa might sit on the porch in his World War II service cap and wave to the passing neighbors. That is the American scene. 
Although cheapened by holiday sales that commercialize the occasion, like all holidays, the Fourth of July has somehow remained triumphantly above it all, like the flag so gallantly flying over Fort McHenry that inspired Francis Scott Key to write `The Star Spangled Banner.' More families and friends gather for picnics or reunions and an evening spent watching fireworks than spend the day in the mall and the evening before the television set. Most people still know that the Fourth of July celebrates the declaration of our nation's independence from Great Britain, though other historical facts concerning our battle for freedom and the establishment of our government are fuzzy though these are facts, and out of focus but not the Fourth of July. Most people consider themselves patriotic, though I suspect that a substantial percentage could not clearly define what it means to them to be a patriot. 
To be a patriot is much, much more than to be a fan of, say, a football team. To root for one's country is part of being a patriot, but that support can be shallow, like the hurrah of a sports fan that turns all too quickly to boos--boos, b-o-o-s--when the team's record loses a certain winning luster. Those cheers, those hurrahs, change to boos, b-o-o-s. It might have been some other spelling of `booze' imbibed during the game. We will leave that for another day. To be a patriot is to reach into the deep current that has carried our nation through history, and not be distracted by the ephemeral eddies of scandal that ripple the surface. To be certain, a part of that definition is the quiet willingness to set aside one's own plans and don the uniform of a nation that calls for your service. But one need not only wear a uniform to be a patriot. Nor is it enough simply to pay your taxes, obey the speed limit, and memorize the pledge of allegiance 
to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic--not the democracy--to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God. 
I am proud of the fact that I was a member of the other body, and I'm the only Member of Congress who still serves in the Congress of the United States who was present there when the words `under God' were included in the Pledge of Allegiance on June 7, 1954. 
Interestingly, exactly 1 year from that day, on June 7, 1955, the House of Representatives--I was a member of the House at that time--the House of Representatives enacted legislation providing for these words `In God We Trust' to appear on the currency and the coin of the United States. Those words had appeared on some of the coins previous to that time, but on June 7, 1955, the House enacted legislation providing that the currency and the coin of the United States would carry the words `In God We Trust.' 
To be a patriot involves understanding, appreciating, and protecting that which gives our Nation its unique spot on the compass of the world--our Constitution. It has been much in the news the last 24 hours. 
And that cannot be condensed onto a bumper sticker. 
In establishing a government that adroitly balances the minority against the majority, the small or less populous States against the larger, the executive against the legislative against the judicial, and that preserves individual liberty and opportunity, our Founding Fathers truly delivered on the promise embodied in the Fourth of July. The Declaration of Independence was a clarion call in the wilderness, a defiant shout down the echoing canyons of history, saying, `We can do better.' The Constitution gave that call that was issued in the Declaration of Independence substance, and the more than 200 years of history since that time have done little to erode the triumph of that achievement. 
The Constitution of the United States of America is a remarkably compact document. This is it--this little, tiny document. Of course, this particular booklet also contains the Declaration of Independence. But that is it. That is the Constitution of the United States. Think of the struggles, think of the sacrifices of men and women, think of the battles, think of April 19 when Captain Parker stood on the greens at Lexington with his men and bared their breasts to the British redcoats, and then at Concord, and then Bunker Hill, and King's Mountain. And think of the battles during the War of 1812, on the sea, on the land, the carnage, the blood that was shed in the Civil War by men on both sides, who fought for the Union and who fought against the Union. All of these, and more, gave their lives. 
The Constitution still lives! The men who wrote the Declaration of Independence--Jefferson, Franklin, Sherman, Adams, Livingston--their lives were at risk. Their lives were at risk. They could have been hanged. That was treason--treason--to write that Declaration of Independence! They could have been taken to England and tried and executed there. That was treason! Think of the sacrifices that have gone into the creation of that little booklet--the history, the events, the treasures that were at risk, the fortunes that were lost, the lives that were lost, the blood that was shed, the families that were destroyed, the properties that were confiscated--all of these and more. 
What did we get out of it? We got this--the Constitution of the United States! The Constitution's beginnings go back for years, for decades, for centuries, back a thousand years. American constitutionalism began at Runnymede on the banks of the Thames in June 1215 and before. It had its roots in the English struggle when Englishmen shed their blood at the point of a sword in their efforts to wrest from tyrannical monarchs the power of the purse. 
So there it is. That little document is all we got out of it. But what that contains! More than the Magna Carta. That is what we will be celebrating on the 4th of July--that Declaration of Independence and that Constitution. Too soon we have forgotten, haven't we? This is a remarkable document. Every schoolchild ought to study it, and every schoolchild ought to be required to memorize it. 
The Law of the Twelve Tables, created in Rome in the year 450 B.C. A delegation was sent to Athens to study the laws of Solon--that remarkable man who is one of the seven wise men of Greece--to study the laws and to bring back to Rome the ideas and the provisions that could be put into a law, which the Plebeians would understand as well as the Patricians. The delegation went in 
454 B.C., and they came back to Rome and began this work in 451 B.C. In 450, they completed the work: The Law of the Twelve Tables. They inscribed these laws on tables, and those tables were destroyed in the year 390 B.C. by Brennus and the Gauls. The Gauls conquered Rome and destroyed much of it and, along with it, destroyed the Law of the Twelve Tables. 
But so what? Cicero said that the young people had been required to memorize the Law of the Twelve Tables, and therefore, even though the Gauls destroyed the Twelve Tables, the Law of the Twelve Tables lived on in the memories of the schoolchildren. Hence, the Romans hadn't lost the Law of the Twelve Tables. The Schoolchildren had been required to memorize the Law of the Twelve Tables. 
Cicero also had this to say about the Constitution:  
It is necessary for a Senator to be thoroughly acquainted with the Constitution, without which no Senator can possibly be fit for his office. 
Those who wish to find that quotation may look in Blackstone, the first book of Blackstone, section 1, paragraph #10, I believe it is. Blackstone quotes Cicero and what Cicero said about the Constitution. 
This is it. Let us all think about that on the 4th of July. Let us think about those who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for that document. It is not lengthy. What does it weigh? Put it on the scale. Put it on the scales of time, on the scales of history, on the scales of liberty. Its weight cannot be measured. 
Every schoolchild ought to study this, and every adult ought to know so instinctively that any challenge to the balance of powers outlined in this document should be instantly identified and resisted. If only cultural antibodies could be developed that would allow the people of this Nation to acquire an immunity, and would allow the Members of this body and the other body of the Congress today and forevermore to acquire an immunity, to constitutional cancer--it is a vaccine that I would gladly take. Then, perhaps, I and others like me would not have to struggle so hard to excise the melanomas of balanced budget amendments and line-item acts that periodically threaten to overturn the safeguards established by the Framers to ensure that the people and their elected representatives have recourse against an ambitious power grab by the executive, or by any political party. 
Like the wild strawberries and blackberries that sweeten a country stroll on a Sunday afternoon, our republican form of government is a natural treasure of a generous and bountiful land. But, like the delicate wild beauties of vine and bramble which are too easily overlooked amid the garish profusion of plenty that surrounds us, so must we be alert to often subtle presence of Constitutional safeguards embodied in our complex profusion of laws and governmental structures. We must guard against a complacency that would trample them under foot or mow them down in a fervor of thoughtless modernization for the sake of change or in the name of some soul-less efficiency. 
This Fourth of July--this Fourth of July--let us put aside for a moment the bright display of fireworks, the inspiring ring of martial music, and listen for the timeless song of our past. Listen for the courage and determination in the solemn opening paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence where it is said: 
`When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 
`We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness: That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.' 
Mr. President, on July 4, 1776, the thirteen united states of America committed themselves to a bold new course, at great risk. It is no small thing to break away from centuries of tradition, in the face of overwhelming military might, and the opening paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence make it clear that our Founding Fathers knew full well the seriousness and the risks of the course they had embarked upon. They recognized the challenge laid out for them in establishing a new and better form of government. 
This Fourth of July, I will happily watch the parades and the fireworks and, with luck, perhaps enjoy with my wife of 61 years and my daughters of many years and my grandchildren of several years a piece of blackberry pie with ice cream. 
But I will also take the time to pull out my little copy of the Constitution that I carry with me, near to my heart. I will take a few minutes to marvel again at the skill and economy with which the Framers outlined a government that has so well provided for our nation through the centuries. We who enjoy the freedom, the independence, the security, and the prosperity of 1998, owe a great debt of gratitude for the courage and the commitment of those patriots of 1776, and an equal debt to the men, some of them the same individuals, who followed through on that promise in the Constitutional Convention of 1789. We honor them best, I think, by preserving their legacy for the patriots of the 21st Century, our children and grandchildren. 
The legacy bequeathed to us in trust to our children and grandchildren is, Mr. President--I say to the very distinguished patriotic Senator, who is from Wyoming, and who graces the Presiding Officer's chair in the Chamber today--simply the most richly endowed nation on the face of the Earth--rich in land, in opportunity, in liberty. 
We are the inheritors of plenty, thank God, merciful Providence. I have had the great fortune to travel widely during my life. I have visited with kings, queens, shahs, prime ministers, presidents, and premiers of many lands. I have seen the beauties of Europe, the mysteries of the Orient, the crumbling ruins of once-mighty empires in the Middle East. They have all left me with wonderful memories and great stories. But when I travel, I pine for home. 
I took a trip around the world along with six colleagues in the House of Representatives in 1955. That was 43 years ago. We traveled around the world in an old Constellation. We traveled for 68 days. That would have been called a junket today. We were a subcommittee of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. And so I traveled in many wonderful lands, but the most beautiful sight that I saw in that entire 68 days, having seen the Taj Mahal, having seen Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan, having seen the other wonders and beauties of the world and of nature, the most inspiring and gratifying thing that I saw were the two little bright red lights flashing at the top of the Washington Monument when we returned to the good old United States of America. We had been in lands where there was no fresh, clean water to be drawn from the faucets. We so much take America for granted today, but what a wonderful experience it was anew to be able upon our return to go back to a faucet and see come from that faucet water--clear, pure, good water--that we could drink without fear of becoming ill. So I have been left with many wonderful memories, but never shall I forget those two red lights at the top of the monument to the greatest President of the greatest country in the world, the Washington Monument. 
I miss when I travel the comforting presence of friendly West Virginia faces, the soft breeze that carries their cheerful hellos, the warm smiles that brighten the day and lift my heart. I think that I never appreciate home so much as when I am away from it. I suspect that you, Mr. President, and most Americans feel that way, too. That great poet Henry Van Dyke certainly did, and he used his facility with words to capture the feeling in his poem, `America For Me.'  
`Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down 
Among the famous palaces and cities of renown, 
To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,-- 
But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things. 
So it's home again, and home again, America for me! 
My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be, 
In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars, 
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars. 
Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air; 
And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair; 
And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in Rome 
But when it comes to living there is just no place like home. 
I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled; 
I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains filled; 
But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day 
In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way! 
I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack: 
The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back. 
But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,-- 
We love our land for what she is and what she is to be. 
Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me! 
I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling sea, 
To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars, 
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars! 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Romulus was the legendary first King of Rome. It was said that he went up to Heaven during a storm. Others have drawn the conclusion that it was during an eclipse of the Sun. In any case, it was a historic event. 
When Joshua had his men march around the walls of Jericho, they blew their trumpets at a given signal and the walls came tumbling down. We are told in the Scriptures that it was a long day, a long day, a significant event, perhaps a scientific event, one about which there has been some debate. 
I have been informed of a truly significant recent event. I wouldn't say that it is Earth shaking, but who knows? It could eventually be looked back upon as an earthshaking event. 
Now, what is this all about? The Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, is watching and listening with great interest, and so are others. This event, I want to say in the Record and for all those who are watching through that electronic eye, this event was about the coming of Chester Trent Lott III, the first grandchild of our distinguished majority leader, and the baby came with the angels on last Saturday evening. 
He weighed 7 pounds and 7 ounces--so, you see, those are mystic numbers, 7/7--7 pounds, 7 ounces. He was 19.5 inches in length. Now, these weights and measures are important. They were even important to the barons who forced King John on the meadow at Runnymede on June 15, 1215, to sign the great charter, the Magna Carta, 
which required that there be a system of weights and measures in the Kingdom. And our illustrious forebears who wrote the Constitution of the United States said that Congress would have the power to fix the standard of weights and measures. 
So here to live by that system of weights and measures is a new man, a nova Homo sapiens named Chester Trent Lott III. That is a matter of great significance in the life of our leader. 
I congratulate Senator Lott on this most felicitous happening, this most felicitous occasion. Mr. President, there is nothing, may I say to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, so wonderful as cradling in your arms--oh, many times I have done it--cradling in your arms a swaddled baby. It awakens in one such an amazing range of emotions. There is nothing like it. It is an experience sui generis--one of a kind. Upon the birth of one's own child, the tremendous joy and relief felt in meeting for the first time this tiny, new person is tempered by a measure of fear. You gaze down at this fragile baby and realize what an awesome responsibility you have assumed. Your baby is small, maybe 7 pounds 7 ounces--and there are smaller babies. They are all small and so fragile, so helpless, and so dependent upon you for their survival. His skin is as soft as a butterfly's wing, his fingernails as translucent as scraps of rice paper; yet those minute, perfect little fingers grasp yours with such fierce determination! I can feel those little fingers closing around my fingers with such fierce determination--although that experience of having my own daughters do that is now 60 years gone. But the memory is fresh in my mind. 
But to become a grandfather--now, that is a higher plateau. Mr. Leader, you are walking a higher plateau of immortality. It is not your first taste of mortality--that came with your son or daughter--but now a more inspiring, promising taste of immortality. To become a grandfather is a completely different experience. There is none of that fear, but all of the joy. That joy is heightened by a deep conviction--a deep conviction that `this is in my image' and in its grandmother's image, too. But it has my genes, it has my chromosomes, it is part of me. I can see it going on into the future and carrying on through life. Robert Byrd will never die, I would say. I can say that in more ways than one, but in this situation, my grandchild is part of me. 
Tennyson said, `I am a part of all that I have met.' But this was known before Tennyson. A grandfather, when he looks upon that child, can say with joy: `This is a part of me; it will never, never die.' 
That joy is heightened by a deep connection that you feel to the long continuum of countless generations, stretching all the way back from Adam and Eve to you and through you to your child, and now to your child's child. And you can feel the pull of the ancient echoes from the dim and distant past as your arms adjust to the weight of this little, new life in your arms. And you can see into the hazy unknown and murky distant future of continuing, endless generations, when this child of your child will have children who will carry a part of you and a part of everyone in this chain before you into the next century, and beyond. 
There is a sense of connectedness and timelessness that allows you to understand your place in the long, slow march of generations that is as difficult to express as it is wonderful to experience. 
That political treatise, The Policraticus, was written by John of Salisbury in the early part of the 12th century. It told of Prothaonius, who said it was glory enough for him that he had lived a life, of which his `grandson need not be ashamed.' It was glory enough for him that he had lived a life of which his grandson need not be ashamed. We grandfathers should try to emulate Prothaonius. 
Well, I offer my sincere congratulations to Senator Lott and best wishes to his new grandson; and, of course, I congratulate Mrs. Lott, about her new grandson, and my wife joins me. I hope the duties of the `grandfather's office' will not prevent the Senator from Mississippi from spending many happy hours with the newest member of the `House of Lott.' 
We read about the House of David. This is the `House of Lott.' And, as the days and months go by, when this grandfather holds his new grandson, I hope that Senator Lott will appreciate the emotion that is expressed by these few lines of verse, which I did not write, but which I dedicate to Chester Trent Lott III.  
First, in thy grandfather's arms, a newborn child 
thou didst weep, while those around thee smiled; 
so live, that in thy lasting sleep 
thou mayst smile while those around thee weep.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the U.S. Supreme Court earlier today announced in its ruling in the consolidated cases of Clinton v. New York and Rubin v. Snake River Potato Growers that it has found the Line-item Veto Act to be unconstitutional. It did this by a vote of 6 to 3. It is with great relief and thankfulness that I join with Senators Moynihan and Levin--and I am sure that if our former colleague, Senator Hatfield, were here he would join with us--in celebrating the Supreme Court's wise decision. 
Mr. President, the Founding Fathers created for us a vision, set down on parchment. Our Constitution embodies that vision, that dream of freedom, supported by the genius of practical structure which has come to be known as the checks and balances and separation of powers. If the fragile wings of the structure are ever impaired, then the dream can never again soar as high. 
Today, the Supreme Court has spared the birthright of all Americans for yet a while longer by striking down a colossal error made by the Congress when it passed the Line-Item Veto Act. For me and for those who have joined me in this fight, a long, difficult journey is happily ended. The wisdom of the framers has once again prevailed and the slow undoing of the people's liberties has been halted. 
Every year, we in this Nation spend billions upon billions of dollars, we expend precious manpower, we devise greater and more ingenious weapons, all for the sake of protecting ourselves, our way of life and our freedoms from foreign threats. And, yet, when it comes to the duty--and we all take that oath with our hand on the Holy Bible and our hand uplifted, we take that oath and say `so help me, God' that we will support and defend this Constitution. And so when it comes to the duty of protecting our Constitution, the living document which ensures the cherished liberties for which our forefathers gave their lives, we walked willingly into the friendly fire of the Line-Item Veto Act, enticed by political polls and grossly uninformed popular opinion. 
Now that the Supreme Court has found the Line-Item Veto Act to be unconstitutional, it is my fervent hope that the Senate will come to a new understanding and appreciation of our Constitution and the power of the purse as envisioned by the framers. Let us treat the Constitution with the reverence it is due, with a better understanding of what exactly is at stake when we carelessly meddle with our system of checks and balances and the separation of powers. If we disregard the lessons learned from this colossal blunder, we might just as well strike a match and hold that invaluable document to the flame. Unless we take care, it will be our liberties and those of our children and grandchildren that will finally go up in the thick black smoke of puny political ambition. 
Edmund Burke once observed that, `abstract liberty, like other mere abstractions, is not to be found.' 
If we, who are entrusted with the safeguarding of the people's liberties--and that is what is involved here--are careless or callous or complacent, then those hard-won, cherished freedoms can run through our fingers like so many grains of sand. Let us all endeavor to take more to heart the awesome responsibility which service in this body conveys, and remember always that what has been won with such difficulty for us by those who sacrificed so much for our gain can be quickly and effortlessly squandered by less worthy keepers of that trust. 
Mr. President, let me read just a few brief extracts from the majority opinion. And that opinion was written by Mr. Justice Stevens. 
There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes. 
That is elemental. I am editorializing now--that is elemental. 
Continuing with the opinion written by Mr. Justice Stevens, 
and concurred in by the Chief Justice and four other justices: 
What has emerged in these cases from the President's exercise of his statutory cancellation powers, however, are truncated versions of two bills that passed both Houses of Congress. They are not the product of the `finely wrought' procedure that the Framers designed. * * * * * 
If the Line-Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the President to create a different law--one whose text was not voted on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for signature. Something that might be known as `Public Law 105-33 as modified by the President' may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document that may `become a law' pursuant to the procedures designed by the Framers of Article I, [section] 7, of the Constitution. 
If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will play a different role in determining the final text of what may `become a law,' such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution. 
I close my reading of the excerpts from Mr. Justice Stevens' majority opinion. Let me read now, briefly, certain extracts from the concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Kennedy. He says this: 
I write to respond to my colleague JUSTICE BREYER, who observes that the statute does not threaten the liberties of individual citizens, a point on which I disagree. . . . The argument is related to his earlier suggestion that our role is lessened here because the two political branches are adjusting their own powers between themselves. . . . The Constitution's structure requires a stability which transcends the convenience of the moment. . . . Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers. 
Separation of powers was designed to implement a fundamental insight; concentration of power in the hands of a single branch is a threat to liberty. 
The Federalist states the maxim in these explicit terms: 
The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and, judiciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny. 
Others of my colleagues may wish to quote further. 
So what is involved here--what the Court's opinion is really saying--what is involved when we tamper with checks and balances and the separation of powers, that structure in the Constitution? What is really involved are the liberties of the people. 
Blackstone says it very well in chapter 2 of book 1. Chapter 2 is titled `Of the Parliament.' 
Blackstone said the same thing that the Court is saying:  
In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the right both of making and of enforcing the laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men; and wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty. . . . 
There it is. There can be no public liberty where these two powers are united in one and the same man or one and the same body of men. 
That is what the Line-Item Veto Act sought to do; namely, to unite the power of making law with the power of enforcing the law in the hands of one man: the President of the United States. 
Let me close with this excerpt from my own modest production titled `The Senate of the Roman Republic': 
This is not a truth that some people want to hear. 
See, I was talking about the line-item veto. I spent years in preparation for this battle, and those years of preparation went into the writing of this treatise. I quote: 
This is not a truth that some people want to hear. Many would rather believe that quack remedies such as line-item vetoes and enhanced rescissions powers in the hands of presidents will somehow miraculously solve our current fiscal situation and eliminate our monstrous budget deficits. Of course, some people would, perhaps, prefer to abolish the Congress altogether and institute a one-man government from now on. Some people have no patience with constitutions, for that matter. 
Mr. President, I yield to my colleagues.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I also thank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats, for their steadfast support of that in which they believed and concerning which we disagreed. 
I have, from time to time, found myself wrong in life, and I have learned some lessons in being wrong. But Senators Coats and McCain never faltered in their efforts. They were very worthy protagonists of their cause. I salute them, admire them, and respect them. 
Mr. President, if I may add just this: we should learn a lesson by this experience. We have a duty as Members of the Senate to support and defend the Constitution. Some of us read it differently, understand it according to our own lights differently, perhaps. 
We should understand that it is up to us to fight to preserve that Constitution, to protect it, to support it, to defend it. We should not pass off to the Supreme Court of the United States the duty that is ours as elected representatives of the people in this country--a duty which is ours, to study the Constitution, to study its history, the constitutional history of America, study the history of American constitutionalism, to study the history of England, to study the history of the ancient Romans, to study the colonial experience, to reflect upon the church covenants, to reflect upon the Bible and its teachings of that federation, the twelve tribes of Israel. We should do our very best to uphold that Constitution and again not to depend upon the Supreme Court of the United States to do our work. We should not hand off our responsibility to the Supreme Court. 
In this instance, I am proud of the Supreme Court. At no moment in my life have I ever been more proud of the Supreme Court of the United States than I am today. God save that honorable Court! 
I close, if I may, with the lines written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in `The Building of the Ship.' I think they are most appropriate for this occasion: 
Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! 
Sail on, O Union, strong and great! 
Humanity with all its fears, 
With all the hopes of future years, 
Is hanging breathless on thy fate! 
We know what Master laid thy keel, 
What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, 
Who made each mast, and sail, and rope, 
What anvils rang, what hammers beat, 
In what a forge and what a heat 
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope! 
For not each sudden sound and shock, 
'T is of the wave and not the rock; 
'T is but the flapping of the sail, 
And not a rent made by the gale! 
In spite of rock and tempest's roar, 
In spite of false lights on the shore, 
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! 
Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, 
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, 
Our faith triumphant o'er our fears, 
Are all with thee,--are all with thee!

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate adopted the amendment I submitted to S. 2057 that puts the Senate on record in opposition to the attempt being made to increase the number of military stores that sell wine and beer. Although alcohol is available for sale on military bases, it is not for sale in the commissary stores along with the groceries. Specifically, my amendment would prohibit the Secretary of Defense from conducting a survey of commissary patrons to determine whether or not they would support the sale of beer and wine in commissaries. In addition, the amendment would prohibit a demonstration project to evaluate the merit of selling wine and beer in commissary stores at exchange store prices. Mr. President, that is the wrong direction in which to take our military. We should be trying to deglamorize alcohol, not taking steps that tend to promote its use. An expansion of accessibility will likely lead to an increase in the military of all the problems that go hand and hand with alcohol use in civilian life; the negative health consequences, the loss of productivity, the cost to society, the increase in violence and crime, and the increase in sexually transmitted diseases. Why in the world would we want to embrace such a policy as expansion of access to alcohol as official government policy! Life in the military already has its share of stress--long hours, a rigid hierarchy of command, constant training, travel, and long deployments overseas. Let us not expand the opportunities to pour more fuel on any smoldering embers of alcohol abuse in our population and add to these stresses and strains. Let us keep our soldiers fit and sober, clear-headed and ready to defend our national security interests, and hope that such a policy sets an example which other entities in our society will embrace.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will have an amendment in the second degree. First, I will talk about my amendment. 
Mr. President, earlier this month, Secretary of Defense William Cohen announced a plan that he believes will improve initial entry training programs and policies of the U.S. military services. Secretary Cohen's plan will implement about 95 percent of the recommendations put forth by the Kassebaum-Baker panel. 
The 95 percent I refer to is not an exact mathematical term here. It is just a figure of speech to indicate that the great majority of the recommendations that were recommended by the Kassebaum panel will be put into effect. 
This was a panel 
directed to assess the current training programs and policies, with an eye to correcting the structural problems that had allowed truly scandalous situations to occur involving the harassment of female recruits. The membership of former Senator Kassebaum's panel was selected directly by Secretary Cohen himself. 
While many of the policies under the Secretary's plan are to be commended, debate has been brewing over 
those core recommendations that remain and that were not put into effect by Secretary Cohen. 
That deviation pertains to Secretary Cohen's support, in the face of the report of the Kassebaum Commission to the contrary, for continuing the practice of men and women undergoing basic training together, and allowing coed barracks. Not only does this stance counter specific recommendations made by the Kassebaum/Baker panel, but it counters legislative provisions approved by the House of Representatives. In my view, it also counters plain common sense. 
Similar to recommendations in the Kassebaum report, the House of Representatives' Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization Bill includes provisions that would require separate living facilities for men and women during basic training; prohibit after-hours access to barracks by the opposite sex, including drill sergeants; and separate training of men and women at the basic level. Senator Brownback yesterday offered an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill that would require separate barracks for men and women, and limit access to these barracks by members of the opposite sex. 
Secretary Cohen has announced that he is strongly opposed to the House provisions. But regardless of the Secretary's position in the debate, one looming fact remains: Sex scandals are plaguing our military training facilities. The papers are filled with headlines involving sexual misconduct in the services--misconduct involving extensive investigations and trials, and high-profile ends to military careers. This is a serious situation, a situation that, in all probability, must have negative ramifications for our overall national security. That is what we should be concerned about, not political correctness, not social engineering, not social theory, not social planning--not political correctness, but the military security of our country. That is why we have a military. 
While some may claim that most of the sexual misconduct is not occurring during basic training but during follow-on training programs, that claim misses the point. It is my opinion that day 1 of training is a good place to start--day 1. I strongly support a policy that directly states the rules and values of our military services to new recruits on day 1. This policy should clearly dictate to new recruits that the U.S. military is about service, honor, and integrity. 
The sad sagas in the press about sexual misconduct in the military and the sorry disrespect on the part of some members for the dignity of and the courtesies owed to other members of the military, including women recruits, can only serve to undermine the appeal of the U.S. military to our young men and women. 
If we want the brightest and the best recruits, we must be committed to ensuring that the U.S. military service delivers on its recruiting promises of outstanding career opportunities. The best and the brightest will demand no less. 
But that is only part of the issue, as far as I am concerned. While we must implement policies that attract cream-of-the-crop recruits and that carry through on the promise of providing them with world-class training, we must also remember that the objective of military service is the defense of the Nation. That is the objective of the military service. That is what it is all about. That defense, that security, must be the paramount aim of the Military Establishment. All other goals must be secondary to the goal of establishing the best fighting force that our Nation can field. 
I have grave concerns--particularly in light of the Kassebaum report--that our current policy is failing to keep its eye on that paramount concern. 
The Kassebaum panel stated: 
There is no more valuable military resource than its personnel, making training indisputably a top priority. 
The panel further noted: 
The principal objective of the military's training programs is to produce an effective, efficient, and ready force. In order to achieve this objective, the training programs must, first and foremost, emphasize and instill discipline. 
I heartily agree with those conclusions. And the Kassebaum report's recommendations supporting separate barracks for men and women during basic training, as well as calling for some same-gender platoons, seem to me to be in the best interest of the troops, as well as providing the right atmosphere for sound and serious training. I believe we need to do what is best for our national security and what is best for the men and women who join our military forces and whose very lives depend upon the quality of the training they receive. 
Mr. President, last year, I worked with Senator Kempthorne on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I joined with him on an 
amendment to the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill that created an independent blue-ribbon body to thoroughly examine, review, and evaluate the reasons for the ongoing number of sex scandals in training commands. This blue-ribbon panel is also chartered to examine fraternization and adultery issues. This panel has been created with unquestioned credentials. I believe that the report generated from this group will be a significant contribution to the body of work on gender policy. I regret that that report will not be completed until next year. And if its recommendations mirror, or reflect, those of Kassebaum-Baker, it is likely also to be ignored by the powers that be. 
I also favor the language included in the House of Representatives fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense authorization bill that provides for the separation of men and women in training at the basic level. Echoing my priority in this regard, the Kassebaum report concludes:  
. . . separating the recruits at the operational training unit level should provide a better environment for teaching military values, including professional relations. 
Again, the bottom line must be about ensuring that military service is a profession of service, honor, and integrity. Let us also remember this--let me say it again--the purpose of our Military Establishment, which costs us scores of billions of dollars, is to protect the national security of these United States, the security interests of the United States of America. 
Our military is not an equal employment opportunity commission. It does not exist to ensure perfect political correctness by responding affirmatively to the demands of this group or that interest group or some other interest group. It is the ultimate protector of the sovereignty of this mighty Nation and the ultimate protector of the freedoms of her people. That is quite a heavy responsibility and one that needs the most conscientious and vigilant attention to be adequately addressed. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a constructive first step towards cleaning up the mess in the military and putting some common sense back into the service training regime. I like the way the Marines do it. And I think we ought to take a page out of their book. 
Mr. President, I will have more to say possibly on this amendment. As of now, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the debate on the Brownback amendment yesterday some Armed Services Committee members observed that the Brownback amendment would adopt recommendations of the Kassebaum/Baker commission report by passing the Senate's own commission created last year. It was said that doing so makes a `mockery' of the Senate's own action, and wastes the time of the 10 members of the commission. 
Well, Mr. President, Secretary Cohen has flouted the recommendations of the Kassebaum/Baker report that he himself commissioned. He has promised to implement the easiest recommendations in that report while publicly repudiating its core recommendations. He has not waited for the Senate commission's report either. He got out in front of it. 
Senator Brownback's amendment, and the amendment that I have prepared, would say if you are in for a penny, you are in for a pound. If the report has merit--and Secretary Cohen has acknowledged that at least parts of it do have merit in his estimation--then we ought not to reject those parts of the report that do not seem politically correct. In fact, the Kassebaum/Baker report notes that `the committee has made recommendations regarding gender integration in training where appropriate, but has also made recommendations regarding the large number of other issues that we concluded have an impact on the effectiveness of the overall training program. It is the committee's intention that its recommendations be viewed as a complete package since training is a building-block process beginning with the quality of the recruit.' 
Other Members have reported the objections of senior military officials to the recommendations in the Kassebaum/Baker report. And they have stated their strong support for keeping mixed-gender training just the way it currently is. 
I would remind those officials and my colleagues that not so long ago the military trained women completely separately from men. It was only since the early to mid-1980's that the military began mixing the sexes during the early training phases. I believe, if I recall it correctly, that Army women were trained together at Fort McClellan, which is now closing as a part of the base realignment and closure process. 
The great social experiment of putting men and women together from day 1 in the training process is not, therefore, some hallowed military tradition. It is a policy, and if that policy gets in the way of a process that is designed to remold these undisciplined young individuals into focused disciplined soldiers, then we should not hesitate to change it. 
Our focus must be on national security--not political correctness; not social policy. And the basic safety and security of our recruits should not be compromised. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment may be temporarily laid aside so that others may call up other amendments.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Committee has accepted my amendment to provide greater oversight and accountability in those instances when the Secretary of Defense determines that U.S. troops would be best protected by the administration of investigational drugs in a wartime situation. Our forces increasingly face the threat of chemical and biological weapons being used on the battlefield. It may therefore be necessary, in order to protect them from these terrible weapons, to require them to take medicines and drugs to counteract or prevent these threats from being used to devastating effect. I think that we can all agree that the Secretary of Defense should take all reasonable precautions to protect U.S. troops in these situations, and that for a number of reasons, it may not be possible, wise, or safe to make public that decision by asking for the informed consent of each and every soldier, sailor, or airman before those preventative measures are administered. 
However, I believe that it is also reasonable to take steps to ensure that when the Department of Defense thinks a particular drug, either investigational or used in a new way, should be administered without the informed consent of the troops, that such a decision is vetted very carefully, and that such decisions are recorded. Therefore, my amendment adds a new and higher level of scrutiny to the waiver process. My amendment requires that the President, the Commander in Chief, concurs in the decision of the Department of Defense to administer such drugs. It puts the top civilian in charge of the military in the loop, and it requires that these decisions to administer drugs to our troops are reported to the Congress. 
Unfortunately, some examples from history, such as the exposure of troops to atmospheric atomic tests, and other examples of making U.S. military men and women `guinea pigs,' have left lingering concerns about leaving this decision making process entirely in the hands of the military. I hope that my amendment, by bringing civilian leaders and representatives of the people into the process, will allay concerns that U.S. troops will ever be given drugs for any reason other than to protect them from real and dangerous threats.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I respect the viewpoints of all of those who have spoken, those who are opposed to my amendment as well as those who have spoken in support of it. 
When I read and heard about the problems that were existing in the military, I stated publicly that I was going to seek, in the Armed Services Committee, to establish a commission to look into the matter. Whereupon, I am not implying that Mr. Cohen appointed his commission because I said that, 
but he did appoint the commission on his own, or indicated he was going to appoint a commission. 
I looked with some askance at a commission that would be appointed by the Secretary of Defense to look into this matter. So he proceeded to appoint that commission. I was surprised that he appointed Nancy Kassebaum-Baker as chairman of that commission. He appointed a good commissioner. 
So I had approached the matter by pushing for an amendment that would create a commission. Mr. Kempthorne and I joined in that. But I was suspicious of any commission that would be appointed within the administration by the Secretary of Defense--not that it was the particular Secretary of Defense, but I wanted to establish a fox to watch the chickens. 
As it turned out, the commission that the Secretary appointed was a good one. It made some excellent recommendations, but by then we had already decided to appoint our commission. 
Now, there are those who say we should wait on the commission that we appointed. The Kassebaum commission is a commission of high integrity. We know the former Senator who served from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum. We know that she was a great Senator of integrity and one who worked with high purposes. We all believed in her, and I believed in her commission. 
So I think that we ought not wait on the commission now that I helped to establish to keep an eye on the commission, that the Defense Secretary had indicated he was going to appoint. The Kassebaum commission has rendered its recommendations, and my amendment would put into effect the recommendations of the Kassebaum commission. My amendment would conform to the language of the House, the House language, so when the conferees go to conference, if my amendment is adopted, this will not be a question in conference because the Senate language will conform to the House language. 
So there are those who have urged that our colleagues vote against my amendment in order to preserve the integrity of the Senate commission on gender-integrated training, which will not issue its report until next year. Mr. President, I suggest to my colleagues that it is better to preserve the integrity of our Armed Forces and to preserve the integrity and safety of our young recruits. 
Let us not delay the process of implementing changes recommended by former Senator Kassebaum-Baker and the commission that she headed, a commission established by the Secretary of Defense. Let us not delay making changes that will improve the discipline, the teamwork, the cohesion of our military forces. Put these young recruits in separate barracks, train them separately until they have been instilled in the military discipline that will allow them to work together as strong, confident, and effective teams, and keep them focused on the job at hand. Let us not put this off for another year, waiting for the Senate commission to report. The Senate commission's purpose is not undermined by this action. It may make further recommendations regarding the problems faced today with mixed-gender training that the Secretary may want to adopt. 
It is also tasked with examining other areas, including fraternization policies in the various services which clearly, clearly, also merit review and possible change. There is plenty of work for the Senate commission still to do. The Senators have noted in their remarks that senior military officials all supported keeping mixed-gender training just the way it is. But our colleagues have failed to note that not all of our military services support mixed-gender training from day 1. The Commandant of the Marine Corps testified before the Armed Services Committee that the Marine Corps had decided to keep their basic training segregated. 
I think most of my colleagues would agree that the Marine Corps has arguably the greatest discipline, the greatest order, and the greatest unity cohesion of any branch of service. I think it is time that the other services model themselves after this successful example. 
I urge the adoption of my amendment.

Then it changed, and it continues to change. Now, the Secretary, in his letter, according to the quotation by Senator Levin, references `the mission.' Well, it is a moving target, that mission. That is one of the problems I have with this whole situation.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from Michigan as to his resolution. I agree with him on that. But from his reading of the benchmark items and the language that was in the President's report, it seems pretty clear to me that conditions that need to exist in order that we no longer keep our troops there are conditions that the President expects to be achieved before we remove our troops. 
And those conditions, as the distinguished Senator has pointed out, many of them are impossible within my lifetime, if I live to be as old as Abraham, that was 175 years; and if I live to be as old as Isaac, that is 180; if I live to be as old as Jacob, that is 147 years; if I live to be as old as Joseph, that is 110 years. So I have a pretty long while to go to make that. But sincerely, and seriously, I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments.

Mr. BYRD. I simply wanted to say to the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Michigan, I think I was the first to raise questions about benchmarks. In so doing, I did not mean to imply that I was against the amendment that Senator Thurmond has offered. I don't mean that at all. I just picked up on Senator Levin's reference to benchmarks and asked some questions about them. I intend to support the amendment. 
As to the distinguished Senator's reference to the military leaders, our military leaders, in part, helped to get us right where we are now. We were misled by some of our military leaders at the very beginning of the discussions concerning Bosnia. I have great respect for our military leaders, but I don't accept their word as having come down from Mount Sinai, as being engraved in stone. They listen to the President. They say whatever the President thinks. They all do. And very seldom will they venture to say something that isn't in accordance with the administration's viewpoint. 
I intend to say something about this subject matter later, but I wanted to wait to listen to what the distinguished Senator from Texas has to say first. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the original amendment by Senator Hutchison and myself does not set troop levels. 
The original amendment offered by Senator Hutchison and myself does not cut off money for the troops. 
The original amendment by Senator Hutchison and myself does not withdraw troops from Bosnia. 
The original amendment by Senator Hutchison and myself sets no termination date for withdrawal of American troops from Bosnia. It does not jerk the rug out from under our troops. 
The amendment which the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and I would have offered and may offer at another time on some bill provides that the President--the Commander in Chief, if you will--submit to Congress a report, a plan, no later than February 2, 1999, for reducing the military personnel of the United States in Bosnia to an average of the numbers of troops that Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany have in Bosnia, the other members of the contact group--an average--and that that reduction occur by February 2 of the year 2000. 
That is not setting troop levels. That is not withdrawing American troops. We are saying, `We'll stay there with you; we'll stay there, but it's about time that the other members of NATO take on a greater part of the burden.' After all, this situation has developed in their own backyard, not in ours. 
We are not saying we are going to withdraw. We are not suggesting that the money be terminated. We are not suggesting that American troops get out lock, stock, and barrel. We are simply saying that we should at least be able to reduce our troops, now that there is stability in Bosnia, we should be able to reduce our troop level to an average, we would say, of the troop numbers that are involved from the other members of the contact group. 
I think Great Britain has 5,000 involved. France has something like 2,500. Germany has something like 2,500. Italy has fewer. And we are saying to the President, `Now you submit us your plan--your plan. Submit us your plan, and you don't need to submit it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or next month. Submit it by February 2 of next year, just the plan. Tell us how you, Mr. Commander in Chief'--that magic term, that all-encompassing, worshipful term, `Commander in Chief'--`you tell us how you can get our troop levels down to an average of those of Great Britain and Germany and France and Italy, and by February 2 of the year 2000.' 
What is wrong with that? Is there someone here who would say to me that the Congress under the Constitution doesn't have a right or doesn't have a duty even to submit such an amendment calling on the Commander in Chief to do that? `Just let us have your plan, Mr. President. You have lots of time now. We're putting our allies on notice that we want our troop levels to be 
down to an average of what theirs are. It doesn't have to be an exact average. Certainly, instead of 7,000, it could be 3,500 by then, but we'll still be there with you.' 
What got us into this situation, Mr. President, I have heard it said that our military leaders, our generals, our Commander in Chief, have to make these decisions as to troop levels. I don't quarrel with that, but these are the same people, these are the same individuals--there may have been some changes since 1995 and 1996, perhaps some changes in the identity of the personnel in those respective positions, but it is the same administration that got us where we are, the same administration that misled the Congress, misled us into the belief that our troops would be there no longer than 1 year, roughly a year. 
We were told that. We were told that on the Armed Services Committee. The distinguished Senator from Indiana and the distinguished Senator from Michigan were there when the committee discussed this matter. That is what the administration told us, and the distinguished Senator from Indiana has set forth a litany of the dates and the things that were said in keeping with the idea that the United States would be involved there roughly only a year. He has done that for the record, and I consider that to be a service. That is what was there. 
They are the very people who misled us in the beginning. That is why some of us feel that we haven't been dealt with fairly from the beginning, and that it is about time that the administration come forward and give us some reliable statements, give us some reliable data upon which we can depend and the American people can depend. I don't think I have voted at any point against the funding or any authorization of troops in Bosnia. I don't think I have. I am going to check to make sure, but I was misled along with everybody else. 
I doubted, at the time, that the administration would have us out in a year. I was listening to the Commander in Chief through his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, through his Secretary of Defense, in their appearances before the Armed Services Committee. I listened. 
We took them at their word. You see where we are today. That was 1995, and now this is 1998. I just want to shed a little history for the record--for the record--not necessarily for all Senators. Some Senators probably know more about the record than I do. Certainly several of them are in a good position to remember as much about it as I can. 
But for the record, I want to state a little of the history of this situation. 
To begin with, in a nationally televised address on November 27, 1995, President Clinton justified dispatching U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of IFOR by saying U.S. engagement was needed to stop the great suffering caused by the war, to bring stability in Europe, a region vital to U.S. interests, and to maintain U.S. leadership in NATO. President Clinton said that the deployment would last--and I quote--`about one year.' 
In subsequent statements, administration officials asserted that U.S. forces would be out of Bosnia by the end of 1996. President Clinton decided on April 30, 1996, to keep U.S. forces in IFOR at full strength through the Bosnian election on September 14 in order to support the election process. He said the United States would maintain a robust force in Bosnia until IFOR's 1-year mandate expired on December 20, 1996. However, administration officials continued to insist that U.S. forces planned to leave Bosnia within a few weeks after December 20, 1996. 
On November 15, 1996, President Clinton said that the administration had agreed in principle to send U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of a new NATO-led peacekeeping force for Bosnia. President Clinton said the force would remain there until June 1998. 
Now, let me read that again. On November 15, 1996, President Clinton said the administration had agreed--the administration had agreed; did not say that Congress had agreed; the administration had agreed--in principle to send U.S. troops to Bosnia as part of a new NATO-led peacekeeping force for Bosnia. President Clinton said the force would remain there until June 1998. 
So there the administration had already changed their position. No longer was it said that we would be there about a year. Then it was said by the President that we would remain there until June 1998. 
On December 18, 1997, President Clinton announced that he had agreed in principle that U.S. forces should participate in a Bosnian peacekeeping force after the mandate of the current SFOR expires in June 1998. He did not set a new departure deadline, but said the force would leave only when key peace implementation milestones have been achieved. This follow-on force has been unofficially dubbed `deterrent force' or DFOR by some observers. So it went from IFOR, which was `intervention force'; to SFOR, which was `stabilization force'; to DFOR, which was `deterrent force.' 
Mr. President, this is the administration. It was they who said, in the beginning, that American forces would be in Bosnia for about 1 year. We took them at their word. But then, as time went on, the administration, the President, the Commander in Chief, set new dates. After all, Congress sometimes is faced with a very difficult situation. And that is what we are faced with. Things are more complicated than they were in 1787 at the time the Constitution was written. Things are very complicated. 
Here is what Congress is faced with. The administration uses the cloak `Commander in Chief' to put our men and women in foreign areas, in foreign countries where they are in danger; takes them away from their families, away from their loved ones, 
away from their hearthstones, away from their homes--puts them in foreign countries where they are in danger. They may never come back. They go, and they are there because the Commander in Chief sent them, whoever he is--it may be a Democrat or it may be a Republican. 
I respect the Commander in Chief, whoever he is, be it Mr. Reagan, be it Mr. Bush, be it Mr. Clinton. I respect that office. But our troops are sent overseas. Congress did not vote to send them overseas. We are told they will be there about a year. The year comes and the year goes; they are still there. Then we are told they will be there until June 1998. It is now June 1998, and June is about gone. 
Then we are faced, we in the Senate, we in the Congress are faced with the choice of providing money for the military that has been sent abroad. They did not ask to go abroad--these soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. They have been sent by the Commander in Chief. Then we are faced with the dilemma. 
The administration knew that when it told the Congress that our men and women would be there about a year. The administration knew that once they were there, Congress would be faced with a dilemma. And, of course, Congress--we are going to support our military people wherever they are. The administration knows that. They knew that back in 1995. We had our doubts on whether we were deliberately misled, the administration knowing that they could not do this within a year. How am I to know? 
Some of us are becoming aware of the fact that we have been dealt that hand more than once. We had the same hand dealt to us in Somalia--the same hand. And there have been other places as well. 
But I think this is why the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and I, and others, are just becoming a little distrustful of what the administration says about these matters. And we want to have a hand at the end of the leash. We want that constitutional leash to be there. The power of the purse, of course, is the most fundamental, the most basic, the greatest power in Government--the power of the purse. 
We want a hand at the end of the leash. We are not saying, you have to take the troops out. We are not saying, you have to set certain levels. We are just saying, as I indicated earlier, let us know by February 2, 1999, Mr. President, how you would suggest that we reduce those to a certain level that is more in keeping with what the other major parties are doing in Bosnia. And you reach that level by February 2, 2000. 
Now let me lay the predicate by reading into the Record what the Constitution says. Now, how much responsibility, how much power, how much authority does the Commander in Chief have? After all, the framers had in mind making doubly sure that the Commander in Chief was a civilian, not a military officer; and that this civilian, the President, would have the authority over the military. The framers were determined that a civilian would have supreme authority over the military. They placed that authority in the President. He would be the Commander in Chief. He would be superior to the military. It would not be a military officer who would be Commander in Chief. It had to be a civilian officer, selected by the people through electors who, in turn, would elect a President. A civilian would be the Commander in Chief. 
The framers were very jealous of that power. They knew the history of England. They knew that the King was the Commander in Chief and the admiral in chief and that the King in England raised armies and maintained navies, that the King in England declared war and declared peace, and that the King in England made the regulations for the governance of the Armed Forces. They were determined that no King would do that in this country. They were determined that no President would sit as a King in this country. 
The President, a civilian, was to be the Commander in Chief. 
Now, I want to read for the Record everything that is in this Constitution with respect to the powers of the President--the Commander in Chief--when it comes to the military. 
So I look to Article II of the United States. Here it is, Article II of the Constitution of the United States. `The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.' 
That sentence vests the executive power in one person, the President of the United States. It is just that simple. There is your separation of powers. 
Now, I want to read everything that is in this Constitution that has to do with the Commander in Chief and his power. Here we go. Section 2, Article II:  
The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; 
Now, who provides for the calling of the militia into the actual service of the United States? The Congress. I will read that a little later. The Congress provides for the actual calling of the militia into the service of the United States. 
Then in the second paragraph of section 2: 
He [meaning the President, the Commander in Chief] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur; 
In England, the king could make treaties, but the framers decided that that power in this country, under this Republic--it is not a democracy, it is a republic--under this Republic, would be shared between the President and the Senate. 
Continuing to read: 
and he [the President, the Commander in Chief] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors . . . [and other public officers]. 
So, there again, the King in the motherland from whom most of the Members came either directly or by their ancestors, the King appointed the officers. But in this Republic, the President can appoint them by and with the consent of the Senate. 
So that is a power that the framers decided to share. 
Now, there is one more phrase. 
Section 3, the President, the Commander in Chief, `shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.' 
Now, there it is, lock, stock, and barrel, every bit of it, all of it. There is the Commander in Chief's powers with respect to war. There it is. I have read all that the Constitution says regarding the Commander in Chief. 
He shall be Commander and Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States and of the militia of the several States when called into the full service of the United States; he shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice of the Senate shall appoint, ambassadors; and, finally, he shall commission all the officers of the United States. 
That is it. So the President is Commander in Chief. The Constitution doesn't say what his powers are as Commander in Chief. He is Commander in Chief of the Army and the Navy if Congress provides an Army and Navy for him to command. 
So much for the Commander in Chief. Now, let's read what the war powers of the Congress are, according to the Constitution. Here they are with regard to warmaking: 
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense . . . 
Section 8, the very first sentence. I will go ahead: 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . borrow money . . . 
The President doesn't have that power. 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . regulate Commerce with foreign nations . . . 
That is a very important power in peace and in war. 
Continuing, still, in section 8 of Article I of the Constitution: 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations . . . 
Continuing: 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water . . . 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years . . . 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide and maintain a Navy. 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces . . . 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for calling forth the Militia . . . 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress . . . 
Continuing in Article I, section 8; 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . exercise like Authority over all Places . . . for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards . . . 
The Congress shall have Power To . . . make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof. 
Including the Department of Defense, or officers thereof, which includes the Secretary of Defense. 
So there you are. Then in Article I, section 9: 
No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . . . 
Congress makes the law. So I have taken the time of the 
Senate--and Senators have been very kind to listen--to read into the record that which any Member of the Congress, or any individual, can at any time he or she wishes to read for himself or herself from the Constitution of the United States. All of the authority of the Commander in Chief is there in the Constitution. That is all. And all of the authority is there in that Constitution for the Congress, when it comes to warmaking. 
From my reading of those portions of the Constitution, it appears to me that Congress has the authority and the duty, on behalf of the people from whom all power comes, in whom all power resides, under this Constitution--Congress has the responsibility and the duty to ask questions and to make laws, and to make appropriations, and to draw lines in the sand. Yes; Congress has the authority there to decide overall troop levels. One will find that most of the lawmaking powers, most of the authority and the powers that deal with the military forces and with military actions, rest in the Congress of the United States. Don't blame me for that. You are not arguing with me, you are arguing with the Constitution. I have read the pertinent parts of the Constitution into the Record.

Mr. BYRD. No. It states specifically that the President, the Commander in Chief, shall submit to the Congress the plan by February 2, 1999, which will bring the force levels of the United States in Bosnia down to a certain number which is more in keeping with the numbers that are provided by Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain. 
Is there anything unfair about that? 
We don't say it has to be 2,000, or 2,500, or anything like that.

Mr. BYRD. What is wrong with that? We are saying to the President, `You tell us how you would get it down to something which, in the eyes of the American people, who are paying the taxes to keep our forces over there, would be a fair level in view of the fact that we have carried most of the burden thus far. We have helped stabilize the situation. Why isn't it fair?' But let the President tell us how he would go about doing it and bring it down more in keeping with what the other leading countries of NATO are providing.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. In the first place, the courts might do the interpreting at some point. 
Second place: Read the Constitution. Congress has power over the purse strings. 
I hope the Court will decide that the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional. I hope it will do that before it goes out for its recess. 
Congress having the power over the purse, Congress having the power to declare war, Congress having the power to raise and support armies, having the power to provide and maintain a navy, having the power to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces, having the power to provide for calling forth the militia. 
It would seem to me that a reading of the Constitution would indicate that the basic power, the power of the purse, is the basic, fundamental, rock bottom power in this Government. There is no greater power. There is no power as great as the power of the purse. That is vested here. 
It would seem to me that a reading of this Constitution would indicate that Congress has more power and authority under the Constitution than many Senators are willing to admit.

Mr. BYRD. The Senator says at what point does Congress have that. Congress before, before it provides for calling forth the militia, before it creates an army, before it creates a Navy, it certainly has the power and authority not to do those things; it has the power to issue regulations. I am not suggesting that the Congress ought to try to get into the nitty-gritty, teensy-weensy little details of this and that. Of course, there has to be one person who can command the military forces of this country.

Mr. BYRD. I am saying the Congress has not done its duty, and I am taking my responsibility along with others. We have not done our duty. Congress has the responsibility not to follow along after the President like my little dog Billy follows after me. The Commander in Chief is just a man like I am. I respect the Presidency. I respect the President of the United States. I have never served under any President--that is the way I look at being a Senator--but he puts his britches on just like I do, one leg at a time. No more. And he is there for 4 years, unless the House impeaches him. He can't impeach us, but the House can impeach and we can convict him and take him out of that office, and we can also provide that he can never again hold an office. 
I am not one who bows down to the President, who bows down to any Commander in Chief. I am not one who believes we have to do what the Commander in Chief says, but I respect the Commander in Chief. I haven't cast a vote, I don't think, against our having personnel in Bosnia. I haven't done that. But I am certainly not one who says that Congress has to follow the Commander in Chief. 
Now, if the Commander in Chief is ever a Republican again, I daresay there won't be as many people on that side who will stand up and challenge his powers as I stand up and challenge the powers of a Democratic President. As far as I am concerned, under this Constitution there is no Democrat; there is no Republican. He is the President of the United States. He is in there for 4 years, and that is it, unless he is reelected. 
I have been here for 40 years. I hope to be here 40 years 
more, if the Good Lord lets me live that long. But don't look at this Senator and say I am picking on the President. I am not picking on the Commander in Chief. I am simply saying that we here in the Congress have not stood up to our duties under this Constitution. And I do not read under this Constitution where we have to follow any President lock, stock, and barrel, line, hook and sinker. We do not have to do that. We can set a line, and we can say `this far and no farther. If you want to keep our troops in Bosnia longer, come back, Mr. Commander in Chief, come back and we will decide whether or not we want to open the purse strings and provide more appropriations.'

Mr. BYRD. The Senator apparently doesn't believe the Congress has the authority to do what the Hutchison-Byrd amendment would require. I hope he does. I think it does. 
Congress can limit troops by limiting funds for missions. No one questions that. There is great reluctance to placing limits on missions. But when we come to a place where an administration doesn't level with the Congress, then it is about time that the Congress thought about putting some limits on missions, and Congress has the constitutional authority to do it. Don't think it doesn't. I have been around here for 40 years in this Senate and 6 years in the other body, and as far as I am concerned I am getting a little tired of Presidents and Commanders in Chief and their administrations misleading Congresses. This isn't the first time it has been done. It has been done before. 
Madam President, I think I have said about everything already that I have in my prepared remarks. I have read the pertinent parts of the Constitution that deal with the Commander in Chief's war powers and the war power and authority that rests with Congress. I do not say this disrespectfully towards our Commander in Chief. I would say the same if he were Republican. The Constitution is not partisan. I hope that we can be able to agree on some legislation--and it is extremely difficult under the circumstances--particularly in regard to the situation we have in the Balkans. And I agree with the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison. In my own mind, I can keep separate the circumstances and conditions that we face in regard to Bosnia from those which we might have to face in Kosovo. 
I don't understand what our security interests are in relation to Bosnia. But I do understand what our security interests can be when it comes to Kosovo. I think Congress has to recognize it has a duty here, not just to let the administration do whatever it alone thinks best. And I think we owe the President that kind of consideration. I would hope that we could come out with some kind of proposal, certainly in the long run, that would clearly state what the exit strategy is or what the limitations are, what is the deadline, what are the phases by which we reduce our forces. 
I do not have the magic bullet. I don't claim that the Hutchison-Byrd amendment has the magic bullet. I have taken the time at this point to quote the pertinent provisions of the Constitution for the Record, Madam President. I don't claim to add to them or to subtract from them. Here they are. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of corrections in the Record of Friday, June 19. 
In the middle column on page S. 6661, where I quote Tennyson, the Record indicates that I quoted Tennyson as saying, `I am a part of all that I have met, and we are all a part of each other.' 
Mr. President, only the first clause is an accurate quote by Tennyson. The second clause was an editorial comment of my own. It should not be included in Tennyson's quote. So I ask unanimous consent that in the permanent Record Tennyson's quote as quoted by me read, `I am a part of all that I have met,' and take out the quotation mark at the end of the sentence which appears in the Record in the middle column. 
The next correction I should like to make is in the same speech, the same page, S. 6661, middle column. I am quoted as saying, `The Bible says, `see us now a man diligent in his business; he shall stand before kings.' 
That is a misquote. I did not say, `See us now.' I said, `Seest thou.' `Seest thou a man diligent in his business; he shall stand before kings.' 
I ask unanimous consent that that correction be made in the permanent Record. Sometimes in talking I sound like I have my mouth full of turnips, and I am sure it is hard for the Official Reporters to catch the diction correctly. So I ask that those corrections be made.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on June 20, 1863, in the midst of the great Civil War, in which father fought against son and brother fought against brother, a new star in the constellation that we see on that flag was born. It was the 35th star. The great State of West Virginia became a separate government. Its motto, quite appropriate, considering the history of its birth, is `Montani semper liberi'--`Mountaineers are always free.' And so I salute my State on its birthday, which will be on tomorrow, as I said; 1863-1998, 135 years, its 135th birthday. Happy Birthday, West Virginia! 
Mr. President, I invite my friends in the Senate to visit West Virginia. When I was in the State legislature, 52 years ago, we had only 4 miles of divided four-lane highways. Think of it--4 miles of divided four-lane highways in all of West Virginia, 52 years ago. 
Then commenting on that fact was Raul Tunley, writing in the Saturday Evening Post of February 6, 1960, when he said, with reference to West Virginia's highway system, that it was not to be compared with the highway systems of its neighboring States. His exact words were `Its [highway system] is decades behind that of its neighbors.' That was 1960. I was in the Senate at that time, and those words were seared on my memory. `Its highway system is decades behind that of its neighbors.' 
Well, Mr. President, come to West Virginia now. Many times I have stopped in hotels and motels in West Virginia. I have met travelers from other States, tourists who have come to West Virginia to see its majestic mountains, its viridescent hills and its iridescent sunsets, and they have commented to me, glowingly, upon our highways, the highways that we now have in West Virginia, the State which Raul Tunley disparagingly wrote about in 1960, saying that `Its highway system is decades'--not years --`decades behind that of its neighbors.' 
Well, Mr. President, we in West Virginia welcome visitors from other States. I trust that Senators at one time or another will have traveled in West Virginia, and that they will have met its fine citizens and tested their hospitality and seen the beauties of nature, all of God's creation, in those mountains. 
I have visited over 800 of the 1,000 post offices in West Virginia. So I have had an opportunity to get up the hollows and visit up the creeks and over the hills and in the mountains. I have had an opportunity to see much of West Virginia by virtue of my travels. 
And interestingly, Mr. President, West Virginia's post offices, the names of communities and places in West Virginia, tell many stories. If you travel through West Virginia, you can go from Acme to Zenith, from Pax to War. You can sample Justice, Independence and Liberty without leaving your car, and you can drive in Harmony or Confidence, or, if traffic is bad, in Shock. You may even choose to settle in New Era or perhaps in Paradise. Maybe Friendly or Hometown is where you want to sink your roots. 
On the other hand, Odd may suit your fancy, if Looneyville, Pickle Street, Pinch, Droop, or Left Hand fail to meet your requirements. These are all place names in West Virginia--towns, cities, and small communities whose names still reflect the hopes and humors of those who settled my quirky but wonderful home state. 
Some of these new inhabitants clearly had been elsewhere, or perhaps had missed the homes they left behind, for the map of West Virginia reads like a world atlas. You can tour the sights of Athens, Belgium, Cairo, Turkey, Ireland, London, Rangoon, Shanghai, Waterloo, Medina, Vienna, Congo, Glasgow, Ghent, and Genoa without a passport--without crossing more than a county line! You could even Tango in Montecarlo. You can see much of the United States as well, including Auburn, Augusta, Bismark, Cleveland, Miami, Dallas, Newark, Denver, Washington, and Wyoming. And if these big cities overwhelm you, the lower key attractions of Minnie, Little, or Peewee might be soothing, but if your dreams and fantasies are truly wondrous, then Cinderella--Cinderella, Cinderella--is the place for you. 
Some names are more evocative of the settlers' beautiful and wild new surroundings, such as Grassy Meadows, Green Valley, Clear Creek, Deepwater, Lake, Limestone, Shady Spring, Cold Stream, Coldwater, Three Forks, Falling Waters, and even Falling Rock. 
And speaking of Three Forks, West Virginia's schoolchildren are good in math. When I was a boy, we had the old spelling matches and the arithemetic matches on Friday afternoons. So we are good in math. So there is Onego, there is Two Run, there is Three Forks, there is Three Mile, Three Churches, there is Four Mile, Four States, Five Forks, and Six and even Hundred. 
Speaking of falling rock, 
in fact, rocks figure rather prominently in my state of old mountains. West Virginia communities include, simply, Rock, as well as Rock Camp, Rock Castle, Rock Cave, Rock Creek, Rock Oak, Rockport, Rockcliff, Rockford, Rock Gap, Rock Lick, Rock Valley, and Rock View, in addition to the more flavorful Salt Rock. And of course the trees and animals are not to be overlooked, trees and animals discovered by the settlers are also recorded on the maps--Apple Grove, Birch River, Oak Hill, Paw Paw, Piney View, Willow Island, Beaver, Bob White, Pidgeon, Buffalo, Panther, Wildcat, Deerwalk, Trout, Pike, Wolfcreek--Wolfcreek Hollow is where I spent my boyhood years--Elk Garden, Crow, Duck, and of course, as was already mentioned, Turkey, West Virginia. I am proud to say that in West Virginia, sites as pristine and beautiful as those discovered over two centuries ago can still be savored by today's generations. I proudly offer the spectacular chasm of the New River Gorge, the monumental beauty of Seneca Rocks, the ecological rarity of Dolly Sods, the unique variety and interest of Canaan Valley, 
where, when I was minority leader, I took all of the democratic Senators there on a weekend for meetings. Sometimes these meetings are called retreats. I think I was the first Senate leader to take Members of the Senate to retreats and especially to the choice, unique retreat, sui generis, in Canaan Valley, WV. 
There are the scenic and historic virtues of Harpers Ferry at the confluence of two famous rivers--the gentle Shenandoah and the mighty Potomac. The Potomac River rises where? In the highlands of West Virginia. This is just a short list of West Virginia's many natural treasures. 
Of course, West Virginia and King Coal were once nearly synonymous, and the importance that mining played in the life and economy of early West Virginia is also evident in her place names. Alloy, Coalburg, Coal City, Coalfield, Coal Fork, Coal Mountain, Coalton, Coalwood, Coketon, Colliers, Lead Mine, Montcoal, Nitro, Petroleum, and Vulcan, West Virginia, all clearly pay homage to the valuable natural treasure that underlies West Virginia's beauty. 
Romance--Shakespeare--had he lived in a later time--may have been thinking of Romance, WV, when he wrote `Romeo and Juliet.' Romance has its place as well, both as a community and in the affection of the early settlers for their lady loves, enshrined in countless communities named after them, from Alice and Rachel and Sarah to Minnie and Dollie and Naoma, West Virginia. But some of the most interesting place names relate to the concern that our forebears had to pay to the weather and atmospheric conditions in those days before electricity, central heating, and air conditioning. Ah, what a world it was! West Virginia has towns named Cyclone, Hurricane, Mt. Storm, Skygusty, Tornado, Sun, Twilight, Snowflake, Frost, Mud, and Windy. Clearly, El Nino is not the only weather phenomenon to etch a name for itself in people's memories. 
If West Virginia had much to offer those who ventured into her steep mountains, followed her coursing streams in those early days, she has so, so much more to offer the world today. Instead of 4 miles of four-lane, divided highways, as in 1947, she today has 900 miles of four-lane, divided highways. In addition to her stunning good looks, this lady State of the mountains offers the brawn, the brain, and the talents of her hard-working and thoroughly modern populace. 
In towns and cities dotted with institutions of higher learning, West Virginia produces the intellectual firepower to combine with the fabled brute strength of her coal miners, her `John Henrys' of old. The transportation system, including the interstate highways and connectors, rail, air, and even river routes, is increasingly interconnected and modern. For those who do not wish to transport goods or to commute in traffic, West Virginia offers an extensive fiberoptic telecommunications network that allows today's cyber workers to combine high-technology jobs with an uncrowded pastoral setting--imagine that, an uncrowded pastoral setting; how majestic, how beautiful West Virginia seems--a low crime rate, and great family life. 
By this fall, West Virginia will even boast eight distance learning nodes, allowing her citizens to maintain and expand their high-technology edge. In West Virginia, you can surf a standing river wave in a brightly colored kayak or surf the net through a computer modem. 
Well, Mr. President, may I say to my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, I have spent my career in public service, and the underlying theme of that half-century of labor is one of nurturing the infrastructure that will allow the natural talents of West Virginia's people to flourish, providing the support and encouragement for West Virginians of all ages to come, come to West Virginia, come to seek a good education, and the necessary transportation links and other services to attract businesses to the State so that these skilled and devoted sons and daughters of the mountains might remain close to home. 
While my work has required that I spend much of my time away from the hills and hollows of my youth, I cherish every report of new businesses choosing to establish themselves in West Virginia and West Virginia companies adding jobs and products to their operations in the State. These reports mean that my dreams for West Virginia are coming true, that the dream of so many West Virginians to remain in West Virginia and to raise new generations of mountaineers is becoming a reality. I see that energy and optimism throughout the State as new opportunities, new roads, and new buildings rise alongside the gentle reminders of the great and historic legacy of West Virginia's earlier settlers. It is, after all, proof that Confidence and Paradise can still be found in West Virginia, not far from Prosperity in Raleigh County, WV. 
So, Saturday, June 20, is the 135th birthday of West Virginia's establishment as the 35th star in the constellation on our national flag. I know that God's blessings have shone down on her people, on her mountains, on her green hills, and on her green valleys, and that I have been blessed to be a part of securing for her a bright future. 
Happy birthday, West Virginia, and best wishes to you always! Montani semper liberi--mountaineers are always free! Mr. President, take that message to China: Mountaineers are always free.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Sunday, June 21, Americans will take time to honor the Nation's fathers. The Bible tells us to `honor thy father and thy mother.' But at times, fathers have received less public attention and appreciation than mothers. Mother's Day, after all, has been recognized on a continuing basis since 1914, while Father's Day has only been an official holiday for a little over 25 years. 
Mr. President, my State has a proud, though little noted, role in the history of Father's Day. According to the American Book of Days, Fairmont, WV, held a church service honoring fathers in July 1908. The idea did not begin to catch on, however, until a woman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd launched a campaign the following year to establish a day celebrating fatherhood. A resident of Spokane, WA--one of Washington's diligent, able, and respected Senators presently presides over the U.S. Senate--Mrs. Dodd reportedly wanted to honor her own father, a widower who raised her and her five brothers by himself on a farm in eastern Washington State. As I mentioned, a Senator from Washington State is presiding over the Senate, Senator Slade Gorton. He is the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate and is one of the most knowledgeable Members on the subject matter of that subcommittee. He is an excellent chairman. But we are talking today about a lady from his State, the State which he so honorably represents, the State of Washington. 
Thanks to Mrs. Dodd's efforts, the first official Father's Day was held in Spokane on June 19, on the third Sunday in June 1910. President Woodrow Wilson, who fathered three daughters, and President Calvin Coolidge, who had two sons, endorsed the concept of Father's Day, and various Congresses considered different resolutions making Father's Day an official holiday. 
Finally, in 1972, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law a bill making Fathers' Day a national holiday. 
I remember as a child watching my stepfather, my uncle, who was the only dad I ever knew, Titus Dalton Byrd. I remember watching him set forth to toil in the mines, a hard way to make a living, no future, sometimes $2 a day, working in the black bowels of the Earth, in water holes, under mountains of rocks overhead, loading coal. I saw him set forth to work. I suspect that much of what I have achieved in life can be traced to the example of patience, tireless diligence, that he set for me. 
He was a poor man, a humble man, a quiet man. I never heard him use God's name in vain in all my days with him. And when he left this world, he left owing no man a penny. He was an honest, hard-working man, one who accepted his lot in life without complaint. I never in my life saw him sit down at the table--no matter how meager, how humble, the fare--and utter the slightest complaint, never a complaint about mom's cooking, although she was an excellent cook, never a complaint. He never complained about anything. 
Like so many children with their fathers, I continue to be indebted to that man, one of the greatest men that I have ever known in life. And I have known a lot of so-called great men, statesmen, leaders, Senators, Governors, shahs, kings, princes. My dad was a truly great man, great because he symbolized the great things in life: honesty, integrity, respect for his neighbor, love for his God, faith in his country. He loved his family. He loved me. 
I shall always be indebted to him for teaching me by his conduct the virtuous and proper path to take in life, not that I have always followed that path. But if a parent will ingrain these principles in his children, the child may from time to time wander from the righteous path, but in time he will return because the old lessons, the old verities, the eternal values, taught and inculcated into the minds of the children, will always, always remain and will become a part of that life and a part of the next generation. 
The Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes, chapter 9, 10th verse, `Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.' That old dad taught me that. And I took the maxim seriously because he took it seriously. He worked hard, very hard. 
Senators can't know it unless they lived in the mining towns. They can't know the hard drudgery, the discouraging life of the coal miner and his family. 
And my old dad always strove to do his very best, no matter how simple or unexciting the job in the mines. Many men's lives--my neighbors, my friends, fathers--depended in a very literal sense upon the quality of each other's work and upon the carefulness of each other's work. A careless lighting of a match might snuff out the lives of the fathers of hundreds of children. Think of Monongah, WV, where more than 300 lives were taken in one day by an explosion, an explosion in a mine. 
I recall now how late in the afternoon I would go out on the porch and look up the railroad tracks and wait for my uncle, my dad. I never lived with my natural father. My mother died with the influenza epidemic in 1918. I lacked just a few days being 1 year old. I never lived with my father after the day she died. And I never saw him during the next 15 years, and then I was able only to visit with him 1 week. That was my natural father. I had three brothers and a sister, but only recently did I learn that I had a fourth brother, who died at childbirth. 
I grew up in the hands of these wonderful, wonderful people, this old couple who had had one child before I was born. He died of scarlet fever. This old couple took me on my mother's leaving this earthly life. And they brought me from North Carolina to West Virginia. So this was my dad. This was my mom. I have no recollections of my natural mother. 
But these were the people who raised me. They didn't have much, but they had love for me. I never heard them quarrel at any time in their 53 years of marriage. Not a quarrel did I ever hear. My wife and I have been married 61 years. I can't say we haven't had a few spats. But my old mom used to say, `One thing you must remember, both of you, don't you both get mad at the same time.' When one gets mad, the other shouldn't get mad. The other shouldn't say anything. Just sit down, be quiet. So that was her recipe, and it worked. 
I used to look up the railroad tracks and wait for my dad to return from his day in the mines, swinging his dinner bucket beside him. I treasured my time with him. He encouraged me to read, to draw, and to learn music. Like so many fathers, he wanted me to have a better life than he had had. He set about encouraging my interests and in building my confidence. 
I suspect that many of my colleagues learned to throw a ball or to fly a kite under the tutelage of their fathers. Fathers played such an integral role in many of the memories that many of us have of our childhood. We picture those fathers tending the weekend barbecue, fork in one hand and a plate of hot dogs or hamburgers in the other, sitting patiently in the stands of the Little League ball game cheering our successes, consoling us afterwards about our less than successful efforts; or teaching us with a mixture of stern caution and warm affection how to drive the family car. That is not an experience or memory of mine. But I know that it is with many others. Such moments are as precious as pearls, and we string them together in our minds to make a beautiful necklace of memories. 
Fathers can be stern, of course, but what father is more worthy than the one who selflessly serves as a garden stake for his young child? 
I grow a few tomato plants, and I always have a stake to hold those tomato plants until they are strong enough that they can climb and make it with the help of still larger stakes. 
So, what father is more worthy than the father who serves as a garden stake for his child, using his own example to encourage the tender young sapling to grow up straight and to grow tall? Good fathers are like good gardeners. They prepare the soil carefully and they coddle the seedlings before handing them off and planting them in the soil of life. And, even then, they weed out the bad influences, prune the bad habits, support and train the tender shoots with discipline and order and fertilize with affection. 
Let me close, Mr. President, with a short poem by Grace V. Watkins entitled, `I Heard My Father Pray.'  
Once in the night I heard my father pray. 
The house was sleeping, and the dark above 
The hill was wide. I listened to him say 
Such phrases of devotion and of love, 
So far beyond his customary fashion, 
I held my breath for wonder. Then he spoke 
My name with tenderness and such compassion. 
Forgotten fountains in my heart awoke. 
That night I learned that love is not a thing 
Measured by eloquence of hand or tongue, 
That sometimes those who voice no whispering 
Of their affection harbor love as strong, 
As powerful and deathless as the sod, 
But mentioned only when they talk with God. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may again claim the floor just for 2 or 3 minutes, I thank the senior Member of this body for his preeminently gracious and charitable remarks. 
There is a place named Thurmond in West Virginia. It is down on the New River, and it is a very historic place, an old railroad town. There was a poker game there that continued for several years. I have heard various stories about this poker game that lasted 7 years. Some said it lasted 10, 11 or 12 years. It was evidently a long, long time in its existence. 
Thurmond is just a small town now--not to be called even 
a town. But I am very proud that Senator Thurmond of South Carolina has reminded me of Thurmond, WV. I hope Senators will travel through Thurmond at some point. It is on one side of the river, and on one side of the railroad tracks. One can see the beautiful mountain peaks on each side. 
I thank the Senator, too, for his services to his State and to his country. If one reads his biography, one will find that he is truly a remarkable Senator who has led an extraordinary and remarkable political career, a career in public service. He honors me with his kind words, and I am thankful to the divine hand that guides us all for having let me live and serve in this body with Strom Thurmond now for 40 years. I am grateful for my friendship with him and most appreciative of his kind words this morning. 
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may just comment briefly, Tennyson said, `I am a part of all that I have met, and we are all a part of each other.' I am a part of Carl Levin. Carl Levin is a part of me. I am proud to serve in this body with Carl Levin, Senator Levin. He is a man who when he studies a bill, studies it with infinite care, dissecting each comma and period, semicolon, colon, each word, each phrase. 
The Bible says, `See us now a man diligent in his business; he shall stand before kings.' Senator Levin is a man with diligence and ability, and I am proud to know him, proud to serve with him. He is the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee on which I serve with Senator Warner, who is the ranking member on the Republican side. I thank him. He has always been very generous, very kind, very thoughtful to me. And I hope to predict that within just a few weeks he will join me in lauding the Supreme Court of the United States for holding that the Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional. He has fought that battle with me, and I hope we are able to join in triumph as Roman Emperors on that great day. May it come.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nebraska allow me to respond just briefly to the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner? I want to express my gratitude to him for his very lavish and profuse words with respect to me. He shares with us great riches, as we enjoy his friendship and work with him. I look upon him as a great American. He is on the Armed Services Committee, a former Member of a President's Cabinet--Secretary of the Navy. He has demonstrated by his patriotism and public service the kind of service that we should try to emulate. 
I thank him very much for his kind words. They mean much to me.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. This is a bill that addresses many of our Nation's most critical water infrastructure requirements, as well as important energy research functions, and management of our nuclear waste and environmental remediation programs. This bill is also a component of our national security portfolio, due to the atomic weapons production programs of the Department of Energy that are funded in this bill. 
In approving the recommendations of the subcommittee, the committee has reported a bill that does an excellent job of balancing the many competing demands which fall within the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. I wish to commend the subcommittee chairman, Senator Domenici, for all his hard work in crafting the bill brought before the Senate, together with his very able counterpart, Senator Reid. While both of these Senators come from the arid west, where the water management issues are very different from the challenges facing other regions of the country, they have been very responsible in trying to maintain critical investments in flood control and navigation and irrigation, while also ensuring that our energy research and nuclear waste management and weapons production responsibilities are met. 
Their task was made particularly difficult this year by the disgraceful budget request for Fiscal Year 1999 put forward by the administration for the Army Corps of Engineers. Despite strong support for an aggressive Corps construction program from both sides of the aisle and all regions of the country, the administration proposed a significant reduction in spending for Corps construction--some $689 million, or 47 percent, below last year's funding level. 
This budget gap created a huge hole that needed to be filled, and I commend our committee chairman, Senator Stevens, for his sensitivity to the challenges presented to the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee by the President's request. Senator Stevens knows all too well the value and need for critical infrastructure investments that will help communities enhance their economic opportunity. I was pleased to join with the chairman in recommending a 302(b) allocation to the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee which was substantially above the President's request and above a freeze for the non-defense discretionary portion. Nonetheless, the requests for funding far exceeded the subcommittee's allocation. 
Nearly every state had ongoing water projects that the Corps expressed a capability of being able to execute at a program level far in excess of the President's request. So to try and maintain ongoing projects, as well as to protect investments, funding was added to many of these projects. The costs associated with the administration's short-sighted proposal were considerable. Not only would there have been increased costs due to the additional time it would have taken to complete projects, but there would also have been considerable contract termination costs associated with ending or reducing work that had been initiated recently. 
So I commend the subcommittee members for their fine work. Their responsiveness to local concerns will mean a great deal to the communities in my state that were on the short end of the administration's budget. In places like Marmet, the Greenbrier Basin, and the Tug Fork Valley, where people have been waiting years for assistance from the Federal government to improve upon flood control and enhance navigation channels that feed our economy, this bill will be of great assistance. I have seen the mud, muck, and misery that accompany flooding when the waters rise in the creeks and streams and rivers that flow through the mountains of West Virginia. Some criticize these types of projects. I contend that they are critical to improving the lives and enhancing the safety of our constituents. 
Mr. President, as is true with most appropriations bills, not every Senator has 100 percent of his or her priorities addressed fully. That is the very essence of compromise and balance, which are at the center of what it takes to produce an acceptable, and signable, appropriations bill. The President, in gutting the Corps' construction program, proposed significant increases to programs favored by the administration. But every Senator should be clear that, to pay for those increases, the President proposed reductions in funding requested for flood protection and other water infrastructure development. I commend Senator Domenici and Senator Reid for trying to maintain stability across the multitude of programs funded in this bill. 
Finally, I wish to acknowledge the very fine work done on this appropriations bill by the majority and minority staff of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee--Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Greg Daines, Liz Blevins, Lashawnda Leftwich, and Sue Masica. There are many details associated with all of the water projects and energy research items in this bill, and this team does an excellent job of serving not only Senators Domenici and Reid, but also all other Senators.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it seems that concern with so-called `political correctness' has been elevated to a near religion in recent years. 
I thought it might be well to speak on this subject this afternoon when we are not overly busy with other matters. I am sure it is a subject on which not everyone will agree with me. But that doesn't necessarily concern me. I feel that I have something to say, and I am going to say it at this point. 
It seems, I say, that concern with so-called `political correctness' has been elevated to a near religion in recent years. Well, I have long been puzzled by the doctrine, if it may be termed as such, the doctrine of political correctness. When it comes to benefits of this overtly patronizing assault on thought patterns and contemporary speech, I have to admit that I guess I just don't get it. 
It has always seemed to me that one of the intrinsically valuable things about America is its `melting pot' aspect. I heard about the melting pot when I was a boy, and there have been many, many, many valuable aspects of the melting-pot policy. 
The phenomenon of American life and culture has been its uncanny ability to absorb a reasonable number of people from all around the globe of different races, religions, nationalities, abilities and talents, and inspire them to embrace the ideals of freedom, and work toward the common good of the Republic, without destroying their individuality. 
But today's trendy, misguided urge to vigorously emphasize in contemporary thought, and speech, not the value and worth of individual difference, but merely the inoffensive security of `sameness' seems to be going against the time-honored grain that has facilitated the successful achievement of a richly diverse, yet united nation. 
The gross, linguistic overreaching for the goal of being perfectly politically correct that goes on in most public discussions, both written and spoken, is not only insultingly gratuitous, but, at times sublimely ridiculous as well. It is as if everyone who writes or speaks in the public arena today is making a concerted and rather forced effort to banish from the face of the Earth the obvious differences in gender, race, religion and genetic codes inherent in all human beings through the clumsy device of disavowing verbally all dissimilarities. And the results are often either humorous or downright sad. 
In order to avoid offending anyone in anyway we have come up with such linguistic acrobatics as Chair or Chairperson to replace chairman. 
When I think of the Chair there in the front of the Chamber, I think of the position. I address the Chair. I am thinking of the position. But the person who is in the chair is not a chair. He is not a piece of wood; he is not a piece of furniture; he is the chairman. 
Well, one may say what if it is not a `he,' what if it is a lady? Then I would say `Madam Chairman.' I would still refer to the person as the chairman. That has been the case for centuries --eons of time. And here in this latter part of the 20th century we have decided we have to change all that. So, I don't think of the distinguished Senator from Ohio, who presently presides over the Senate in a very dignified and efficient way--I don't think of him as a piece of wood. If I would refer to him personally, I would not call him `the Chair.' I would just as soon that nobody referred to me as a piece of wood, as a `chair.' I was the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. If we want to address the Chair, that is the position. I have no problem with that. But don't refer to me as `the Chair.' I may object to it. 
I see letters that come to my office with reference to the `chair.' And I have told my staff, when you respond to such a letter, you should use the word `chairman.' Don't use the word `chair.' I am not going to get in that parade and go down that road, falling into that pothole of `political correctness.' 
So, we have come up with other linguistic acrobatics, in order to replace any reference to skin color other than white; and Native American to replace American Indian. Well, I am a native American. I was born in North Carolina. If I am not a native American, of what country am I a native? I am a native American. I have no problem with referring to the Indians as `original' Americans. But when they are referred to as `Native' Americans, I think that is demeaning to the Indians. I am a native American. But I don't pretend to be an original American--the American Indian. 
Some day, in the misty future when political correctness is dead and gone, (may that day come with all speed) our descendants may remark on the peculiarity of such terms as `Chairperson.' Did it mean that the poor unfortunate soul possessed a body like a chair? Could it refer to the quality of one's intellect? Or maybe it was related somehow to one's lack of mobility--perhaps akin to the popular expression, `couch potato.' 
Gender neutrality, which is an absolute fetish in our country at this time, produces a plethora of strange choices for its adherents. What, for example, to be gender-neutrally correct, do we call a man-hole cover? How do we neutralize the very necessary `his' and `her' designations on restrooms? And whatever do we do to purge such common expressions as `man-alive,' `he's a macho-man,' `he's a ladies man,' and `man overboard' from the population at large? 
If one stops to think about such things, it becomes absolutely ridiculous. It is laughable, indeed. 
This insane preoccupation has even been carried so far as to apply to the good Lord and his words as related in Holy Scripture, as some `new age' Bibles have done. 
I don't want any of them in my house. They won't find a resting place in my house. That kind of Bible will find its way to the wastebasket if it ever gets to me or to anybody in my family. We will stick with the King James version. 
Personally, I think enough is enough when it comes to political correctness. I think we should all stop this unhealthy preoccupation and consider what effect it has had on the content of public dialogue in general. Far from erasing differences from the public mind, I think political correctness in all of its suspect forms has tended to overly accentuate them. In order not to risk offending anyone, we spend so much time focusing on race, gender, country of origin or whatever aspects of an individual we have to tiptoe around, that we then tend to ignore all of the other truly valuable and important aspects of that individual, such as brainpower, level of achievement, talent or quality of character. In other words, our anxious efforts not to emphasize such surface differences as race and gender have, in my view, paradoxically, had precisely the opposite effect. 
On a more subtle level, political correctness has encouraged us to become much less honest with one another and with ourselves and, as a result, much less willing and able to come to grips with the troubling problems which beset our land. In our obsequious efforts not to offend anybody, we in public life thereby mentally partition our population into groups by race or by gender or by some other category, obscuring the inarguable fact that we are all citizens of the United States of America, that our fates hang together, and that public debate should, in the best of all worlds, be about what is good for the country, not what may appease this group or that group or this individual. That is one reason why I absolutely abhor hyphenated-American designations. They separate and divide us into arbitrary categories which are based for the most part solely on what the eye can readily see. And we find the same problem in our textbooks in the schools. 
How can we help the entire population of our land, the men, the women, the blacks, the Hispanics, the white or the Asian populations, if we submerge honest and forthright discussions of what is best for the Nation in favor of pandering to the sensibilities of this group or that group? The answer is we can't. And the real answer is we don't want to. It is far easier to observe the customary taboos and the popular, awkward, and thoroughly phony norms of political correctness than to actually grapple with real problems in a meaningful and substantive way. 
Personally, Mr. President, I hope that `political correctness' will soon go the way of high-button shoes or the lace-up corset. It is shop-worn window dressing far, far too constraining for a fast-moving, difficult age, crying out for courageous leaders, frank discussion, and innovative solutions. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference agreement on ISTEA now before the Senate, which will appropriately be entitled `The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century', is a magnificent accomplishment for those of us who have labored many long months to achieve the enactment of this truly monumental highway bill. Today is the day that we have all been hoping for lo these many months. Today is the day Congress will send to the President a 6-year ISTEA reauthorization act that truly keeps faith with the American traveling public. In adopting this conference report, the Senate will make two profoundly important statements to the American traveling public. First, we are telling the American public that we are finally prepared to guarantee that the revenues collected at the gas pump will indeed be spent for the purpose for which they are collected; namely, the maintenance, upkeep, safety, and expansion of our national highway and transit systems. Second, we are telling the traveling public that we are determined to reverse the Federal Government's chronic underinvestment in our national highway needs. 
We are about to send to the President a highway bill calling for a full $216 billion in transportation investments over the six years, 1998 through 2003. Of that amount, $173 billion is provided in contract authority for our national highway system. 
Senators will recall that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 assessed a new 4.3 cents gas tax, solely for the purpose of deficit reduction. That was the first time since the Highway Trust Fund had been established in 1956, that a permanent gas tax was put on the books for a purpose other than for transportation investments. In May of 1996, our former colleague, Senator Dole of Kansas, rekindled the debate on the appropriate use of the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax. At that time, I signaled to my colleagues my intent to offer an amendment to transfer this 4.3 cents gas tax from the general fund to its rightful place in the Highway Trust Fund so that it could be used to help meet our ever-growing unmet needs in the area of highway construction and maintenance, as well as to rebuild the thousands of unsafe and overburdened bridges throughout the nation. In my view, the Federal Government has, for too long, held its head in the sand while our Federal investment in our nation's infrastructure declined, both as a percentage of our gross domestic product. As such, I was poised to offer my amendment to transfer the 4.3 cents tax into the Highway Trust Fund throughout the summer of 1996. At the behest of both the majority and minority leaders, I deferred offering my amendment on two separate tax bills. Unfortunately, another opportunity to offer my amendment did not arise during the 104th Congress. 
During debate on the budget resolution last year, Senator Gramm offered a Sense-of-the-Senate amendment supporting the transfer of the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax from deficit reduction to the Highway Trust Fund, and the spending of that revenue on our highway construction needs. Senator Gramm was joined by 81 of our colleagues in support of this amendment. Later that year, when the Finance Committee marked up the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, it was Senator Gramm, who is a member of that committee, who successfully included a provision transferring the 4.3 cents to the Highway Trust Fund. That provision 
became law with the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act in August of 1997. 
Transferring this new revenue to the Highway Trust Fund was crucial, because it gave Congress the opportunity to authorize and commit dramatically increased resources on our National Highway System. Unfortunately, however, even with this new revenue coming into the Highway Trust Fund, the Environment and Public Works Committee reported a highway bill on October 1, 1997, that failed to authorize even one penny of this new revenue to be spent on our Nation's highways and bridges. Indeed, under the funding levels reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee for the highway program, the unspent balance in the Highway Trust Fund (including both the highway and transit accounts), was expected to grow from $22.9 billion at the beginning of 1998 to more than $55 billion at the end of 2003, the end of the ISTEA II authorization period. I found these figures to be grossly unacceptable. Senator Gramm and I did not successfully champion the transfer of the 4.3 cents into the Highway Trust Fund so that the revenue would sit in that Trust Fund, unspent. There was no question that these funds were sorely needed on our Nation's highways. I have taken to the Floor numerous times over the years to remind my colleagues of the hundreds of thousands of miles of highways in the nation that are rated in poor or fair condition, and the thousands of bridges across our nation that are rated as deficient or functionally obsolete. 
Following the Environment and Public Works Committee's action, I held several discussions on the subject with members of the committee, including Chairman Chafee, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus. As a consequence of these discussions, I prepared an amendment to the highway bill to authorize the spending of the full amount of revenues going into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. Given the continuing deterioration of our Nation's highways in all 50 states, and the growing volume of concern on the part of the Nation's Governors and State legislators regarding the Federal Government's underinvestment in our infrastructure, I felt that it was essential that the Senate have an opportunity to vote on whether or not we meant what we said when we placed these additional highway tax revenues into the Highway Trust Fund. 
I was pleased to have as the very first cosponsor of the amendment I had prepared my very good friend and colleague, Senator Gramm. Shortly thereafter, our efforts were given a great boost when we were joined by Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, and Senator Warner, the subcommittee's chairman. Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner, and I diligently sought to obtain cosponsors for our amendment. In total, we were able to secure an additional 50 cosponsors, making a total of 54 cosponsors for the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. 
Our amendment authorized additional contract authority for highways over the period Fiscal Years 1999 through 2003, totaling $30.971 billion. At the time we introduced our amendment, that amount was the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the revenue from the 3.45 cents portion of the 4.3 cents gas tax that would be deposited into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund over that five-year period. In January of this year, the Congressional Budget Office re-estimated that five-year figure to a level of $27.41 billion, or a reduction of $3.561 billion from their earlier forecast. 
During Senate debate on the highway reauthorization bill, Mr. President, it appeared that a true battle was brewing. The Senate was divided into two camps--the camp of those that had joined with Senators Byrd, Gramm, Baucus, and Warner in support of authorizing the spending of the additional revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, and the opposition, led by Senators Domenici and Chafee, who opposed this approach. This division was causing a delay in Senate consideration of the ISTEA bill, a delay that made all Senators uncomfortable, since we faced the May 1 deadline beyond which most states could not obligate any federal aid highway funds absent a new authorization bill. The fact is, that the May 1 cutoff of highway obligation authority is still in effect and is a major reason why it is so critical that Congress get this legislation to the President's desk before the Memorial Day Recess. Ultimately, in an attempt to break the Senate deadlock on the highway bill, the majority leader, Mr. Lott, asked that all parties join him in his office for negotiations on this issue. And so, Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Domenici, Senator D'Amato, and I did join with the majority leader to discuss the situation. After several days of back and forth discussions, under the very adept moderating style of the majority leader, I was pleased that an agreement emerged that resulted in an amendment to the then-pending highway bill totaling $25.920 billion in additional highway spending. That amount represented 94 percent of CBO's most recent estimate of the revenue to the highway account, stemming from the 4.3 cents gas tax. 
On a matter that was of critical importance to me, the negotiated amendment included $1.89 billion for the Appalachian Development Highway System. Coupled with the $300 million already in the committee bill for this system, total funding over the 6-year ISTEA bill, for the Appalachian Regional Highway System equaled $2.19 billion, the full amount requested by the administration in their ISTEA proposal. Back in December--or January, rather, of 1997, I had met with the President with the goal of convincing him of the importance of completing the Appalachian Highway System. The completion of these highways were promised to the people of Appalachia more than 32 years ago. But as we enter the new millennia, we find that our Interstate Highway System is almost 100 percent complete while the Appalachian Highway System remains less than 78 percent complete. In my home State of West Virginia, we lag behind the average for the region. Our segments of the Appalachian Highway System are only 73 percent complete. I was pleased that, following our meeting, the President saw fit to include $2.19 billion for the Appalachian Highway System in his ISTEA reauthorization proposal. While this amount would not serve to complete the Federal contribution toward the system, it represented a substantial boost to the system and sent a signal to the entire Appalachian region that we are serious about completing these corridors. So the proposal also provided for the Appalachian States to be able to draw down contract authority from the trust fund in order to complete their Appalachian corridors. 
The $26 billion included in our amendment not only allowed for a boost to the Appalachian Highway System, it provided for substantial increases in highway funding for all 50 States and many other national highway initiatives. Perhaps, most importantly, it closed the substantial funding gap that existed in the total amount of funding in the Senate highway bill and the highway bill under consideration in the House of Representatives. It paved the way for a less contentious and more amicable conference. Put simply, by bringing the additional $26 billion to the table, our amendment better enabled the conferees to include many critical initiatives in the conference agreement--initiatives that might otherwise have been left out of our Federal Aid 
Highway program for the next 6 years. 
This conference agreement includes an historic increase in the overall level of investment in our Nation's highways, a 44 percent increase over the levels authorized in the original ISTEA legislation for the years 1992 through 1997. The agreement includes a total of $2.25 billion for the Appalachian Highway System. Within that amount, West Virginia can expect to receive roughly $345 million to aid in the completion of Corridor H from Wardensville to Elkins and Corridor D in the Parkersburg area. The bill also includes specific earmarks for several high priority projects throughout the State. These include: $50 million for West Virginia Route 10 from Logan to Man and $22.69 million for the continued construction of the Coalfields Expressway in Southern West Virginia. 
Mr. President, I commend the conferees for their diligent efforts in reaching this historic agreement. I especially commend chairman Chafee and chairman Warner, as well as Senator Baucus, who have spent untold hours in negotiations with the House conferees in an effort to reach a fair and balanced conference agreement. I also commend chairman Shuster for his splendid efforts on the House side in chairing this very difficult conference and for bringing it to a successful conclusion in such an expeditious manner. Further, I want to especially commend my own Congressman, Representative Nick Rahall of the Third District of West Virginia in which my voting residence is attained. He served as one of the leaders of the House conferees and has been a stalwart ally in the effort to guarantee the American people that their gas taxes will be spent on our Federal highways. His wisdom and his experience have made West Virginia and the Nation proud. 
I also compliment the many members of staff--for example Jim English and Peter Rogoff--who have worked diligently over these many, many months, as a matter of fact, in helping to bring this historic bill to fruition. I must thank, again, both leaders, Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lott, for their support of the legislation. I thank all Senators who have participated one way or another in the working out of this agreement. And, again, I compliment and thank Mr. Shuster and the Members on the House side. 
It was a difficult bill. It was a difficult battle and a difficult conference. 
I close by thanking once more, Senator Gramm of Texas for his splendid leadership, for his unfailing courage, for his high dedication to the passage of this bill, and also for his determination to do everything possible to see to it that the moneys the American people spent on the gas tax when they fill their fuel tanks go into the highway trust fund and are spent on highways. I thank him for joining with me in seeing to it that the amendment which would provide for the expenditure of those trust fund moneys on highways and bridges was implemented. This was the goal that we sought. We thought it was right. We thought that it was being honest with the American people. 
I don't think I could have had a better supporter and compatriot and colleague in this effort than Senator Gramm. He is, indeed, a very able Senator, and has one of the brightest minds I have seen in my 40 years in this Senate. I salute him and express my gratitude for his steadfast support and his encouragement that he gave to me and to others of us who worked together in this matter. 
This conference agreement represents a remarkable accomplishment, long sought by the American people and those of us who are fortunate enough to represent them. I commend all those whose efforts have brought us to this historic day. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my sad duty to announce to the Senate the death on last Friday of our former colleague, U.S. Senator Jennings Randolph. With countless West Virginians, and with his many friends across America, I am saddened by the passing of my longtime friend. 
Jennings Randolph was a man possessed of a profound love for West Virginia and for the Nation. More, he was a man of seemingly boundless energy and limitless horizons. Both in Government and in his several other fields of interest and expression, Senator Randolph seemed constantly to be looking for ways to assist other people to achieve their own potential, or for avenues by which others might attain a better life for themselves. He was, paradoxically perhaps, an indefatigably optimistic realist. Jennings Randolph knew that life often demands struggle and many times ends in defeat; but for every problem, Jennings believed that good-willed, intelligent, and decent men and women could find solutions to their mutual and individual problems, if they united their talents in a mutual effort to overcome frustration or evil, or if they but reached into their deepest resources of character. 
An educator, writer, public speaker, aviation enthusiast, corporate executive, a Representative and a Senator, Jennings Randolph was a master of many talents. I was honored to serve with him as a colleague, and honored to call him my friend. 
If events can foreshadow destinies, perhaps Jennings Randolph's destiny was outlined at his birth, 96 years ago, in 1902. One of Senator Randolph's father's closest friends was the great William Jennings Bryan. Jennings was fond of recounting the anecdote that his father was with Bryan shortly after Jennings' birth. When told of the arrival of a new Randolph male, Bryan asked Mr. Randolph, `Have you named this boy?' `No,' the father replied. `Then why don't you give him part of my name as a good Democrat?' 
So Jennings Randolph received his name from the perennial Presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan--a name that Randolph never tarnished and that he burnished brilliantly in his own career. 
I recall another story that Jennings Randolph sometimes told out of his boyhood in Salem, West Virginia. According to Jennings, Salem had a water tower that stood high on a hill above the town. 
Jennings said that he told his father and mother, `If I could just get a long pole and * * * climb up on that tank, and hold out that pole, I believe I could touch the sky.' That is a story that shows the theme of this man's life--the tale of a boy who wanted to touch the sky. And when that boy became a man, touch the sky he did. 
Jennings Randolph graduated from Salem College in 1924. From there he went into newspaper work in Clarksburg, West Virginia, and later in Elkins. A short step more took him onto the faculty of Davis and Elkins College as a professor of speech and journalism, and the director of athletics. Working in that capacity, in 1932 Jennings Randolph was elected to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, entering as a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's `New Deal,' and serving in the House until January 3, 1947. 
In 1947, he accepted a position as assistant to the President of Capital Airlines and Director of Public Relations. In 1958, however, Jennings Randolph returned to politics. He loved politics; he loved to `Press the flesh.' He couldn't get politics out of his blood. So he won election to the U.S. Senate to complete the unexpired term of the late Senator Matthew Mansfield Neely from West Virginia. On November 5, 1958, Jennings took the oath of office as U.S. Senator. 
Elected in that same election for a full Senate term, for 26 years, I shared with Jennings Randolph the privilege of representing and serving West Virginia in the United States Senate. That partnership I shall cherish always. No man could have asked for a more generous, dedicated, or thoughtful colleague than I had in Jennings Randolph. And I know from my own experience that Jennings Randolph was certainly a man whose touch reached the sky. In West Virginia to this day, thousands of people bless his name for the deeds that he did for them as a friend and as a faithful public servant. 
One of Jennings Randolph's greatest areas of ongoing contribution was to the development and advancement of air flight. 
Some may recall the ancient Greek myth of the flight of Icarus. According to that legend, Icarus attempted to fly, using wings attached to his body with wax. 
Icarus flew, to be sure. But Icarus flew too close to the sun. The sun melted the wax on Icarus's wings, and he fell into the sea. 
Early on, Jennings Randolph became interested in flight. Fortunately for him and for us, Jennings went about getting into the air more safely than Icarus did. 
As I mentioned, in 1947, Jennings Randolph became an assistant to the President and Director of Public Relations for Capital Airlines--one of the companies that later formed United Airlines. In that position, for the next eleven years, Jennings Randolph advanced the airline industry here and abroad. While Jennings was with Capital Airlines, however, he undertook one mission that places him on an equal footing with Icarus--in bravery and, of course, Jennings was far more successful than Icarus. On November 6, 1948, with a professional pilot at the controls, Jennings Randolph flew from Morgantown, West Virginia, to the Washington National Airport in a propeller plane fueled with gasoline made from coal. Now, that was just like Jennings Randolph--out there pioneering, not only in flight, but also in the use of fuel in that plane that had a West Virginia Source--coal. Certainly, that project was an act of faith, for which many remember Senator Randolph. 
Not as well remembered is Congressman Jennings Randolph's introduction in 1946 of legislation to create a National Air Museum. Three decades later, on July 4, 1976, Senator Randolph dedicated the National Air and Space Museum complex on the Mall in Washington--noted today as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Nation's Capital. 
Jennings Randolph was an advocate of numerous other items of vital legislation as well--legislation to aid the handicapped and black lung victims, legislation to promote clean water and 
clean air, legislation to provide vocational and career education, and the legislation that created the National Peace Academy in 1983. 
In announcing his decision not to run for reelection to the Senate in the 1984 race, Jennings said, `* * * It's been a happy road. I have no regrets. * * * I believe the Bible says there is a season and a time for every purpose. It is time for me not to run for reelection.' 
That `happy road' was an unparalleled example of citizenship and public service. In an era in which so many seem preoccupied primarily with grasping and grabbing for themselves, Jennings Randolph was committed to exerting himself--his intellect, his energy, and his considerable talents--on behalf, and in behalf, of his fellow citizens, his fellow West Virginians, his fellow Americans, his fellow human beings. 
Jennings lived a long time--a full and active life. But all of us, high and low, rich and poor, must one day say goodby to friends and loved ones in this earthly life and make our journeys to that unknown bourne from which no traveler returns. 
It was on last Friday morning that the pallid messenger with the inverted torch beckoned Jennings to depart. 
Jennings' passing reminds me of Thomas More's lines. 
When I remember all 
the friends so linked together 
I've seen round me fall 
like leaves in wintry weather 
I feel like one who treads alone 
some banquet hall deserted 
whose lights are fled 
whose garlands dead 
and all but he departed . . . 
Whether Jennings, on that last morning, saw a more glorious sun rise with unimaginable splendor above a celestial horizon; whether his dexterous and disciplined faculties are now contending in a higher senate than ours for supremacy; whether he yet remembers us as we remember him, we do not know. These questions are much like the question that came from the lips of that ancient patriarch, a man of Uz, whose name was Job, `If a man dies, shall he live again?' 
But we have the consolation expressed by that same man of Uz,  
Oh that my words were written in a book and engraved 
With an iron pen, and 
lead in the rock forever, 
For I know that my 
Redeemer liveth and that 
in the latter day he shall 
Stand upon the earth. 
So, Jennings Randolph has crossed the Great Divide. 
I think of others who were serving here when Jennings Randolph and I took the oath of office to serve in this Chamber. It was almost 40 years ago. I remember Senators on both sides of the aisle: Senator Aiken, Senator Anderson of New Mexico, Senator Harry Byrd, Sr., of Virginia, Senators Capehart of Indiana, Chavez of New Mexico, Cooper of Kentucky, Dirksen, Douglas of Illinois, Eastland, Ellender, Fulbright, Hayden, Hennings of Missouri, Hickenlooper of Iowa, Hill of Alabama, Holland of Florida, `Scoop' Jackson of Washington, Johnson of Texas, Johnston of South Carolina, Langer of North Dakota, McClellan of Arkansas, Magnuson of Washington, Wayne Morse of Oregon, Murray of Montana, Willis Robertson of Virginia, Richard Russell, Saltonstall of Massachusetts, Stennis of Mississippi, Symington of Missouri, and Milton Young. All of these, and others, were here. 
Of that illustrious band which sat in this Chamber when Jennings Randolph and I first entered the Senate, only Strom Thurmond and I remain here. 
They are drifting away, these friends of old 
Like leaves on the current cast; 
With never a break in their rapid flow, 
We count them, as one by one they go 
Into the Dreamland of the Past. 
Erma and I extend our condolences to Jennings' two sons, Jay and Frank, and to others of his family.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I refer to the third chapter of Genesis, verse 20, `And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.' 
This coming Sunday, May 10, is Mother's Day. And, upon awaking that morning, some mothers will be treated to a lovingly prepared culinary surprise, and a glue-streaked--but treasured--handmade card. Others will be invited to brunch or to lunch or to dinner with their children and, perhaps, grandchildren, many of whom may have traveled long miles, some perhaps from one edge of the continent to the other, to help honor their mothers and grandmothers on this very special day, a day that originated in West Virginia, Mother's Day. 
In my own case, and that of my wife, we will be visited by our two daughters, Mona Carol and Marjorie Ellen, and their husbands, Mohammad and Jon, respectively. And we will also be visited by our five grandchildren. I will name them in the order of their ages: Erik Byrd Fatemi, and then Mona Byrd Moore, Darius James Fatemi, Mary Anne Moore, Fredric Kurosh Fatemi. They will all come to our house, the Lord willing, this coming Sunday, and they will bring flowers to my wife Erma. And we will sit and talk for awhile, and then we will have those beautiful flowers and those beautiful thoughts and those beautiful memories that will be with us for--in the case of the flowers, all summer; in the case of the thoughts and memories, as long as we live. Others of my colleagues will experience the same visits from their daughters and granddaughters. And this will go on all over the country, with children coming back home, the family circle again coming together. 
This weekend will be one of the busiest weekends of the year, one of the busiest for florists who deliver baskets and bouquets of long-distance love. As for telephone lines, they will be busy also, carrying the loving voices of sons and daughters, unable to make the long journey home. Some will be calling from foreign lands, but they will make those calls to mother. 
This annual outpouring of affection and appreciation gives me hope that the strength of family feeling in this Nation has really not diminished all that much, but ever how much, is too much. Yet, those feelings are still strong. Despite the afternoon hate-fests on television that sometimes pass for talk shows, in which high ratings are garnered by mother-daughter rivalries or mother-son conflicts that devolve into circus sideshows, caring and affection are still widespread among ordinary families like mine, and like the families of others here. 
I cannot adequately describe how proud I am that the strength, the character, and the devotion that my wife Erma instilled in our daughters have carried through their families and are manifested in the fine families that my grandchildren are building. And I know that other Senators are just as proud of their families as I am of mine. I have said many times that the love and confidence and support of my family have helped me through the hardest moments of my life--I have had some pretty tough moments--and have sweetened every victory, and there have been some victories. 
`Simply having children does not make mothers,' someone has said, but a good mother is a pearl without price, for a mother's role in maintaining a civil and decent society is incalculable. 
I say mothers here, not to denigrate the active role played by many fathers in the lives of their children today, but in recognition of that fundamental tie between a mother and her child--between a mother and her children. It is mother who wakes first at night to soothe the fevered brow. It is mother whose kisses are better than Bactine at taking the sting out of the tender skin. It is mother whom you call when things are really, really bad, no matter your age. It is mother who teaches us love. Mothers are our first and our best role models, whose wisdom and training guide us through our headstrong teenage years and comfort us when we are older. 
Napoleon Bonaparte said, `The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother.' To raise children to become good citizens is a challenge, and it seems that today there are so many more malign influences out there, working to bend that childish twig into a blighted and twisted tree. `As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined,' it has been said. And, so, as I have stated, there are so many more malign, malignant influences out there everywhere, working today, than there were when I was a child, 
working to bend that childish twig into a blighted and twisted tree. 
When I was younger--I will not say when I was young, I am still young, as young in spirit as ever--but when I was a boy, there was no television, thank God; no television, and only very limited radio programming. That was back in the days when radio was good. We had an old Philco radio, just a little radio that sat on a shelf on the wall. 
Of course, during the years when I lived as a country boy `out in the sticks,' as we sometimes are prone to say, we had no radio at our house. We had no electricity in the house. No radio, no running water, no electric lights. But we moved later to a coal camp where we did have a radio, the Philco that sat on the wall shelf. 
A trip to the movie theater was rare. I remember that the strong man in the old silent movies was Joe Bonomo, and the cowboys were Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, Jack Hoxie, and William Desmond. But there was no Internet and no video, not even a school library in the two-room schools that I attended. But later on when I was in high school, there was a school library. Then there was Bible class on Sunday. It was, in many ways, an easier time, a simpler time in which to rear children; it was much more easy to protect children against corrupting material. 
I am no Luddite opposing technology and progress. Isaiah said that we would have progress. He said:  
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 
And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. . . 
So Isaiah foresaw the diesel motor train, the submarine, the underocean cable. He foresaw television. He foresaw that wonderful nuisance, the telephone, and all of these inventions, of course, would level the hills and all flesh would see the glory of the Lord together. That was Isaiah. 
I am no Luddite opposing technology; I am for it. And progress, of course, I am for that, too. 
With the bad comes the good, and with the good comes the bad. Children, unfortunately, have access to pornography on the Internet, but they also have access to Shakespeare and to Milton and to Carlyle. They have access to their Government and to many other sources of useful and intellectually stimulating information. 
With television and with videos, our children can visit the world and see history in the making. But a parent's job, the mother's job or the father's job, is harder. It is more difficult to protect your children from material that may be too seamy or too misleading. It is more difficult to shield your children from language that is profane, offensive, vulgar. It is more difficult to demonstrate acceptable behavior when aggressive drivers, offensive song lyrics and violent behavior are present on the streets, in the air and on television, therefore, right in your living room. Seemingly everywhere, everywhere. 
When sports heroes spit in the face of the umpire or choke their coaches, their fans--some of them--may think it is all right, because one will probably also notice that not enough of a penalty was attached. When the news is full of lawyers or politicians or commentators throwing out slurs and wild allegations, youngsters may think that courtesy and respect are not needed in business or public life. By the way, John Locke wrote a constitution in 1669 for the government of the Carolinas. In John Locke's constitution, there could be no lawyers. No fees could be charged in John Locke's constitution. Every law would sunset at the end of 100 years. That was John Locke's constitution. 
Hence, when the kind of language that I have been discussing, when the kind of behavior permeates the schoolyard and the neighborhood, it soaks into youngsters like water into a dry sponge. 
When I see children of all ages celebrating their mothers on Mother's Day, I am encouraged. It means that many mothers and fathers are overcoming the difficult challenges placed before them. They are succeeding in building families. They are strong enough, caring enough, supportive enough to fend off the disrespect that surrounds them and who see no shame--no shame--in following the dictate of the Bible to honor thy mother and thy father. `Honor thy father and thy mother.' These surely are families that spend time together around the dinner table. 
I am overjoyed when I see my grandchildren come into my home. They are really, grown men and women. 
They still kiss me on the cheek. It does not make any difference how many people are around, they still kiss me on the cheek--that demonstration of heartfelt, genuine love and affection that can only come from children. Oh, as an aside, I might add, not altogether jokingly, but also from my little dog `Billy.' 
These are families that spend time around the dinner table. These are families in which the children do their homework, in which parents know their children's teachers and their friends, families in which the members help and encourage and support each other through triumph and tragedy. 
We spend a lot of time in the Senate talking about children, what priceless treasures they are, and the things we ought to do or ought not to do to help them. I am happy today to look past those young gems in our national treasury, to recognize and honor the mother lode from which they issue, the ore that shapes them--clear, flawless, and true in all of their colors--their mothers. I hope that the mothers on my staff enjoy their Mother's Day festivities, and that they, and my wife Erma, the mother of my daughters, who are the mothers of my grandchildren, and all mothers around the Nation, know that I salute them, encourage them, and honor them this Sunday and every day. 
I salute the mothers on my staff. It is very difficult for them and for mothers on the staffs of other Senators. They have to be dedicated, and they do make a sacrifice in order to serve. And it is a sacrifice that can never be retrieved or recouped. My admiration and respect go out to all of the young mothers who work in this great Senate family. 
Now, I lost my mother when I was 1 year old. She died in the great influenza epidemic in 1918. She died on Armistice Day. And I had what I thought were three brothers and one sister. Only about a month ago, I found that I had another brother, a fourth brother, who had died at childbirth. I did not know that until about a month ago. 
In 1918, times were very hard. My father worked in a factory that manufactured furniture. The Spanish flu killed 500,000 people in this country, and, according to estimates, more than 20 million people around the world. My mother knew that she might not recover, and so she asked my father to give me, the baby, to his sister Vlurma. I believe he had 10 sisters. And my other brothers were to be farmed out to others of his sisters. 
But I was given to my father's sister Vlurma and her husband, Titus Dalton Byrd, and they raised me. They did not have much of an education, but they gave me their love and they urged me to do right. They had the Holy Bible in the house. They could barely read, but the example that they set was a shining example of a couple who revered God. They did not wear their religion on their sleeves. They were not of the religious left or the religious right or anything of that nature; they were just good persons, trying to make an honest living and according to God's will. 
I can imagine my own mother, had she lived; I have no recollection of ever having seen her, naturally, by virtue of her having gone away when I was just a year old. But the woman who raised me gave me tenderness and love and affection. I can see her wearing her bonnet and her apron. She was a hard worker. I can see her, as others in this Chamber can see their own mothers, I am sure, especially as most Americans who are perhaps not as old as I am, can remember their mothers, especially those who lived out in the country, out on the farm, wearing their bonnets and their aprons as they worked in the kitchen. 
Those were old-fashioned mothers. We picture them in our minds. My mom, I used to watch her as she cooked the meals when I was a little boy. And I would hear her sing. And I would hear her use an expression: `Well, you put in a pinch of this and a pinch of that.' They did not have cookbooks. And my mom probably could not have read a cookbook, in any event. But I often heard her use that expression: `A pinch of this, a pinch of that.' They did not use recipes; they just knew about how much of this ingredient to put in, how much of that to put in, and how long to cook it. By experience, they learned to cook. They were great cooks--great cooks. 
Well, as I think of that woman who raised me, I think of the old-fashioned mother that most of us can remember. And I will close with a few lines that take off on my mom's expression, `a pinch of this, a pinch of that.' Now, I did not write this poem. I do not remember the name of the author. It is a fitting poem:  
When Mother use to mix the dough, 
Or make a batter--long ago; 
When I was only table high, 
I used to like just standing by 
And watching her, for all the while, 
She'd sing a little, maybe smile, 
And talk to me and tell me--What? 
Well, things I never have forgot. 
I'd ask her how to make a cake. 
`Well, first,' she'd say, `Some sugar take 
Some butter and an egg or two, 
Some flour and milk, you always do, 
And then put in, to make it good--' 
This part I never understood 
And often use to wonder at-- 
`A pinch of this, a pinch of that.' 
And then, she'd say, `my little son, 
When you grow up, when childhood's done, 
And mother may be far away, 
Then just remember what I say, 
For life's a whole lot like a cake; 
Yes, life's a thing you have to make-- 
Much like a cake, or pie, or bread; 
You'll find it so,' my Mother said. 
I did not understand her then, 
But how her words come back again; 
Before my eyes my life appears 
A life of laughter and of tears, 
For both the bitter and the sweet 
Have made this life of mine complete-- 
The things I have, the things I miss, 
A pinch of that, a pinch of this. 
And, now I think I know the way 
To make a life as she would say: 
`Put in the wealth to serve your needs, 
But don't leave out the lovely deeds; 
Put in great things you mean to do, 
And don't leave out the good and true. 
Put in, whatever you are at, 
A pinch of this, a pinch of that.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the courage and decisiveness displayed by President Clinton and the Secretary of State, Ms. Albright, in attempting to get the Arab-Israeli negotiations back on track. The attacks by some in the other body are disappointing and not helpful. If there has been coercion and strong-arming or unreasonable tactics on the matter of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over the last year or so, Mr. President, in my judgment, it has not been on the part of the United States. 
The unfortunate reality as I view it, is that the Israeli Prime Minister has pursued a policy of paralysis in the peace process. I think it is unwise for any responsible American leader to suggest that this practice should continue, and the United States should not intervene to get the negotiations underway again in a meaningful way. The Israeli Prime Minister has traveled to Washington before, totally empty-handed, with no proposal for moving the negotiations forward. In so doing, he has catered to the forces working against progress. He has embarrassed the United States, and all who have supported a peaceful constructive resolution of the issues on the table regarding Israeli and the Palestinians. It is no wonder, given his track record on the negotiations since he became Prime Minister, that the administration has seen fit to require some assurance that another visit to Washington will produce something more than empty rhetoric and more stonewalling. I cannot support more strongly the position of Secretary Albright, that if the Israeli Prime Minister is unwilling to accept some moderate specific American proposals for progress on the West Bank that there is not much point in another fruitless trip to Washington, which might further inflame the situation in the Middle East. 
As to the Israeli Palestinian problem, Mr. President, it has always taken three to tango. All parties, the United States, the Palestinians and the Israelis must want the negotiations to move forward, and it is only through compromise that success can be achieved. The United States has used its good offices to broker the negotiations and has burnished substantial financial resources to ensure the stability of Israeli on an unstinting basis. Any one of the parties can derail the negotiations and so it is a measure of the tremendous difficulty the United States has had with the Netanyahu government that the administration has felt it necessary to take specific steps to get the negotiations back on track. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I commend the President for this initiative in the interests of getting the negotiations jump-started. I hope that cooler heads will prevail and that all Americans will see the wisdom of supporting a reasoned but decisive approach to the negotiating effort. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have heard much in recent years of the horrors and abuses inflicted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the American taxpayer. I have little cause for doubt, Mr. President, that there lies a certain degree of verisimilitude in these allegations and, further, that the pending legislation represents a necessary and overdue effort to ameliorate these abuses. Certainly, a portion of the criticism directed at the IRS has been justly earned by the officials and employees who administer and work at the agency. If but half of the concerns raised during the Finance Committee's recent hearings on these IRS abuses are true, there is indeed an immediate and overwhelming need to reform and restructure the IRS. However, let us remember, Mr. President, that the task to which the Congress has assigned the IRS has never been nor will ever be a popular one. The simple fact that few people enjoy paying taxes leads logically to the presumption that they will not embrace the very agency charged with collecting their taxes. 
Having said that, Mr. President, let me now turn my focus to the bill before us. As reported to the Senate by the Finance Committee, H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, would significantly alter the management, oversight, and basic structure of the IRS as we know it. By creating an IRS Oversight Board, this legislation aims to provide the strategic oversight and guidance that has been deficient or lacking at the IRS in previous years. As the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service concluded in its report to the Congress last year, the `problems throughout the IRS cannot be solved without focus, consistency and direction from the top. The current structure, which includes Congress, the President, the Department of the Treasury, and the IRS itself, does not allow the IRS to set and maintain consistent long-term strategy and priorities, nor to develop and execute focused plans for improvement.' 
Clearly, the drafters of H.R. 2676 have sought to provide the very `focus,' 
`consistency,' and `direction' that the IRS Commission concluded was necessary. I hope that the nine-member Board, as proposed, will be able to carefully and diligently clear a new path on which the IRS can tread the challenges that the 21st Century will bring as a more responsive, less intrusive federal agency that works for--not against--the millions of honest American taxpayers to whom we are all accountable. 
With regard to the composition of this Oversight Board, I voted against two amendments this morning that would have either directly or indirectly removed the union representative from this Board because I believe that such representation is crucial on a Board that will have so much influence in the actual workings of the IRS and the 100,000-odd actual workers who carry out its many tasks. I also opposed an amendment to remove the Treasury Secretary from this Board because I believe that, for any such Board to be truly taken seriously and command attention, the chief executive officer of the Treasury Department--the Secretary--must be able to offer his or her unique perspective on various IRS issues through a position on the Board. Furthermore, by serving on this Board, the Treasury Secretary will help ensure that the recommendations thus produced are not ignored or disregarded by officials of the IRS. 
Mr. President, I also want to convey my support for a number of other provisions of H.R. 2676. Specifically, I applaud the provisions of the bill providing for a National Taxpayer Advocate and an independent Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The former office should help to better protect the interests of individual taxpayers who are often outmatched in their disputes with the IRS, while the latter will ensure that the office with responsibility for overseeing the IRS is independent of the agency itself. I further support the provisions of this legislation calling for increased use of electronic filing in the next ten years--the advent of electric filing technology cannot be ignored as we seek to find ways to make the IRS more responsive to the American taxpayer. 
Mr. President, the bill contains many other taxpayer protections that I believe will improve the way the IRS works. However, let me express my concern about a provision in the funding offset amendment agreed to by the Senate yesterday, without my support. Last night, the Joint Committee on Taxation produced calculations predicting that, while this provision will raise approximately $10 billion in the next ten years and thus protect this bill from a PAYGO point of order, it will lose a net $47 billion in revenues over the next twenty years. Clearly, this is an attempt to back-load the true cost of a tax provision to circumvent a budgetary point of order, and I hope that it will be dropped in conference negotiations with the House. 
Mr. President, my reservations about this particular provision of H.R. 2676 notwithstanding, I am prepared to support Senate passage of this important and much-needed legislation. As the elected officials of the people of the United States, it is our duty to ensure that the IRS--the very agency to which we have delegated authority to implement and enforce our constitutional prerogative to `lay and collect' taxes--does not harass, abuse, or otherwise place unnecessary burdens on the millions of honest, hard-working taxpayers to whom we are each accountable. This legislation, as a whole, represents a positive step in the direction of a more responsive, more accountable, and more efficient Internal Revenue Service that better serves the American people.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the bill that I introduce today, on behalf of the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and myself, is an attempt to reduce the American portion of the NATO deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It does so in a carefully staged manner over the next 2 years, going from the administration-planned force size of 6,900 ground troops at the end of this June, to 2,500 troops in February, 2000. In the interim, the amendment calls for a force size of 5,000 U.S. troops to be arrived at by February 1999, and 3,500 by July 1999. 
This is a gradual drawdown to a level which more accurately approximates the size of the forces of France and Germany at this time. The United States would continue to honor its commitment to NATO to play an appropriate role in the Bosnia stabilization force, but the amendment provides crucial leverage on our allies in Europe to assume the leadership role that is appropriate for them in an operation near their borders in Europe. 
The current plan by the administration, including the requirement for meeting a series of general benchmarks in the areas of democratization, an independent press and judiciary, and other reforms, could keep the United States with the leading force in Bosnia for an indefinite period. I do not believe the American people will support the proposition of a semi-permanent deployment with no end-game. Nevertheless, this year, for the first time, the President has said that there is no definite end-game, or exit schedule which he would propose. Thus, the pressure is off our allies to pick up more of the leading role, and our allies are perfectly content to keep the United States spending some $1.8 billion per year on this operation, in addition to the funds we contribute to NATO on an annual basis. 
My good friend from the state of Michigan, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Levin, has also been concerned over the permanent nature of the American deployment and the lack of leadership being displayed by our European partners. He has offered a proposal, as a provision in the supplemental appropriations bill, which was approved by the conference committee on that bill, to urge the President to reach an agreement on the deadlines for closure on the various benchmarks in the President's report. This is a good amendment by Mr. Levin, and it is a very good starting point, and I am supportive of it, but I am afraid that it does not contain the kind of pressure that would cause the administration to act decisively with our allies on the matter of sharing the burden of leadership in Bosnia. I do not think that the Levin amendment, which, as I say, I strongly support, goes far enough. 
The administration seems not to work very effectively, except under the pressure of explicit deadlines and an explicit schedule with specific numbers, dates, and goals. This specificity is provided by the amendment which Mrs. Hutchison and I presently intend to offer to the fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense authorization bill when it comes to the floor. I hope that my colleagues will have a careful look at the details of the amendment. I believe that it deserves strong bipartisan support. It is a responsible approach, and it provides the time and the impetus for our allies to get their acts together and begin to take responsibility for the peace of the European Continent. The United States will continue to play an important supporting role in this effort, but I hope we will begin to wean our allies from the overdependence upon the United States that they currently exhibit. 
Reports over the last few days on the very disturbing developments in the Serbian province of Kosovo need the focus of the Senate and the administration and of all Americans. These events demonstrate my point. We may well have a catastrophe in the making, and the question of heading off, or at least containing ethnic unrest in Kosovo must be addressed by the administration, as well as by NATO. I don't see any evidence that the administration is moving in the direction of providing that kind of address. There may be steps that we need to take right now to prepare for worst-case eventualities. The administration needs to inform the Senate in detail on its policy regarding the possible scenarios involving the situation in Kosovo. 
The amendment offered by Senator Hutchison and myself does provide that the forces which we move out of Bosnia proper can be redeployed to the periphery of that troubled region--into Hungary, for instance, and particularly into Macedonia, in an effort to demonstrate to the Serbs and other parties that NATO will not stand for the spreading of the ethnic conflict beyond the borders of Bosnia and Serbia. But the spread of the ethnic conflict in Kosovo is a separate issue which must be addressed by the administration, and I hope that the administration will get busy and give us just such an address. Everything possible should be done to forestall a spread of the ethnic conflict in Kosovo. Bosnia and its violent disposition must be contained and must not be allowed to infect the rest of Europe. We cannot countenance the spread of the ethnic violence into the southern Balkans, and we must do everything that we can to forestall the involvement of Greece and Turkey in future instabilities caused by the Bosnia and Kosovo situations. 
The reduction in U.S. forces over a two-year period arranges a sure but gentle glidepath during which a reconfiguration of the composition of allied forces can be accomplished without opening up vulnerabilities for U.S. forces or causing uncertainties on the part of Serbian elements as to the staying power of NATO, while Bosnian unrest remains a threat to the peace of the continent. Yet, history must move in Europe, and the role of leadership on the ground, through the presence of American armies, must transition to one where a healthier balance of responsibility is created. This transition is especially important in light of the recent developments in Kosovo. In the long run, in an era where new states are being incorporated into NATO, and new practices of consensus-building and peacekeeping must be developed among the states of the alliance, Europe must begin to get a surer grasp of its own destiny through a spirit of close cooperation among its European NATO partners. 
Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will review the details of the amendment, and will choose to co-sponsor it. 
Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk on behalf of the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and myself and I ask that the title be stated.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I trust that my colleagues will indulge me just for a few minutes. I thank the majority leader and the minority leader. I am grateful to the two leaders, Mr. President, for their generous expressions of praise and affection. I thank all of my colleagues for the many courtesies that they have extended to me over these, now going on, 40 years in this body. 
Majorian, who became Emperor of the West in 457 A.D., referred to himself as `a prince who still glories in the name of `Senator.' That is the way I feel about it. I am grateful to the good people of West Virginia for trusting me with this honor for nearly 40 years now. I carry this title with great pride. 
Sometimes my constituents say to me, `Do you ever get used to it?' as they look about this marvelous building, and the truth of the matter is that I haven't gotten used to it. Each time I walk through these doors, I feel a sense of great pride in being a Member of the United States Senate, and a sense of satisfaction in knowing that I have tried to do my best, and that the people of West Virginia have recognized that, and that they have continually shown their faith and confidence in me. 
There have only been 1,843 men and women who have graced these desks, and those in the old Senate Chamber down the hall, those on the floor below, those in Philadelphia, and those in New York City where the first Senate met in 1789--1,843 Senators. 
These 15,000 votes that we have just heard about, if we allow 15 minutes per vote, and if we allow the average number of 148 days per session, as has been the case over the past 10 years, and allowing for 8-hour days, it would require constant consecutive votes expanding over 3 years and 24 days to cast these 15,000 votes, back to back, doing nothing other than voting. Three years and 24 days. I am thankful for the opportunity to have cast these votes. 
But it isn't the number of votes that really counts so much; it is the substance of each vote and the quality of judgment that is brought to bear in reaching a decision thereon. There have been a few votes that I regret having cast. But, in regard to the overwhelming majority of votes, I would not change them if I had the opportunity to do so. 
And so I trust that I can help other Senators from day-to-day to feel great pride in their having been selected by the people of their States to serve in this great body. It is the highest legislative office in the land. I do not consider a Senator as someone who serves under any President. Senators serve with Presidents. The Presidency is the highest office in the executive branch. I respect the Presidency always, whether the holder of the office is a Democrat or Republican. But a United States Senator has no superior in any other office of Government. That is the way we should feel about it. After all, this Senate is the pillar upon which the Constitution really rests, because it was on July 16, 1787, when the Great Compromise occurred, and out of that compromise came the United States Senate--the forum of the States. It is the only forum in the Nation in which the States themselves are recognized on the basis of equality. And each Senator is fortunate that his or her constituents have chosen him or her to represent them in this great forum of the States. 
The other night I was proud to look around and see all Senators sitting in their seats as they arose to answer the rollcall. After that rollcall was announced, several Senators came to me and expressed the fact that they had been greatly impressed by the dignity and the performance of the Senate as it voted on that occasion, which was a great occasion, an outstanding one. But I suppose that what touched me most was afterward, when I started to leave the Chamber, a number of these pages came up to me and one said, `Gee, that was cool'; another said, `that was great.' Still another said, `I couldn't keep the tears from rolling down my cheek as I watched the Senators cast their votes.' The pages were genuinely touched by the dignity and performance of the Senate on that day. 
The people of the United States watch this Senate every day. They see us if we are milling around in the well. Legislators in State legislatures are accustomed to voting from their seats. 
Many of you have been members of the State legislatures. So have I. Those members remain in their seats and they vote there. 
We may sometimes forget that the world is watching us. But the people in whom sovereignty resides are watching. They see us. 
As the premier legislative body of the Nation, it seems to me that we should all take great pride in this institution and realize that we are the people who, perhaps more than any others in Government, set the standards. Who else sets the standards? Where have all our heroes gone? Babe Ruth used to be my hero. Lou Gehrig was my hero. In 1927, Babe Ruth broke his previous record with 60 home runs. But where do our young people go now to find their heroes? Back in my days the baseball players didn't spit in the face of the umpire, or choke the coach. We looked up to those athletes. We had our heroes. Perhaps we Senators can fill the place of heroes for our young people so they can have someone to whom they can look and emulate. 
I am proud of all of my colleagues. I have often remarked about the high intelligence of the Members of the Senate. I hope we will be reinspired to serve with high purpose knowing that we have no particular right to this office except the fact that the people of our States trust us for a limited time with it. And, in that limited time, it is my desire that we do our best, and that we set a high standard of performance so that the American people will regain their confidence in government. 
If I might be pardoned for taking a few more minutes, Pyrrhus was a great Greek general. Hannibal said that he was one of the three greatest generals of all time--Pyrrhus. He defeated the Romans at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 B.C., and he paid a great price, from which we get the term `a Pyrrhic victory.' He knew he was going to have to fight the Romans again because they weren't conquered, by any means. So Pyrrhus sent Cineas, the philosopher, to the Roman Senate. And Cineas went with jewelry, and exquisite robes and other gifts, hoping to corrupt the Roman Senate, and, persuade the Romans to become an ally of his. 
After Cineas had observed the Roman Senate, he reported to Pyrrhus that the Roman Senate was no mere gathering of venal politicians, no haphazard council of mediocre men, but in dignity and statesmanship, veritably it was an assemblage of kings. 
About 175 years later, Jugurtha, a Numidian prince, came to Rome and connived in the assassination of a Roman leader. He was ordered to leave Rome. He walked through the gates of Rome and upon several occasions paused to look back. Suddenly, he exclaimed, `Yonder is a city that is up for sale, and its days are numbered if it finds a buyer.' The Roman Senate had deteriorated to that extent in one and three quarters centuries. 
I don't believe this Senate's days are numbered. But it is going to depend upon the Members of the body--not the number of votes that they will cast but the quality of the Senators, their high purpose, their dedication. 
I salute my colleagues and thank them for all of their kindnesses to me. 
Now I am off to my second 15,000. 
As Oliver Wendell Holmes said, `The rule of joy and the law of duty seem to me all one.'

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak with reference to the amendment offered by Mr. Craig that would, if adopted, require that the United States adopt a specific authorization for the continued deployment of U.S. forces now in Bosnia prior to the deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification of the protocols for NATO expansion. I have long supported an active Congressional role regarding the ongoing U.S. mission in Bosnia. 
Congress does have a responsibility to carefully oversee that mission, to ensure that it stays on track and that limits are placed on the U.S. role there that will safeguard our troops from being consumed in an ever-expanding nation-building crusade. So, I support what I think is the Senator's intent, which is to apply pressure to the Administration and the Congress to fulfill their oversight responsibilities with respect to Bosnia. 
However, that being said, I do not believe that this amendment is necessary. The Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense Authorization bill is likely to be considered by the Senate within the next several weeks, and the corresponding appropriations bill will also be taken up before we adjourn. These bills are the appropriate vehicles on which to debate and act to place limits on the U.S. mission in Bosnia. They provide a vehicle for establishing policy and then backing up the will of Congress with the power over the purse. We do not need this amendment today to force us into taking action on Bosnia. We do not need to hold these nations--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--hostage to any perceived inability or lack of will on our part to act independently on Bosnia. 
So I say to my colleagues that this Senator from West Virginia does not lack the will to work to establish a policy and a specific, detailed authorization for the U.S. mission in Bosnia. I do not favor open-ended commitments to deploy forces to Bosnia, and I do not favor giving this administration or any other administration a free rein to involve our men and women in uniform in the kind of policing actions that got us into such trouble in Somalia. I am already working on such an amendment in concert with other Senators, with the intention of offering it to the Department of Defense Authorization bill or perhaps some other vehicle. I welcome the participation of Senator Craig and his cosponsors in this debate. But we do not need to act on this amendment at this time. We do not need to leave this protocol bound and gagged in some dark closet until we ransom it with a debate and legislative action that, I assure you, will take place without a hostage on another occasion on another day and on another measure. 
Although I will vote against this amendment, I assure my colleague from Idaho, and the other supporters of his amendment, that it is not because I do not wish to have a concrete policy regarding Bosnia. I urge Senators to vote against the amendment offered by Senator Craig. 
I thank the Chair, and, Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is considering whether Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary should be admitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This is one of the most important foreign policy issues to be considered by the Senate in recent years, and the outcome will shape the future direction of NATO and our military relationship with our European allies. 
In addressing this question, we should begin with the fundamentals, by examining the past and future purpose of NATO. NATO is a collective security military alliance, with the original purpose of defending Western Europe from a possible attack by the Soviet Union and its allies in the Warsaw Pact. When considered from that perspective, NATO stands as one of the most stunningly successful alliances ever conceived. Not just because it maintained the peace for over forty years--other alliances in human history have kept the peace for longer periods of time. The success of NATO cannot be judged merely by time, but also by the scope of its mission. For, unlike previous military alliances, NATO was not intended merely to prevent another conventional war, but also to deter nuclear war. At stake was--and still is--nothing less than the preservation of global civilization, and the world owes a debt of gratitude to the alliance and its leaders for maintaining the peace. 
Some have argued that NATO also serves to maintain democratic traditions, since its original purpose was to protect Western democracy from an attack by an authoritarian Warsaw Pact. Today, NATO continues to defend those democratic values, which are part of the criteria in the decision to expand the membership of the alliance. 
Nonetheless, NATO continues to be, first and foremost, a defensive alliance. Critics of NATO expansion question whether Russia perceives NATO to be defensive or offensive, and argue that the admission of the these three new members will `alarm' Russia. These critics believe that Russian nationalists will perceive the expansion of NATO to be the enlargement of an offensive alliance aimed squarely at the heart of Russia, rather than the enlargement of a defensive agreement among nations inclined to keep, not break, the peace. 
The question of Russian nationalists, and their future role in their own country, speaks to the core of the issues surrounding the future of NATO. The question is not only how Russian nationalists react today, but also whether the most militaristic and virulent nationalists might gain power in the future, and whether that could pose a renewed threat to peace in Europe. 
Russia is unstable in virtually every societal area--her economy is weak, her military in shambles, and civil order is increasingly dominated by violence and corruption. Although we all sincerely hope that this wounded bear will regain her health and settle into a peaceful way of life that protects the interests of all her citizens and which deals fairly and openly in the community of nations, it is not at all clear that democratic traditions will survive within that nation for the next ten years. Some have argued that the expansion of NATO could be a factor in bringing the nationalists to power. The available evidence suggests that this is not the case. The Yeltsin government has publicly accepted the expansion of NATO, and public opinion polls indicate that the Russian populace is barely aware of this question, and everyday Russians do not have strong opinions on the question of NATO expansion. They are far more concerned about bread and jobs than they are about NATO. 
If authoritarian nationalists are to gain power in Russia in the future, that sad scenario will be caused by the fundamental instability of Russian democratic institutions, and the general collapse of the economy, not by NATO expansion. If nationalists seize power, and impose a new militaristic dictatorship upon Russia, it will pose a new threat to the peace of Europe, and the continuation of NATO will be essential to again preserve that peace. We might again face the question of a newly hostile Russia that possesses a still formidable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles. 
I would also note that critics of NATO expansion argue this question both ways. They argue that we dare not enlarge NATO because it might irritate or anger the most virulent of the Russian nationalists, yet those same critics do not address the question of the threat posed by a future rise to power of those very same nationalists. 
In the event of the rise to power of authoritarian nationalists in Russia, NATO would be strengthened by the admission of these three nations. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic occupy key geopolitical positions in the heart of central Europe. For that reason alone, their addition to NATO is of strategic importance. These three nations have also met the criteria for membership, and their inclusion in NATO would more firmly cement their ties to the U.S. and Western Europe. 
Another related question is whether we should enlarge NATO now, or wait until some undefined future date. There is little to be gained through delay, since the Russian government has largely accepted the addition of these three countries to NATO. The diplomatic and political conditions are not likely to be any better in the future, and there is a serious risk that circumstances may only worsen. For example, if militaristic nationalists gained power in Russia in the future, they would likely vehemently object to any expansion of NATO. NATO would likely not act to expand the alliance in the face of such Russian opposition, fearing that it might lead to renewed cold war tensions. The bottom line is that we would not be able to expand NATO at the very time that such enlargement would be in our national interest. Under such circumstances, NATO might deeply regret not including Poland, with the geopolitically important Polish plain, as part of NATO. 
It is probably true that some xenophobic Russian nationalists will tell their people that NATO enlargement poses a threat to their country. But we know, as do they, that this argument is entirely false. NATO is inherently a defensive alliance. Its military structure revolves around the defense of its own territory, and not around the launching of offensive operations aimed at subjugating Russia. We cannot base our foreign policy upon the paranoid concerns of the opponents of democracy in Russia. They will advance arguments to undermine democracy and U.S.-Russian relations regardless of what we do. 
Another important question is whether there should be another round of NATO enlargement, and if so, which nations should be included. Critics of NATO expansion have argued that a decision to admit Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic implies yet another round of expansion, and that if we start down this path, we will inevitably include even more nations into NATO. 
In my opinion, there is nothing inevitable about this at all. I am voting on the admission of three nations, and only three nations. My vote to admit those three does not imply either approval or disapproval for any other nations. If this or any future administration decides to recommend another round of countries for admission to NATO, that recommendation must receive the consent of the Senate to become a reality. 
I want to clearly separate our vote on enlargement today from any vote in the future on other nations. I recognize that there are deep-seated concerns about the possible future admission of the Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. These are important questions, which would be carefully evaluated by the Senate, and any decision involving the admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic stands by itself. 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has performed a vital role in maintaining the peace and deterring catastrophic nuclear war. I believe that the enlargement of NATO, by including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, will further strengthen that role in the future. Therefore, I will cast my vote in favor of expansion.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding. I also thank the distinguished majority leader for calling to the attention of Senators the following standing order, which I hope that Senators will contemplate. And I congratulate the majority leader for enforcing this regulation. Any Senator may ask the Chair to enforce this regulation at any time. I have often thought about it. I think we ought to follow this regulation, Mr. Leader, and I hope that we will establish this as a practice and continue to do it. 
The Senate would make a much better impression, not only upon the visitors but also on Senators themselves, if they learn to sit in their seats to answer the rollcall. And they will take greater pride in this institution. I guarantee that, watching from the galleries, it would be a much more impressive sight during rollcall votes than what we have been accustomed to seeing down here in the well, which looks like the floor of a stock market. I have been to the stock market on a few occasions. It doesn't look any worse. 
Let me read this standing order of the Senate. It is on page 157 of the Senate manual. All Senators who wish to read it, here it is. It is only three lines. The heading, `VOTES SHALL BE CAST FROM ASSIGNED DESK.' 
Resolved, that it is a standing order of the Senate that during yea and nay votes in the Senate, each Senator shall vote from the assigned desk of the Senator. 
This was by Senate Resolution 480 in the 98th Congress, the Second Session, October 11, 1984. 
This is a great day for me. I am glad to see the leader asking that Senators abide by this regulation, which we voted on, those of us who were here in 1984. 
I thank the leader.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Wednesday evening, the committee of conference on the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, had its first opportunity to sit down in full conference and discuss the differences between H.R. 2400 and S. 1173, respectively, the House- and Senate-passed highway bills. As a Senator who is not a member of the conference committee but as a Senator who is, nevertheless, deeply committed to increasing substantially the size of our national investment in transportation infrastructure, I rise to urge the conferees to complete expeditiously their deliberations on the highway reauthorization bill. The conferees and all Senators are fully cognizant of the imminent--the imminent--arrival of May 1, the date beyond which all States will be prohibited by law from obligating any Federal-aid highway funds. 
Senators will recall that, during the months of February and March, I and a number of other supporters of the Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner amendment, spoke on the Senate floor on a daily basis to discuss the critical need for the Senate to turn immediately to the ISTEA, or the highway, reauthorization bill. I thought it was extremely important that all 100 Senators, all 50 Governors, and the thousands of State legislators and mayors and transportation agencies throughout our Nation were fully aware that the Surface Transportation Extension Act--the short-term ISTEA extension bill passed at the end of last year--includes a deadline on the authorization of our federal aid highway and transit programs. That short-term bill, P.L. 105-130, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, includes the following passage, and I quote from the law of the land. 
The Magna Carta of 1215, which the English barons forced King John to sign at Runnymede on the meadow near the Thames River, had a phrase within it, `the law of the land.' That was the phrase, `the law of the land.' And our own American Constitution later used the phrase `due process.' `Due process.' We speak of the due process law. Due process is an evolution from the law of the land in the Magna Carta. 
So I want to read this following passage from the law of the land:

Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, on another matter, I desire to compliment Senator Ted Kennedy on his stalwart, unstinting, and unyielding support of public education. I, on yesterday and on previous days, voted in opposition to Senator Kennedy's position on amendment after amendment to the education bill that was before the Senate, the bill which passed the Senate last evening. But Senator Kennedy never falters--never falters. I did not agree with him, and that is why I voted differently on some of the amendments and on the passage of the bill. 
But I, nevertheless, never hesitate to admire his supreme dedication to the education of our children and to the support of the public school system. He has done a magnificent job over the years. When I was majority leader, he was just as magnificent, just as unyielding in his support of public education, always a superb committee chairman and today a superb ranking member of the committee. 
He is undaunted always. He is always constant. You know where he stands. 
How hard it is---- 
As we read from Caesar: 
How hard it is for women to keep counsel! 
But I am constant as the northern star, 
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality 
There is no fellow in the firmament. 
That is pretty constant, isn't it? Let us go over it again. 
How hard it is for women to keep counsel! 
Now that is not a part of my thinking in this instance, but that is part of the quotation. 
Now I am thinking of Senator Kennedy. 
But I am constant as the northern star, 
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality 
There is no fellow in the firmament. 
So even though I differ in my position, especially with respect to this bill that was passed yesterday, differ in some respects from my colleague, Senator Kennedy, I admire him and commend him and salute him for his constancy in standing for what he thinks is the best for our young people. 
And, of course, in differing with Senator Kennedy, I, too, stood for what I thought was best for our children. I deplore some of the things that are being said in an attempt to equate highways with schools or with education. The country needs both. The country is in dire need of investment in infrastructure in this country. Both highways and education, the education of our young people, both constitute infrastructure. 
And I think it is unwise to attempt to equate one with the other and say, `Oh, we are spending billions of dollars on highways. Why should we not spend like amounts on education?' I am for both. But why equate education with highways or highways with education? We cannot have one without the other. We have to have both. And so I hope the administration will get off that tack of trying to equate highway funding with education funding. We can be for both roads and schools and be for our children in being for both, without speaking disparagingly of either. 
My concerns, as I stated yesterday, grew out of the deplorable state of elementary and secondary education as we view it today and as we view its results. And as I cited on yesterday, certain reports indicate that we are not doing very well in the education of our young people. And while some people seem to be saying just spend more and more money, we cannot continue to just throw money at the problem and expect to resolve it. 
I have been voting for more money for elementary and secondary education now for 33 years, since the legislation was first passed in 1965. For decades I have always been found at the gate protecting and supporting Federal funds for public schools and for our education programs. 
But when one goes the last mile of the way and concludes from what he sees, from what he hears, and from what he reads, concludes from analytical reports about public education that we are not doing well, that there is something wrong, then it seems to me that, in the interest of the public school system, we may have to try a little different approach, else the confidence of the American people in that system and the support of the American people for that system are going to erode. We see that happening. 
One of the things that I am greatly concerned about is the kind of textbooks that our children are being given in the schools--books that are almost devoid of history, according to one of the reports yesterday. Many teachers are putting textbooks aside, not using them, and depending upon materials that they--the teachers--develop for themselves. That is a sad commentary. One of the reports indicated that in many States the subject of history is no longer being taught. That is a tragedy. How are we going to be able to judge current events if we have no knowledge of what happened yesterday or in yesteryear or a decade ago or a century ago? These are guideposts, and history will help us to determine, with some amount of knowledge and wisdom, the solutions that are needed concerning events and problems of today. 
Byron, in speaking of history, said, `History, with all her volumes vast, hath but one page.' `History, with all her volumes vast, hath but one page.' Now, what did Byron mean by that? He meant that history does really, essentially, repeat itself. And I think it does. Why? Because human nature has never changed. 
When God created the world and the solar system and all of this universe and other universes--and he is still creating the universes, still creating stars, God created man, and gave him a will. If we read Milton's `Paradise Lost,' we read much about man's having been given the faculty of reasoning and having been given the power of the will. He may exercise his will. 
He has been given a memory. History is a compilation, in many ways, a compilation of memories. And if we don't have any sense of history, then we will find ourselves lacking. 
Cicero said with respect to history, `To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.' 
I recall that Herodotus, the father of history, who lived circa 484-424 B.C., wrote about Cyrus the Great of Persia. He wrote about Cyrus and Darius and Xerxes. Writing of Cyrus, he told the story of how Cyrus had been very successful as a ruler of Persia. Cyrus ruled in Persia, ruled as the king of Anshan, from 559 B.C. to 550 and then as the king of Cyrus, all the Persians and the Medes, from 550 to 529 B.C. As Cyrus was nearing the end of his reign, he desired to enlarge upon his provinces and he conceived the idea of going into the area of the world northeast of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, which was the land of the Scythians. The ruler of the Massagetae was a woman. Her name was Tomyris. 
Cyrus came to a great river. He called about him his wise men, his seers, his soothsayers and top generals, and asked them for their opinions as to whether or not he should cross the river and pursue his dreams of adding to his mighty provinces by defeating the Scythians. His advisors urged him to cross over the river. Some years earlier, Cyrus had defeated Croesus at the battle of Thymbra, in 546 B.C. Croesus was at that time the ruler of Lydia--Croesus, the richest man in the world, I suppose. But Cyrus didn't execute Croesus as one whom he had defeated, but he took Croesus into his court and used him as an advisor. 
On this occasion, Cyrus got one piece of advice from his generals, and he then asked Croesus what his opinion was. Croesus said this: 
`There is a wheel on which the affairs of men revolve but its movement forbids the same man to be always fortunate.' 
What was Croesus telling Cyrus? He was saying that history repeats itself. And in my own life, in my perception of things, I have seen men successful for a while, but it doesn't always last. Croesus gave to Cyrus this good advice, which, indeed, was a warning. 
Let me just say briefly that Cyrus disregarded the advice of Croesus and crossed the river. And Tomyris, the ruling queen of the Massagetae, sent word to Cyrus, urging him to go back into his country, telling him that he had been a successful king; but promising him that, if he continued in his efforts to subjugate, to conquer, the Massagetae, he would get his fill of blood. 
Cyrus disregarded the words of Tomyris and there was a great battle. Cyrus lost the battle. 
Herodotus tells us that after the battle, Tomyris sent her men around the field to find Cyrus. They found his body. Tomyris prepared a large bag of skins and filled that bag with blood. When the body of Cyrus was brought to her, she had the head severed from the body. She thrust Cyrus' head into the bag that was filled with blood, and said, `I promised you that, if you persisted in attacking my people, you would get your fill of blood. I have kept my pledge.' 
Now, Mr. President, I believe that history is exceedingly important for people who wish to become statesmen, for people who wish to become teachers, lawyers, ministers, doctors. Why would we want in our country to put history aside and to substitute social studies? One of the reports that I referred to on yesterday indicated that history had become a `curricular swamp' and indicated also that in many States among the 50, history is not even being taught as a study. 
What is happening to America? No wonder our children are going to grow into men and women without any idea as to what happened before they were born. Cicero would not have thought very well of that. There are people who think that we ought to get away from memorizing things. Well, how could I ever instantly come up with the answer to the question, `How much is eight times nine?' or `How much is six times seven?' if I hadn't memorized my multiplication tables? 
History, as I said yesterday, is a matter of dates and 
heroes. That was my own way of putting it. 
As a boy, I walked the red clay roads of Mercer County in southern West Virginia and attended a little two-room schoolhouse and studied Muzzey and his history of the American people. I studied Muzzey by the light of an old kerosene lamp--I memorized my history lessons. My first heroes were men like Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Thomas Benton, Nathanael Greene. I studied about the Revolutionary War. We read about Francis Marion, the swamp fox, and Daniel Morgan. We read the story of Nathan Hale, who said, `I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.' Those were our heroes. 
Are we reaching a point in American history when young people no longer have heroes, except what they see on TV? Is that going to be the history that they will remember? 
As the story in the Washington Post had related, to which I referred on yesterday, textbooks are being written in ways that seek to avoid offending this little interest group or that little interest group or some other little interest group, as a result of which the pages are becoming so bland and meaningless that they end up offending everybody. 
If we want to really improve the public school system and the education received in the public school system, then we ought to demand textbooks that are meaningful and not just filled with pictures. `A picture is worth a thousand words,' but not a whole 
book of pictures. There has to be some substance that goes with the dessert--some beans, potatoes, cabbage, and corn bread to go along with the dessert, some substance that teaches high morals and teaches the basics, teaches our children to read and to write and to spell, and teaches them about arithmetic, science, history, and geography. 
We used to have our little spelling matches on Friday afternoons back in that little two-room schoolhouse. I always looked forward to Friday afternoon. I looked forward to those occasions when I would be able to stand up with other boys and girls and see who was the last to be left standing. He or she was the champ. And then we would have contests in addition and multiplication, with a piece of chalk on the blackboard. Who was the best math student? 
Those teachers were dedicated when I was a boy. They loved us and we loved them. They inspired us and we, each of us, wanted to get that pat on the back, that pat on the shoulders from the teacher, saying, `You did well.' We were inspired by those teachers. They weren't paid much. I can remember that, during the Great Depression, teachers had to give up a certain percent of their paychecks in order to get them cashed. They were dedicated teachers. That was their life. We had great teachers. We had good textbooks. We had discipline in the schoolroom. 
My foster dad was not my natural father, but he raised me. He always told me that if I got a whipping at school, I would get another whipping when I came home. 
You will find most people of my age who received the same warnings from their parents. `If you get a whipping at school, we are not going to the schoolhouse and beat up on the teacher. We are going to see you in the back room.' We knew they meant business. The parents supported the teachers. They supported discipline in the school. How can children learn and how can teachers teach unless we have discipline in the schools? They can't do it. There has to be discipline in the schoolrooms. 
There is something more than just money that the public school system in America needs today. And the public school system had better get its act together. Here I am, after 33 years of giving solid support to the public school system in America, saying if there is another approach that will work. Let's try it. We are not doing too well, as it is, plowing this same old furrow. We have to make some changes. I think we need to start with the textbooks. Teachers ought to be paid well. Not all teachers are good teachers. Not all Senators are good Senators. People will take care of that sooner or later, hopefully. But not all teachers are good teachers. Yet, there are a lot of good teachers and there are a lot of good students. 
In speaking of good students, let me brag about my grandsons and granddaughters. I have a grandson named Darius, who has a doctorate in physics, a pretty tough subject, I would say. I doubt that his grandfather could do that well. Darius has a degree, a Ph.D. in physics. He was married recently. He married a young lady who is working on her Ph.D. in physics at the University of Virginia. I have another grandson who will receive his Ph.D. in physics just within a few weeks, before the summer is over. I also have a son-in-law who is a Ph.D. in physics. I could speak at great length about my sons-in-law and daughters and grandsons 
 and granddaughters. I will not do that today. But I have made my point. Those grandsons who have received Ph.D.s in physics didn't get those Ph.D.s in physics watching television. They didn't get those Ph.D.s reading trash. They read good books. They were taught by good teachers. 
We have a lot of young people in this country who want to learn. I have tried to encourage young people. My wife and I sent a young Chinese orphan through college some years ago. We paid her tuition and for her books because her mother had died of cancer. My wife and I knew that the mother, who had discovered that she had terminal cancer, was very concerned about her daughter. They were no relation to us. We happened to get acquainted with them because we visited in those days, a lot of restaurants in the area. At one point we had visited over 100 restaurants in Northern Virginia and Maryland and the District of Columbia. We came to know this Chinese couple. When they were faced with this tragedy, my wife and I said to the woman, `We are going to see that your child has a college education. If she continues to make good grades in school and graduates with good character, and if she will go to American University, we will see that she has her tuition and her books paid for.' 
I chose American University because I had graduated from there with a law degree at the age of 45. I never intended to practice law. Nobody told me to do it. I wanted the experience of being in a classroom with other law students. I went to law school for 10 years at night while serving in the House of 
Representatives and in the Senate. In fact, I just received my baccalaureate in political science from Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1994. 
It never gets too late to learn. Solon, that great lawgiver who was one of the seven wise men of Greece, said, `I grow old in the pursuit of learning.' One never gets too old to learn, and it is one of the best ways to stay young--continue to study, to learn. 
As I was saying yesterday, in 1969 I decided I wanted to establish a little recognition for the high school valedictorians in West Virginia. I came up with the idea of having a `Robert C. Byrd Scholastic Recognition Fund.' At that time I bought, out of my own pocket, a $25 savings bond for each high school valedictorian. It only cost $18.75, I believe. But if and when it matured it would be worth $25. It wasn't a great amount of money. Nobody gave me a bond when I graduated from high school. But I wanted to give a little recognition to the exceptional students in the high schools of West Virginia. I remember in one high school there were seven students, I believe, who tied with a 4.0 average. I gave seven $25 bonds to the students in that school. A little recognition like that is what our young people need. In recent years, I have established a trust fund, and the bond is a $50 bond. 
I often talk with the pages here. I try to take a little time out of my day once in a while to tell them some good stories written by Tolstoy or by other great authors, like Chaucer. We talk about wholesome, good works by great authors; a little encouragement along that line. We never know when we toss a pebble in the water where the ripples will end. They go on and on. We don't know where a little word of encouragement to these young people might take them. 
Then a few years ago, I devised legislation that would provide for a national scholarship of $1,500 to be awarded to the same number of students in each State as there are representatives from each State in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The criteria require that those children excel in scholastic studies. What they do as athletes doesn't count. Neither do extracurricular activities. 
There is a rightful place for sports. But the country's values are made to stand on their heads when people revere a little too much the athletes while not recognizing the young people who are working in the laboratories and in the libraries and in the schoolrooms poring over textbooks day and night. 
So what I am saying is, we ought to readjust our values. Let each have its proper place. But no ball game ever changed the course of history. I do not say that disparagingly about ball games. We all like to watch them. But it is the young people who study science, math, algebra, history, physics, these other disciplines; they are the people who keep this country with its finely honed cutting edge in technology; they are the people who put an American on the Moon. 
Let's get back to basics. Let's recognize our young people and encourage them to study, to read good books, get away from the trash that is on TV. It might be a good thing for some adults, too. Get off that couch and quit watching so much of that junk. It is junk, most of it. I have seen some good movies on television. Alistair Cooke used to have some great movies. But for the most part, TV programming is lousy. I am not sure, if my daughters were growing up today, that I would even have a television set in my house. It is a great medium for good, but it is very destructive, the kind of programming 
of which we see all too much today. 
I have taken some time this afternoon because I wanted to compliment Ted Kennedy. I also wish to compliment Senator Coverdell and all those who worked hard for the bill yesterday as well as those who opposed the bill. They all have at heart the welfare of the children of this country. I thought a little bit of my own homespun philosophy thrown in while no other Senator seeks the floor this afternoon, wouldn't hurt either.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this bill. Some amendments have been adopted, however, with which I do not agree, and I would prefer that they had not been adopted. But that was the Senate's will. Even so, I think this is a new approach and it is entitled to be tested. So I am going to support this legislation for that reason. 
Mr. President, the Bible tells us that Solomon prayed for wisdom and knowledge. He did not pray for riches. He did not pray for honor. He did not pray for the life of his enemies. He asked the Creator for knowledge and wisdom, and perhaps we in the Senate should do the same. 
Mr. President, I am very concerned by our Nation's failure to produce better students despite the billions of Federal dollars appropriated every year for various programs intended to aid and improve education. To put it simply, the sums of money invested in our Nation's education system continue to grow each year and, yet, the quality of our Nation's students does not keep pace. 
Several Senators have championed efforts to improve the dilapidated state of our Nation's school buildings, and I commend them for their leadership. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), over fourteen million students attend schools in need of major renovations, and I am concerned by this figure. Then, why, my colleagues may ask, have I chosen to vote against an initiative to use Federal funds for construction of our Nation's school buildings? It is not because I do not recognize the benefits or the need for better school facilities--I certainly do. The GAO has estimated that the total bill for addressing this problem nationally tops $100 billion. However, I have reservations about the administration's approach to school repair and construction, which may be more appropriate for better-heeled school districts than are to be found in West Virginia and other rural States. Many poor districts do not have the ability to repay any loan, even an interest-free loan. 
We are right to be concerned about dilapidated school buildings in this Nation. However, Mr. President, I believe that before the Federal Government embarks upon the new mission of providing massive amounts--and they will be massive amounts--of scarce Federal dollars for school construction, we should just step back and take a fresh look at why our students are not performing well scholastically. Is it due to aging school buildings? No. Reasons much more fundamental than aging school buildings underlie the poor academic performance by American students. It is these problems which must be addressed. 
Senators stand on this Floor and we argue about the benefits of tax credits for education, we argue about funds for aging schools, we argue about funds for private schools versus funds for public schools. Yet, I tell you that I believe we are all just talking past each other and past the problem. The problem is rather clear. It has two major components. The problem with education in America has, as its root, (1) the quality of our teachers, and (2) the quality of what they are teaching. 
We have many good teachers and many of us owe more than we can ever pay to our good teachers. I had dedicated teachers when I was a child. They didn't get paid much back in those days. We came through the Great Depression. But they were dedicated. They loved the children that they taught and they inspired us to excel. And a good teacher can do that, can inspire his or her students to excel, to try harder, to work harder, and strive to be at the head of the class. 
According to the Third International Math and Science Study, released on February 24 of this year, `U.S. 12th graders outperformed only two (Cyprus and South Africa) of the 21 participating countries in math and science.' This is deplorable, absolutely deplorable. 
Why is it that from 1993 to 1998, education spending has increased by 25 percent, and at the same time, results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rank U.S. high school seniors among the worst participants in the areas of math and science? Why is that? Why is it that in all three content areas of advanced mathematics, U.S. advanced mathematics students' performance was among the lowest of the twenty-one participating nations? It is not because of lack of money. 
James A. Garfield, one of the Presidents, said with regard to the value of a true teacher: `Give me a log hut, with only a simple bench, Mark Hopkins on one end and I on the other, and you may have all the buildings, apparatus and libraries without him.' He wasn't talking about massive buildings, impressive halls and corridors. So why is it? Why is it that in all three content areas, as I say, of advanced math, U.S. advanced--the best--math students' performance was among the lowest of the 21 participating nations? These are supposed to be our Nation's stellar students, our Nation's best students. This is not to say that all our students fall short. We have some excellent students. We have some good schools. 
I am 100 percent for education. In all my life I have endeavored to press to improve myself. I wanted to start at the beginning, start with myself, improve myself. And I think I have--my colleagues know that. I also wanted to help others. So, in 1969, almost 30 years ago, I started a program in West Virginia to reward the high school valedictorians. And I started a program that is referred to as the Robert C. Byrd Scholastic Recognition Fund. When I began it, I began it with money out of my own pocket. In the beginning, a $25 savings bond was presented to each high school valedictorian in the State of West Virginia. That was in 1969. After a while, I established a trust fund for purchasing the savings bonds, which, in recent years, have been $50 bonds. I wanted to reward students--not the athletes, they get their rewards--but the students who work hard to excel in reading and in mathematics and algebra and geometry and music and so on, encourage those students to excel and to recognize them for excellence. As I say, we recognize the great athletes. We don't recognize the best spellers. Often I hear my colleagues talk about their State's No. 1 standing in football teams and so on. The question that occurs to me is how well can they spell? How well can they add and subtract and multiply and divide? How well can they read? That is what we need to reward--the children who are in the libraries and in the laboratories and who are working hard to improve themselves, to get an education. 
So I am 100 percent for education but I want to have some confidence, more than I presently have, that my vote to spend the hard-earned dollars of taxpayers will produce a return to merit that investment. I have been voting for Federal aid to education for decades--not just years, for decades--since 1965, to be exact. That was the year in which the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed as well as the Higher Education Act. I have been supporting those acts. 
But, we still seem to be losing the battle against mediocrity. I do not want to vote against spending for education. But, Mr. President, when do we admit that we are doing poorly, and try something new? It is glaringly apparent from the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and other similar studies that increased education funding does not necessarily translate--does not necessarily translate--into higher student achievement levels. An even more recent study, conducted by the Fordham Foundation, a private organization committed to quality-based reform of elementary and secondary education, indicates the low quality of state standards in math and science. In mathematics, the Nation flunks, with only three States out of 50 receiving a grade of an `A', and just nine others a grade of `B'. In science, the United States is just mediocre, if we can call it that, with nine States failing and seven earning `D's'. 
The Thomas B. Fordham Foundation found that our schools are also doing a pretty dismal job of teaching history and geography. I quote from the foreword of the report on history: `. . . the vast majority of young Americans are attending school in states that do not consider the study of history to be especially important.' 
Now think of that. 
`. . .the vast majority of young Americans are attending schools in states that do not consider the study of history to be especially important.' 
Napoleon said: `Let my son often read and reflect on history; this is the only true philosophy.' That was Napoleon. 
`No doubt some children are learning lots of solid history from excellent teachers in fine schools. Their good fortune, however, appears to be serendipitous. State standards rarely constitute a ceiling on what can be taught and learned. But it's not unreasonable to view them as the floor below which no child or school should fall . . . when it comes to history, most states have placed that floor where the sub-basement ought to be . . . in only a few instances is history itself the focus of the state academic standards that pertain to it. In most jurisdictions, history remains mired in a curricular swamp called `social studies,' . . . ' 
Social studies is all right. I don't have any quarrel with social studies, but let's also have history. Let's don't substitute social studies for history. There is no substitute for history. 
History, of all things, is not thought to be important enough in many of our states to be taught as a separate subject, and that is most unfortunate. 
Mr. President, merely continuing along this same path of proliferating education programs and investing more and more Federal dollars into our Nation's education system will not solve the problem of improving the quality of our Nation's students. 
I congratulate our colleagues who work diligently on their committees to bring bills to the floor and manage the bills, who are highly dedicated to serving the students of the Nation and to improving the schools of the Nation and to getting better teachers. I congratulate my colleagues for their efforts. They, too, must become discouraged. 
On a fundamental level, however, there is something askew with the way we are approaching education in this Nation. 
I started out in a little two-room schoolhouse along about 1923, when we did not have hand calculators. Lord, have mercy--calculators? We did not have them. We did not have computers or other high technology. We did not have much money for supplies, just the bare essentials. We got by with spring water. We had only one bucket in the school room. A two-room school; two buckets in the school. I was glad when the teacher chose me from time to time to go with another lad across the hill to the spring to bring back the bucket of water. We all drank out of the same bucket and out of the same dipper. 
We didn't have any indoor plumbing. We had an outhouse--a couple of them--and we didn't have electricity. When the storms came, we had to light a candle or a kerosene lamp. So I do know something about so-called `difficult' conditions. I am one of those children who started out with the bottom two or three rungs of the ladder gone; they were missing. 
In those days, mathematics was about rules, memorized procedures, memorized multiplication tables and other methodical tables. Science was stern stuff. History was about dates and heroes. That is where many of us who went to school in the mountains and hollows of West Virginia learned about our heroes, the people we wanted to be like. 
There is where we learned about Nathanael Greene, one of Washington's top generals, perhaps his top one. Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox; Daniel Morgan; Nathan Hale, who died on September 22, 1776, because he had been asked by George Washington to go behind the British lines and to draw pictures of the breastworks and other military excavations, and so on. Hale was discovered the night before he was about to return. He had these drawings in his pockets. The next morning, he was executed. 
He was asked if he had anything he would like to say. He had already asked for a Bible and a chaplain and had been denied both of those. He asked if he had any statement. He said, `I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.' 
So there in our history books is where we children first learned about American heroes, our heroes. 
History was about dates and heroes. And with these basics, the United States became a mighty industrial power, a leader in medicine, and a winner of world wars. But, somewhere along the line, we seem to have gotten off the track. Today, our students have algebra textbooks that include discussions of chili recipes and hot pepper varieties. I made a speech on this floor a year or so ago about this and brought the particular so-called algebra book with me. And these textbooks do not even begin to define an algebraic expression until page 107--107 in this particular book, so it is no wonder that our students do not fare better on international tests such as the TIMSS! 
On Friday, March 20, I noted an article on the front page of the Washington Post, which reported a new trend among teachers to teach without the benefit of textbooks. The article discussed how teachers are increasingly relying on the Internet or on materials that they prepare themselves, and spurning the traditional student textbook. Now, what is the reason for this phenomenon? I quote from the Post piece, `Scientific knowledge is expanding so rapidly that many textbooks are outdated only a few years after they are published. Recent political disputes'--get this; this is the Washington Post talking--`Recent political disputes over textbook content have made publishers wary of offending any interest group, and the result is that the books have become bland and shallow, some teachers complain. . . . Some teachers even cite a decline in children's reading skills as a rationale for abandoning the tomes.' 
Mr. President, imagine that. Our kids can't read well enough to effectively digest a textbook. And furthermore, textbooks have become such worthless amalgams of touchy-feely, politically correct twaddle, that many teachers are casting them aside in favor of doing the extra work to prepare material themselves. 
Mr. President, if we ever hope to improve the quality of students in this country, it is essential that we recultivate an interest in education for its own sake--education for education's sake--not only in our Nation's children, but also in their parents. Our Nation's ailing education system is, in part, influenced by the parents of those children, and of young adults attending high school and college. Parents need to take an active role in their children's education. Without parental involvement, dumbed-down textbooks will continue to creep into the local school systems, and it will be our children and our grandchildren who suffer. 
I hope that we do not try to tell the American people that fighting over school vouchers or the size of an education IRA, or even the repair of our school buildings will solve the problem of the often shallow, substandard, low quality education we are offering our kids these days. I strongly suspect that our students' poor performance as scholars has a lot more to do with the general dissolution of the family structure, loss of respect for authority, rampant alcohol and drug use by students even in the lower grades, and a pervasive change in attitudes about the value of discipline, than it does with dilapidated school buildings. 
We can rebuild all the school buildings that we want, and, yes, I agree that we undoubtedly need to modernize and to rebuild some of these structures, but let no one believe that school construction will solve what is wrong with education in this country today. The problems assail us from many directions. How can our teachers teach if they have to create their own textbooks as well as attempt to maintain discipline, and please every interest group? When one considers the meager salaries of teachers generally, and having to struggle against the backdrop of a society that glorifies athletics and the attainment of any type of celebrity far more than it cares about scholarship, it is easy to see why good teachers are increasingly hard to come by. How can mundane scholarship, which requires commitment and hard work on the part of the student, compete with sensational television and movies that offer brutal murder, steamy sex, and filthy language as standard daily fare for our young people? What in the world has happened to a society that is intent on rewriting every single discipline from algebra to geometry to history to be sure that those essential basic subjects are, first and foremost, absolutely politically correct? It has taken us over lock, stock and barrel. We are pulverizing essential knowledge and facts to pulp, easily digested by even the laziest and most undisciplined brains--baby pablum for the mind. 
So, while we rage on here today about which political party will capture the education issue, let us remember that we are only skimming the surface with any and all of these well-intentioned solutions. 
There is something much, much more fundamentally wrong with education in America today than a shortage of funding. The public school system had better shape up, or else public support for it is going to completely erode. And I, for one, am willing to try some new approaches--new approaches--anything that may help our most precious resource. 
The Democratic party is not our most precious resource. The Republican party is not our most precious resource in this country. Our children are our most precious resource--our kids. And so I am willing to try some new approaches to achieve the kind of scholastic excellence that our children need and deserve. 
My only hope is that someday--someday--in some effective manner, we will find the courage and the practical means to address what amounts to educational child abuse in this Nation in a bipartisan fashion. 
It should not make any difference whether the right approach is Democratic or Republican. We ought to forget that stuff. That is mere junk partisanship. What matters is the education of our children. 
There is no room for mere political jousting on a matter of such momentous importance to our people and to our Nation. And that is exactly what the country is witnessing in Washington with regard to the education debate--political jousting. 
Mr. President, with U.S. high school seniors ranking 19th out of the 21 countries in mathematics, and 16th out of 21 countries in science, we must devote greater attention to stimulating excellence in education. Getting back to the basics is the obvious starting point, and we better start now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my vote on the motion to table the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague, Senator Kennedy, to H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools. Despite my support for excellence in teaching and the need for more teachers--high-quality teachers--in the classrooms across America, I voted in favor of tabling the amendment. 
Like many of my colleagues, I realize the importance of quality teachers in our nation's elementary and secondary schools. I started out in a modest two-room schoolhouse where I did not have high-technology equipment or much money for supplies, but what I did have were dedicated teachers who really cared about my future and my education. Today, our children and grandchildren are being taught mathematics by teachers who have no background whatsoever in the subject area--none at all! There are situations in which teachers who have been trained to teach physical science instead find themselves teaching mathematics! That is not right, and not fair to the teacher or--more importantly--to the students. 
This amendment would provide a maximum of $8,000 of loan forgiveness over a five-year period to graduate students entering the teaching profession. Given the rising costs associated with a higher education, this certainly does not amount to much in the eyes of a student faced with loans totaling $50,000 or more. Nor does such an incentive help to bring in more teachers in demand subject areas, such as mathematics. 
Mr. President, the issue and need is for more qualified teachers, not just more teachers. Teaching is a profession for which one must have a true passion as well as dedication and talent. As Aristotle stated so eloquently in his day,  
Teachers who educated children deserved more honour than parents who merely gave them birth; for bare life is furnished by the one, the other ensures a good life. 
This amendment does not ensure that quality teachers will be brought into the classrooms. While ostensibly a targeted amendment designed to help provide better teachers for Title I schools and those schools which lack quality teachers in core subject areas, it would cover over ninety percent of all schools. Over ninety percent, Mr. President. I do not call this targeted. 
While I support the amendment in principle, I believe that it is an unfocused proposal at best. The amendment relies heavily on the hope that limited student loan forgiveness will serve as incentive for graduate students to opt into a teaching profession in lieu of a higher paying job. Furthermore, it does not target the schools which are truly in need of better quality teachers, nor does it ensure that it will be quality teachers in the needed subject areas who make their way into the classrooms. For these reasons, Mr. President, I have voted to table the amendment.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, for the courtesies they have extended to me. 
Mr. President, the distinguished Senator who is now presiding over the Senate, Senator Pat Roberts, quoted me earlier in respect to the Bosnian matter. I wish to quote a great American President--a great American President. And that President's comments were pertinent at the time and are pertinent today. 
Perhaps I should first thank Senator Hutchison for offering the amendment. I can assure her and assure the Senator from Wisconsin that when the time comes to discuss and to consider appropriations for the fiscal year 1999, I shall be active, the Lord willing, in dealing with this matter that is the subject of this amendment; namely, Bosnia and our participation in the circumstances and conditions that presently prevail in that area. 
The constitutional framework arranged by the framers speaks with crystal clarity regarding the war powers. The authority to initiate war rests solely with Congress, except for one narrow area, the defensive authority to repel sudden attacks which is granted to the Commander in Chief. Let us listen, though, for a moment to the words of President Abraham Lincoln, in a letter, to William H. Herndon, on the subject of the exercise of the unfettered use of the war power by a President. 
Mr. Lincoln wrote: 
Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose and you allow him to make war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect after you have given him so much as you propose. If today he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, `I see no probability of the British invading us,' but he will say to you `Be silent. I see it, if you don't.' 
Lincoln continues: 
The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their peoples in war, pretending generally if not always that the good of the people was the object. This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. 
So, Mr. President, Lincoln spoke to the subject in his day. 
This is a very difficult area. It is an area of mixed powers, and the problem is, Presidents in recent years have been prone to put men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces in areas of danger and then call upon the Congress for appropriations to sustain that American manpower, and Congress is reluctant, of course, once the men are in the area, reluctant to be charged with pulling the rug out from beneath them. 
But there has to be an accounting. Congress has to be a part of this equation. Congress has the 
responsibility and duty to make itself heard in this matter. The time will come when we will have that opportunity. I hope that Congress will rise to the situation. 
I will have considerably more to say on this subject at that time, as will others, I am sure. But we cannot just sit back and leave it up to the administration to use the term `Commander in Chief,' which is a British term from the beginning and which was used to designate various army officers in various locations during the time of Charles I, Charles II, and so on. 
That term is not enough. It is time to use the power of the purse. And many of us in this Chamber have fought for that power of the purse. We have resisted the efforts to give the President, whether he be a Democrat or a Republican, a share in the control of the purse. That matter is coming home to roost. We will see here, as we have seen it previously, that Congress' power over the purse is the one voice, the one voice that every administration, Republican or Democratic, will hear and will heed. I hope that we in this body will remember that the time was not too long ago when Congress gave to the President of the United States the line-item veto. When we did that, we stuck a dagger in the back of the Senate. I hope that the Supreme Court will strike that nefarious law dead, dead, dead. 
But that is just one example of our being the culprits in giving to the Chief Executive a power that the Constitution does not give him. But in this case let us speak up. Again, I congratulate the lady from Texas. I will be with her, we will talk, we will work together, and I have a feeling that the administration will come back to the Appropriations Committee and the Armed Services Committee, and I believe that the administration will be shorn of its trappings, which were so impressive, they thought, a year ago as they assured us on the Armed Services Committee that our troops would be in Bosnia only, perhaps, about a year. I think they were dissimulating at the time. I think they knew better than that. I think we had a strong suspicion that that would not be the case. They were being a little disingenuous at the time--not the first time Congress has been treated in that fashion; there have been other times. 
It is time that Congress spoke up and took a stand for this Constitution of ours. 
I thank the Senator from Texas for her courtesy.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by the senior Senator from North Carolina. The administration has been on a nonstop campaign to color the Congress as irresponsible chiselers on U.N. dues. At the same time, however, we are forking over emergency money for Bosnia operations and for Southwest Asia operations in this bill that amounts to nearly $2 billion. 
It was the present NATO-led operation that bailed out the embarrassingly bad failure of the United Nations to keep the peace in Bosnia which had witnessed a modern version of the Holocaust. It was the U.S. military operation, exclusively in Southwest Asia, that gave teeth to the U.N. Secretary General's negotiations with Saddam Hussein, a fact readily admitted by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
The United States has paid out many times over in unilateral costs the so-called arrearages claimed by the United Nations to be owed by the United States in support of the objectives of the United Nations in both theaters. 
The amendment by Mr. Helms is truth in international funding, truth in international fundraising. 
We do not see much in the way of contributions by other members of the Security Council to our operations in either theater. 
The figures used by Mr. Helms, some $6 billion or more in U.S. unilateral outlays since 1990, compared to the trumpeted past due bill of $1 billion we supposedly owe to the United Nations, provides the stark contrast--the stark contrast--the basic unfairness of the charge that the United States is some kind of debtor to the United Nations, some kind of deadbeat, as it were, some kind of chiseler, as it were. 
My mom used to keep boarders back in the coal mining community. And we took on boarders who came to our house. I often listened to a new boarder for a few minutes. From time to time I would say to the woman who raised me--`He's going to beat you out of your board bill. That man won't pay you.' And I was amazed in so many instances to find, to my chagrin, that that man would not pay his board bill. He was a chiseler. That is what we are portrayed to be--chiselers; deadbeats--we will not pay our dues; we will not pay our arrearages. 
The United States has been bailing out the rest of the United Nations for years now. Take the United States out of the United Nations, what do you have left? What is there left? The other members of the United Nations, in fact, owe the United States. They owe us a massive back bill for military operations and funding. 
The first question that was ever asked in the history of the world, in the history of the universe, in the history of all creation, the first question that was ever asked was when God walked through the Garden of Eden, in the cool of the day, searching for Adam and Eve. 
They had forfeited--they had forfeited--their right to that everlasting life in that garden of bliss, a virtual paradise, by eating from the Tree of Knowledge in violation of God's warning not to do so. So God came looking for them in the cool of the day. God asked that first question: `Adam, where art thou?' They had hidden themselves from Him. `Adam, where art thou?' 
Mr. President, we might well ask the other members of the United Nations, `Where were you when we were in the hot sands of the gulf, when we had sent our men and women away from their homes, away from their firesides, away from their children, away from their loved ones to take possible action to protect you and yours? Where were you? Where were you?' 
Mr. President, the time has come for the administration to cool down--cool down--it's hot rhetoric on the matter of the so-called arrearages by the United States. The time has come to see the forest--not just the trees--on the matter of who is fulfilling the responsible role--the responsible role--of international leadership against aggression. 
I commend the Senator for his amendment. I thank him for allowing me to be a cosponsor of it. I hope that it will get a big vote in this Chamber so that a clear message is sent to the whiners--to the whiners--both in New York and down Pennsylvania Avenue on this whole issue. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend, the very distinguished Senator from Alaska, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
I commend the leaders of the Senate for scheduling this very important emergency supplemental appropriations bill so quickly after its having been reported out of the committee, and I was pleased to join our distinguished chairman, Senator Stevens, in taking the unusual step of scheduling our markup of this emergency bill prior to House action, in order to expedite congressional consideration of the bill. This bill contains some $2 billion in emergency appropriations which are urgently needed for the support of our men and women overseas engaged in peacekeeping efforts in both Bosnia and Southwest Asia, as well as to cover necessary repairs resulting from natural disasters at various military installations throughout the Nation. In addition, over $560 million is included in the bill for assistance to those of our citizens who have suffered from natural disasters, such as the flooding in the western and southern portions of the Nation and the ice storms in the northeast and the recent killer tornadoes in Florida. 
The bill also includes some $280 million in appropriations for various nonemergency purposes which are, nevertheless, necessary in order to enable various departments and agencies to continue their operations through the end of this fiscal year, without undue interruption. Of this amount, some $156 million is for the Federal Aviation Administration to expedite its work on improving the Air Traffic Control computer system in order to avoid any problems connected with the year 2000. As noted in the committee report, the Department of Transportation's Inspector General has recently concluded that without this additional assistance, if unexpected problems are identified during testing of the replacement computers, the FAA might find themselves in a situation where they may be unable to assure the safety of the traveling public in the year 2000. Page 25 of the committee report states--and I quote therefrom--that: `Failure to resolve these computer hardware and software deficiencies well before the year 2000 problem could disrupt air traffic.' These nonemergency discretionary appropriations are fully offset, largely through rescissions, which are set forth in Chapter 11 of Title I of the bill. 
Finally, and very importantly, the bill includes $550 million in mandatory appropriations for veterans compensation and pensions. These funds are needed to accommodate the additional costs associated with the 1998 cost-of-living adjustment of 2.1 percent for compensation beneficiaries, as well as an increase in the estimated number of persons receiving such compensation and pension beneficiaries. 
With respect to Bosnia, the President has provided a certification and report, required by the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization and Appropriations Acts, that the continued presence of U.S. armed forces is required after June 30, 1998. The report bears some careful reading by my colleagues, and I hope they will read it, in that there is a departure from the requests of the administration in previous years. The requests in previous years were all couched in the language of short-term duration. 
Last year, the administration told us that we would be out of Bosnia in about a year. 
All of the witnesses who came up before the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee assured the committees that that was the expected timeframe which would be needed during which we would have to place our men and women in possible harm's way, but we were assured--we didn't just ask the question once or twice, and the response didn't come forth just once or twice, but the response was always in the context of a year's time. 
Well, I had strong suspicions then that it wouldn't work out that way, and I have a feeling that the administration felt the same way about it. I had a feeling that the administration was putting the best face on it and that they would be back within a year seeking more money. There is a bit of disingenuousness about it, I think. They probably knew in their own minds and hearts that it couldn't likely be done in a year, but that was the approach, that was the songbook from which everyone in the administration or the witnesses were to sing. It was to be a mighty chorus, everyone in harmony, no one out of tune, no sour notes, no `off' beats, everything orchestrated so that everyone would sound in unison to the effect it would be about a year. 
Having seen this kind of game played before, I was suspicious of it. The time is up now and we are not only in, but we are in for an indefinite amount of time. The President's report doesn't have any end point included. Here is what the President said, now that men and women are there, and I quote from the report: `We do not propose a fixed end-date for the deployment.' Let me repeat that: `We do not propose a fixed end-date for the deployment.' Now, that is a far cry from what the President's people were saying last year, a year ago. But there is a big difference. Once you get the Congress to go along for a little while and get the men over there, then it is a fait accompli for the Congress and they come back saying, `We need more money.' 
`We do not propose a fixed end-date for the deployment.' That says it all. So we are in a different situation now. The exit strategy--in other words, the required conditions for our forces to come out and come home--reads like a nation-building strategy. What is required for us to leave Bosnia? First, judicial reform. Just a minor thing, judicial reform. Then, development of an independent media throughout the territory. Now, that sounds to me like a pretty big order. Then there is more. Democratic elections. What do we mean by democratic elections? Democratic elections followed by free market economic reforms--ahhh, free market economic reforms--privatization of the economy, and so on and on. 
Well, that is an amazing piece of work. I urge my colleagues to read that report. We all get the point. 
This is a formula requiring the completion of a new, integrated democratic state. That is what nation-building is. I didn't buy on to that. The U.S. Senate has not bought onto that. And if the duration of our stay is going to be based on nation-building, as the President is obviously saying in the report, we are there for a good, long time. 
How many Senators want to buy on now? Now is your chance, or your chance will soon come as to whether or not Senators want to buy on for a long time. Who knows, perhaps a good case can be made for it. Perhaps a good case can be made. But I haven't heard it as yet. This Senator from West Virginia is not in there for a good long time. Not yet, certainly. The administration was being disingenuous. Those who came up here and testified last year--obviously they had to say what the administration had required them to say. They all came up before the committees and it was like a broken record to hear everybody say practically the same thing, `We will be there about a year, about a year.' Well, they are the people who are supposed to know. So that is what we were told. 
But I don't believe this is going to be an indefinite free ride. I think the administration ought to have to make its case this time, and it ought to be required to give more specifics, more facts, more reasoning, more reasons for its program. The terms of our involvement are turning into a permanent force, turning into a permanent force, and the pressure to get out is dissipating. The pressure for our allies to take the lead is evaporating, evaporating. 
The distinguished Presiding Officer has stood on some afternoons and seen the Sun `drawing up water,' as they say. The Sun's rays will be peeping through a cloud and we are told that the Sun is drawing up water. But water is evaporating. I often pour water into my little fountain for my birds over in McLean and the water evaporates after a while. The birds get some of it, but it also evaporates. 
Likewise the pressure for our allies to take the lead is evaporating. Our combat forces are going to be there for years if the report is accurate. And the funding is to the tune of some $2 billion per year through regular, so-called `emergency' supplementals. Now, are our allies being asked to defray any of these costs? I support this supplemental request for fiscal year 1998, but the fiscal year 1999 cost of nearly $2 billion should be debated again, when the regular authorization and appropriations bills are considered on this floor. 
We need to debate this regularly because we are spending your money. One of the network's TV programs from time to time talks about spending `your money' and gives examples of projects from time to time that are being supported by Members of Congress or perhaps others, and they will say, `This is your money.' Well, we need to debate this request because we are spending your money, the taxpayers' money. And we need to get some answers. 
Now, when we turn to Southwest Asia, the situation seems to be even worse. Not only do we have 30,000 troops in the region waiting for the signal to go after the Iraqi regime, but our allies are not there with us. 
We look over our shoulders and we don't see anybody. Where are they? It reminds me of the first question that was ever asked through all the eternity, all time and eternity, that preceded the making of the world, the universe. The first question that was ever asked, when God, walking in the cool of the evening, was seeking Adam and Eve, and they were not to be found, and then God said, `Adam, Adam, where art thou?' The first question. 
So, we should say to our friends and our allies, where art thou in this matter? Many countries of the world are not in that immediate region but they depend upon oil from that region. Why are they not assisting? Why are we not asking them to assist? The President, in his report to Congress, speaks about leadership. In other words, we, the eldest remaining superpower, must provide the leadership. Well, it comes with a price tag. I take it we are all providing the money, apparently all of us. We are not asking our friends. We are going to do it whole hog this time. Our friends in the Arab world are cool, to say the least, about building an effective coalition to enforce the U.N. inspections team on Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, we continue to pony up to the tune of $1.3 billion for this current fiscal year. 
My colleagues should be aware that the committee adopted an amendment which I offered and which our distinguished chairman, Mr. Stevens, cosponsored urging the President to go out and get contributions from our friends and allies for financial help, in kind, and other support to share the burden in Southwest Asia against a threat to world peace. Go out and get a little help. People downtown might start out by reading Shakespeare, read about Timon of Athens. Read Shakespeare's `The Life of Timon of Athens.' He, too, sought to get help from his friends. After he had squandered his own wealth on his friends, he sought to get some help from them. One day the bookkeeper said, `Look, Master, we are out of money. You are broke.' Old Timon said, `I am sure my friends will help me. You go see this fellow over here and then go see that one over there--I helped him one day--and this one over here, go see him.' 
Well, Timon was disappointed. He didn't get any help. 
I urge the administration to go out and get contributions from our friends and allies for financial help, in kind, and other support to share the burden in Southwest Asia against a threat to world peace. We fully expect a vigorous campaign by the administration to create an effective international political coalition where the burden is shared. This will take a great deal of effort on the part of the administration's foreign policy team. They talk about all this big debt we owe the U.N. Why not charge off some of the costs that we have been spending and that we are yet spending and that we will continue to spend for a while in dealing with the threat of Saddam Hussein. How about that, Mr. U.N.? How about giving us some credit on those expenditures? We ought to try. We expect that an effort will be made on the part of the administration's foreign policy team, and it will result in a wide-ranging political effort to isolate the regime currently in power in Iraq. 
We face a situation of grave weight and precedent in dealing with this transparent attempt to intimidate the world with weapons of mass destruction. How we handle this threat will be of great importance for the future of effective efforts to control the proliferation of weapons, components, and delivery systems of mass destruction. It is the future of arms control, and we need to pay great attention to it. That is why I offered this amendment in the committee. That is why Mr. Stevens, the chairman of the committee, supported it. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the committee's recommendations as it brings forth this bill, S. 1768. I again commend my chairman and express my appreciation to him for the excellent work he has put forth in bringing the bill to the floor. Also, I thank him for his courtesy and for the good will and friendship that he has continued to extend toward me. 
Now, Mr. President, are amendments in order to the bill?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have offered this amendment on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan. I am very pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from North Dakota in introducing an ambitious new effort on the matter of the Nation's persistent and growing trade deficit. Mr. Dorgan has taken the floor time after time after time and spoken eloquently and very knowledgeably concerning the perennial trade deficits that seem ever to grow larger. This legislation would establish a commission to take a broad, thorough look at all important aspects of trends involving and solutions to the growing U.S. trade deficit, with particular attention to the manufacturing sector. 
The trade deficit, as my colleagues know, is a recent phenomenon--recent in terms of its being over a period of recent years--with large annual deficits only occurring within the last 15 years or so. Between 1970 and 1996, the U.S. merchandise trade balance shifted from a surplus of $3.2 billion--did you hear me, Senators? Our merchandise trade balance has shifted from a surplus of $3.2 billion to a deficit, in 1996, of $199 billion. That is $199 billion. As my colleague, Mr. Dorgan, has suggested, projections by econometric forecasting firms indicate that long-term trends will bring this figure to $300 billion, or more, within the next 10 years. So hold on to your hats. The deficit was $199 billion in 1996, but long-term trends indicate that the figure will go to $300 billion, or more. You better hold on to two hats. It is going to really take off within the next 10 years. No one is predicting a decline in the near future. Sounds kind of like the stock market, doesn't it? This is bad news about the trade deficit. Thus, unless we act, our trade deficits will soon exceed our annual appropriations for the Department of Defense. 
Mr. President, $2 million is made available in this amendment to establish a 12-member congressional commission to be known as the trade deficit emergency review commission, with three members each to be named by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, and by the Speaker and minority leader of the House. At least two of those individuals are to be Senators, and at least two are to be Members of the other body. The purpose of the commission shall be to study the causes and the consequences of the U.S. merchandise trade and current account deficits and to develop trade policy recommendations for the 21st century. The recommendations shall include strategies necessary to achieve market access to foreign markets that fully reflect the competitiveness and productivity of the United States and also improve the standard of living in the United States. 
While it is not clear what the particular reasons for this growing trade deficit may be nor what the long-term impacts of a persistently growing deficit may be, the time is overdue for a detailed examination of the factors causing the deficit. We need to understand the impacts of it on specific industrial and manufacturing sectors. We need to identify the gaps that exist in our databases and economic measurements to understand specifically the impacts of the deficit on such important things as our manufacturing capacity and the integrity of our industrial base on productivity, on jobs, and on wages in specific sectors. 
From time to time, we debate the trade deficits. Both Senator Dorgan and I and other Senators have participated in 
these debates. Senator Dorgan is an expert on the subject. I voted against NAFTA, I voted against GATT, and for good reasons, which every day seem to be becoming clearer and clearer. So we debate these deficits frequently. We moan and we groan, we weep and we shed great tears by the bucketsful. We complain about them, but if we do not understand the nature, the impacts, and the long-term vulnerabilities that such manufacturing imbalances create in our economy and standard of living, we are in the dark. 
It appears to me that debate over trade matters too often takes on the form of lofty rhetorical bombast of so-called `protections' versus so-called `free trade agreements.' But I suggest that neither side knows enough about what is really transpiring in our economy, given the very recent nature of these annual persistent deficits. Certainly, we know that the deficits reflect on the ability of American business to compete abroad. We want to be competitive. Certainly, we know that specific deficits with specific trading partners cause frictions between the United States and those friends and allies. This is particularly the case with the Japanese, as we are well aware, and is becoming quickly the case with China. It will only be when we truly understand the specific impacts of this large deficit on our economy--particularly our industrial and manufacturing base--that the importance of insisting on fair play on the trade account will be clear. 
Finally, the legislation requires the commission to examine alternative strategies--big words, `alternative strategies'--which we can pursue to achieve the systematic reduction of the deficit, and particularly how to retard the migration of our manufacturing base abroad and the changes that might be needed to our basic trade agreements and practices. 
These are the purposes of the commission that Senator Dorgan, I, and other Senators are proposing in this legislation. 
I join in welcoming other Senators. I join with Senator Dorgan in welcoming other Senators to cosponsor the legislation. Senator Dorgan will speak later this afternoon on this subject matter. I again thank him for the leadership that he has been providing and continues to provide on this subject matter. 
I urge Senators to support the amendment.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a great poet of the last century, William Wordsworth, wrote a famous piece of poetry which schoolchildren ought to memorize. They used to memorize it. It begins: 
I wandered lonely as a cloud 
That floats on high o'er vales and hills, 
When all at once I saw a crowd, 
A host, of golden daffodils; 
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. 
Continuous as the stars that shine 
And twinkle in the milky way, 
They stretched in never-ending line 
Along the margin of a bay; 
Ten thousand saw I at a glance, 
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. * * * * * 
For oft, when on my couch I lie 
In vacant or in pensive mood, 
They flash upon that inward eye 
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
And then my heart with pleasure fills, 
And dances with the daffodils. 
Wordsworth surely wrote those lines thinking, of course, of spring and perhaps of March, for again this March, the crisp brown leaves of winter are scattering before the blustery winds, and the daffodils are dancing in the breeze. And like those bright heralds of spring, I come to the floor today to celebrate today's vernal equinox, that celestial marker of winter's end and the beginning of perhaps the most blessed season of the earth's awakening. The dark, cold days of winter may now be safely said to be behind us and we may all begin to think optimistically about shedding our somber coats of wool, our bulky cocoon of hats, gloves, and scarves. 
This winter has had more than the usual share of dreary, wet days in the Washington area. Locales more accustomed to winter and to winter's suntans have borne the psychic weight of day after day after day of unrelenting rain, of 3 months of steady downpour, floods, and mudslides. The mountains of my own West Virginia shouldered aside cold winds that left her ancient hollows heaped with snow--white, cold snow--that otherwise might have fallen on Washington, sheltering us in warmer air that caused flooding rains instead. There is hardly a spot in the nation that has escaped some abnormal weather occurrence, be it flood, freeze, gale, or tornado. I am sure that everyone joins me in welcoming the fading of El NinAE6o's influence over the global weather patterns, but it will be a while before things return to normal. In the Senate, we have begun the recovery from winter's chilly wrath with the consideration of an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that will help to repair the worst of the nation's weather-spawned disasters. 
But just when we begin to doubt that the sun will ever replace automobile headlights as the main source of illumination on our commutes to and from work, the morning brightens to reveal long skeins of Canada geese again filling the sky with their sweet music as they wing their way back northward. The robins, returned to our lawns again, search out worms in the warming earth, and the bluebirds busy themselves with nest building. 
I asked the robin, as he sprang 
From branch to branch and sweetly sang. 
What made his breast so round and red; 
Twas `looking at the sun,' he said. 
The forsythia joins the crocus and daffodils in painting watercolor washes of lavender and yellow across lawns and roadsides. Spring's pale buds are peeping out from under the somber skirts of winter, giving hope on every tree and bulb. The annual pageant of the cherry blossoms cannot be far behind. 
Mr. President, I admit to being no great fan of winter. I had all of the snow--all of the snow that I ever cared for when I was a boy, walking through the hills and mountains and hollows of West Virginia. Neither I nor my little dog, Billy, truly enjoys making our round of the neighborhood in the cold and lonely evenings of winter. I do not like to travel on wet or icy roads, on days so gray that the dawn seems to fade seamlessly into dusk, when snow or sleet drives sideways into the windshield--no, I would rather be hibernating in a comfortable chair with 
a good book, thank you. Not the trash that one finds on the book stands at the airports, but a truly good book written by Emerson or Carlyle. 
And the beauty of the winter landscape is for me too austere, all shades of gray, brown, white, and black, dull after the scarlet and bronze riot of the fall. Give me instead the cheerful chaos of spring, with its stained glass window of colors, its energy, and its great sense of purpose. 
I asked the violets, sweet and blue, 
Sparkling in the morning dew, 
Whence came their colors, then so shy; 
They answered, `looking to the sky'; * * * * * 
I asked the thrush, whose silvery note 
Came like a song from angel's throat, 
Why he sang in the twilight dim; 
He answered, `looking up at Him.' 
So give me dew, instead of frost, on the grass in the morning, and thunderstorms instead of blizzards in the afternoons. And fill my evening sky with fireflies, not icy, twinkling stars. Let me feel the cool breeze from the West Virginia hills on my face while the sun warms my back, and let me listen to the cheerful cacophony of frogs while I spade up sweet garden soil 
in which I shall soon plant my tomatoes--my tomatoes--Big Boy or Better Boy or Beefsteak--whatever. I see our Presiding Officer, who comes from the hills and lakes of Minnesota, smiling. He, too, is thinking of spring. 
Spring is a season for all the senses, a season savored all the more fully because it follows the season of greatest limits. Oh, give me the season so loved by poets, by Wordsworth. 
Having begun with one great poet, perhaps it is only fitting that I close with another, whose life overlapped the first. Robert Browning surely appreciated the mysteries and the joys of spring. As a poet must do if his works are to stand the test of time, he has distilled a deep feeling, the abiding joy and contentment in the Creator's handiwork, and decanted it in words of pure and simple beauty:  
The year's at the spring, 
And day's at the morn, 
Morning's at seven; 
The hill-side's dew-pearled; 
The lark's on the wing; 
The snail's on the thorn: 
God's in his heaven--[and] 
All's right with the world! 
The vernal equinox is at hand, Mr. President, tolling its celestial chime of spring. Oh, welcome, spring! What a difference it makes. At the thought of spring, again to the words of William Wordsworth, `And then my heart with pleasure fills, and dances with the daffodils.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, March 16th, marks the birthday of a man whom Shakespeare could have been describing when he said in `Henry VII,' `He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one, exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading.' The man whom that description fits like a glove is the respected senior Senator from New York, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who today celebrates his seventy-first birthday. O, to be 71 again. O, to be 71 again. I have to rejoice in Senator Moynihan being only 71 today. I am pleased to offer Senator Moynihan my best wishes for a very happy birthday, and my thanks for the intellectual vigor, the stubborn veracity, the scrupulous accuracy and the wise counsel that Senator Moynihan has brought to the Senate. 
Senator Moynihan's curriculum vitae is as widely known as it is broadly based--his humble beginnings, his climb up the academic ladder which, despite being interrupted by World War II, culminated in a doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy; a period of teaching economics--wouldn't I like to have sat in his class--a period of teaching economics, sociology and urban studies at Harvard and at the Joint Center for Urban Studies; and a distinguished series of positions in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations before winning election to the Senate for the first time in 1976. Few Senators come to this body with so much academic and practical experience. No one who observes Senator Moynihan on the Senate floor would guess that as a young man, he once arrived at a test with a dockworker's loading hook tucked in his back pocket. 
William Shakespeare has also said in `Twelfth Night,' `But to be said an honest man . . . goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar.' And that description also reflects the character of Senator Moynihan, a lifelong scholar who has never shirked from the sometimes unpleasant duty of informing the Senate and the nation and Presidents of the hard facts of this or that issue. His carefully studied analysis and his insight into complex issues ranging from poverty in America to the future of social security keep Senators on the floor and staff glued to C-Span, because we have all come to rely on the fact that when Senator Moynihan speaks, we all will learn something of importance, something that may fundamentally shift our thinking. His skill with words is equally finely honed, imbuing every thoughtfully parsed sentence with meaning and wit. He is, to hearken back to Shakespeare's description, `fair spoken, and persuading,' in speech and in the many books he has authored. 
In an age of ten second campaign slogans, bumper sticker rhetoric, and simplistic, feel-good legislation, Senator Moynihan is an anachronism, a throwback to the days of thoughtful consideration of complex issues and reasoned debate on the merits of different possible solutions. He thinks on a grander, a grander scale than do most people and, as a consequence, he is able to foresee problems long before they become costly, messy, politically dangerous quagmires that few people have the courage to tackle, let alone solve. When I have doubts about some new program being proposed, or some radical change being suggested without the benefit of hearings or committee consideration, and Senator Moynihan also voices concern, or briefly sketches possible unpredicted outcomes arising from the proposal, then I know that my hesitation is vindicated. 
In another sense, too, Senator Moynihan is a figure from a different, more polite age, for he is a gentleman. Edmund Burke has observed that `A king may make a nobleman, but he cannot make a gentleman.' `A king may make a nobleman, but he cannot make a gentleman.' The same can be said for politicians--elections can make a Senator--not always a good one--but they can never make a gentleman. In this age of negative campaigns, of road rage, of obscenities masquerading as popular music, and of television that makes one blush while changing channels, there are few gentlemen to point to, but Senator Moynihan is surely one of those few. He listens carefully, respectful of the viewpoint of the speaker--which is in itself an increasingly lost art, it seems. I have never heard him raise his voice in anger, or comment rudely about another Member, and though his criticisms can be as witty and tart as an Empire apple--the Empire apple is something like the McIntosh apple, very flavorful, tart. I saw some up at Martin's store in Charlestown yesterday, some Empire apples. Despite the standing that he enjoys, he remains an approachable figure, unaffected by the grandeur of his surroundings in this majestic building. Were he to stop and look back at the Capitol, I suspect that he would be enjoying the simple pleasure of tulips and daffodils, nodding, tossing their heads in the sunshine, and not so much savoring the symbol of legislative power embodied in this marble and sandstone edifice. 
In the twenty-two years that Senator Moynihan has graced the Senate with his presence, he has brought to the Senate an intellectual puissance and an exalted level of scholarship that have raised the mental caliber of every one around him. He has been more than a Senator from New York, though he certainly has been a good representative of the people of that great State. He has also been an intellectual leader, a sage, and a prophet for the Senate and for the Nation. He has lifted us all up on his broad wings of scholarship. 
He is the possessor, the last time I looked at the Congressional Directory some few months ago, he is the possessor of 60 honorary degrees--60. I don't think anyone else in this body, probably in the other body, can equal that achievement. 
So he has lifted us all up on the broad wings of his scholarship, his experience and his wisdom, so painstakingly acquired only to be so freely and generously given away. 
Herman Melville observed in Moby Dick that `. . . there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest stoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.' The distinguished Senator from New York is just such a soul, a Catskill eagle, inspiring other birds of the sunlit Senate plain, including this Byrd. 
Mr. President, Erma and I offer our best wishes to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan as he celebrates his birthday with his lovely wife Liz and his family. May he enjoy many, many, many more happy birthdays, and may we, his colleagues, have the high privilege of sharing in those birthdays with him over a period of many, many years away.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has provided the United States Senate with some of its finer members. Take John Breckinridge, who in the early 1800's became his party's most effective spokesman and legislative leader during his first term in the Senate, and who would doubtless have achieved further greatness had he not succumbed to typhus fever at the age of 46. Despite this early death, Breckinridge did achieve a form of posthumous success when his son, John C. Breckinridge was elected first Senator and then vice-President. (It was, incidentally, the younger Breckinridge who, in 1859, provided such a moving tribute to the `consecrated character' of the old Senate chamber, before leading the Senators in procession to their new, and current home.) 
Or consider the great Henry Clay, who promoted the American system, whose powerful oratory and forceful personality made him one of the dominant figures during the Senate's golden age of the 1830's, 1840's and 1850's. And what of Alben Barkley, Majority Leader during the 1940's, whose booming baritone and vast repertoire of humorous anecdotes made him one of the more popular Senators of his time? 
Not to mention John Sherman Cooper, who sat right here on the floor during the year that we served together. John Sherman Cooper was a former Ambassador to India. I first met him in 1955, at which time I was a Member of the House of Representatives and was traveling with a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to the Pacific and the Far East. On that occasion we traveled 68 days. We went around the world in an old constellation. That would have been called a `junket' in these times. John Sherman Cooper was Ambassador to India when I and my House colleagues stopped there for a short time. John Sherman Cooper also played an outspoken role in the debates on the war in Vietnam. The list of outstanding Senators from Kentucky is a long list indeed. 
Mr. President, today Kentucky has another native son of whom it can be equally proud. That man is Wendell Ford, who on Saturday last, March 14, became the longest serving Kentuckian in the history of the State. 
It seems only fitting that Senator Ford should hold this record, for few other politicians have served the great Commonwealth of Kentucky as ably or as successfully as has Wendell Ford. After service in World War II, Senator Ford returned to his home state and in short order became a state Senator, then a lieutenant governor, then Governor, before his election to the Senate in 1974. 
When Wendell Ford came to the U.S. Senate, I was the majority whip. Since that date in 1974, Senator Ford has earned acclaim as a smart and savvy legislator, particularly during his excellent chairmanship of the Rules Committee from 1986 to 1994. I count it a great privilege and honor and a pleasure to have served on the Rules Committee during those years of Wendell Ford's chairmanship. He did well. He was a mighty protector of the rules of the Senate and is one of the best chairman of any committee on which I have served. Senator Ford has also been prominent in the party leadership. He chaired the democratic senatorial campaign committee from 1976 to 1982 and he has served with distinction as party whip since 1990. 
As a Senator, Wendell Ford has endeared himself to colleagues and staffers alike with his warm personality and his vibrant sense of humor. He has also distinguished himself as a devoted and vigilant defender of the interests of his native Kentuckians. I should say of all Kentuckians, native or otherwise. I have always felt a kinship with Kentucky, which borders my own mountain II state. I have felt a kinship with the people of eastern Kentucky, whose rugged, mountainous terrain resembles that of West Virginia. And, as a fellow United States Senator representing another less well-off state whose needs have often been overlooked for too long, I have the utmost respect and admiration for Senator Wendell Ford's courageous and tenacious efforts to serve the interests of his state and its noble people. In this regard, Senator Ford may be seen as an heir to the legacy of Henry Clay, whose `American system' favored federal spending on communications, transportation and other internal improvements. 
As a matter of fact, the Old Cumberland Road, as it is sometimes referred to, the Old National Road, began at Cumberland, MD, and went westward to Wheeling, WV and on to Vandalia, IL. The work on that road began in 1811, and by the year 1838 the Federal Government had invested the astounding sum of $3 million in that highway. That was the highway which many settlers traveling from the east and going to the west, took, as they made their way to the Ohio River. I should say that Henry Clay was one of the foremost supporters of appropriations for the Old Cumberland Road, and we who live in the mountainous terrain of West Virginia, and particularly in the northern part of the State, have not forgotten that nor shall we forget it. Few Senators have been as dedicated to serving the needs of their constituents as the able senior Senator from Kentucky, and I salute him for that. 
At the same time, Senator Ford has also done much good work on a national level. As a member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Ford has become a national leader on aviation issues, a leader who played key roles in shaping the 1994 Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act and the 1987 Airport and Airways Capacity Expansion Act. On the Energy Committee, Senator Wendell Ford has worked tirelessly to lessen our country's dependence on foreign oil and to support clean, environmentally friendly coal technologies. And whether fighting for campaign finance reform or sponsoring the motor voter bill, Senator Ford has been a valiant soldier in the ongoing struggle to make this country's political system as fair, as open, and as representative as possible. 
Mr. President, the same words spoken by Senator Clay in his farewell address to the Senate 156 years ago could just as well be attributed to Senator Ford's career in the Senate. Senator Henry Clay declared in part: 
 . . . that I have been actuated by no personal motives--that I have sought no personal aggrandizement--no promotion from the advocacy of those various  measures on which I have been called to act--that I have had an eye, a single eye, a heart, a single heart, ever devoted to what appeared to be the best interests of the country. 
Senator Ford's good work has not gone unappreciated by his constituents. The host of state records that he holds testifies to his popularity with Kentuckians. After all, Senator Ford was the first candidate to carry all 120 countries against opposition and, he did this in 1980. In 1992, he won the highest number of votes cast for any state candidate. And in 1996, he surpassed Alben Barkley's record of having the longest consecutive service of any Kentucky Senator. Now, with this latest accomplishment to his name, there can be no doubting that Senator Ford's position is as one of the most successful and popular politicians in the state's history. 
Mr. President, although Senator Ford has announced that he will not stand for re-election this fall, he may rest assured as he prepares to leave this chamber that his contributions and accomplishments have earned him a place in the Senate's and Kentucky's honor rolls. I am sure that I can speak for all of my colleagues when I say that Senator Ford will be sorely missed. His combination of personal charm and legislative skill is a rare one, and whoever fills his seat will have much to live up to. 
My wife, Erma, and I shall regret to see him and his lovely wife go. 
Wendell Ford in his service here and in his service to the people of Kentucky, reminds me of a bit of verse by John G. Holland, entitled `God Give Us Men': 
God give us men! 
A time like this demands strong minds, 
great hearts, true faith, and ready hands. 
Men whom the lust of office does not kill; 
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; 
Men who possess opinions and a will; 
Men who have honor; men who will not lie. 
Men who can stand before a demagogue 
And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking. 
Tall men, sun-crowned; 
Who live above the fog, 
In public duty and in private thinking. 
For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds, 
It's large professions and its little deeds, 
mingles in selfish strife, 
Lo! Freedom weeps! 
Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps. 
God give us men! 
Men who serve not for selfish booty; 
But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty. 
Men of dependable character; 
Men of sterling worth; 
Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will 
rule the earth. 
God Give us Men! 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest he absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, signals a significant accomplishment for this session of the 105th Congress. In passing this comprehensive six-year surface transportation bill, the Senate makes two profoundly important statements to the American traveling public. First, we are telling the American public that we are intent on using the revenues that we collect at the gas pump, from the American highway user, on the purposes for which they were collected; namely, the maintenance, upkeep, and expansion of our national highway and transit systems. Second, we are telling the traveling public that we intend to reverse the federal government's chronic underinvestment in our national highway needs. 
I want to take this opportunity to recount the major milestones of a multi-step process that brought us to this point where we will pass a highway bill calling for a full $173 billion of investment over the six years, 1998 through 2003. I also want to thank the many persons and organizations that have brought us to this point in time. 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 assessed a new 4.3 cents gas tax solely for the purposes of deficit reduction. This was the first time since the Highway Trust Fund had been established in 1956, that a permanent gas tax was put on the books for a purpose other than highway investment. In May of 1996, our former colleague, Senator Dole of Kansas, rekindled the debate on the appropriate use of the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax. At that time, I signaled to my colleagues my intent to offer an amendment to transfer the 4.3 cent gas tax to the Highway Trust Fund so that it could be used for our ever-growing unmet needs in the area of highway construction and the maintenance of our nation's bridges. During the summer of 1996, at the behest of both the majority and the minority leaders, I deferred offering my amendment to transfer this tax into the Highway Trust Fund on two separate tax bills. Unfortunately, another opportunity to offer my amendment did not arise during the 104th Congress. 
Last year, at the beginning of the 105th Congress, I found a strong ally for my efforts in my colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas. During debate on the budget resolution last year, Senator Gramm offered a sense of the Senate resolution supporting the transfer of the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax from deficit reduction to the Highway Trust Fund, and the spending of that revenue on our highway construction needs. Senator Gramm was joined by 81 of our colleagues in support of this resolution. Later that year, when the Finance Committee marked up the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Senator Gramm, a member of that committee, successfully included a provision transferring the 4.3 cents to the Highway Trust Fund. That provision became law with the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act in August of 1997. 
In transferring this new revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, the Congress was presented with an opportunity to authorize and spend dramatically increased resources on our highway needs. There is no question that these funds are sorely needed. I have taken to the Floor numerous times over the past three years to remind my colleagues of the hundreds of thousands of miles of highways in the nation that are rated in poor or fair condition, and the thousands of bridges across our nation that are rated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Unfortunately, the highway bill, as originally reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, did not 
authorize one penny of this new revenue to be spent on our nation's highways and bridges. Indeed, under the funding levels reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee for the highway program, the unspent balance in the Highway Trust Fund (including both the highway and transit accounts), was expected to grow from $22.9 billion at the beginning of 1998 to more than $55 billion at the end of 2003, the end of the ISTEA II authorization period. Upon learning of this situation, I held several discussions on the subject with members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, including Chairman Chafee, and the Ranking Member, Senator Baucus. Following these discussions, I decided to prepare an amendment which would authorize the full amount of revenues going into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. Given the continuing deterioration of our nation's highways in all 50 states, and the growing volume of concern on the part of the nation's governors and state legislators, on the federal government's underinvestment in our infrastructure, I felt that it was essential that the Senate have an opportunity to vote on whether or not we mean what we say when we place highway tax revenues into the Highway Trust Fund. 
I was first joined in the amendment by my colleague, Senator Gramm. Shortly thereafter, our efforts were given a great boost when we were joined by Senator Baucus, the Ranking Member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, and Senator Warner, the subcommittee's chairman. Despite substantial early opposition from certain Senators, including the Chairman of the full Environment and Public Works and Budget Committees, Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner, and I diligently sought to obtain co-sponsors for our amendment. In total, we were able to secure an additional 50 co-sponsors, making a total of 54 co-sponsors for the Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner amendment. 
Our amendment authorized additional contract authority for highways over the period Fiscal Year 1999 through 2003, totaling $30.971 billion. That amount was the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the revenue from this portion of the 4.3 cents gas tax that would be deposited into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund over that five-year period. In January of this year, the Congressional Budget Office reestimated that five-year figure to a level of $27.41 billion, or a reduction of $3.561 billion from their earlier forecast. 
At the end of last month, Mr. President, it appeared that a true battle was brewing. The Senate was divided into two camps--the camp of those that had joined with Senators Byrd, Gramm, Baucus, and Warner in support of authorizing the spending of the additional revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, and the opposition, led by Senators Dominici and Chafee, who opposed this approach. This division was causing a delay in Senate consideration of the ISTEA bill, a delay that made all Senators uncomfortable since we continue to face the May 1 deadline beyond which most states cannot obligate any federal aid highway funds absent a new authorization bill. At the end of last month, the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, asked that all parties join him in his office for negotiations on this issue. While I must admit I was not inclined to negotiate in a manner that would cause us to abandon our principle of authorizing the spending of the Highway Trust Fund revenue, I, along with Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner, did join with the Majority Leader, and Senator Chafee, Senator Domenici and, at times, Senator D'Amato to discuss the situation. After many days of back and forth, and the very adept moderating style of 
the Majority Leader, I was pleased that an agreement emerged that enabled us to add an amendment totaling 25.920 billion dollars to the highway bill. This amount represents 94 percent of CBO's most recent estimate of the revenue to the highway account, stemming from the 4.3 cents gas tax. I was especially pleased that, as part of these negotiations, Senator Domenici, Chairman of the Budget Committee, committed himself to finding the outlays through the budget resolution process to see to it that these funds will not just be authorized, but will also be spent through the annual appropriations process. Further, I appreciate the support of the agreement by the Distinguished Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, as well as for his outstanding work in managing this complex bill over the several weeks that it has been before the Senate. I also wish to recognize the cooperation and support that I have received for many months on my amendment to this important legislation by our Distinguished Minority Leader Mr. Daschle. He joined as a cosponsor of the Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner amendment early on and was a staunch advocate and supporter throughout. 
On a matter that is of critical importance to this Senator, this amendment included $1.89 billion for the Appalachian Development Highway System. Coupled with the $300 million already in the committee bill for this system, total funding over the six-year ISTEA bill, for the Appalachian Highway System, will equal $2.19 billion, the full amount requested by the Administration in their ISTEA proposal. 
I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jeffords be added as a cosponsor to amendment number 1397, the so-called Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner amendment, to S. 1173.

Mr. BYRD. That brings the total number of cosponsors to 54. Mr. President, I thank all cosponsors of our amendment who, in effect, were trying to force the government to live up to the commitment it made to the American people and require that money collected in gasoline taxes for the purpose of building roads actually be spent for that purpose. At various times over the course of the last several months, many of these cosponsors spoke on the Floor in an attempt to bring to the attention of the leadership the importance of bringing up the ISTEA II bill as expeditiously as possible, and I thank those members for their efforts. 
In addition to the support of these cosponsors, we had outstanding support from a large number of outside organizations ranging from the American Automobile Association to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. I wish to thank all of these organizations, without whose support it would have been impossible to have been successful in our efforts to not only bring the bill up as quickly as we were able to, but to have adopted the Environmental and Public Works Committee amendment, which provides some 94 percent of the contract authority proposed in the original Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner amendment. Indicative of the support received by these organizations was a very strong statement given before the National Governors Association by the President and CEO of the American Automobile Association, Robert L. Darbelnet, in which he expressed strong support for the Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner amendment.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in addition to thanking these many groups, I also deeply appreciate the efforts of the staffs of the principal co-sponsors of our amendment. They include Steve McMillin of Senator Gramm's staff, Tom Sliter and Kathy Ruffalo of Senator Baucus' staff, Ann Loomis and Ellen Stein of Senator Warner's staff, and Jim English and Peter Rogoff of my own staff. Also, the majority leader's staff, namely Keith Hennessey and Carl Biersack, deserve great credit for their efforts toward reaching a consensus on the critical funding agreement to this bill. Finally, I also thank the individuals at the Federal Highway Administration, who have toiled diligently outside of the limelight, in bringing this bill to closure. They include Jack Basso in Secretary Slater's office, as well as Bud Wright, Patty Doersch, and Bruce Swindford, at the Federal Highway Administration. Their assistance was instrumental in providing data and technical assistance in development of the Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner Amendment, as well as for the underlying committee bill. 
This is a bill, of which I am proud, and of which all Senators should be proud, and for which I urge all Senators to vote aye.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to keep the Congress and the American people informed about the real condition of our National Highway System. 
Under current law, the Secretary of Transportation is required to sent a biannual report to the Congress on the performance and conditions of America's highways. 
Unfortunately, the report that was due at the beginning of last year was not completed and delivered to the Congress until last week, some 18 months late. Moreover, the new report uses an entire new set of measures that make it impossible to determine whether the condition of our roadways has improved or declined. Indeed, the new report abandons the format utilized in prior years which provided direct and clear data on the condition of our highways and bridges. This data enabled all citizens and policy makers to measure the progress of lack of progress that had been made on improving our highway system. 
This amendment would ensure that all future reports include data using the format that was used in prior years so that we can compare `apples to apples' when formulating our national policy on highways.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my vote on the motion to table the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell, to S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. Despite my sympathy with the position of Mr. McConnell, and despite my reservations about the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program, I voted in favor of tabling the amendment. 
Like many of my colleagues, I encourage small businesses--including those owned by socially and culturally disadvantaged individuals--to take an active role in bidding for federally funded highway construction contracts. But, while I understand the goals of the DBE program, as set forth in Section 1111 of ISTEA, I do not support preferential treatment for certain businesses on the basis of the race, ethnicity, or gender of their owners. 
I believe that the Constitution, as amended by the 5th, 13th, and 14th Amendments, does not permit the government to discriminate or differentiate on the basis of race, ethnicity, or gender--regardless of whether the government's motive is malicious or benign. If the precepts of `equal protection' and `due process' are to mean anything, then they must ensure that no one in this country is granted favorable or unfavorable treatment on the basis of some single differentiating characteristic. 
My reading of the Constitution is supported by the Supreme Court's 1995 decision in Adarand versus Pena. In that decision, the Court rules that the DBE and other race-based affirmative action programs can only be upheld if they are narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest. This test, commonly referred to as `strict scrutiny,' makes it exceedingly difficult for any affirmative action program to pass constitutional muster. It should come as no surprise, then, that after the Court remanded the Adarand case, a federal district court judge found that the DBE program fails strict scrutiny, and thus is unconstitutional. Indeed, it is worth pointing out that the last time that the Supreme Court upheld a statute based on a racial- or national-origin classification under the strict scrutiny test was in 1944. 
In my opinion, the correct course of action is to award highway contracts on the basis of cost, performance, and the most efficient use of taxpayer's money. This merit-based approach is both fair and constitutionally appropriate. 
Despite these reservations about DBE, I also recognize that the courts have not yet definitively ruled on the constitutionality of affirmative action programs. The Adarand district court decision is currently on appeal, and I look forward to further clarification of the constitutionality of programs such as DBE. 
Furthermore, while I support the McConnell amendment in principle, I believe that further debate and scrutiny is necessary. This amendment has not yet been subjected to the committee process, which is so essential to determining the true merits and flaws of a proposal. Before we replace the DBE program with an Emerging Business Enterprise Program, we need to ensure that the replacement does exactly what we want it to do. Otherwise, we risk hurting some small businesses through rash, ill-considered action. For these reasons, I voted to table the McConnell amendment.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman has brought to the attention of the Senate a new and deadly twist on the idea of convenience stores. He has discussed the existence in some States of stores that sell alcohol at drive-up windows. That is simply amazing to me, a store that sells alcohol at a drive-up window. 
How can we take seriously any campaign to reduce the dangers of drinking and driving, while at the same time allowing sales of alcoholic beverages to people in their cars! It is crazy. I am sure that these drivers will, of course, always, personally, follow the guidelines to `wait until you get home to drink these alcoholic beverages!' I am just as sure of that as I am sure that everyone who buys take out food at a drive through window waits until they are safely off the highway before trying to eat a dripping burger or a hot, salty french fry, while simultaneously steering a three thousand pound automobile through traffic! 
I applaud the action being taken by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bingaman, to ban these alcoholic beverage sales at drive-up windows. There is no reason to take the concept of convenience to this extreme. I have been on the face of this beautiful Earth for a little over 80 years now, and I have seen a lot of new conveniences come into my life, but I can adamantly admit that this is not one that I welcome. I want to be able to enjoy life for many more years, and I do not want the prospect of a long life put into jeopardy so that some boozehound or drunk driver can have great convenience insatiating his or her desire for alcohol without even having to leave the car! There are just some things in this life that should not be easy to obtain--things that should not be so convenient. Easy access to alcohol means easy access to drinking and driving, and that is something to which I am vehemently unalterably opposed. 
The existence of this kind of easy-on, easy-off establishment only increases the potential for drunk drivers to purchase alcohol. An intoxicated person, sitting in a car, can easily avoid attracting the attention of the sales person by fiddling with the radio or finding some other type of distraction, thus preventing the sales clerk from noticing that the driver is inebriated, maybe even drunk. Observation of customers for clues to their sobriety, or lack thereof, is much easier if the customer has to park, get out of the car, and walk into the store. 
My strong opposition to establishments which offer drive-up alcohol sales is not only limited to my fear of drunk drivers, but also to the potentially illegal sale of alcohol to minors. The pitfalls of youth and inexperience behind the wheel of an automobile are only exacerbated when one throws alcohol into the equation. One question that comes to mind is: How does an employee at this type of alcoholic beverage store adequately make the comparison between a driver's identification and the person sitting in the car presenting that ID? That person is sitting in a car! This potential drunk driver could be 5 foot 10, he could be 5 foot 7 while his or her identification card might identify the person as a six-footer. 
Mr. President, I believe that in order to make a sound decision to sell alcohol to a person, the customer should be standing before the sales clerk, presenting the necessary documentation, and showing the essential sober characteristics that are legally required for that person to purchase alcoholic beverages. 
I am all in favor of making life more convenient. It is nice to have the liberty of going to a Quik-Mart when you need to purchase a candy bar pick-me-up, or for that gallon of milk that your family needs for breakfast the next day. But, I do not believe in making it more convenient for drunk drivers, potential drunk drivers, or our underage youth or anybody else, for that matter, to purchase alcohol. It is this type of convenience that can make life very inconvenient for the responsible individuals, families, wives, children, our staff people and other travelers who make the conscious decision to `cruise without booze!' Allowing this type of alcohol sales establishment is a leap backwards in the campaign against drunk driving. 
I fully support Senator Bingaman's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I think of an old poem by Joseph Malins. I hope that I can recall it. I think it is very fitting here. It makes the whole point that Senator Bingaman's amendment is trying to accomplish: 
Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed, 
Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant; 
But over its terrible edge there had slipped 
A duke and full many a peasant. 
So the people said something would have to be done, 
But their projects did not at all tally; 
Some said, `Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,' 
Some, `An ambulance down in the valley.' 
But the cry for the ambulance carried the day, 
For it spread through the neighboring city; 
A fence may be useful or not, it is true, 
But each heart became brimful of pity 
For those who slipped over that dangerous cliff; 
And the dwellers in highway and alley 
Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence, 
But an ambulance down in the valley. 
`For the cliff is all right, if you're careful,' they said, 
`And, if folks even slip and are dropping, 
It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much, 
As the shock down below when they're stopping.' 
So day after day, as these mishaps occurred, 
Quick forth would these rescuers sally 
To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff, 
With their ambulance down in the valley. 
Then an old sage remarked: `It's a marvel to me 
That people give far more attention 
To repairing results than to stopping the cause, 
When they'd much better aim at prevention. 
Let us stop at its source all this mischief,' cried he, 
`Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally; 
If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense 
With the ambulance down in the valley.' 
`Oh, he's a fanatic,' the others rejoined, 
`Dispense with the ambulance? Never! 
He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could; 
No! No! We'll support them forever. 
Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall? 
And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he? 
Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence, 
While the ambulance works down in the valley?' 
But a sensible few, who are practical too, 
Will not bear with such nonsense much longer; 
They believe that prevention is better than cure, 
And their party will soon be the stronger. 
Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen, 
And while other philanthropists dally, 
They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence 
On the cliff that hangs over the valley. 
Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old, 
For the voice of true wisdom is calling, 
`To rescue the fallen is good, but 'tis best 
To prevent other people from falling.' 
Better close up the source of temptation and crime 
Than deliver from dungeon or galley; 
Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff 
Than an ambulance down in the valley.' 
I hope my colleagues will vote today to put a strong fence around the edge of the cliff, because that is all that is going to work. 
I commend my colleague for his foresight, for his courage, and for his good sense in offering this amendment. I thank, again, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will only take 2 or 3 minutes. I thank the Senator from Oregon for letting me impose on him. I want to say that I am very sympathetic to the case that has been made by the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska. I hope we can do something to help him. He is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and all of us who have anything in this bill at all, who are impacted by this bill, all of us who support this bill, are going to have to look at this chairman down the road to help us to implement what we are doing here. I hope we will find a way to help him. 
I am the only former House Member who is now serving in the U.S. Senate who voted for the addition of Alaska to the Union. I was sworn in with the late Senator Gruening, about whom Mr. Stevens spoke. That case has been made time and again. I want to say, Mr. President, I have never heard the case made better than Senator Stevens has made it. I can understand how his people feel. They need help. It seems to me that whatever helps Alaska helps West Virginia. That is the way I look at it. I want to be supportive of finding a positive response to the Senator's needs. I want to help him.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take the floor because we are presently in a quorum call and I thought it might be a good time for me not to overly impose on the Senate, since the Senate is not having any debate at the moment anyway. 
Mr. President, Sir Francis Bacon, who was the Lord Chancellor and who ultimately went to the Tower--he wasn't executed, but he went to the Tower. In 1621, he was impeached and he was sent to the Tower for accepting bribes, which he admitted. He said there are three things that make a nation great and prosperous: a fertile soil, busy workshops, and easy conveyance for men and goods from place to place. 
The Persians knew the importance of good roads, and had a network of roads that connected Susa and Ecbatana and Sardis and Babylon and Ninevah and Carchemish. Cyrus the Great was the king of Anshan in 559 B.C., and he became the king of all Persia when he defeated the Medes in 550. From 550 B.C. until 529 B.C. Cyrus ruled. Cyrus was killed in a battle with the Massagetai, whose ruling queen was named Tomyris--Tomyris. It's a very interesting story. 
Herodotus, the author of history, tells us about it. I won't repeat that part today. Cyrus was killed in 529 B.C. and Cambyses, his son--Cambyses II--ruled from 529 to 522 B.C. Then Darius the Great ruled from 522 B.C. to 485 B.C. 
Darius the Great--and Herodotus tells us this--Darius became king upon the neigh of a horse. He and some others joined in a conspiracy and assassinated an imposter to the throne. Upon the death of the imposter, these seven conspirators, of which Darius was one, decided they had to make a decision as to who would rule. They had a very interesting discussion about democracy and aristocracy and monarchy. Herodotus tells us all about it. It would be interesting for Senators to read that, or to reread it in the event they have already done so. 
In any event, they decided at sunrise they would go out into the suburbs, these several conspirators, and that the first horse that neighed, the rider of that horse would be king of Persia. Darius subsequently told his groom, Oebares, about this and said, `This is what we have agreed upon. Do you have any ideas?' Oebares said, `Yes, don't you be concerned about it. Your horse will be the first to neigh.' 
That evening, Oebares took the favorite mare of Darius' horse into the suburbs and tied her to a tree. He then took Darius' horse to where the mare was tethered, and, after a little while, returned with Darius's horse into the city for the night. The next morning, Darius and the other conspirators rode out into the suburbs with their horses. As they came near to the area where the mare was still tethered, Darius' horse neighed. The other conspirators immediately fell down upon the ground and proclaimed Darius to be the new king of all Persia. This is according to Herodotus. 
Darius the Great built great roads. The Egyptians knew how to build good roads, the Etruscans, the Carthaginians, but the Romans were the truly great roadbuilders. Some of the roads and bridges that the Romans built hundreds of years ago are still in use. Many Senators who have visited Rome and have gone out to Tivoli--a few hours drive--have traveled the Old Appian Way, which was built by Appius Claudius Caecus, beginning in 312 B.C. and extending from Rome to Capua and on to Brundisium. The Romans knew how to build roads. They understood that in the center of the road there had to be a crown so that the water would drain off on each side and that on each side there had to be a ditch for the runoff water. These roads enabled the Roman legions to reach any part of the vast Roman empire. The Romans were great roadbuilders. And they built bridges, some of which are still in use today. 
Now, roads in our time are very important and we have heard the expression that America is a country on wheels. People are on wheels. They are going hither, thither and yon at all times. 
The Department of Transportation has indicated that the highways in all of the national system have deteriorated and that only 39 percent of the highways in the national system are in `good' condition. 
We now have this highway bill that has come to the floor and we have already discussed the amendment, how it came about, and the meetings that took place in the majority leader's office. I said before and I say again, the majority leader performed a tremendous service in inviting those who were participants in the discussions, inviting them to his office and sitting with us each day, assisting us in reaching an agreement which now takes the form of an amendment to the ISTEA II bill, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
I came into these meetings, in a way, as someone out of the highways and hedges. I am not on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am not on the Budget Committee. The Environment and Public Works Committee has jurisdiction over this legislation. I am not on that committee. Mr. Baucus is the ranking member of that committee. Mr. Chafee is the chairman. Mr. Warner is a member of that committee and is chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of that committee. Mr. Domenici is chairman of the Budget Committee, and Mr. Gramm of Texas is a member of the Budget Committee. Those were the participants. 
I believe Mr. D'Amato sat in on one or two meetings. He is chairman of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the mass transit moneys. That was not part of our amendment. 
So, as I say, I was a stranger, in effect, to these meetings, not being a member of the committees that were directly involved. But I got into this thing because of Appalachia and because the moneys that were being deposited into the highway trust fund were not being spent for highways. And I talked with various Senators, upon one occasion with the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus. I said, `We need help on Appalachian highways.' He said, `Well, we need more money, we need more money.' I said, `OK, let's spend the money that is going into the highway trust fund. That is what the people think it is being collected for; let's spend it.'

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment, and I wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, for his efforts in this regard. These new rules, which modify the ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter, would severely impact West Virginia. Up to ten counties in my home state might be thrown into nonattainment under these rules, and a large number of industries might be adversely affected, including chemicals, construction, steel production, glass manufacturing, coal-fired utility power plants, pulp and paper mills, and commercial trucking. 
On a national level, the impact of these rules is even greater, with early estimates from the President's Council of Economic Advisors that these rules might cost $60 billion annually. Many major urban areas have not yet complied with the current ozone standard, and are not even close to being able to do so. These urban areas have not even completed their plans on how they will comply with the current standard. Basic logic would dictate that these states should first finish these plans, and enforce the current standard, before moving on to even more ambitious proposals. Instead, these states must constantly revise their air plans, even while never completing those plans. As I stated in an earlier letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), these states are trapped in the clean air version of the perpetual motion regulatory machine, where replanning becomes as important as actual implementation and enforcement. 
In the area of particulates, there is almost no national monitoring data, and there is weak scientific and technical support for the rule. The EPA and the environmental community refer to a small number of studies that support the rule, but there is room for serious debate about whether a clear connection between PM 2.5 and health-related problems has been established. 
The amendment before us is actually quite modest in its goals, and unfortunately does not address many of these broader problems with this air rule. The amendment codifies promises made by the Administration with regard to the time schedule to implement the new rules, and also codifies provisions for funding a nationwide network of monitoring stations for particulate matter. The Administration's proposed time schedule is not legally binding, and this amendment will ensure that the EPA cannot later alter the terms of the implementation package that it has offered to state governments. 
Despite these modest goals, this amendment holds the EPA's feet to the fire, and will ensure that promises made to the states will be honored. I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment offered by Senator Inhofe, and ensure that promises made to West Virginia are promises kept by the EPA.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I grow older I am obliged to bid farewell to some friend almost every day, and thus does the circle gradually and all too rapidly diminish. That great New England poet James Russell Lowell said it well: 
As life runs on, 
The road grows strange 
With faces new, 
And near the end 
The milestones into headstones change, 
`Neath everyone a friend 
Mr. President, it is with sadness that I take the Floor today to pay tribute to the memory of a departed former colleague, Abraham Alexander Ribicoff, with whom I served from January 3, 1963, to January 3, 1981. Senator Ribicoff was a man of many talents. And he was a man who had been honored by the people of his State and country many times and in many ways. After graduating from the University of Chicago Law School in 1933, he was admitted to the bar the same year. He became a hearing examiner, under the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act in 1937, and he became a member of the Connecticut legislature in 1938, a judge of the Hartford Police Court in 1941, Chairman of the Assembly of Municipal Court Judges for the State of Connecticut in 1941, and he was elected to the 81st and 82nd Congresses, a service which extended from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1953. He was Governor of Connecticut during the years 1955-1961, and he was sworn in as Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in the cabinet of the late President John Kennedy. 
Abraham Ribicoff was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962, reelected in 1968 and again in 1974, and served until January 3, 1981, not being a candidate for reelection in 1980. During this period of Senator Ribicoff's service in the Senate, I served in the Senate leadership as Secretary to the Democratic Conference, Democratic Whip, and Senate Majority Leader, during which time Abe Ribicoff was my close friend and valued advisor. 
Abraham Ribicoff was a man of high character, great character, sterling integrity, excellent judgment, with an unusual sense of history and with excellent political instincts, and with uncommon ability. 
His advice was widely sought by other Senators, and it was always kindly given. He was a popular Senator, and could easily have won reelection to a fourth Senate term. His career of public service spanned 42 years. 
Abe Ribicoff had a very rare sense of timing and political judgement. He was among the first to endorse Senator John F. Kennedy for President. He nominated John F. Kennedy for Vice President in 1956, and was his convention Floor Manager for the, now legendary, successful presidential nomination in 1960. 
Abe Ribicoff had the air and dignity of a Senator in a classic sense. He always dressed impeccably, he possessed faultless manners, and he was a gentleman in every sense of the word. Yet, he spoke forcefully, and he was unafraid of advocating politically difficult positions--unafraid. He was among the first to break with the strong-armed tactics of certain Israeli lobby groups, and he willingly paid a political price for his courage. In 1978, he conducted the first major Senate investigation, and produced the first Senate report on the difficult problem of global warming. His report on the subject could well have been written today, some 20 years later, when global warming has now become fashionable as an issue. He was also an expert on international trade. 
I have spoken of his service during the time I was Majority Leader. He was then the Chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, as well as second ranking Democrat under Senator Russell Long on the Finance Committee. I relied heavily on Abe Ribicoff's advice on a broad range of issues, from the creation of the cabinet level Department of Education to the fashioning of major energy legislation during the energy crisis of the late 1970's. 
Abe Ribicoff was a persuasive speaker, and always gave as well as he got in Senate debates, during the days when the Senate really did debate issues. Yet, his strength was as much in his ability to sense the appropriate compromise, and he knew how to build consensus, and to craft sound solutions to highly contentious issues in Committee and on the Senate Floor. 
His passing, at a ripe old age, is another chapter, rounding out a history of remarkable men who have graced this chamber, and who have made their individual marks on the minds and memories and hearts of their colleagues and they have done it on the basis of their character, their instincts, and their talents. Senators would do well to read the story of Abraham Ribicoff's life. He came from humble beginnings and he made a success from his own resources, his own grit, and his own instincts. His life was one which can be used as a model by others on both sides of the aisle. He stood his ground when it really counted, and consequently he claimed the high road in his political life. I have missed Abe Ribicoff's counsel since his retirement, and I wish he had remained longer in this body. I wish he were here today. 
Abe Ribicoff waged many political battles in life. The battle with death he finally lost, as we must all finally succumb to the onslaught of that grim and unrelenting enemy: death. But though that grim reaper may lay claim to ending the battle of this life, the claim of victory has always and will always elude death, even though it stalks each of our lives from the cradle to the grave. How sweet the words of thy great Apostle Paul in his first epistle to the Corinthians: 
 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 
Mr. President, man was not created an animal, as we are taught in our universities and our high schools. Man was not created an animal, but as a living soul within which there is embedded a spark of the Divinity, a nexus with the Creator. It is that spark that lives on, a soul that an animal does not have, a soul that goes back, when one departs this earthly life, to the presence of his Maker. And we all have that journey to travel. Great Grecian and Roman philosophers, by pure reason and logic, arrived at the conclusion that there is indeed a creating, directing, and controlling Divine power, and an immortality of the soul. Throughout the ages, all races and all peoples have instinctively so believed. It is the basis of all religions, be they heathen, Mohammedan, Hebrew, or Christian. It is believed by savage tribes and by semicivilized and civilized nations, by those who believe in many gods and by those who believe in the one God. Atheists are and always have been few in number. But beyond all credulity is the credulousness of atheists, who believe that chance can make the world, when it cannot build a house! 
So, Mr. President, as Longfellow said: 
There is no death! What seems so is transition; 
This life of mortal breath 
Is but a suburb of the life elysian, 
whose portal we call death. 
Mr. President, we have heard the story of an old king in the Middle Ages who had his barons at a great banquet. They were quaffing their bumpers of ale. It was a bitter night outside. The storm raged. The snow was falling furiously. Suddenly, into the rude chamber in which they were gathered there flew through some crack or crevice in the roof a little bird. Blinded by the light and perplexed, it flew wildly here and there and beat itself against the rude beams. Finally, it found another crevice and out it went into the night again. The old king, advanced in years, spoke to his barons and said: 
That bird is like a life; it comes from out of the night, it flits and flies around a little while, blinded by the light, and then it goes back out into the night again. 
So, Mr. President, my friend Abraham Ribicoff has gone to what Hamlet said was `the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,' but I have no doubt that the Creator, who stoops to give to the rose bush whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze the sweet assurance of another springtime, has received into His bosom a man who was my friend, who loved his country, and who loved his fellow man--rich and poor, high and low, who neither looked up to the rich nor down on the poor--Abraham Alexander Ribicoff. 
To his dear wife Casey, a graceful, charming, and noble woman, my wife, Erma, and I extend our sympathy and our love. 
Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy, 
Bright dreams of the past that she cannot destroy, 
That come in the night-time of sorrow and care, 
And bring back the features that joy used to wear. 
Long, long be my heart with such memories filled, 
Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled, 
You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will, 
But the scent of the roses will hang round it still. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, we have completed today what I consider to be one of the most remarkable group of meetings that I have participated in during my nearly 40 years in the Senate. Those meetings were called by the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott. 
What brought us to the meetings were these circumstances: A 6-year highway authorization bill had been reported to the floor. Numerous Senators came to me and said to me, `Senator, we need more money.' I am not on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I am not on the Budget Committee. So I suppose I am a player who, in a way, has just come in from the outside. 
But working with the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, whose amendment in the Finance Committee last year effected the transfer of the 4.3-cent gas tax into the highway trust fund, he and I and Senator Baucus and Senator Warner joined together in an amendment which would have provided $30.9 billion in additional contract authority for highways and bridges. Am I correct? 
It was our desire to see this money that was building up in the highway trust fund spent on highways and bridges. Now, of the 4.3-cent gas tax that goes into the highway trust fund, 3.45 cents is intended to go for highways and bridges and 0.85 cents goes for mass transit. 
Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner, and I worked hard last fall in an effort to get cosponsors of our amendment. As a final result, we got 50 other cosponsors which, added to the four of us, made a total of 54 cosponsors of the amendment. And we had a good many Senators who told each of us that they would vote for the amendment even though they would not cosponsor it, if and when it came to a vote. 
The majority leader then made the highway bill the pending business, and called certain Senators to meetings in his office, and we have had several such meetings. The participants have been the majority leader, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Warner, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, and myself. On at least one occasion, Mr. D'Amato was included. 
In any event, those were difficult meetings. In the final analysis, everybody sacrificed something. In the end, we agreed to increase the amount in the bill $26 billion for highways. I ask my colleagues, am I correct?

Mr. BYRD. Twenty-six. All right. I thank from the bottom of my heart my friend, that old crusty New Englander who wins our admiration and respect, Mr. Chafee. He and I have gone round and round about this, but in the final analysis, we have joined hands. So, the people of Appalachia, who constitute 22 million people in 399 counties of 13 States--those people who have been promised these corridors now for 32 years--can now see the light at the end of the tunnel, because what we have agreed to here will be the $300 million that is already in the reported highway bill, plus $1.89 billion, which will be added according to our agreement, thus making a total of $2.19 billion, which conforms to the President's request. 
For the entire cycle 1998-2003, then, there will be $2.19 billion for Appalachian highways. That is not going to be earmarked money. That money is going to those 13 States on the basis of the Appalachian highway mileage that remains to be constructed and considering the costs of completion. Throughout the region, of the total Appalachian development highway system, 78 percent of the system has been completed or is under construction. 
Beside and beyond the Appalachian portion, this agreement will benefit every State in the Union in terms of additional dollars for highways. I believe I am making a correct statement. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, is nodding his head in the affirmative. 
Let me close by thanking him again and by thanking the majority leader, by thanking Mr. Gramm of Texas, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Domenici. It has been a beautiful exercise in give and take and finally coming to a consensus and shaking hands and saying, `We are going to stand by this agreement.' 
I thank all Senators, and I thank the Chair.  
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator for speaking on this subject. We have developed a strong moral sense of outrage against smoking. We have talked about the effects of smoking on health. The administration has picked it up, and there has been a great crusade in this country against smoking. There have been laws passed against smoking. And there have been bills passed against this or that aspect of smoking. 
Tobacco is a very unwelcome--we have a good many tobacco farmers in West Virginia. We have tobacco farmers in many States that make their living farming tobacco. I am not opposed to this crusade against smoking. I am not opposed to that at all. But why not have an equally strong crusade against drinking? 
When I am called upon to participate in any program before Christmas or before any holiday or before school graduations in which the thrust of the message is: `Don't drink and drive,' I do not say it that way. I say, `Don't drink, period.' 
When is the country going to develop a sense of moral indignation and outrage at drinking? Those who smoke may injure their own health. I hear a great deal about secondhand smoke. I do not know how much of that can be proved. But drinking alcohol injures the health of the person who drinks. All of us can say, `Well, our granddaddies or great granddaddies drank a little toddy each morning, put a little whiskey in the coffee, and so on.' But that is as far as it went. 
We have conducted a great war against drugs in this country, illegal drugs. The most popular drug in this country is alcohol. When are we going to say, `Stop it'? When are we going to teach our young people not to drink? It is not good for them. It will get them into trouble. It has been the cause of unemployment for tens of thousands of men and women in this country. It causes men who drink to go home and beat up on their wives and to mistreat their children. 
Not only does it injure the health of those who drink, but it also constitutes a threat to others. The person who drinks may pick up a club and beat you to death. He may pull out a gun and shoot you. He may get behind that automobile wheel, because he is already inebriated. But if he had been taught, if it had been ingrained into him by his parents in the home to `Stay away from that drug. Stay away from it. There is nothing good in it, nothing!' If he had been taught to stay away from it, he would not be drunk when he gets behind the wheel of an automobile. 
When is a sense of moral outrage and indignation going to rise in this country to the point that people will teach their children not to touch it? `Stay away from it. Don't drink.' 
I would be very happy to see this administration, and other administrations in our party and other parties, join in a crusade against strong drink--against alcoholic beverages. But there is no sense of outrage, no sense of outrage about this drug. 
It is a drug. And it is habit forming. And there is no good in it. When one gets on that path, it has an unfortunate end. It costs money. It costs jobs. It breaks up families. It destroys homes. It destroys marriages. And it kills people. And many times, the people who are killed are the innocent people --the wives, the children--who are out there going to the grocery store or going home from school or going to the child-care center. And they are killed by a drunk driver. 
We talk about people who have been charged with drunk driving 13, 14, 15 times. That is outrageous! 
When are we going to have judges and people who enforce the law in this country throw the book at them? We should simply not tolerate this drug. I don't want to be an extremist about anything, and I'm not one who would see harm in an old person that takes a little `toddy' as we say, a little whiskey, but we don't look at it that way. We look at it with an attitude that there is nothing wrong with drinking alcohol, it is the thing to do, it is the `in thing.' 
How many students at the universities around this country have lost their lives, who have committed suicide or died in automobile accidents as a result of binge drinking? We have read about it in the papers--the University of Virginia and other universities. It is bad. When are we going to teach our children that it is bad? Don't follow the crowd. It is not the `in thing' to do. It is a drug that kills. It may kill you. It may kill someone else. You will have the blood of that person's life on your hands. 
Why don't the legislators of this country get up and talk about it? Talk about booze, booze that kills people. They don't want to talk about it. We would not hear anything about drunk driving if people would teach their children not to drink. There wouldn't then be any problem with drunk driving. It is not the `in thing.' It is a drug that kills, and it is America's most popular drug. 
So count me as one who feels that we ought to have a crusade against booze--not just a crusade against smoking, but also a crusade against booze. I hope my fellow legislators will rise and stand with me. It may not be a very popular thing to say but it is right. I'm right in saying that. I'm not right in everything I say, but alcohol is destructive. The sooner we teach our young people by our own example not to drink, the sooner we won't have as many drunk drivers. 
I smoke a cigar, and have been smoking cigars for more than 35 years, but I am supportive of the crusade against smoking. It is not good for one's health, but neither is alcohol. I will be happy to have others join me in cracking down on drinking and in really, really making it tough on drunk drivers. Why should they be allowed to continue to drive an automobile if they are going to drive while drunk? Why not take that driver's license away? Why not put them in jail, too? And if they insist on driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors, put them in jail, fine them. Make it tough on them--the tougher the better. Just stop them from driving at all. If they kill other people, they might as well have had a pistol. I might as well carry a pistol around, just pull it out, shoot anywhere, just let the bullets fly in any direction and kill somebody--I ought to go to jail. Let the drunk drivers go to jail. Put them in jail and keep them there until they dry out. 
Let's try in our churches to create that moral indignation against drinking. 
I cannot compliment the distinguished Senator too highly for what he has said on the floor today. He has a story that all people ought to hear and I commend him for what he has said. 
Now, with respect to the bill, the bill is a good bill but it doesn't go far enough. Those who have joined with me in offering the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment are saying let's take that money the people pay as a tax when they buy gasoline, 
and spend it on highways and mass transit. We are not doing that. The American people, I think, are very supportive. I know they are. Our amendment would do just that. It would provide that the 4.3 cent per gallon gas tax go for highways and mass transit. I have no doubt the American people want it to be that way. That is the purpose of our amendment. 
So it is a good bill but we are trying to make it better. I hope we will have the support of all our colleagues. 
I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me echo the sentiments that have been expressed by my friend from Texas. We want to see this 4.3-cent gas tax that the American people are paying every time they drive up to the pump--they pay 4.3 cents, which, added to the previous taxes, amounts to 18.3 cents on the gallon. 
Now, of course, some of that goes for mass transit, but of the 4.3 cents, 3.45 cents on each gallon goes to the highway trust fund for highways, 
and .85 cents goes to the trust fund for mass transit, am I correct on that? My colleague nods in the affirmative. 
Now, Mr. President, I have been on this floor each day urging that the leadership take up the highway bill. I compliment the majority leader on his indications that he intends to take up the highway bill, perhaps as early as tomorrow. That would still be his judgment to make. I also compliment the distinguished majority leader for having some of the principals in his office this morning to discuss this matter so that, hopefully, we can arrive at some conclusions and agreements which will pave the way for expeditious action on the floor in connection with the highway bill when it is taken up. The majority leader did a worthwhile service when he did that. 
The majority leader also stressed that this was nonpartisan, and it is. This is not a Republican bill. It is not a Democratic bill. 
So for the first time, this morning we sat down to discuss this matter and we had the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Chafee, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Baucus, we had Senators Gramm, D'Amato, Warner, and myself. We had these Senators together in the room. 
Now, Mr. President, I have been reading almost daily--and even this morning before I went to that meeting--that there is a deal. There is no deal. I have been reading little headlines and statements in various publications to the effect that a deal is near. Well, we don't know about that. This is the first time that I have sat down with the principals to discuss this matter. I have talked about it with my friend from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and with the other two cosponsors of the amendment, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Warner, but there is no deal, not yet. We all hope that we will reach a point where we can hold each other's hand and say we, as principals in this effort, have agreed to thus and so, and then we will come to the floor and see where we go from there. 
I should state at the very beginning, again, that the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment provides for every State in the United States to have an increase in their highway contract authority--every State, am I not correct on that?

Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. 
Until we brought out our amendment there was no other game in town, no game in town, for increasing highway spending in the States over what was in the reported bill. I had various Senators come to me and say, `We need more money.' I'm not the chairman of any committee at this point, but I said why not spend this money that the American people are putting into the highway trust fund? So I came forward with the amendment to do that, together with Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner. 
Each time citizens go to the gas tank, as gasoline comes out of that nozzle and goes into the tank, the American people see a little cylinder that turns round and round. They should also, in their mind's eye, not only see the gasoline coming out of that nozzle into their tank, they should also see the money which they are paying as an additional tax on gasoline go into that trust fund. As they watch that cylinder, let them think in those terms--there is money going into that trust fund, and they have been told, there are some who don't like to admit this, but they have been told that this money will be spent on highways. Now, that can be discussed because there was a period when they were not told about a particular portion of that money, the 4.3 cents, there was a brief period when that was not going into the trust fund for highways. 
Because of the action by the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and the Finance Committee, that money, the 4.3 cent tax, is not going into the highway trust fund but it is just sitting there. We are saying in our amendment, let's spend it, because the 
American people think that is what they are getting when they go to the gas tank. Don't let anybody tell you they don't think that. 
I was in this Congress in 1956--I was in Congress before that--but in 1956 we created a highway trust fund. That was during the Eisenhower administration. It was during his administration that his great and good idea concerning an interstate highway system came into being. In order to fund that highway system, Congress created a trust fund. The people were told that the moneys that they were putting into that trust fund in 1956 would go for highways, and they have been under that impression for 42 years, except for a couple of years, perhaps, beginning in 1993 or some such. 
Mr. President, the people ought to have faith in their Government and that is what this amendment is all about, a faith-in-Government amendment. Build highways. And the Department of Transportation tells us that only 39 percent of the highway systems throughout this great country stretching from the Atlantic to the western waters and from the border of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico can be considered in good condition. 
The highways are rapidly deteriorating. So are the bridges. We have over 580,000 bridges and 180,000 of them are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The American people want to see their highways and their bridges built back up. We talk a lot about child care. We see people spending their time in the long lines because of congestion. They ought to be home taking care of the children who have just come in from school. They have to have good highways in order to do that. It took me an hour and 15 minutes to get from my house, 10 miles away, to my office yesterday morning. What are we talking about? What are we kidding the people about? That is our purpose. 
Now, I hope, as do my colleagues, that we can reach an agreement among the principals. I am encouraged by this morning's meeting, very much encouraged, by the attitudes and presentations of all who were there. I want to express my compliments and my thanks, again, to the majority leader and to the chairmen of the committees who were there, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Chafee, and to the ranking members who were there. Everyone participated. 
Mr. President, I hope we will be able to continue these discussions. The majority leader is going to ask us to come back tomorrow, and in the meantime we will be talking. But there is no deal, and I hope people will debunk some of such wishful thinking from their minds. We have yet to see where we are going to go and how we are going to get there. We are making progress but we are not there yet. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

I am sure he will agree that until he and Senator Gramm and Senator Baucus and I came up with this amendment, the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, until we came up with that amendment, there wasn't any idea as to how we were going to get more money above the reported bill for the States. It is only because our amendment was prepared and 53 cosponsors are on it today, that any of the States have real prospects for getting more money for highways. 
Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, other Senators and I have spoken numerous times over the past several weeks about the significant problems that will arise in States across the country if the Senate further delays action on the highway bill. Each day we delay adds to the burden of commuters sitting in traffic that is often moving at a crawl or brought to a complete stop because many of our highways are simply overcrowded. Each day we delay brings us closer to the May 1 deadline--just 39 session days away from today. That includes today--39 days. The time bomb is ticking. Senate session days remaining before May 1 deadline: 39. That includes May 1 as it includes today. 
Since 1969, the number of trips per person taken over our roadways increased by more than 72 percent and the number of miles traveled increased by more than 65 percent. 
The combination of traffic growth and deteriorating road conditions has led to an unprecedented level of congestion, not just in our urban centers but in our suburbs and rural areas as well. Congestion is literally choking our roadways as our constituents seek to travel to work, travel to the shopping center, to the child care center, and to the churches. According to the Department of Transportation, more travelers, in more areas, during more hours are facing high levels of congestion and delay than at any time in our history. And these congested conditions make us more susceptible to massive traffic jams as the result of even the most minor of accidents. The DOT tells us that, during peak travel hours, almost 70 percent or the urban interstates and just under 60 percent of other freeways and expressways are either moderately or extremely congested. That is lost man hours, reduced productivity, wasted fuel, and wasted time. 
The worsening congestion is taking a horrible toll on our economic prosperity. I direct the attention of my colleagues to a study conducted by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University. According to the Institute's study, the annual cost of highway congestion in our nation's 50 most congested cities has grown from $26.6 billion in 1982 to almost $53 billion in 1994. In other words, it has doubled. Delay accounted for 85 percent of this cost, while fuel consumption accounted for 15 percent. While more recent data are still being collected, the Institute's researchers state that, in the last four years, the cost of congestion in these cities has only continued to grow. This multi-billion dollar hemorrhage is found not only in our largest cities where eight of the top ten cities had total annual congestion costs exceeding $1 billion; we find congestion taxing severely the economies of several small- and medium-sized cities as well. According to the Institute, the economy of Albuquerque, New Mexico endures an estimated annual cost of congestion approaching $150 million per year; Memphis, Tennessee-- almost $150 million per year; Nashville, Tennessee--almost $200 million per year; Norfolk, Virginia-- more than $350 million per year; Columbus, Ohio-- more than a quarter of a billion dollars per year; Jacksonville, Florida--more than $350 million per year; and San Bernadino-Riverside, California--over $1 billion per year. 
There are a lot of explanations for traffic congestion's growing impact on our cities, but a principal cause of congestion, clearly, is the fact that road mileage has not kept pace with a growing population, a growing work force, and an American lifestyle in which the personal mobility afforded by automobiles is as essential to daily life as are eating and sleeping. Many people say that Americans have a love affair with their cars. More than a love affair, however, Americans simply depend on their cars to squeeze their myriad chores and activities into a busy work day. 
A vehicle is one tool that many American workers cannot do without. They do not just drive to and from work anymore. Americans stop at the day care, the grocery store, the dry cleaners, the PTA meeting, the gymnasium, and at volunteer programs, all in the course of driving to and from work. Transportation researchers call this phenomenon `trip-chaining,' and it is a trend that continues to grow and shows no sign of slowing. 
While the size of our highway network has remained relatively static for years, the condition and performance of those roads has deteriorated. Poor road and bridge conditions must share part of the blame for our nation's congestion problem. According to a 1995 U.S. Department of Transportation's report to Congress, 28 percent of the most heavily traveled U.S. roads are in poor or mediocre condition. That means that those roads need work now--work now--to remain open and protect the safety of the traveling public. And more than 181,000 bridges, or 32 percent of our nations' 575,000 bridges, are in need of repair or replacement, including 70,000 bridges built in the 1960's and designed to last 30 years under 1960's travel conditions. These roads and bridges that have outlived their useful life or that are falling apart from under-investment often are traffic choke-points that can be corrected with the proper repairs. 
And Senators don't have to travel very far away to see the traffic choke-points, as they attempt to cross the bridges, get on the bridges and cross the Potomac every morning and every evening. It took me an hour and 15 minutes to get from my home in McLean, 10 miles away, this morning, to get to my office because of traffic congestion feeding into the streets, and feeding on and feeding off the bridges. We have to get across that Potomac. As I say to my colleagues, we don't have to travel far to see these choke-points working against us, against the traveling public. 
If Senators would like examples of a choke points, they need look no further than the bridges that cross the Potomac River. Most of these bridges were not designed to carry the traffic that accompanies the morning and evening rush hours. As a result, traffic jams back up for miles every work day, in both directions. That is the gridlock that poor roads and bridges can cause. I am sure that if Senators contact their own state transportation departments, they will find numerous examples of traffic choke-points in their own states where a new bridge, smoother pavements, where an additional lane would alleviate the problem and get people and freight moving again. 
And congestion means more than just economic costs. Obviously, congestion costs Americans time that could otherwise be spent with the family, with those children who are coming in from school and times that otherwise could be spent at work, time that could be otherwise spent in school or elsewhere. According to a study by the Texas Transportation Institute, commuters in the country's 50 largest urban areas lose an average of 34 hours each year idling in traffic. Now that is not only time wasted, it is not only gasoline wasted, it is pollution in the air. 
Another, and equally important, cost of congestion is, as I say, its impact on air quality. As cars and trucks are slowed by traffic congestion, they emit more pollutants, thereby impeding efforts in many parts of the country to come into compliance with federal air quality standards. Road improvements aimed at smoothing the flow of traffic can reduce auto-related pollutant emissions substantially. All such improvements, however, cost money. And the Senate should be doing everything possible to ensure that our state and metropolitan officials do not run out of federal highway funds that can help them relieve congestion and improve air quality. 
Today, Mr. President, Americans rely on automobiles for 90 percent or more of all trips. In many areas of the country, we need additional highway capacity to accommodate that travel. And federal highway funds are often a critical source of capital for these projects. 
What can we do about congestion, Mr. President? What can Congress do to help eliminate the $53 billion annual burden borne by commuters in our large cities? What can we do to give people more time at home with their families or on the job instead of stuck in traffic? What can Congress do to our cities and counties to help their air quality? 
Probably the single most important action Congress can take to help alleviate these problems is the prompt enactment of the 6-year highway bill. That bill is on the Senate calendar, ready to go, and the country cannot afford to wait any longer. The May 1 deadline after which States will have no more Federal money--the Governors are in town and I hope that some of them are watching the Senate at this moment--the May 1 deadline after which States will be unable to obligate any more money, and if there is any doubt as to whether or not the States may obligate any more money after midnight, May 1, take a look at what the law says, public law 105-130, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, which is the short-term highway authorization that Congress passed last November before adjourning Sine die. 
Here is what it says. This is the law. `. . . a State shall not'--it doesn't say it may not--`. . . a State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid highway program project after May 1, 1998 . . . .' 
There it is. That is the law. Unless a new law is passed that will be the law on midnight, May 1, all the highway departments throughout the country, the Governors and mayors and other officials and the employees of the various highway agencies throughout the country, will feel the pinch. So the May 1 deadline, after which States cannot obligate new Federal money to finance congestion relief projects, as I say and I repeat it, is just 39 session days away--including today and including May 1. It is drawing nearer with every passing minute. 
Mr. President, we cannot afford to delay. Our constituents stuck in traffic jams need our help. They want their highway taxes used to get them out of gridlock, but we cannot do that while the Senate is stuck in legislative gridlock. I urge the majority leader to get the Senate--and the country--out of gridlock by calling up the highway bill now.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has been blessed with the presence of many fine men and women over the past two centuries. Many of the great figures in our country's history played their parts before a Senate backdrop. Names such as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun leap to mind. 
I should say, incidentally, that I have been unable to find any piece of legislation, certainly any major piece of legislation, that carries the name of Webster, Clay or Calhoun. They did not achieve their greatness by introducing legislation and by seeing it enacted, but they spoke to the great issues of the day and spoke with fervor and courageously and with great vision. 
But there are speakers, thinkers and leaders in more recent times as well, and I think of Robert Taft of Ohio, renowned in his day for his integrity and intelligence; I think of Georgia's erudite, gentlemanly Richard Russell; and of the wise, capable Mike Mansfield from Montana. To these names I would like to add, today, one of my most esteemed colleagues and best friends in the Senate family--Edward M. Kennedy, who, on yesterday, celebrated his 66th birthday. 
Oh, to be 66 again! 
From my perspective, of course, turning 66 places one in the springtime of one's life. What is truly remarkable about Senator Kennedy is that, despite his relative youth, he ranks third in seniority in the Senate. Indeed, having begun his senatorial career at the tender age of 30, there is no reason why Senator Kennedy may not grace this chamber with his presence for another 35 years (although I assure my colleague that, while he may have the upper hand on me in years, I am in no rush to relinquish my seniority to him!). 
But Senator Kennedy's career is not adequately measured in years. Rather, if we are to fairly and truthfully evaluate the career of the senior Senator from Massachusetts, we must reckon with the hard work, the legislative skill, and the undiminished idealism that have been the hallmarks of his Senate tenure. I shall elaborate on each of these points in turn. 
I begin with hard work. For, far from relaxing upon his well-deserved laurels, Senator Kennedy continues to put many of his far younger colleagues to shame with his willingness to put in long hours. I for one have always found it doubly fitting that Senator Kennedy is the ranking member (and former Chairman) of the Senate Labor Committee. For the Senator is not just a passionate advocate of the causes of working men and women; he is also one of the most industrious members of this body, and a man whose tireless labor continues to inspire others. Senator Kennedy knows well that, as Thomas Edison pointed out several generations ago, `there is no substitute for hard work,' and his success as a legislator owes much to his energy and dedication. 
This brings me to my second point: the remarkable legislative acumen of my dear friend from Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy first ran for the Senate in 1962 under the slogan `He can do more for Massachusetts,' and he has certainly more than lived up to those words. Massachusetts and the rest of the country owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Kennedy. I will not try to recite all of his legislative achievements. Though many may consider me an orator of the old school, I have no intention of delaying the business of this body for the many hours that such a recitation would require. Instead, let me just point out a few of his more recent achievements, such as AmeriCorps, the School-to-Work Opportunity Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Job Training Partnership Act (and subsequent amendments). Few Senators have been as successful and as skillful as Senator Kennedy at passing bills. Never content simply to endorse the efforts of his colleagues or to introduce a bill for the sole purpose of providing fodder for a self-serving press release, Senator Kennedy brings to each of his legislative endeavors the diligence, savvy, and bipartisanship that have made him a great lawmaker. 
Finally, I wish to salute Senator Kennedy's idealism. Throughout his career, Senator Kennedy has fought for a simple premise: that our society's greatness lies in its ability and willingness to provide for its less fortunate members. Whether striving to increase the minimum wage, to ensure that all children have medical insurance, or to secure open access to higher education, Senator Kennedy has shown time and time again that he cares deeply for those whose needs greatly exceed their political clout. Unbowed by personal setbacks or by the terrible sorrow that has been visited upon his family time and time again, his idealism burns forth as resolutely and indefatigably as the torch burning over the grave of his brother, President John F. Kennedy. 
And so, Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to wish my good friend and beloved colleague, Ted Kennedy, a happy, healthy 66th birthday. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to reiterate the pressing need for early Senate action on S.1173, the highway bill, commonly referred to as ISTEA II. The federal-aid highway program expired on September 30, last year. In November, Congress passed a short-term extension of the program, but we included in that stop-gap measure a deadline for enacting a new highway bill this year. And I remind my colleagues, the deadline of May 1 is fast approaching. The clock is ticking; the calendar is running. After May 1, 1998, no state will be able to obligate any federal highway funds unless a new highway bill has been signed into law by that time. 
So, Mr. President, at this point, there are exactly 40 session-days remaining--including today--until the clock strikes midnight on May 1 and every state's ability to obligate federal highway funds is suddenly and indefinitely cut off. The longer the Senate waits to take up the legislation, the more likely it is that the federal-aid highway program will lapse and road work in many states will slow to a trickle or come to an abrupt halt. Unlike past delays in reauthorizing the highway program, the obligation of highway funds will not go forward after that date, if there is not new authorizing legislation enacted by Congress in the meantime. Mr. President, that means that unlike those past reauthorizations of the highway program, this year it will come at the height of the construction season. As a result, construction workers are likely to be laid off, at a time of the year that many of them depend upon their largest paychecks to come in to help them and their families. 
And these lay-offs will not be mere statistics, Mr. President. We are talking about the loss of real jobs for real people who have real families. There are thousands of road construction workers around the country whose jobs are in greater and greater risk each day that we delay action on the highway bill. We in the Congress have an obligation to those workers and their families, our constituents, to beat the May 1 deadline and prevent those lay-offs and work stoppages from occurring. 
Let me describe just how important this highway legislation is for the construction industry. According to the most recent biennial report of the U.S. Department of Transportation on the condition and performance of the nation's highways, federal, state, and local governments combined invest approximately $39 billion annually in capital improvements to our roads and bridges. That is a lot of money. That is $39 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Federal funds account for 44% of that investment. That means, in little more than two months, almost half of all the funds spent on road construction in this country will dry up--disappear--and the results will be unfortunate for many who work in road construction and related industries. Construction laborers and employers, those who supply construction materials and equipment, thousands employed at engineering and design companies--these people and their families face an uncertain future because of the Congress' failure to act promptly on this very important highway bill. 
Even now, the approaching May 1 deadline is having a disruptive impact on road construction in some states, and the disruptions will grow exponentially if the deadline comes and passes without enactment of a new highway bill. For instance, the state of Missouri has announced it will stop bid-lettings in April, Illinois and Ohio will follow suit on May 1, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation has told contractors that the state will delay all federally-funded highway projects beginning in March, when they will run out of available intrastate maintenance money. They will run out of resources from other Federal programs soon thereafter. 
So the State of Missouri will let its last Federal contract in March. As I have already indicated, the State of Ohio will stop bid-letting on or around May 1, and the State of Illinois has reported that in the April-to-June timeframe it will be required to defer over one-quarter of a billion dollars in planned Federal projects. 
As states announce delays in project bid-lettings, contractors know they will have more difficulty in finding work for their employees and making payments on their machinery and facilities. If Congress has not enacted a new highway bill by May 1, contractors across the country will 
have to begin laying off their employees as projects are completed. According to officials at the Associated General Contractors, most companies will not begin rehiring construction workers until at least a month after new legislation is enacted. Furthermore, companies will stop using their concrete, pipe, steel, cement, asphalt and guardrail suppliers and won't use them again until 45-60 days after new legislation becomes law. 
In addition, if the federal highway program is left unfunded for a number of months, the employees of the construction companies will attempt to find employment elsewhere, I should think. They have to continue to put bread on that table for a wife and for children. If they are successful in gaining other employment, the construction companies will have to hire new employees, often requiring expensive and time-consuming job training. 
If new federal highway funds are not available after May 1, much of the summer construction season will be gone. If there is no new highway bill until September, the entire fall construction season will be lost, and since winter road construction is nearly impossible in many of our northern tier states, construction and related industries in those states may be out of work until spring, 1999. How many companies will survive the loss of income for that lengthy period of time, Mr. President? What effect will it have on the families of construction workers left unemployed because of our inaction, our delay on the highway bill? 
Remember, construction does not operate like an assembly line that can be stopped and started again on short notice. The design and construction of highway projects are carefully planned months in advance. Projects to be constructed in September generally must be planned early on and funded by May. 
And if our inaction on the highway bill cripples the construction industry, what effect will it have on the national economy? 
Mr. President, the last Census of the Construction Industry tallied 572,851 construction companies with a total employment of 4.6 million persons. The industry's annual estimated payroll is $118 billion, and construction companies work on projects valued at approximately $528 billion a year in the United States. Clearly, crippling the construction industry will have a ripple effect on our overall economy.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior Senator from Vermont for his remarks. They are both timely and appropriate. I deeply appreciate his contribution to this colloquy. 
Vermont, like West Virginia--and like many other States, as he has pointed out--has a short construction seasons, especially when we think of winter, and spring, fall, and winter again. 
So the time is now. And I feel greatly emboldened and encouraged by the comments of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. He is a stalwart supporter of all things that benefit his State, and the other States of the country. 
I thank him very much.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is an unfortunate fact of life in today's Senate that, as Members go about the business of fulfilling their duties, it is increasingly difficult to find time in our hectic schedules to acknowledge the personal milestones of our colleagues. I intend to rectify this situation in part today by taking just a few minutes to congratulate my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, on the occasion of his 68th birthday. 
Oh, Mr. President, only to be 68 again. Oliver Wendell Holmes said, `Oh, just to be 70 again.' Well, I feel very much in that same mode. 
Born in the prairie town of Wichita, Kansas, at the start of the Great Depression, Arlen Specter, through the diligent application of his intellect and his tenacity, has become the 1,750th individual to serve this great nation as a United States Senator. 
Mr. President, Senators serve with Presidents. I hope Senators will remember that. Senators don't serve under Presidents. Senators serve with Presidents. President is another office, a high office, indeed, in the executive branch. But Senator Specter is the 1,750th individual to serve this great Nation as United States Senator, and he has served with Presidents in both parties. 
Woodrow Wilson reportedly said, `The profession I chose was politics; the profession I entered was law. I entered the one because I thought it would lead to the other.' Mr. President, I do not know if, in Senator Specter's case, he came to the same conclusion or if politics was for him a natural calling, but whatever the case, the melding of politics and law in the person of this thoughtful, soft-spoken Pennsylvanian has resulted in an inspired result for the people of the Keystone State. 
A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University Law School, Arlen Specter began his remarkable public career as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia, where he won the first conviction in the Nation of labor racketeers, fought consumer fraud, and relentlessly prosecuted corrupt public officials. That willingness to take on the tough fights, no matter where they might lead, has become the hallmark of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. 
But dogged pursuit of righting criminal wrongs is only one facet of Arlen Specter's many-faceted character. As a Member of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, Senator Arlen Specter has worked long hours, and with great determination, in an effort to see that Federal dollars are wisely usedto combat breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, I believe it is fair to say that my friend from Pennsylvania takes a second seat to no one when it comes to his commitment to doing all that he can to provide a better, healthier life not only for those whom he represents in Pennsylvania, but also for all Americans. 
Mr. President, it is this fortuitous combination of legal acumen, tenacity, and compassion for the difficulties of others that has made Arlen Specter a highly-respected Member of this body, one whose counsel is so valuable to all who know him and work with him. As Henri Frederic Amiel noted in his Journal on April 7, 1851, `man becomes man only by the intelligence, but he is man only by the heart.' Senator Specter is a superior example of what Henri Frederic Amiel meant by that pronouncement. So I offer my friend and colleague my heartfelt congratulations, and also my thanks to him for his wisdom, his character, and his decency on this day which marks the beginning of his 68th--almost the beginning--I suppose it is the beginning of his 68th year. Oh, but to be 68 again. 
So I say to my friend from Pennsylvania: 
The hours are like a string of pearls, 
The days like diamonds rare, 
The moments are the threads of gold, 
That bind them for our wear. 
So may the years that come to you 
Such wealth and good contain 
That every moment, hour and day 
Be like a golden chain. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana for his kindness in yielding to me. I yield the floor. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for his remarks on this very important subject. I sat and listened to them. I found them to be very illuminating, very interesting, very informative and refreshing. 
I have been around a good many years. I didn't realize all of the steps, the lengthy process, the consumption of time that is required from the alpha to the omega of planning and completing the highway. This has been most edifying to me as I have listened. I thank the Senator. 
I recommend to all Senators that they read in the Congressional Record the statement that has been made today by Senator Baucus. He sits on the authorizing committee, and he has had an opportunity because of the jurisdiction of that committee over highways, he has invested many years in the study of this subject matter, and it is a real privilege to have him part of the Senate. I thank him for imparting to me, and I am glad I took the time and sat here and listened to him. 
This vast knowledge--I am sure he could speak all afternoon on this subject without notes. I thank him. His comments have been very helpful. I hope all Senators will read these remarks in the Record and that Senators will join in cosponsoring the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. 
If the Senator will allow me 10 more seconds, I ask unanimous consent that the following three Senators be added as cosponsors to the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment numbered 1397 to the bill S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997: Senator Dodd, Senator Bingaman, Senator Thurmond.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and especially the distinguished chairman of the committee, my lovable colleague from Rhode Island, Senator John Chafee, that old crusty New Englander, whom I greatly admire, for including some very important provisions in S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, or ISTEA II. In my statement today, I will focus on the important provisions in the committee-reported bill that will expedite the delivery of desperately needed transportation projects to the American people--that is, if we ever get the opportunity to debate and amend and adopt this important bill. 
I think most members would agree that addressing environmental issues in this body in a strong bipartisan way is--to say the least--difficult. Yet, Senator Chafee has managed to accomplish what few Senators have been able to do--craft legislation that enjoys strong support from Senators on both sides of the aisle that would help put order and efficiency in the way transportation projects are reviewed by both state and federal agencies, and as a result, reduce the time it takes to plan a project by as much as three years. 
The ISTEA bill as reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, recognizes that every day counts when planning and constructing a highway or bridge in this country are undertaken. The problem that was addressed in S. 1173 is a serious one. It now takes ten years to plan, design, and construct a typical transportation project in this country. I am sure that if Senators contacted their own state transportation departments, they would be disturbed to find the number of transportation projects that are being delayed due to overlapping and often redundant regulatory reviews and processes. These delays increase costs and postpone needed safety improvements that would save lives. One of the lives it saves may be yours. Think about it. I can tell my colleagues that, in my state of West Virginia, these numerous regulatory reviews have delayed critical improvements to the two most dangerous segments of roadway in the state. 
Why does it take so long to plan a project? These delays are occurring because the development of a transportation project involves multiple federal and state agencies evaluating the impacts of the project and possible alternatives, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). While it would seem that the NEPA process would establish a uniform set of regulations and procedures for the submission of documents nationwide, this has not been the case. 
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and their companion state agencies each require a separate review and approval process, forcing separate reviews guided by separate regulations and requiring planners to answer separate requests for information. Moreover, each of these agencies issues approvals according to separate schedules. The result: the time period from project beginning to completion has grown to at least 10 years in many instances, and that assumes that the project is not controversial and that adequate funding is available. If either of these assumptions is not the case, the time period may be even longer. 
The highway bill reported by the Environment & Public Works Committee effectively improves the project planning process by establishing a coordinated environmental review procedure within the U.S. Department of Transportation. This change would allow all reviews, all analyses, and all permits to be performed concurrently and cooperatively within a mutually-agreed-upon schedule, by both the federal and state agencies with jurisdiction over the project. Effective environmental coordination, as envisioned under the ISTEA bill, would result in less staff time and less expense for all the agencies and stakeholders in the NEPA process and reduce the time it now takes in reaching a final decision with respect to receiving project approvals and permits. 
The committee studied a problem, the committee sought a solution, and the committee put that solution in their bill. I understand that further improvements to those provisions may be offered on the Senate floor, if and when we finally take up and debate S. 1173, the 6-year highway authorization bill. But here is the problem: we are not considering S. 1173. We are not considering the 6-year highway authorization bill. When will the bill be brought up? How long, Mr. President, must we wait? Every day counts when planning and constructing a transportation project. But soon, there will be no more days to count because the program--the short-term, 6-month highway authorization measure--will have expired and the funds will have dried up. Counting today--counting today--there are only 42 session days remaining through May 1. 
So, we count today, and we count the day of May 1. And counting these 2 days, there are only 42 session days remaining. The time bomb is ticking. You can hear it tick. And with every tick a minute, an hour, a day will be gone. The time bomb is ticking--tick, tick, tick, tick. No projects will be delivered under any review process after May 1, because that is the drop-dead date in the short-term extension legislation presently in place, beyond which no State may obligate any Federal dollars. 
Let's pause to read the language that is in the law--the law which Congress passed last November and which was signed by President Clinton on December 1 of last year. Read the language in the law. Read the language, I say to the Governors and the mayors and the highway agencies and to Senate and House Members. Read it. Here it is. I now read from Public Law 105-130: The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997. Here it is. Read it. Hear me as it is: 
` . . . a State shall not-- 
It doesn't say `may not.' 
` . . . a State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid highway program project after May 1, 1998 . . . .' 
Let me read it again. This is the language in the law which the Senate and House passed and which the President signed. Here is the language: 
` . . . a State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid highway program project after May 1, 1998 . . . .' 
As I say, counting today, and May 1, also, we have only 42 days in which the Senate will be in session, not counting Sundays, not counting Saturdays, not counting holidays. We have 42 session days. The time bomb is ticking. 
The clock is ticking. The days are counting down now before this deadline. If an ISTEA reauthorization bill is not enacted by midnight on May 1, highway program obligations will cease and projects will not move forward. 
Any delay in the planning and construction phases of a project may cause the price of the project to rise considerably. In addition, a delay in federal funding can cause a logjam of projects to be let for bidding, resulting in a `crowding' of a large number of proposed projects into the latter part of a construction season. 
The construction seasons are soon going to be upon us, when  
The lark's on the wing; 
The snail's on the thorn; 
God's in his heaven-- 
All's right with the world. 
Spring will be here. But will a 6-year highway authorization bill have been passed? 
This increased workload may strain the capacity of the construction industry and subsequently increase the cost of projects. 
Stopping the Federal-aid highway program, even for a brief period, will also impact project delivery schedules in the long run. If preliminary engineering and design work is not allowed to proceed, then construction will not occur and, in fact, will be deferred into a second construction season, thus crowding out and delaying projects that were planned for the second year. Such a delay would have a ripple effect--a ripple effect--from which it may take years for states to fully recover. Remember, we are talking about critical transportation projects designed to improve highway safety, reduce traffic congestion, and clean our air. 
We hear much about global warming--much about global warming. This is the place to start. Pass a highway bill. Cut down on the traffic congestion, the traffic jams, and the long lines of cars. Cut down on the pollution that is filling the air while those cars sit and idle and the time bomb ticks away. 
The programmatic reforms in the committee-reported bill that I have discussed here are very important. They will save time, they will save money, and they will save lives. Yet, because we have not begun consideration of the bill in this session, not one of these gains has become a reality. The single most important factor that will determine the timeliness of project delivery in 1998 will be the timely reauthorization of ISTEA 
--the 6-year highway reauthorization bill. 
So the time bomb is out there. It is in that language that I read a moment ago from the law. The American people cannot afford to wait even 1 day past May 1 for the United States Congress to reauthorize ISTEA. The U.S. Senate has the time now to consider ISTEA, and that is what we should do. 
How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
Let me close for now with a passage from the Book of Isaiah, 58th chapter and the 12th verse. And I read only from the King James version of the Bible. In all probability, that is the version that our forefathers brought over on the Mayflower--the King James version. Read these other versions, and they will say, `In my father's House are many dwelling places.' But the King James version says `In my father's House are many mansions.' Ah, how much more beautiful is that elegant language! 
I read now from the King James version of the Bible, 58th chapter and the 12th verse. 
And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: 
thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; 
and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, 
The restorer of paths to dwell in. 
Mr. President, I urge the majority leader to be the `Repairer of the Breach' by calling up ISTEA now, so that we may be one step closer towards enacting the provisions called for in S. 1173 that would help accelerate the delivery of vitally-important transportation projects to the American people. 
Let me say again as I have said here before, I have been majority leader. I was majority leader during the years 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980, and I was again the majority leader during the 100th Congress in 1987-1988. I know the pressures that are on any majority leader. I have felt them. I have walked in those same footprints that other majority leaders have tread on the sands of time. I know that it is very difficult, and many times impossible, to adhere to the wishes, to the pleas of those who implore, those who beseech, those who importune the majority leader to do this, to do that, to do something else. The majority leader cannot please everybody. 
This is not a partisan bill. This is a nonpartisan bill. There is no partisanship in this bill. There is no partisanship in the amendment that I have offered with Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner as the chief cosponsors. There are 54 Members of the Senate who are cosponsoring the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, and they are from both sides of the aisle. They are Republicans and Democrats, about evenly divided, I would say, among those names that are on that amendment. 
There is no partisanship here. There is no partisanship in my urging the majority leader to call up ISTEA--no partisanship. I know he is under great pressure from some of the Senators on the Budget Committee, including, I am sure, the distinguished chairman, Mr. Domenici, a man who has one of the finest brains in this Senate. He does not want the ISTEA bill brought up, he and Mr. Chafee. Mr. Chafee has said so. So I am not saying anything behind their backs that I would not say anywhere. They prefer to wait until the budget resolution is called up. 
Mr. President, the country needs a 6-year highway authorization bill, and the time is ticking. Failure to call it up will only undermine the very necessary progress that this bill is designed to make. 
I believe that if the majority leader were left to his own pursuits--he has not told me this--he would call this bill up. But my good friend, Senator Domenici, is a very powerful Senator. He was here a moment ago. He will be back later today. And I am not saying anything to make him feel that I am taking any advantage of him. But if he would just leave it to the majority leader, I think we would get this bill up. That is my own opinion. 
Mr. President, failure to take up the bill, as I say, will undermine the very necessary progress that that bill is trying to make, and it deprives me and other Senators from calling up amendments to that bill. Our transportation system, our people's safety, and the country's economy all await action by the Congress on the 6-year highway authorization bill. What are we waiting for? How long, Mr. President, how long will we have to wait? How long? 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may already be aware, in a decision announced today by Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Line Item Veto Act has been found to be unconstitutional, an unconstitutional delegation of the Congress' power over the purse. While I congratulate each of the plaintiffs and their attorneys, this victory does not belong to them alone. This is a victory for the American people. It is their Constitution, it is their Republic, and their liberties that have been made more secure. 
Judge Hogan's opinion parallels a previous decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, also for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in Byrd v. Raines, as well as the opinions expressed by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens in that same earlier case. While I fully expect this decision today to be appealed and I, therefore, recognize this as a first step, I nevertheless regard it as an important step. 
For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to take just a few moments to read pertinent excerpts from Judge Hogan's decision. I read now, beginning with that section titled `Procedural Requirements of Article I.' 
I continue to read from Judge Hogan's opinion: 
The Constitution carefully prescribes certain formal procedures that must be observed in the enactment of laws. The Line Item Veto Act impermissibly attempts to alter these constitutional requirements through mere legislative action. Because the act violates Article I's `single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure,' . . . it is unconstitutional. * * * * * 
Both Houses of Congress, through a process of discussion and compromise, had agreed upon the exact content of the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act. These laws reflected the best judgment of both Houses. The laws that resulted after the President's line item veto were different from those consented to by both Houses of Congress. There is no way of knowing whether these laws, in their truncated form, would have received the requisite support from both the House and the Senate. Because the laws that emerged after the Line Item Veto are not the same laws that proceeded through the legislative process, as required, the resulting laws are not valid. 
Furthermore, the President violated the requirements of Article I when he unilaterally canceled provisions of duly enacted statutes. Unilateral action by any single participant in the law-making process is precisely what the Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses were designed to prevent. Once a bill becomes law, it can only be repealed or amended through another, independent legislative enactment, which itself must conform with the requirements of Article I. Any rescissions must be agreed upon by a majority of both Houses of Congress. The President cannot single-handedly revise the work of the other two participants in the lawmaking process, as he did here when he vetoed certain provisions of these statutes. * * * * * 
Whatever defendants wish to call the President's action, it has every mark of a veto. * * * * * 
Finally, Congress' `indirect attempt[] to accomplish what the Constitution prohibits . . . accomplishing directly' cannot stand. . . . `To argue otherwise is to suggest that the Framers spent significant time and energy in debating and crafting Clauses that could be easily evaded.' Congress knew that a single Line Item Veto, performed prior to the President's signature, would violate Article I's requirement that the president sign or return the bills in toto. This limitation on the President has been clear since George Washington's tenure. 
Let me quote the words of George Washington as they are quoted in Judge Hogan's opinion: (`From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto.') Congress cannot evade this long-accepted requirement by merely changing the timing of the President's cancellation. 
Because the Line Item Veto Act produced laws in violation of the requirement of bicameral passage, because it permitted the President unilaterally to repeal or amend duly enacted laws, and because it impermissibly attempts to evade the requirement that the President sign or reject a bill in toto, the Act violates the requirements of Article I. For that reason alone, the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional. 
Now, under the heading `Separation of Powers,' in Judge Hogan's opinion, I find these words, and I quote from his opinion: 
Furthermore, the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional because it impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of government. The separation of powers into three coordinate branches is central to the principles on which this country was founded. . . . The declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of government was to `diffuse power the better to secure liberty.' * * * * * 
Pursuant to the doctrine of separated powers, certain functions are divided between the legislative and executive branches. Article I, section I vests all legislative authority in Congress. Legislative power is the authority to make laws[,] 
Says Judge Hogan. Executive power, on the other hand, is to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' * * * * * 
With regard to lawmaking, the President's function is strictly a negative one: to veto a bill in its entirety. 
While it is Congress' duty to make laws, Congress can delegate certain rulemaking authority to other branches, as long as that delegation is appropriate to the duties of that branch. (`[T]he lawmaking function belongs to Congress . . . and may not be conveyed to another branch or entity.'); * * * * * 
The Line Item Veto Act impermissibly crosses the line between acceptable delegations of rulemaking authority and unauthorized surrender to the President of an inherently legislative function, namely, the authority to permanently shape laws and package legislation. The Act---- 
Writes Judge Hogan, enables the President, in his discretion, to pick and choose among portions of an enacted law to determine which ones will remain valid. The Constitution, however, dictates that once a bill becomes law, the President's sole duty is to `take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' His power 
Writes Judge Hogan, cannot expand to that of `co-designer' of the law--that is Congress' domain. Any subsequent amendment of a statute falls under Congress' responsibility to legislate. The President cannot take this duty upon himself; nor can Congress relinquish that power to the Executive Branch.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, next Monday is the official observance of the birthday of our first President, George Washington, who so wisely observed, as did Judge Hogan, `From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in toto.' How right George Washington was! I can think of no greater tribute to his wisdom than this decision today. 
Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague who joined in preparing the amicus and who has, all the way from the beginning of these debates, which have gone on for years now, stood like the Irish oak in opposition to giving the President of the United States--any President, Republican or Democrat--a line-item veto. 
I salute my friend, and I am very grateful to him for the work that he has done and for his constant support and leadership as we have stood together with Senator Carl Levin, who cannot be here today because he is in Europe. If Senator Moynihan had been at the Constitutional Convention, even though Judge Yates and Mr. Lansing left the Convention early, leaving only Alexander Hamilton to sign that great document, Senator Moynihan would have been there to attach his signature. And not only that, he would have joined with Hamilton and Madison and Jay in writing one of the greatest documents of all time, the Federalist Papers. I yield to my friend.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Max Cleland, for his fine statement urging action on the ISTEA bill now. 
Mr. President, bad roads are killers. In 1996, nearly 42,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents on America's highways; in 1996, 355 of those fatalities occurred in West Virginia. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) maintains that poor road designs and conditions are a contributing factor in at least 30 percent of those fatal crashes. That works out to more than 12,000 Americans--over 100 West Virginians--whose lives could be saved each year by an investment in better, safer roads. These fatalities are not just numbers. They are lives, precious lives lost because we are not spending the money that is needed to make our highways safe. 
And roadway fatalities are on the rise, having risen in each of the past 5 years. Highway crashes are now the fifth highest cause of all deaths and the leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 6 and 27. 
This national problem can be blamed, at least in part, on the deplorable and deteriorating condition of our Nation's highways and bridges. Of the 950,215 road-miles eligible for Federal funds, the Federal Highway Administration, in its biennial Performance and Conditions Report, found that 28 percent of the pavement mileage is poor or mediocre in condition, meaning it needs immediate repair to remain passable. The FHWA also reports that the country has 181,748 bridges, in other words, 31 percent of all bridges over 20 feet in length, that are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The report estimates that nationwide investments must average $54.8 billion annually just to maintain current road and bridge conditions over the next 20 years, $74 billion annually to improve the highway network. Currently, all levels of government, Federal, State, and local combined, are investing only $34.8 billion annually. That means we are not even coming close to making the investments necessary to maintain our vital highway infrastructure. 
Fortunately, this trend can be reversed. Well designed and maintained roads will increase our safety by reducing vehicle deaths and injuries. They also save Americans the anguish of losing a loved one. 
The Federal Highway Administration has conducted extensive research on the lifesaving improvements that can be made to our highways and bridges. According to Federal Highway Administration research: Widening a road lane by 1 foot can lower crash rates by 12 percent. Widening a road lane by 2 feet can lower accident rates by 23 percent. 
The construction of medians for traffic separation can reduce fatal crash rates by 73 percent. This is information from the Federal Highway Administration. The term `fatal crash rate' means the number of fatal crashes per 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Shoulder widening can lower fatal crash rates by 22 percent, and one of the lives that is saved may be yours, yours--and roadway alignment improvements can lower fatal crash rates by 66 percent. These are huge figures. 
Widening or modifying a bridge reduces fatal crash rates by 49 percent, and constructing a new bridge when the current one is deficient can reduce fatal crash rates by 86 percent. 
I well remember, and shall never forget, the fatal collapse of the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, WV, in 1967, in which collapse 46 people plunged to their deaths in the cold waters of the Ohio, the Ohio River; 46 people plunged to their deaths in 1967, 31 years ago, when the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant collapsed. 
So, constructing new bridges when the current bridges are deficient can reduce fatal crash rates by 86 percent. Upgrading bridge ratings can cut fatal crash rates by 75 percent. 
In addition, the number of lanes on a road has an impact on safety. National statistics show that four-lane divided highways are substantially safer than other roads. Four-lane divided highways are substantially safer than other roads. 
May I say to my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, that when I was in the legislature in West Virginia in 1947, 51 years ago, West Virginia had a total of 4 miles--West Virginia had a total of 4 miles of divided four-lane highway; 51 years ago. Four miles. That was it for the entire State. And today there are almost 900 miles of divided, four-lane highways. 
National statistics show that four-lane divided highways are substantially safer than other roads. In 1995, 77 percent of all fatal crashes--get that, 3 out of 4--77 percent of all fatal crashes occurred on two-lane roads, while only 5 percent of those crashes took place on four-lane divided highways. 
Of course, making the types of improvements I just outlined will cost money. But making that investment will reap human dividends. According to the Department of Transportation's 1996 Annual Report on Highway Safety Improvement Programs, every $100 million invested in roadway safety improvements will result in 144--12 dozen--144 fewer traffic fatalities. 
And now, Mr. President, we arrive at the crux of the matter. The U.S. Senate is sitting idle. Not exactly sitting idle. There are other matters that are being considered and they are not unimportant. But insofar as doing something about the highway conditions of the country is concerned, the United States is sitting idle--the U.S. Senate and House are sitting idle when Congress should be working to finish the ISTEA bill, 
a bill which was brought up last October and debated, or at least it was before the Senate for about 21 days and then it was taken down and a short-term, stop-gap highway authorization measure was enacted, which will expire at midnight--midnight, when the clock strikes 12, midnight, on May 1, just 43--43--days away. Mr. President, there is a time bomb ticking here. Congress has 43 session days. Let's talk about the Senate. The Senate has 43 session days remaining, and that includes today; 43 session days remaining until midnight May 1. So 43 days includes today and includes May 1. The clock is ticking, and the time bomb is ticking. 
Roadway safety depends on the uninterrupted flow of Federal highway funds, and yet the Senate is literally inviting a shutdown of our State and Federal highway programs by delaying action on ISTEA II. Forty-three days, 43 session days when the Senate will be in session, not including Saturdays and Sundays and holidays. 
Senators don't have to just take my word for that. Let's see what the law says. The short-term highway bill that the Senate passed and the House passed and was signed into law by President Clinton on December 1 of last year, let's see what that law says. That is the short-term highway authorization bill by which the time was extended 6 months, the authorization for highway programs, spending on highway programs. 
Let's see what Public Law 105-130, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997 says, in part. Hear it:

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Rockefeller, former Governor from West Virginia, who served 2 terms as Governor. I thank him for joining in urging that the ISTEA bill be called up at this time. And he made the point that partisanship isn't involved here. There is no partisanship in this. 
Both sides of the aisle--there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who want ISTEA, the ISTEA bill to be called up. And there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who are supporting the amendment, the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, which would provide for the moneys that are in the trust fund, the moneys that the American people have paid at the gas pump, the 4.3-cent gas tax, for example. That is doing nothing now except building up surpluses in the trust fund. 
There are Senators on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, who want to see those moneys that are spent by the American people out there in the form of gas taxes, who want to see those spent for highways to improve highways and mass transit programs. As of now, they are just building surpluses; they are not being spent for anything. 
There are those in this Senate who are importuning the distinguished majority leader not to call up this highway bill right now because they want to wait until after the budget resolution is adopted so that these moneys in the trust fund can be 
spent for social programs, and so on, that the administration and some Senators, of course, want to spend those moneys on. But the American people believe, because they have been told, that the moneys in the trust fund should be spent for highway improvements and transit improvements. 
I have not said much on the West Virginia angle of this, but I intend to. But that is what the amendment which Senator Gramm and Senator Baucus and Senator Warner and I and 50 other Senators, making a total of 54 Senators, are urging, that that ISTEA bill be brought up, urging that the money in the highway trust fund be spent for highways to improve the highways and to improve transit programs. 
So that money is there. And, as I say, there are some on the Budget Committee, not all, some on the Budget Committee who are importuning the leader, the majority leader, not to bring up ISTEA now--keep it, wait, wait until after the budget resolution is brought up. And those particular Senators, in my judgment, do not want to see those gas tax moneys spent on highways. They want to spend them on other programs. 
So, Mr. President, I again urge that the leadership keep its commitment to the Senate and call up this highway bill. I can understand the pressures on the majority leader. I have been majority leader. And I can understand the pressures that are on the majority leader from other Senators. And, as I say, I have a feeling that the majority leader, if he did not have those pressures, would have the ISTEA bill brought up now. I have a feeling--I certainly have a hope--that he would support the amendment that 53 of my colleagues are supporting. 
Mr. President, I again thank my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, especially for his reference to Corridor H and Corridor D and other corridors in West Virginia. 
I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is a small vocal group in West Virginia that opposes Corridor H. But there was a poll taken in West Virginia within the last 2 weeks, I believe, that showed that 80 percent--79 percent of West Virginians support the completion of Corridor H inside West Virginia. Only about 6 percent--6 percent--of the people are very opposed, and that is the highly vocal group over there that has been opposing Corridor H. Of course, they have some people over in some of the adjoining States who add their voices to the small 6 percent in West Virginia who are opposed to completing Corridor H. About 8 or 9 percent, as I understand it, from the poll do not take any position one way or another. But 79 percent take a strong position for the completion of Corridor H inside West Virginia. 
So my colleague mentioned Corridor H. And I hope that eventually in my lifetime we can see Corridor H completed inside West Virginia. It has been promised to the people of West Virginia for 33 years. And the Appalachian highway system has been promised to the 13 States in Appalachia for 33 years. It is 78 percent complete in the region, 74 percent in West Virginia. 
The time bomb is ticking. I hope that we can get that bill up and let the Senate work its will on these amendments, my amendment included. 
Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Texas for his patience.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from Texas. He worked inside the Finance Committee to offer an amendment which was adopted in the committee transferring the 4.3-cent gas tax to the trust fund, to the highway trust fund, where it would be spent on highways and mass transit programs. So he got it that far. So the money is in the trust fund, and I compliment him. 
Now he has joined with me and 52 other Senators--in addition to the two of us, he has joined with me and 52 other Senators, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Warner, in particular--who are initial cosponsors of this legislation. He has joined with us in attempting to authorize, to have the Congress authorize, the expenditure of the moneys in the trust fund, the 4.3-cent gas tax, to authorize the expenditure of those funds for highways and for mass transit programs. 
That is what they were intended to be used for. He has stood like a stout Irish oak on his side of the aisle in urging that the ISTEA bill be brought up and in urging support of this amendment upon which we are both allied and working. I thank him for that. I thank him for his steadfastness; he has stood like a Rock of Gibraltar. We will continue to work in the effort to implore the bringing up of this highway bill. I thank him very much.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in February 1997, scientists in Scotland were successful in producing a cloned sheep, named `Dolly.' This incredible event shocked the world and led to the realization that, at some point, cloning human beings might also be on the horizon. Shortly after the announcement about Dolly, my concern about the ethical and moral implications of cloning human beings led me to cosponsor Senator Bond's bill, S. 368, that would prohibit the use of Federal funds for research on human cloning. I believe that, with the notable exception of Dr. Richard Seed, who has announced to the world his intention of cloning a human being, there is broad agreement that cloning humans is unacceptable on many grounds. 
But, the successful cloning of `Dolly' has prompted scientists to ponder other potential uses of somatic cell nuclear technology, the technique used to create Dolly. Scientists believe that research using this technique might hold promise for a whole host of devastating human diseases. For this reason many in the scientific community are urging Congress to move cautiously in this area, lest overly broad legislation have unintended consequences. Care in its crafting is, therefore, imperative. 
Given the concerns raised by the scientific community and patient groups, it is therefore prudent that we proceed with caution and only after thorough consideration of the ramifications that may follow if we were to enact S. 1601, the bill before us today. This bill has received not one hour of hearing before the appropriate committee. Who can say with any comfort what the impact may be on important research aimed at dread diseases? Doesn't important and potentially far reaching legislation such as this at least warrant hearings before we proceed? This legislation could have unintended and detrimental consequences. 
Let us now get down to hard work and take the time necessary to determine how to go about banning the cloning of human beings in a clear and precise way that will avoid the unwanted consequence of also banning important research intended to alleviate the pain and suffering of victims of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and many types of dreadful cancers. 
I will vote against invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to S.1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act. While I wish to register strong opposition to cloning a human being, I also believe that bringing this recently-introduced legislation to the Senate floor for consideration without hearings by the appropriate Senate committee, including testimony from expert witnesses is a mistake.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, since the convening of this session of Congress 2 weeks ago today, I have spoken on the Senate Floor numerous times to convey the urgency of prompt action on the highway bill. We were told that it would be among the first pieces of legislation considered this year, and yet the bill is still not before us. This inactivity is unjustified and, I think, it is inexcusable. The deadline for passing highway reauthorization legislation is May 1--May 1 of this year. 
That deadline is set forth in the short-term highway bill that was passed last November before the Congress adjourned sine die. It is very clearly set forth in that legislation. After May 1, States will be prohibited from obligating any Federal highway or transit funds. 
After that date, states will be prohibited from obligating any Federal highway or transit funds. As a result, many states will be forced to delay road and bridge projects and thousands of highway construction workers, as well as those in related industries, such as gravel and asphalt manufacturers, highway equipment manufacturers, and steel suppliers, may begin to be laid off. 
At the height of the highway construction season, thousands of highway, bridge, and safety projects will be stopped cold--dead in their tracks--and those who are employed in relation to these projects could begin to be sent home and lose their paychecks, while they await further action by Congress to enact highway reauthorization legislation. 
So the Senate has just 44 session days remaining, including today. Those are days we have been told that the Senate will be in session. So there are just 44 session days, including today, remaining in which to avert this impending crisis. When the hour strikes midnight on May 1, the time is up. 
I want to take a few minutes to explain exactly what this May 1 deadline means to a number of the States. 
The Road Information Program, TRIP, recently surveyed the State transportation departments throughout the country to ascertain what will happen after May 1 if a new highway bill has not been signed into law by the President by that time. To date, TRIP has received responses from 15 State transportation departments, and additional responses are expected soon. Even with preliminary results, however, it is clear that billions of dollars worth of highway projects and transit projects are in danger of being postponed, and will be postponed until new Federal funding is available. These are critical transportation projects--critical transportation projects--projects designed to improve road safety and reduce the number and severity of highway crashes, to smooth the flow of traffic so we can improve air quality and lower the pollution that Americans breathe every day and every hour and every minute, and to reduce congestion so that Americans can spend more time at work and more time at home caring for their children, more time with their families and less time trapped in gridlock. 
It may be edifying to my colleagues to hear some of the specific projects in their States that will be delayed, according to their own State transportation departments, if new Federal highway funding is not available beyond May 1. Remember, these are just the 15 States that have responded already to the TRIP survey. 
The Road Information Program asked each State to list some of the most critical transportation projects that would have to be postponed during the 12-month period beginning May 1, 1998, if no new Federal funding is available. 
And so let us go down the list. The very first State that is on the list is the State of Georgia. 
In Georgia, the State transportation department will have to delay: Improvements to I-475 from I-75 in Bibb County to I-75 in Monroe County; improvements to the Harry S. Truman Parkway in Chatham County; work on the Jefferson Bypass in Jefferson County; and improvements to Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in Gwinnett County. 
The Indiana transportation department will have to postpone: rehabilitating I-69 in Dekalb County; road and bridge rehabilitation on I-465 in Marion County; and bridge rehabilitation on US 20 in St. Joseph County. 
In Kentucky, funds will dry up after May 1 for projects to: widen US 27 to four lanes from Lexington to Paris; reconstruct the Donaldson Road interchange on I-75 in Boone County; and replace the Cumberland River Bridge in Somerset. 
Now, the Senators from these respective States, I am sure, are talking with their highway departments. Those Senators will probably have more complete lists than these that I am reading. But these are just the first 15 that have been supplied to me by TRIP.  
In Maine, delays will occur on: The rehabilitation of the Carlton Bridge on US Route 1 in Bath; the reconstruction of 4 miles of Route 9 in Devereaux; and the replacement of the Penobscot River Bridge on Route 11 in Medway. 
The Missouri transportation department will have to postpone, I am told: the replacement or rehabilitation of seven bridges on I-70 in the St. Louis area; plans to add left turn lanes on Route 61 at Lemay Woods in St. Louis to improve traffic safety; the widening and resurfacing of Route 39 in Barry County; and the replacement of two bridges over the North Fabius River on Route 136 in Scotland County. 
In Nevada, they will have to delay plans to: widen I-15 from two to three lanes in West Las Vegas; remove and replace pavement on I-80 in Reno; and widen US 95 to four lanes in Las Vegas. 
In New Hampshire, our failure to enact a highway bill by May 1 will mean the transportation department has to postpone: reconstructing exit 20 on I-93 in Tilton; safety improvements planned for I-93 in Manchester; and replacing a bridge over North Branch River in Stoddard. 
In North Dakota, congressional inaction will mean the postponement of plans to: reconstruct South Washington Street in Grand Forks; improve I-94 from Eagles Nest to Geck; and widen US 52 from Drake to Harvey. 
The Oklahoma transportation department will have to shelve plans for: interchange reconstruction and resurfacing on I-35 in Oklahoma City, a project designed to relieve congestion; widening 50 miles of US 183 from Cordell to Snyder in western Oklahoma to provide four lane access to I-40, designed to foster economic development in the region; and building shoulders and a passing lane on US 283 in Beckham County to improve highway safety. 
In South Dakota, failure to meet the May 1 funding deadline will mean the delay of plans to: reconstruct I-29 in Minnehaha and Moody Counties; improve Benson Road in Sioux Falls to provide access to the Joe Ross Field Airport; and improve the interchange at the Haines Avenue exit on I-90 in Rapids City. 
The Texas Department of Transportation reports that the following projects scheduled for Spring 1999--all designed to relieve congestion--would be delayed without new Federal funding beyond May 1: widening to eight lanes a 4.3 mile section of Route 1960 in Harris County; widening to eight lanes a 3.9 mile section in Fort Bend County; and widening to four lanes a 6 mile section of US 67 in Johnson County. 
In Utah, the following projects--all related to preparations for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games--would be delayed: The reconstruction of the Kimball and Silver Creek Junctions on I-80; the construction of the 1.5 mile Winter Sports Road; and the reconstruction of the interchange at I-84 and US 89. 
In Vermont, our inaction will mean delay in the planned resurfacing of 200 miles of State highways; the rehabilitation or replacement of three State highway system bridges and five local highway system bridges; as well as the reconstruction of four miles of US 7 in Shelburne and South Burlington to increase capacity and improve traffic flow. 
In my State of West Virginia, the lack of new Federal highway funds after May 1 would mean postponement of the renovation of the Shepherdstown Bridge on West Virginia 480 in Jefferson County; the widening of a segment of West Virginia 2 in Ohio County to improve traffic flow--by the way, it was on Route 2 that my former colleague in the Senate, Senator Jennings Randolph, and I had an accident in 1957--1957 or 1958. We had an accident in that county. We ran head on into another automobile, killing the driver of the other automobile. That was Route 2. So we are talking here about the widening of the segment of West Virginia 2 in Ohio County to improve traffic flow, and the replacement of the Easley Bridge in Princeton, Mercer County. Mercer County, that is where I first started school in a little two-room schoolhouse over 70 years ago. 
And finally, in Wyoming, the Senate's failure to act by May 1 would mean delaying reconstruction and bridge work on I-80 in Rock Springs, Rawlins, and Laramie Marginalal; as well as widening and rehabilitation projects on I-90 from Buffalo to Gillette and from Moorcroft to Sundance. 
So, Mr. President, I urge Senators to call their transportation departments, if they have not already, and find out what a prolonged delay in Federal highway funds would mean for their States. The list I have just read is, obviously, not exhaustive; but it is indicative of the serious problems every State, or almost every State certainly will face if Congress does not act before midnight May 1. When Senators start to realize what this May 1 deadline means for their States, and how few days we have left to move a highway bill through the Senate, it should become obvious that we will have no choice but to bring up the highway reauthorization bill. 
We have just 44 days, 44 session days. That does not count days like Saturdays and Sundays or other days when the Senate is not expected to be in session. Only 44 session days, including today, remain through the hour of midnight May 1. 
After that hour of midnight, then those States can obligate Federal aid highway program funds for any Federal highway project, after the hour of midnight on May 1. Now, that is by law. That was a part of the law that Congress passed last November when it enacted the short-term highway bill. It is in there. Bridge replacements, traffic decongestion projects, and road widening efforts all mean safety, time, money and jobs to our people. Further delay makes no sense. A commitment was made to bring up the highway bill after the President's State of the Union speech. The State of the Union speech has come and gone and there is still no highway bill here in the Senate. Further delay makes no sense and the Senate should consider the highway bill promptly. 
How much time remains, Mr. President?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, only 45 session days remain through May 1, the deadline date, beyond which every State will be prohibited by law from obligating new Federal highway or transit funds. This past Thursday, we heard the argument that there is no reason for the Senate to rush to the highway bill, because, it was said, the House does not plan to act on the highway bill until next month or later. 
Well, Mr. President, I have served in the Congress now going on 46 years. I was 6 years in the House, and this is my 40th year in the Senate. I have served both as majority leader and minority leader, as well as majority whip and secretary of the Democratic conference. I respectfully suggest that the Senate must never let itself be governed by the scheduling preferences of the other body, especially on legislation as important and as urgent as is the highway bill. 
I have served in the other body, and so have several other Senators, including the distinguished Senator, Mr. Pat Roberts, who now presides over the Senate with a degree of efficiency and poise and dignity and skill, so rare as a day in June. But all other Senators know, as I do, that the House of Representatives is a very different place with very different rules. 
When the House of Representatives takes up the highway bill, the House Rules Committee will report out a rule that will probably limit the number of amendments that will be allowed to be offered and mandate limitations under which those amendments can be debated. The House can well take up a highway bill and pass it within one day or two days or three days. But who here thinks that the Senate will be able to take up and pass the highway bill in two or three days? 
When the Senate takes up the highway bill, Senators, as always, will have the right under the Senate rules, to offer amendments and to have those amendments debated. It will probably take 2 or 3 weeks for the Senate to pass an ISTEA bill. Given all of the competing 
and contentious amendments that the Senate will likely debate on ISTEA, we should recognize the fact that it will probably take two or three weeks for the Senate to pass an ISTEA bill. One does not have to look further back in history than the last time that the Congress authorized our surface transportation programs. Back in 1991, I believe it was, the Senate debated the ISTEA legislation for the better part of 3 weeks--not 3 days, but 3 weeks. The other body, however, was able to call up and dispense with their version of the ISTEA legislation in two days! The Senate took almost 3 weeks; the House took 2 days. What reason do we have to think that, this time, things will be different? 
I believe that we have an obligation to try to get a complete, comprehensive, six-year highway authorization bill to the President's desk by or before May 1. We owe that to our Governors, our mayors, our highway engineers, our highway departments throughout the country, and to our constituents who drive on the Nation's highways every day. If we have any hope of getting a highway bill to the President by or before May 1, the Senate needs to begin now. 
In November of last year when we took up the short-term highway authorization bill, we were told that it was the intent for the Senate to take up ISTEA and address it early in this year in order to put pressure on the House and also so that when the House acted, we, in the Senate, would be ready for conference with the House. Now, however, it seems that the pressure is not on the House, but on the Senate. The wind has shifted, and we are now on a course that puts pressure on the Senate--pressure from the Governors of our States, pressure from our transportation departments throughout the country, pressure from our transit providers--all of whom will be forbidden by law from obligating any federal funds after May 1. We are also receiving pressure from our citizens who must endure hazardous driving conditions. Why are we waiting, Mr. President? 
As I stated last week, the President's budget proposes an absolute freeze on highway spending for the next five years. The President, the first time he ran for the office, campaigned strongly on a platform of investing in the Nation's infrastructure. We don't hear that anymore. The President is proposing a freeze on spending while the balances in the highway trust fund skyrocket. Meanwhile, the 6-year highway bill, as reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, will also allow unspent balances of the highway trust fund to pile up year after year after year, while the Nation's highway needs go wanting year after year after year. Where else, then, but on a highway authorization bill, can the Senate come forward to make an affirmative statement that the expectations for spending on highways over the next six years will go well beyond the freeze levels proposed by the President? 
I recognize that there will be disagreements among Senators as to how increased authorization levels for highways can and should be financed. Senator Gramm, one of the principal cosponsors of my amendment, has stated that he is categorically opposed to moving the caps in order to boost spending for highways. We will have that debate through the regular budget and Appropriations process. Mr. President, one thing I am sure of, if we do not get a 6-year ISTEA bill to the floor, and make a statement by the full Senate that we do not expect to allow the unspent balances of highway trust fund to pile up year after year, as the President proposed and as the Environment and Public Works Committee in its reported bill proposes, highways will be nowhere in the upcoming budget debate. We will be debating direct Federal expenditures for child care and other social welfare programs that are being pushed by the administration, while the needs of our Nation's infrastructure will be left out, just as they were left out of the President's budget. 
Well, let me make one thing preeminently clear. The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus should be called up so that those unspent highway balances, at least to the tune of $31 billion, can be authorized to be spent. We will not spend them in the amendment. We only authorize them to be spent. We will not be debating the budget bill. It is the highway bill I am talking about. 
In last week's remarks on the floor about the highway bill, reference was made to the `Highways First' crowd. Well, Mr. President, I plead guilty as charged. I make no apologies for standing on this floor and saying we have been remiss in our national investment in surface transportation. At a time when the ISTEA authorization has expired, and it did expire on last September 30; at a time when the country is just limping along--limping along--on a stopgap highway authorization bill; at a time when the construction season is looming just--just--a few weeks away; at a time when Governors and mayors and highway departments throughout the country need to know just what Federal resources they can count on for this year's budget as well as for long-term highway construction plans; at a time when we should be discussing a long-term, 6-year highway authorization bill just as the commitment was made to the Senate and to the country that we would be discussing a long-term, 6-year ISTEA bill; yes, yes, I believe that first things should come first and that the 6-year highway bill is the first thing that the Senate should be debating, and last November we were told just that. So, yes, I am one of the `Highways First' crowd. Count me in. Count me in. 
When 42,000 people are dying on the highways of this country every year, and when we are told by the U.S. Department of Transportation that 30 percent of those highway deaths are caused by outdated safety features, poor pavement quality, substandard road and bridge designs, and other bad road conditions, yes, I am one of the `Highways First' crowd. Count me in! 
What could be more fundamental to our national prosperity, and to the quality of our daily lives, than adequate, safe highways? Major highways carry nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commercial traffic, and, roughly, 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic--80 percent. When it comes to the daily lives and the daily working conditions of our constituents, Americans take more than 90 percent of all their work trips in cars or trucks. 
And we hear much from the administration as to how this Nation should better meet our child care needs, and that is quite appropriate. Therefore, I make no apology for taking the floor to point out how the family lives of millions of Americans would be improved if working parents could spend more time at home with their children rather than sit in ever-worsening traffic jams. We hear so much talk about protecting our children; and yet, getting them to school to be educated, and to hospitals and to clinics to receive healthcare can't be done with efficiency without safe, modern highways. 
Everyone knows that. Twenty-two million people in Appalachia know it. Twenty-two million people in Appalachia know the difficulties in getting to work, in getting to school, in getting to hospitals, in getting to child care clinics, in getting to church, and in getting back home--22 million people in Appalachia. 
Highways first? You bet, I believe in highways first as of now under the circumstances that I have outlined. I believe in highways first. Fixing potholes and pavement may not be glitzy and may not be sexy, but attending to our Nation's transportation system is a basic, fundamental need. It is job one, because so much of life in the United States absolutely depends on our ability to get people and goods from one place to another. 
Francis Bacon, who went to the tower because he was found guilty--and he admitted it--of accepting bribes, said, `There be three things that make a nation great and prosperous: A fertile soil, busy workshops, and easy conveyance of men and goods from place to place.' 
Well, it was said on this floor last week that two of the few places where the Government should be involved in spending money were in the field of national defense and in the field of building infrastructure because people cannot do these things by themselves, it was said. How true. The Government had to do its part, it was said last week on the floor of this Senate. Well, the unfortunate fact is that the Government has not done its part. The record is replete with evidence that we have not done as good a job as we should have done in maintaining our highway infrastructure. We are letting our National Highway System fall more and more into disrepair. And, as a result, the cost of bringing our highways up to an adequate and safe condition grows by billions of dollars every year. 
Mr. President, it was President Ronald Reagan, who, in January 1983, said, `Common sense'--`common sense'--perhaps one of the most uncommon things that would be found in this city --`Common sense tells us that it will cost a lot less to keep the [national highway] system we have in good repair, than to let it disintegrate and have to start over from scratch. Clearly'--this is former President Reagan talking; I am quoting him--`Clearly, this program is an investment in tomorrow that we must make today.' How true. 
Ronald Reagan was right. We must make that investment today. The commitment that the highway bill would be brought up at the beginning of this session should be kept, a 6-year ISTEA bill should be made the pending business of the Senate, and it should be done right today or soon, very soon. The highway needs grow worse day by day; the time grows shorter day by day; and I hope that the Governors and mayors and highway departments throughout this country--and I am speaking to you out there--I hope that the Governors and mayors and highway departments throughout this country will join in urging the Senate leadership to keep its commitment, so that we can debate this highway bill--it is number one on the Nation's business list. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is imperative that the Senate turn immediately to the consideration of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997. We now have less than 45 days remaining in which the Senate will be in session between today and May 1, 1998. 
On May 1 of this year, our State highway departments throughout the land and our transit providers across the Nation will be forbidden by law from obligating any new Federal highway or transit funds. That is the drop-dead date. That is the deadline. 
What will it mean to individual States when they no longer can move forward on a comprehensive highway construction program? What will it mean to your State? What will it mean to mine? What will it mean for our Nation's highway construction workers when they are thrown out of work, when that paycheck stops and when they have to struggle to put a meal on their family table? 
What will it mean for our urban transit systems when they must cease progress on projects, projects that are needed to minimize congestion and to move our constituents to work, to schools, to places of worship, to child care centers, and back home? 
It will mean disruption, deprivation, and, in cases where some construction projects need to go forward for the sake of safety, it will mean that accidents, injuries, and perhaps even death may be the result because of our delay--our inexcusable delay. There is no excuse for the delay. 
On Monday of this week, the President sent his formal budget request for fiscal year 1999 to the Congress. That budget calls for the overall obligation ceiling for our Federal aid highway programs to be frozen. Now hear that! This is the President's budget, calling for the Federal aid highway program to be frozen for each of the next 6 years at the level enacted for FY 1998, namely, $21.5 billion. 
The President ran for office the first time on a strong platform recommending more infrastructure in this country, more highways, safer bridges, but the President now is proposing an absolute freeze on highway spending for the next 5 years; never mind the tremendous unmet needs that exist across this Nation for bridge and highway construction, and for safety improvements; never mind a critical provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which is there by virtue of an amendment that was offered by my friend and colleague from Texas, Senator Phil Gramm; never mind that critical provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, a bill that the President signed into law with much fanfare, and rightly so, last year. 
That bill included a provision transferring the 4.3 cent gas tax--that had been used for deficit reduction since 1993--into the highway trust fund, so that it could not be used for other programs, instead of the highway program, but could be used to address these serious highway deficiencies. But even with this new source of revenue to the trust fund--roughly $7 billion per year--the President's budget now calls for the overall Federal obligation ceiling for highways to increase by how much? Not one copper cent! Not one penny; not one penny! Over the next 5 years, it is to be frozen. 
Under the President's budget, the uncommitted balance of the highway trust fund will grow and grow and grow, like topsy. 
Based on estimates that I have received from the Congressional Budget Office, under the committee-reported bill, the unspent balance of the highway trust fund will grow from $25.7 billion at the end of this fiscal year to more than $71.8 billion at the close of the authorization period covered by the next ISTEA legislation. 
At that time, therefore, there will be almost $72 billion that would just sit unspent in the highway trust fund; $72 billion paid by you out there, paid by you, the buyers of gasoline; $72 billion paid by our constituents--yours, I say to the distinguished Senator from California, and mine--paid by our constituents at the gas pump--money that will be deposited into the highway trust fund but not used. Not used. 
Under the President's budget, the trust fund balance would grow even larger, since his 5-year highway freeze is some $9.6 billion less than would even be authorized in the committee-reported bill which we debated on this Senate floor for about 21 days last fall. 
I do not believe that a majority of this body supports the notion that highway spending should be frozen for the next 5 years, while the unspent balance in the highway trust fund rises by roughly 300 percent over the next 6 years. I am confident that a majority of this body does not support that idea. 
I do believe, however, that it is incumbent for this Senate to take up the highway bill, to take it up immediately and to make it clear that we do not support the President's proposal for a 5-year freeze on highway spending. 
Let the President hear that message, loud and clear. We do not support a 5-year freeze on highway spending, nor do the American people support that. I am confident they don't. 
The financial needs of our national highway network vastly exceed our current levels of expenditure. If we freeze highway spending for the next 5 years, the gap between what will be needed just to maintain the present inadequate conditions of our Nation's highways, on the one hand, and what we will be able to spend, that gap is going to grow wider and wider and wider, and we will fall farther and farther behind. 
Yet, Mr. President, the Department of Transportation has stated that our Nation would be required to spend an extra $15 billion each year above current spending levels just to maintain the current conditions of our Nation's highways. We would have to boost spending on highways by more than $15 billion a year to make the least bit of improvement overall in the condition of our Nation's highways. Now, that is what the U.S. Department of Transportation is telling us. 
And what are the current conditions of our Nation's highways? At present, only 39 percent of our National Highway System is rated in good condition. That is not what Senator Byrd is saying, that is what Senator Byrd says that the U.S. Department of Transportation says. Fully 61 percent of our Nation's highways are rated in either fair or poor condition. 
For our 42,794 mile interstate system, the crown jewel of our National Highway System, one-half of the mileage is rated in fair or poor condition. These figures only worsen when one looks at our other major and Federal State highways. In our urban areas, 65 percent of our noninterstate highway mileage is rated in fair or poor condition. 
There are over a quarter of a billion miles of pavement in the United States that is in poor or mediocre condition. This is what the U.S. Department of Transportation tells us. There are almost 95,000 bridges in our country that have been classified as deficient, and within that total, roughly 44,000 bridges have been deemed to be structurally deficient, meaning that they need significant maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement. 
Many of these bridges require load posting, requiring heavier trucks to take longer alternate routes. That affects our efficiency, our productivity and our overall economy. And an additional 51,000 bridges have been deemed to be functionally deficient, meaning that they do not have the lane width, shoulder width or vertical clearances sufficient to serve the traffic demand. The condition of our highway system is fast becoming a national disgrace. 
As I said, Mr. President, to make any improvements at all in these conditions, to keep these conditions from worsening further, we would have to boost spending in our highways, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, by more than $15 billion annually. 
With that backdrop, it defies sanity that the administration wants to freeze highway spending over the next 5 years. Every driving American pays gas taxes. We have told them that that money would go toward increased highway investments. What will we tell them now? Mr. President, this Senate needs to take an immediate step to call up the highway bill and to tell the traveling public that we do not support freezing highway spending for the next 6 years. 
Why wait until May 1, when our States will be prohibited from obligating any Federal funds on highway or transit projects? We should call up the highway bill and make it clear to America that we meant what we said when we voted to transfer the 4.3 cents gas tax from deficit reduction to the highway trust fund. An overwhelming majority of the Senate supported that transfer. The administration may have frozen the transportation budget, but this Senate does not have to freeze in a stupor of suspended animation while we watch our States careen toward a certain brick wall. There are only 45 days left. Now is the time--now is the time--to take the next step by moving to the highway bill. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator thinks he has me over a barrel. I voted against cloture. I make no bones about that. 
But why finger point at that bill? Finger pointing isn't going to resolve the problems that are going to confront our highway departments and our Governors and our mayors throughout this country. That is not going to do any good, Senator. 
Yes, I voted against cloture. I would like to see a campaign finance reform bill, but I would also like to see a highway bill. So forget what happened back there on cloture. 
Lot's wife looked back and she turned to salt. Let's don't look back. Let's keep our promise, the promise that was made to bring up this highway bill. I didn't make that promise. The leadership of the Senate made that promise. 
This is not a partisan matter, Mr. President. Republicans and Democrats buy gas at the gas station. Republicans and Democrats pay a gas tax. Republicans and Democrats use the highways of this country and the transit systems. Republicans and Democrats are injured and die when safety conditions get to the point where accidents occur. So this is not a partisan matter. 
I know that the Senator from Rhode Island is against that amendment. He has been all along. He was against it when the bill was up last fall. That is a given. There is no surprise in that. But, Mr. President, the promise was made to bring up the highway bill. 
Now, I have been around this Senate a long time, and this is the first time I have heard that the House controls the Senate calendar. I don't believe that, and I have reason to believe that if the Senate will act, the House might change its mind. Why should the House control the calendar here? The highway needs are out there. The Senator knows that. They exist in his own State. They exist in my State. They exist in every State in this country. 
The highway departments and the Governors and the mayors don't know how to plan their budgets for this year because they don't know what Federal resources they can count on and they can't do long-term planning. When we talk about highways, those plans have to be long term. 
I say to the Senator, why not have a bill up now? Let's debate it, but let's debate while we are on the bill. That is the promise that was made. I didn't make that promise. I'm not attacking any Senator personally. I am urging the Senate leadership to take up the bill. Why not have the bill before the Senate? Now, if we take up the bill, the House will surely move, I would think. The pressure will be on them. We can't base our actions on what the House might do. 
The House schedule doesn't change the May 1 deadline, Senator. The May 1 deadline is only 45 days away, and the House schedule won't change that. That is approaching. Every day that we waste here, sitting on our hands talking about other matters, some of which are important, some of which are not--I pointed out just the other day that we wasted over 3 hours in one day in recesses and in quorum calls. We could be debating this bill, my friend. I hope that the Senator will join us in urging the leadership to bring this bill up. I would like to hear the Senator on the floor every day. I would like to hear his voice rising, up sometimes, up and down. I hope he will join us because I would like to be here with him. I would like to be debating the highway bill. 
We have had a series of broken promises. Congress acted to shift the 4.3-cent gas tax to the highway trust funds. The people have been told, regardless of what the Senator says, the people have the understanding that that money is going to be spent on surface transportation 
programs. So we promised that, and then we promised to take up the highway bill. What about the highway needs? How can we ignore those needs when we have huge, unspent balances in the trust fund? 
Mr. President, I just called my highway department this morning, and according to the West Virginia State Highway Commissioner, if ISTEA is postponed beyond the May 1 date, 75 highway projects, including about 20 bridges in West Virginia, will have to be delayed. This story can be told all over this country. Senator, you will hear it. You will hear it. I say that with the utmost respect. The Senator from Rhode Island is going to hear it. 
Mr. President, do I have any time left?

Mr. BYRD. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for his patience in listening to this discussion that has been going on. He is going to manage a bill, but he has been very patient, and I think we imposed on him. I just wanted to apologize and thank him.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act reauthorization, ISTEA--in other words, the highway bill--sets the authorization levels for the current fiscal year and the next 5 years for our Federal highway construction, bridge, highway safety, and transit programs. When the Senate found itself unable to complete action on S. 1173 at the end of the last session, it was necessary to pass a short-term extension bill to tide these programs over from October of last year until May 1, 1998. I supported that short-term extension measure, but I did so with the understanding from the distinguished Senate majority leader, and others in the leadership, that `immediately following the President's State of the Union Address,' the Senate would return to the highway reauthorization bill. 
It now appears that things have changed and that the distinguished majority leader is being urged by a handful of Senators to delay action on it and not bring up ISTEA until after Congress completes action on the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution. Mr. President, as one who has been majority leader, I can understand the pressures that are upon our own distinguished majority leader at this time with reference to the highway bill. I have had discussions with the able majority leader, and prior to the reconvening of the Senate, I had the pleasure of talking with the majority leader in my office. He showed me the courtesy of coming to my office, and we sat for 30 minutes and discussed this measure and other matters. I can understand the pressures that are on him from other Senators in this body. Having been majority leader, I know that one cannot please all Senators on his own side, much less Senators on the other side of the aisle. I am fully aware of that. And what I say with respect to the bill certainly is not in denigration of our majority leader. I have an excellent relationship with him, as I do with my own leader on this side of the aisle, and I would not want to do anything to impair that relationship. 
But, Mr. President, having said that, this would be a very shortsighted approach to handling one of the most important matters to come before this Congress--the highway bill. I understand that the very able chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, has expressed his hope and intention to proceed quickly with his hearings and the markup of the budget resolution. As Senators are aware, Section 300 of the Congressional Budget Act sets a date of April 1 as the deadline for the Senate Budget Committee to report the budget resolution each year. The Congressional Budget Act requires Congress to complete action on budget resolutions every year by April 15. 
I was here, Mr. President, when we enacted the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and I spoke for it, supported it, and had a considerable bit to do with the formulation of it. But in all of the years since the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, Congress has met the deadline 
for completing action on budget resolutions only 3 times. Those 3 years were fiscal years 1976, 1977 and 1994. 
I say to all Senators, but particularly to the leadership, that this is not a very good record upon which to base our hopes for early completion of the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution. Yet, that's what the plan appears to be, as it relates to the highway bill. As I say, I implored, I importuned, I beseeched, I pleaded with the distinguished majority leader before this session was convened and urged that we be allowed to bring up the highway bill. That was the commitment that was made. It was made to the Senate, it was made to the American people. As I say, I know the majority leader has a lot of pressures on him, and I can understand those, having been majority leader. So I am not going to be one to criticize the majority leader in this respect. Heavy and uneasy is the head that wears the crown. 
We are being told we should just be patient and our State highways and transit authorities should not worry. We'll get around to enacting the ISTEA bill after the budget resolution is finished. Mr. President, that places our State highway departments in an extremely precarious and uncertain position as they struggle to continue, without interruption, the Nation's critically important highway construction, bridge construction and repair, highway safety and transit programs. 
Now, every highway department is being put into that position. How can we be sure that the budget resolution will be completed at all, much less by the April 15 statutory deadline? Eventually, it will be completed, but how can we be sure that it will be finished in time to meet that deadline? In the past 25 years, Congress has only met that deadline three times, as I have already indicated. On all other occasions, the deadline was missed, sometimes by months, as it was in fiscal year 1985 when the budget resolution was not completed until October 1, 1984; and for fiscal year 1991, when the budget resolution was not completed until October 9, 1990. 
But even if it is passed, how can we afford to wait until that deadline? How can we afford to wait until April? How can we afford to wait until April 15 to bring up the highway bill? Construction seasons are upon us. Construction seasons in the northern States, in particular, are going to be constricted. 
If the leadership continues to hold up the ISTEA bill, I am concerned that Congress will not be able to act on a new highway bill prior to the statutory deadline now in existence for the obligation of highway and transit funds. How many more days do we have, Mr. President until May 1? May 1 is the drop-dead date with respect to highway obligations--new obligations by the highway departments throughout this country. May 1. How many more days remain? 
We don't count Saturdays and Sundays, naturally. But only 41 session days remain. Only 41 session days when the Senate will be in session. The States will hit the spending walls for highway transfer funding on May 1. I assure all Senators that we will hear from the American people if we continue to ignore the basic transportation needs of this Nation in such a cavalier fashion. The disruption of these transportation projects will be massive, massive in the Northeast, in the Northwest, in the Southwest, and in the Southeast--all over this country. The disruption of these projects will be massive across the Nation as States will be required to stop obligating funds on May 1 for the highway and transit programs. Congress needs to get its act together! 
This is an irresponsible and unnecessary course that threatens the very lives of people as well as the economic well-being of the people throughout the country. Does it take a crisis, Mr. President, to force us to act here in Congress? Do we have to have a bridge collapse and possibly have people killed before we wake up? I have not forgotten the collapse of the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, WV, in 1967. It killed 46 people. 
Let us look out of the windows and observe the rains that are pounding our area. Listen to the radio, or watch the television set--I don't do much of that; but I do watch the weather--and watch what they are saying about the weather all over this country, about the storm, about what is happening in States back to the west and to the north. The snow, the ice, the ravages of winter will further pock-mark and erode our highways and bridges. We can't afford delays in stepping up to our responsibilities for public safety very much longer. 
Mr. President, I have asked the journal clerk how much time the Senate wasted yesterday in quorum calls and in recesses. On yesterday--one day alone--we spent 59 minutes, almost an hour, in quorum calls, and 2 hours and 18 minutes in recesses. That is 3 hours 17 minutes--with a quick calculation--3 hours 17 minutes spent in quorum calls and recesses here in the Senate yesterday. We could have been working on the highway bill. 
Strategy games in Washington may be fine for those who do not depend on safe, modern highways to protect their livelihoods and their lives. But, hand-sitting will not serve us well when the public realizes what is going on. 
I implore the leadership to move this bill as soon as possible. The clock is ticking, Mr. President, and time is running out. 
I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators. I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like today to pay tribute to one of my most esteemed colleagues on the occasion of his birthday. For, sixty-five years ago, in Salisbury, Maryland, two Greek immigrants named Spyros and Matina Sarbanes gave birth to a child, whom they named Paul. I, for one, have no doubt--although history does not provide confirmation of my conjecture--that within a few days, or perhaps weeks, of this event, young Paul had begun the earnest and impassioned learning that would distinguish him throughout his life. 
This learning has paid dividends throughout the life and career of Paul Sarbanes. It won him a scholarship to Princeton--from where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa--and earned him a Rhodes Scholarship. Thence, he proceeded to Harvard Law School and a prestigious clerkship with a federal appellate court judge. After conquering such mountains early on, he might have been forgiven for resting on his laurels, but these early triumphs proved to be simply prologue to further achievements. Senator Sarbanes' drive and his intelligence propelled him from a law firm to the Maryland House of Delegates, then on to the U.S. House, and, in 1976, to the U.S. Senate. How wonderfully appropriate that the year in which this country celebrated its bicentennial it should also witness, in the election of Senator Sarbanes, confirmation of the basic American tenet that any man--even the child of immigrants--can rise to the highest levels in this country! And who better than Senator Sarbanes to prove that the American meritocracy, which rewards extraordinary wisdom and diligence, endures? 
For over two decades, I have been privileged to work alongside Senator Sarbanes. I have learned in that time to put down whatever business I have before me and pay careful attention when this man speaks on the floor. For I know that whatever words issue forth from his mouth will be the result of careful consideration, intelligent analysis, and a nuanced balancing of the facts. These qualities distinguish Senator Sarbanes' remarks, and they are the reason why this man epitomizes for me the best that the legal profession has to offer. If every lawyer would only emulate the reasonableness and wisdom of Senator Sarbanes, the country's legal profession would be held in much higher esteem than it is today! 
Mr. President, I am sure I speak for all my colleagues when I wish my esteemed colleague Senator Sarbanes the happiest of birthdays. The words of Senator Sarbanes' classical forebear, Aristophanes, seem particularly appropriate today: `Blest the man who possesses a keen intelligent mind.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is an urgent necessity for the Senate to turn immediately to the consideration of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, ISTEA. That is the highway bill. That bill was reported unanimously by the Environmental and Public Works Committee on October 1, 1997. However, due to our inability to enact a comprehensive 6-year ISTEA reauthorization bill at the close of the last session, our State highway departments and transit providers are currently operating under a short-term extension bill that provides roughly one-half year of funding which is needed for our Federal highway construction, our highway safety, and our transit programs. 
That short-term extension bill, Public Law 105-130, signed by the President on December 1, 1997, includes the following text, and I hope that Senators will listen carefully:

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the provisions of ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, expired on September 30, 1997. The Senate took up the ISTEA reauthorization bill on October 8, 1997, but between that date and October 29, the Senate was unable to adopt even one substantive amendment due to the impasse over Senate consideration of campaign finance reform legislation. As a consequence, the six-year ISTEA Bill was taken down and returned to the calendar. 
Finally, on November 10, the Senate passed a short-term extension of our existing highway and transit programs, thus delaying the completion of Senate action on our nation's surface transportation policy until the second session of the 105th Congress, the first week of which has now passed into history. Despite the stated intentions last November of the distinguished Majority Leader to take up the ISTEA reauthorization bill, S. 1173, at the beginning of this session, the bill has not been taken up, it is not before the Senate, and we are still operating on the short-term extension. 
With each passing day, I am increasingly concerned that the Senate may not return to the ISTEA reauthorization bill until after action is completed on the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution, which may not occur until late spring. 
I supported the enactment of the short-term extension bill back in November, but, as I said then, it was only a stopgap measure, and it provided only for one-half year of funding for our existing highway program, the highway safety programs, and the transit programs. Meanwhile, the various highway departments in the 50 states cannot establish a budget for the current fiscal year because they do not know the final level of federal resources they will receive even for this fiscal year which ends on September 30. The short-term extension bill will expire at the end of March, when the advent of spring will have made its appearance. Whether a new short-term extension of our highway programs will occur by the end of March is highly questionable. Meantime, how can the Governors and the highway departments of 50 states plan for the construction season that will soon be opening throughout the country? It is a classic case of dawdling and indecision in Washington which is throwing our states into highway planning and budget limbo! 
Dante, the author of `The Divine Comedy', in Canto IV, described Limbo, as the `first circle of Hell.' This, it seems to me, is a very apt description of the situation in which the Governors and heads of highway departments throughout the states now find themselves as they attempt to budget and plan for the upcoming construction season, and their situation may very well become worse than hell as, more and more, they find themselves unable to do any long-term budgeting and planning in respect to highway construction. 
They cannot develop and implement any long-term financing plan because they do not know the level of federal resources that will be available to them over the five years following the current fiscal year. This is an impossible situation for our state highway departments. Given the costs and the duration of major highway projects, and the complexities associated with short construction seasons in our cold weather states, planning and predictability are essential to the logical functioning of our Federal-Aid Highway program. That kind of rational planning is precisely what our states cannot do at this time because of the inaction of Congress regarding the highway bill. This is not how our state and local transportation agencies should have to do business. It is, nonetheless, the precise circumstance in which our transportation agencies are being placed due to the failure of Congress to enact a multiyear ISTEA reauthorization bill in a timely manner. 
It is not only unreasonable, it is also very unfair, for Congress--because of inaction--to place this burden upon the Governors, the Mayors, and the highway agencies throughout the country. Plainly speaking, Congress is shirking its responsibility! 
Meantime, while Congress sits on its hands, Americans who buy gasoline are continuing to pay a 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax every time they drive up to the pump. That gas tax previously went to deficit reduction, but it is now being deposited in the highway trust fund, and Congress should pass legislation to authorize that it be spent on our nation's considerable highway needs. The money from these gas taxes is accumulating in the highway trust fund, but Congress has passed no legislation authorizing it to be spent for surface transportation needs. The American people have been told by the Congress that monies in the highway trust fund would be spent for highways and other surface transportation needs. 
And as long as Congress fails to live up to its commitment the American people are being misled. As long as Congress fails to live up to its commitment, the American people are being duped into believing that the gas taxes in the highway trust fund will be spent on highway construction and other transportation needs, but Congress, meanwhile, dillydallies, sits on its hands, and lets these tax revenues build up in the highway trust fund. It amounts to an abuse of the trust which the American people have placed in us. Meanwhile, the potholes deepen, the asphalt chasms open wider, and danger stalks our nation's highways. 
By the end of this fiscal year, more than seven billion dollars in additional new revenues will have been deposited into the highway trust fund, not one penny of which is, as of this moment, authorized to be spent on highway construction and other surface transportation needs under the committee reported ISTEA bill. 
Instead, these funds will continue to sit in the highway trust fund, earning interest, and being used as an offset to the federal deficits--if, indeed, they are not siphoned off, in the meantime, and used for purposes other than highway and other surface transportation needs. 
The time to act on the highway bill is now! The first week of the second session has gone with the wind. We are now into the second week. The clock is ticking and the calendar is running. The highway construction seasons will soon be upon us, and yet, as of this moment, there is no indication that Congress will return to the highway bill. 
I hope that the Governors, who will soon be meeting in the Nation's Capital, will contact the leadership in both Houses and request that the highway bill be taken up immediately. I hope that the Mayors and the state highway departments will do the same. The first day of spring is only seven weeks away, and Congress must begin promptly to debate the highway bill in both houses if we are even to hope that the bill can be enacted by the time that `the lark's on the wing' and `the snail's on the thorn.' It should be done. But it can be done only if the leadership will bring up the bill. I respectfully urge the Senate leadership to do that promptly. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on January 25, 1998, this past Sunday, the President of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze, celebrated his 70th birthday. President Shevardnadze is one of the central international political figures of our age, and has been pivotal in the transformation of the communist Soviet empire into a group of nation states which have now embraced the goals of individual freedom, democratic processes, and free market economics. It is noteworthy that this transformation, the dismantling of an empire with large intelligence and military forces, and with a history of inbred hostility toward the West, occurred absent any violent confrontation with the United States, or our European allies. 
Much of the credit for this peaceful transformation, the ending of the Berlin Wall and the cooperation between the Soviet leadership and the United States on major arms control and reduction agreements, rightfully belongs to the enlightened and forceful personality of Mr. Shevardnadze. His role emphasizes the crucial part played by personalities in the shaping of the major events of human history. He serves as an example that history is shaped to a large extent by individual men, rather than by social movements or economic imperatives. 
For instance, Russian cooperation with the United States in working to condemn, and then oust, Saddam Hussein's forces from their occupation of Kuwait was to a large extent due to the courageous support of Mr. Shevardnadze in the face of opposition from forces in Russia which wanted to preserve a historic Russian-Iraqi alliance. His help in establishing a cooperative relationship with the United States regarding the invasion of Iraq actually forced Gorbachev's hand and trumped the Soviet security bureaucracies. It has been well documented that Shevardnadze quickly shed the negative approach to East-West relations that was the hallmark of former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko when Shevardnadze took over the Foreign Ministry of the Soviet Union in 1985. Both former Secretaries of States George Shultz and James Baker have written extensively about Shevardnadze and praised his many contributions to the ending of the cold war. As a former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, has written in the September 25, 1997, issue of the `New York Review of Books,' `If Gorbachev had been served by a less imaginative and courageous foreign minister it is doubtful that the cold war could have been ended as rapidly and definitively as it was.' 
Shevardnadze served as Soviet Foreign Minister from 1985-1991, and presided over the rapid transformation of East-West relations and the end of the cold war. It was, as I have said, an extraordinary era in which we have all been fortunate to participate in and to witness. In 1991, Eduard Shevardnadze resigned as Soviet Foreign Minister in protest over what he perceived as the coming of a military dictatorship in Russia, and he returned to his native Georgia. Georgia was in an advanced state of shambles, with the economy devastated following the breakup of the Soviet Union. The country was in a state of ruinous civil war. Shevardnadze entered political life there, and was elected president of Georgia in November 1995, with over 70 percent of the vote. Currently, he also serves as the Commander in Chief of the armed forces of Georgia, and has brought new hope, stability, and economic development to that nation. A new constitution has been adopted, and Shevardnadze has secured the transportation of Caspian oil through Georgia and negotiated a number of agreements with both Russia and the neighboring Caucasus states. As the current ambassador of Georgia to the U.S., the Honorable Tedo Japaridze, has written to me regarding President Shevardnadze's goals, `he is committed to build democracy in Georgia, brick by brick.' 
Eduard Shevardnadze is a man who has made a difference in our age, and he will continue to make a difference. He has many admirers in the United States, including myself, and I wish him well on the event of his 70th birthday. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United States completed a major round of international global climate change negotiations at Kyoto, Japan, on December 11, 1997. Senators and staff members from the Senate Monitoring Group, created by the Senate leadership in accord with the recommendation in Senate Resolution 98, adopted last July 25, 1997, were included on the U.S. delegation. The Senate was well represented at the talks. The chairman of the Monitoring Group, Senator Chuck Hagel, as well as Senators John Kerry, John Chafee, Joe Lieberman, Max Baucus, and Mike Enzi, dedicated considerable time and effort there to understand the issues being debated and to engage our negotiators on those issues. They have reported mixed results at the negotiations. The U.S., together with the other 39 industrialized nations, agreed to specific, legally binding targets for emissions of six greenhouse gases. The United States agreed to a numerical target of reducing greenhouse gases by 7 percent below 1990 during a budget period between 2008 and 2012. According to the administration, this commitment is actually about a 3 percent reduction below the 1990 emissions level after other technical provisions of the protocol are included in the calculations. It should be noted, however, that the administration has not yet provided the economic analysis to demonstrate how their calculations result in a 3 percent reduction, rather than 7 percent. 
The rules of this U.N.-sponsored conference allow decisionmaking by consensus. Therefore, only those provisions not subject to major dispute were included in the final protocol, and one can say that the United States and all the other countries which approved the protocol arrived at in Kyoto did so without dissent and without taking actual votes on its provisions. Under these circumstances, it is understandable that in some cases only broad concepts could be included, with the devilish details deferred for later. There were a number of areas of achievement for the United States, and I commend the skill and persistence of our American negotiating team, led by Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, for those successes. There were, however, some disappointing results, or even lack of results, and a number of important uncertainties that need to be resolved. 
My colleagues should understand that the negotiations at Kyoto are not perceived by the parties to be the end of the story--far from it. The next major meeting of the parties, so-called COP-4, will convene in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November of this year, after the elections. In the interim, there will be one or two preliminary meetings, now scheduled to take place in Bonn, at which time, hopefully, further progress on the details of the general concepts agreed to at Kyoto, and on matters not yet resolved, might be made. 
I am far from satisfied with the results of the negotiations thus far, the goal of which is exceedingly 
ambitious for it is no less than to positively control man's impact on the Earth's climate. The dynamics of climate, the impact of man's influence on it, its timeframes and thresholds and danger points are still far from perfectly understood. It is still far from being perfectly understood. It is certainly understandable, then, that every goal sought was not totally achieved at Kyoto, and that further study and work are needed. Having said that, I believe that the consensus of most scientists who have examined the global warming issue, and certainly the large majority who have participated in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have concluded that the balance of evidence suggests that human activities are indeed having a discernible and unfavorable impact on global climate systems. I accept the proposition that the potential for serious climate disruption is real and that the global community must respond at an appropriate pace in accordance with scientific evidence as it its developing. 
Now, Mr. President, I am not a scientist, of course, and I am not a physicist. But as Benjamin Franklin said at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, `I have lived a long time.' I am seeing some changes in the weather system, in the climatic system. It seems to me, very clearly, that the summers are hotter and the winters, at some points, certainly are warmer, and that floods more often occur, that storms ravage parts of our country more often. There seem to be more droughts, more disasters that strike our land. And so I just sense that something is going on out there. I don't need any scientific evidence to impress that feeling upon me. But what the scientific evidence suggests is that, should global warming occur, by the time we have absolute confirmation that our planet is warming, it might well be too late to take preventative action. For this reason, I have been concerned about the threat of global warming, and I believe that it might be prudent to undertake cost-effective measures to deal with the risk of climate change as a form of a global insurance policy. However, it will do no good for the United States to take such steps alone. 
The Byrd-Hagel resolution was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 95-0. It was adopted unanimously by the Senators who voted, and there were 95 present. 
The results of the Kyoto talks did not satisfy--with reference to the Byrd-Hagel resolution--the two goals that were agreed upon, in the context of what I like to say was a unanimous Senate adoption of the Byrd-Hagel resolution. What were those two goals agreed upon in that resolution? I quote from the resolution:  
That it is the sense of the Senate that--(1) the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992, at negotiations in Kyoto in December, 1997, or thereafter, which would--(A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates new specified scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing country Parties within the same compliance Period, or (B) Would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. 
Let's read that again. This is what the Byrd-Hagel resolution said, and it was agreed to by a vote of 95-0 here in the Senate. This is what it said insofar as the operative words are concerned: 
That it is the sense of the Senate that--(1) the United States should not be a signatory---- 
Should not add its name. to any protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992, at negotiations in Kyoto in December, 1997, or thereafter, which would--(A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates new specified scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing country Parties within the same compliance Period, or (B) Would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.  
Mr. President, the Kyoto protocol did not meet either of these two Senate standards. 
Regarding Developing Country commitments, part A, the developing countries, the so-called Group of 77 plus China, steadfastly and adamantly refused to accept binding commitments such as were entered into by the developed countries, the industrialized countries, or Annex I countries, in the Kyoto protocol. China made her position clear, and it was an unambiguous `no'! That was China's answer. `No.' The standard response from the developing world to our concerns is to argue that the industrialized nations should make all of the reductions, because of the developed world's historically high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The developing world also points to our relative wealth, and to their relative poverty, in arguing that we should shoulder the entire financial and economic burden of all reductions. 
But this argument is environmentally, and economically unsound. First, as I have previously noted, the emissions of the developing world will surpass those of the industrialized world in about 2015. After that point, the growth in developing world emissions is projected to overtake any emissions reductions that the industrialized world might make. China, herself--and China said `no' at Kyoto--will become the largest emitter of CO2, carbon dioxide, in the world during the first half of the next century, surpassing the United States. 
Second, I am concerned about the emissions from the most advanced of the developing nations, countries like China, India, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, who are experiencing explosive growth, and who are on their way to joining the club of industrialized countries. Even a marginal and even an incremental increase in the standard of living for every resident of China will result in a huge increase in greenhouse emissions. While no one wants to deny the benefits of economic growth and higher standards of living to anyone around the world, it is imperative that China's economic growth be coupled with the responsibility for its impact on the global environment. Cleaner economic expansion is possible and must be expected. And it is easier to begin development with an eye toward the environmental situation than it is to take corrective action later. 
If progress is to be made this year in reaching a truly global agreement, it will occur only when the developing world realizes that it is at risk from the adverse consequences of climate change at least as much as we are. Most studies indicate that these nations are, in fact, at greater risk--at greater risk--than the advanced countries. 
Since atmospheric warming is a global problem, without the responsible action by key developing countries, we will not have a global solution, and we will not solve the global problem. It makes little sense for the developed countries to penalize themselves for an outcome which will be unsuccessful. As I wrote to the President on December 15, 1997, binding commitments for developing nations should be paced according to the ability of each country to achieve greenhouse gas emission limitations appropriate to its national circumstances and economic growth. These limitations could be gradually implemented. Whether such commitments are in fact appropriate and represent best effort by each nation, will not be difficult to discern. As the saying goes, we will know it when we see it. For the moment, there is nothing to be seen from the developing nation quarter. So, it will be the task of the Administration to bring those key greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting nations into legally binding commitments during the same compliance period that has been agreed upon by the advanced nations, that is, the period 2008-2012. 
Mr. President, I also remain concerned about whether the agreement reached in Kyoto meets the second standard set by the Byrd-Hagel resolutions, S. Res. 98, namely, that its implementation would not result in serious harm to our economy. Since the impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy is not now clearly understood, we cannot rule out the likelihood of such damage. It is critical that our nation, and the Senate, understand the probable costs of these specific actions proposed to address global climate change, as well as the possible consequence of taking no action. 
What is the cost? What is the cost, if no action is taken? What is the cost if certain actions are taken? 
The administration has not yet presented a comprehensive economic analysis, sector by sector, regarding the impact of the Kyoto decision on our economy. Without such an assessment, understood in detail, the Kyoto agreement's impact on autos, on the coal industry, on steel, on aluminum, on cement, on the oil industry, on consumers, on builders, on people of varying income levels, there would be little sense in the Senate's even debating the protocol. 
The lack of satisfaction on either count of the S. Res. 98 standards--as I say, there are two of them--means the Kyoto protocol fall short, and there would be virtually no chance of securing the approval of two-thirds of the Senate were the President to decide to submit it for such approval. The President has already indicated his agreement with this assessment, and I believe that he agrees that the decisions of the conference are just the first part of an ongoing work in progress which will continue over 1998 and perhaps beyond, until a comprehensive, effective, and understandable agreement is reached that would be worthy of Senate consideration. 
On the positive side, the U.S. negotiating team deserves our commendation for sticking to certain central principles, which were incorporated into the protocol as agreed to in Kyoto. The negotiations were tough, grueling and long. Nonetheless, it was the United States, led by Under Secretary Eizenstat, that obtained agreement on many of our most important priorities, in direct contrast to the Europeans, who witnessed the rejection of almost all of their more draconian and economically harmful ideas.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. And I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, on several occasions during the last session of Congress, I took to the Senate floor to discuss the importance of reauthorizing the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. I shared my observation that this effort to renew our Nation's highway, highway safety and transit programs would be one of the most important, if not the most important, legislative accomplishment of the first session of the 105th Congress. As all Senators are aware, the provisions of ISTEA expired on September 30 of last year 1997. This meant that, absent enactment of new authorization legislation, many important highway, bridge, and transit projects would grind to a halt. Unfortunately, the Senate did not turn to the critically important ISTEA reauthorization bill until October 8 of last year. Between that date and October 29, 1997, the Senate was unable to adopt even one substantive amendment due to the impasse over Senate consideration of campaign finance reform legislation. 
The parliamentary amendment tree was filled. And it was impossible to get an amendment in which I and other cosponsors of the amendment wanted to have brought before the Senate. 
The Senate failed to invoke cloture four times on the ISTEA bill. In the end, notwithstanding the fact that a unanimous consent agreement was reached on the campaign finance issue, the 6-year ISTEA bill was pulled from the floor. Finally, on November 10, the Senate debated and passed a short-term extension of our existing highway and transit programs, effectively putting off completion of Senate action on our Nation's surface transportation policy for the next 6 years until the second session of the 105th Congress. 
Now, despite the stated intentions of the Senate leadership to take up the ISTEA reauthorization bill, S. 1173, during the first week of the second session of this Congress, I am very concerned that the Senate may not return to the ISTEA reauthorization bill until after completion of the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution in late spring. 
Mr. President, the onus is now upon us to return to the full 6-year transportation authorization bill and complete our work as soon as possible. While I supported the enactment of the short-term extension bill back in November, I remind my colleagues that it was only a stopgap measure providing only about one-half year of funding for our existing highway, highway safety, and transit programs. As of this date, our State highway departments and our mass transit systems cannot establish a budget for the current fiscal year because they do not know the final level of Federal resources that they will receive for this year. Morever, they cannot develop or implement any long-term financing plans because they do not know the level of Federal resources that will be available to them over the next 5 years. This is an impossible situation for our State highway departments. Given the cost and duration of major highway projects and the complexities associated with short construction seasons in our cold weather States, planning and predictability are essential to the logical functioning of our Federal-Aid Highway program. But that kind of rational planning is precisely what our States cannot do at this time because of our inaction. This is not how our State and local transportation agencies should have to do business. Certainly, no corporation could long survive doing business in this fashion. It is, nonetheless, the circumstances that we have placed upon our transportation agencies, due to our failure to enact a multi-year ISTEA reauthorization bill in a timely manner. 
Members will recall that, prior to S. 1173, the ISTEA bill's being pulled from the floor, I, along with Senator Gramm of Texas, and the chairman and ranking member of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, Senators Warner and Baucus, filed an amendment numbered 1397. Our amendment embodies the simple premise that the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gas tax, which previously went to deficit reduction, but which is now being deposited in the Highway Trust Fund, should be authorized to better address our Nation's considerable highway needs. The amendment has two principal objectives. First, to put an authorization in place that allows for a substantial increase in highway spending in order to stem the continuing deterioration of our National Highway System. And second, to fulfill the trust of the American people, the people out there who pay these gas taxes every time they drive up to the gas pump believing that these funds will be used to maintain and improve our national transportation system. That was the position of Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner, and myself back in October when we brought forth our amendment, and that is our position today. 
Our amendment, which now has 49 co-sponsors, provides for the authorization of highway spending levels over the next 5 years consistent with the revenues derived from this 4.3 cents gas tax--roughly $31 billion over the 5 years 1999-2003. 
By the way, we have 49 cosponsors on that amendment. But several other Senators have assured us that they will vote for the amendment even though they were not interested in cosponsoring it for one reason or another. They will vote for it. They will be supportive of it if it will be brought up for a vote. 
Nothing has changed since October regarding the resolve of Senators Gramm, Warner, Baucus, and myself to see this amendment adopted. However, other things have changed since the amendment was introduced. We are now well into fiscal year 1998 and the 4.3-cents gas tax is being deposited--where?--into the highway trust fund. By the end of this fiscal year, more than $7 billion--with a big `B'--$7 billion in additional new revenue will be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund, not one penny--not one penny--of which is authorized to be spent under the committee-reported ISTEA bill. Instead, these funds will be allowed to sit in the highway trust fund, earning interest, and being used as an offset to the Federal deficit for the next 6 years. In other words, if we adopt the levels authorized in the committee-reported bill, as Senators Domenici and Chafee--both of whom I have the greatest respect for--would have us do, we will have accomplished nothing--nothing at all--toward improving our National Highway System. Instead, we will have just enacted legislation to actually prevent using this 4.3 cents gas tax for highways. What the committee-reported bill does, then, without the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, is ignore the availability of this new trust fund revenue for the entire upcoming 6 years. Not one red cent will be authorized for expenditure if we accept the committee bill, as reported. This means that by the end of 2003, the highway trust fund balances will have grown to roughly $72 billion! In other words, some $72 billion will be sitting there in the highway trust fund as government IOUs collecting interest and being used to lower the Federal deficit instead of for highways as we, the Members of Congress, have told the American people it would be. I cannot imagine a more perverse scam on the American people. 
Well, one may say, we need to balance the Federal budget and we cannot do it if we let these highway monies be spent. Not true. Not true, Senators. 
The resources were available back in October to finance the levels of highway spending embodied in the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. And today, it appears that there are even more resources available to provide for a healthy increase in infrastructure spending, without busting the budget. When one reviews the conditions of our Nation's highways and bridges and the current inadequate levels of investment--which would continue for the next 6 years under the committee-reported bill--one must come, as I do, to the conclusion that it would be irresponsible to do any less. 
Mr. President, our national highway system is America's lifeline, not just for rural areas, but for all of our Nation's cities--even those that make extensive use of mass transit and rail systems. Our major highways carry nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commercial traffic, and nearly 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. Even though our Nation has among the most extensive and efficient rail and aviation systems in the world, eight out of every ten tons of interstate cargo still travel over our highways. And eight out of every ten of our constituents travel between States over highways. In regard to intrastate traffic, Americans take 91 percent of all work trips and 87 percent of all trips in a car or truck. Like it or not, we are a Nation on wheels. 
Yet, despite the indispensable role our highway system plays in modern American life, we have, as a Nation, been negligent--let us confess it--we have been negligent in its upkeep. We have allowed the system to fall into a woeful state of disrepair while the unspent balances of the Highway Trust Fund have continued to climb. According to the most recent report by the U.S. Department of Transportation regarding the conditions and performance of our National Highway System, only 39 percent of our National Highway System is rated in good condition. Fully 61 percent of our Nation's highways are rated in either fair or poor condition. For our interstate system, which is the crown jewel of our National Highway System, fully 50 percent of the mileage is rated in fair or poor condition. And these figures only worsen when we look at our other major Federal and State highways. In our urban areas, fully 65 percent of our non-interstate highway mileage is rated as being in fair or poor condition. There are literally over a quarter-of-a-billion miles of pavement in the United States that are in poor or mediocre condition, and there are almost 95,000 bridges in our country that have been deemed to be deficient. Within that total, roughly 44,000 bridges have been deemed to be structurally deficient, meaning that they need significant maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement. Many of these bridges require load posting, requiring heavier trucks to take longer, alternate routes. And an additional 51,000 bridges have been deemed to be functionally deficient, meaning that they do not have the lane widths, shoulder widths, or vertical clearances sufficient to serve the traffic demand. 
Paradoxically, as our roads continue to deteriorate, our Nation's dependence on those roads continues to grow. Highway use is on the rise. The number of vehicle miles traveled grew by roughly 40 percent over the last decade to an astronomical rate of 2.3 trillion. Within that total, the rate of traffic growth on our rural interstates grew by an even higher rate. And these levels of growth show no sign of abating. Since 1969, the number of trips per person taken over our roadways increased by more than 72 percent and the number of miles traveled increased by more than 65 percent. This combination of traffic growth and deteriorating conditions has led to an unprecedented level of congestion, not just in our urban centers but also in our suburbs and rural areas. Congestion is literally choking our roadways as our constituents seek to travel to work, to the shopping center, to the child care center, to their houses of worship. 
Mr. President, the traveling public is waiting for us--for us--to take up and pass a comprehensive ISTEA bill that truly addresses the needs of our surface transportation system. We should take up that legislation at the earliest possible time. And when we do, I hope all of my colleagues will join Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, Senator Warner and me, in supporting our amendment to re-invest in America's lifeline--our amendment to restore the trust of the American people in the Highway Trust Fund--our amendment to authorize the spending of our Highway Trust Fund resources where they are so desperately needed: On our Nation's highways.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I fully support the efforts of the chairman, and I congratulate him for the proposal that he has just described which, if adopted, makes it possible to greatly shorten the process of completion of the remaining appropriation bills. 
The pending amendment contains the committee's recommendations for the remaining three Fiscal Year 1998 appropriation bills, namely, the Commerce/Justice/State, District of Columbia, and Foreign Operations Appropriation Bills. As Members are aware, the Commerce/Justice/State and Foreign Operations Appropriation Bills were passed by the Senate in July of this year and have been in conference with the House. For those two bills, the committee's recommendations include, to a large extent, the agreements reached by the House and Senate conferees. There are, however, certain issues upon which the conferees were unable to reach agreement. For those particular issues, the committee has recommended proposals which we hope will be acceptable to the Senate and, if so, which the House can then accept. The chairman and ranking member of the Commerce/Justice/State Subcommittee, Senators Gregg and Hollings, and the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senators McConnell and Leahy, will make statements regarding their portions of the pending amendment. These very capable chairmen and ranking members have worked tirelessly for months on their respective bills, and they are to be commended by the Senate for their efforts. 
For the District of Columbia, as Senators are aware, the Senate has not yet passed the Fiscal Year 1998 appropriation bill. Here again, there are a number of issues which, up to this point, have been unresolved. I am certain that the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Faircloth, and the equally able ranking member, Senator Boxer, will explain in some detail the D.C. portion of the pending amendment and will be prepared to answer any inquiries which Senators may have. 
Mr. President, hopefully we are nearing the conclusion of the Fiscal Year 1998 appropriations process. As I have stated, the pending substitute, if enacted, will complete action on the remaining three appropriation bills. Like last year, this has been a very difficult year for the Appropriation Committees. These difficulties, however, like in other recent years, are due largely to attempts to attach controversial legislative riders to appropriation bills. The 
delays in enacting the remaining appropriation bills are in no way attributable to the chairman or other members of the Appropriations Committee. 
In his first year as chairman of the committee, Senator Stevens has carried out his responsibilities in an outstanding manner. At every step of the process, from the first meeting of the committee this year and throughout all of the hearings and markup sessions that he has chaired, he has shown not only great expertise and skill as it relates to all appropriation matters, but, just as importantly and, perhaps more so, my distinguished friend and colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, has unerringly displayed great patience and bipartisanship on every occasion throughout this, his first year as chairman of the committee. I know that he would have preferred, as I would, to have the thirteen appropriation bills separately adopted and signed into law. But at this late date, I support the chairman's decision and commend him for bringing this proposal to the Senate that, if agreed to, will enable us to complete action on the remaining bills expeditiously. 
It may well be that the House will be unable to agree with every recommendation made in the pending substitute. If that is the case, the House may wish to ask for a conference with the Senate on the matter; or, the House could simply amend the Senate amendment and send the bill back to the Senate without the need for a conference. My point is, that even with the adoption of this proposal, we are not out of the woods. Further action may be required by the Senate. But, I am convinced that if we proceed in the regular manner and continued separate conferences on the Commerce/Justice/State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Bills, and separately complete action in the Senate on the District of Columbia Appropriation Bills, and then conference with the House on it, we may be in for several more weeks of controversy on these outstanding issues on the remaining appropriation bills. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these separate conferences would ever be able to overcome the impasses which have developed and mired them down. 
Mr. President, I want the Record to show that if given the opportunity to vote on these three appropriation bills separately, I would have voted against passage of the conference report on the Fiscal Year 1998 Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill. At a time when we are under continuing severe budgetary constraints on discretionary spending for our nation's infrastructure--its highways and bridges, water and sewage treatment projects, education and other national priorities--I am opposed to providing appropriations for foreign countries at the same or increasing levels year after year. For example, in my view, the $3 billion payment to Israel and $2 billion payment to Egypt should be reduced under the circumstances facing the nation. Even though we are achieving reductions in the Federal budget deficit, we nevertheless still have a Federal debt exceeding $5.43 trillion and the interest on that debt each year amounting to $251 billion. 
I strongly urge all members to support the chairman of the committee, as well as the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant subcommittees, in the proposal that is before the Senate, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my very distinguished colelague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for yielding to me and for allowing me to be a cosponsor of the legislation which he has just been discussing before the Senate. I am proud to be one of his colleagues. I have great admiration for Senator Specter and admiration for his knowledge of the law. He has had long and varied experiences. I admire him for that experience. 
Senator Specter is a good lawyer. If I wanted a lawyer to plead my case to the Supreme Court, I think I would like Arlen Specter. If I were President of the United States--of course, I guess that will never become a reality--I would consider him for Attorney General, even though he is on the other side of the aisle. He calls the shots like they are. 
I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague in introducing the legislation. Our proposal is aimed at helping the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty by directing the Judiciary Committee to establish a pool of the best and the brightest Supreme Court candidates for the President's consideration whenever there is a vacancy on the Court--the best and the brightest. 
I personally do not promote the idea that we must make diversity a criterion. I have no problem with diversity, as long as the chosen ones are chosen because of their merit--their merit. That is what we seek to do here. We want the best and the brightest--not because they are Republicans, or not because they are Democrats, necessarily, but because they are the best and the brightest. 
As anyone who has ever read the Constitution knows, one of the most important differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives is the Senate's constitutional duty to advise and consent on Presidential nominations. Specifically, that power which is contained in article II, section 2, stipulates that the President, `by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.' 
While it may be true that the Senate has traditionally given a President great leeway in choosing his executive branch subordinates, especially those in Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions, such deference on the part of the Senate has generally not applied to judicial nominations, particularly Supreme Court nominations. On the contrary, the Senate has historically exercised great caution to ensure that it carries out its responsibility, a responsibility that is a fundamental element of the separation of powers established in the Constitution. 
While we have been very diligent in granting our consent, I believe, as does Senator Specter, that the Senate has been less than energized with respect to the offering of its advice. The Constitution refers to the `Advice and Consent.' 
It doesn't just refer to the word `consent,' nor does it put the word `consent' in front of the word `advise.' It uses the phrase `advise and consent of the Senate.' Too often, as the American people are acutely aware, nominations to the High Court have become embroiled in special interest battles. All too often, the qualifications of a nominee have been aside as outside forces--interest groups and so on--have sought to use a nomination as a means of furthering their particular ideological agenda. That is not what the Supreme Court is for. Too often, the eventual loser in the process is not just the individual who has been nominated, but also the Court and its integrity, and also, more than that even, the people of the United States--the whole people, not just some particular interest group, but all of the people. 
Mr. President, in an era when the nine life-tenured Justices who sit on our highest Court routinely decide questions that go to the very heart of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we cannot afford to have anything less than the most highly qualified individuals serving on that Court. 
While I do not mean to disparage any of the current Justices, the fact remains that, more and more, nominees are being selected for reasons that go beyond their qualifications, that go beyond their abilities, that go beyond their dedication, their reverence for and dedication to the Constitution. Accordingly, Senator Specter has come to the conclusion--and he has allowed me to join him--that the best way to resolve this problem and the best way for the Senate to undertake its advice responsibility is to direct the Judiciary Committee, after consultation with the finest legal minds in our country, to establish a panel of potential nominees that would be made available to the President--this President, or any other President. In so doing, it is our hope that we can begin to depoliticize the nomination process and, in turn, help restore to the High Court the esteem, much of which has been lost over the past few years. 
In closing, I again want to thank Senator Specter for his thoughtfulness, for his vision, as we have worked on the resolution. I know that he shares my concern that the Senate has not only this responsibility, but it has a duty, a constitutional duty, to ensure that the highest Court in the land is comprised of the best and the brightest talent that our Nation has to offer. I hope that others will join us in this effort.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have followed the fast-track debate closely, and it is with some disappointment that I note the absence of any discussion of the constitutional and institutional framework that governs our country's approach to foreign trade. A proper understanding of that framework is essential if we are to have a productive, enlightened debate about fast track. 
I am also convinced that some of fast track's most ardent admirers might find their ardor dimmed a little if they recognize the sordid truth about fast track. 
Accordingly, I wish to speak, not overly long, about the illegitimate birth and disreputable pedigree of fast track. And I will attempt to unfold a decidedly unflattering but undeniably truthful account of how Presidential machinations and arrogance combined with congressional spinelessness to produce the monstrosity of fast track. They will learn that fast track is not about saving jobs or opening markets or building a bridge to the next century. Fast track, in a very considerable measure, is about power--raw, unfettered, Presidential power. And Mr. President, let me point out to any colleagues who doubt my reliability and objectivity in this regard that much of what I have to say is drawn from a recent article in the George Washington Journal of International Law and Economics, whose author appears favorably disposed to fast track. 
I start by noting that the Constitution assigns Congress a major role in the regulation of foreign affairs. Contrary to popular opinion--and contrary to the beliefs of most Presidents--the executive branch does not possess sole authority over foreign affairs. Indeed, beyond the general statement in article II, section 1 that `[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America,' the Constitution contains only four provisions that grant the executive clear foreign relations authority. 
Now, I carry in my shirt pocket a copy of the Constitution of the United States. Alexander the Great greatly admired the Iliad. And he carried with him a copy of the Iliad, a copy that Aristotle had carefully examined and refined somewhat. And it was called the `casket copy.' Aristotle slept with this casket copy of the Iliad under his pillow. And along with the Iliad, there was a sword. 
Now, Mr. President, I do not have a copy of the Constitution at night under my pillow, but I try to carry it at all times whether I am in West Virginia or whether I am here. I try to carry a copy of the Constitution in my shirt pocket. It is a copy of the Constitution that I have had for several years. It only cost 15 cents at the time I procured it from the Government Printing Office. Although the price has advanced now to probably about $1.50, $1.75, it is still the same Constitution. 
We may have added one or two or three amendments to the Constitution since I first procured this copy. I have not stopped to check on that. But the Constitution itself has not changed in that time other than, as I say, some amendments have been added. 
Would it surprise Senators to know that the Constitution contains only four provisions that grant the executive clear foreign relations authority? 
As one scholar has dryly observed, `the support these clauses offer the President is less than overwhelming.' The clauses, all in article II, are these: the power to appoint ambassadors and to negotiate treaties, (section 2, clause 2), and both of these require the Senate's `Advice and Consent'; also the responsibility to receive ambassadors from foreign governments, (section 3); and the authority to command the Armed Forces in case Congress, through its responsibilities and powers under the Constitution, provides Armed Forces for the President to command, (section 2, clause 1). These narrow provisions provide a rather shaky foundation on which to build a case for the executive's predominance over foreign affairs. 
Congress, by contrast, is explicitly given substantial authority under the Constitution and in the Constitution over foreign affairs. While the Constitutional Convention saw a lot of debate about which branch was better qualified to make foreign policy, the document that was signed on September 17, 1787 gives us a clue as to which side won. Fully eleven of the powers granted to Congress in article I, section 8 involve foreign affairs. They include the powers: (1) `To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' (clause 3); (2) `To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises' (clause 1); (3) `To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations' (clause 9); (4) `To declare War . . . and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water' (clause 11); (5) `To raise and support Armies' (clause 12); (6) `To provide and maintain a Navy' (clause 13); and (7) `To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia.' (clause 16). When one throws into the mix Congress' power to make the law--section 1, article 1--and its control over spending and appropriations in section 9, one conclusion is inescapable, namely: Congress' authority over foreign affairs is formidable. 
Despite the Constitution's clear language, however, the history of this country has seen the executive branch assume control over increasingly large swathes of foreign affairs power, while Congress has occasionally taken back a scrap or two or a crumb or so for itself. It is now almost axiomatic that the President is sole representative of the United States before foreign nations. This is the culmination of a process that began in the earliest days of the Republic, when Congress met infrequently, giving the President effective day-to-day power over foreign affairs; the process has since accelerated with the advent of modern media--particularly television--which provide the President with a singularly powerful forum in which to make his case on matters of foreign policy. 
While the executive branch has assumed general authority over foreign affairs, for a long time Congress made sure that its power over foreign trade remained on the eastern end--on the eastern end--of Pennsylvania Avenue. After all, the Constitution is clear on this point: Congress has sole authority over trade. Two of the article I clauses as I just cited deals squarely with that issue, and they are conclusive, namely: Congress must `regulate Commerce,' it has the power to `regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' and has the power to `lay and collect . . . Duties, Imposts and Excises.' 
For much of this Nation's history, there was little tension between the legislative and executive branches over trade regulation, unlike other areas of foreign policy, such as the use of military force. 
As I have said on earlier occasions, for the first 150 years or so of its existence, Congress exercised broad control over foreign trade and tariffs. Starting in 1934, however, Congress decided that it no longer wished to unilaterally exercise its power to set tariffs. Accordingly, Congress delegated to the President in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 the authority to negotiate tariff agreements and to proclaim changes in tariff rates, within certain boundaries set by Congress. This so-called `Proclamation Authority' was periodically renewed, typically for brief periods of around three years. 
It did not take Congress long to decide that it had given away--that it had delegated--too much trade negotiating authority. The result was the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which, among other things, created the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations; required that multilateral trade negotiations include designated members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee; and prevented the President from negotiating certain tariff reductions designated by the Tariff Commission. 
Congress soon discovered that the Trade Expansion Act was not enough to rein in a newly emboldened executive branch, which set about seizing as much control over foreign trade as it could get away with--and then some! The first shoe to fall was the U.S.-Canada Automotive Products Agreement of 1965, which the administration secretly negotiated for over a year without so much as notifying Congress. When President Johnson sent the Agreement to Congress for approval, presenting it as a fait accompli which needed only a legislative rubber stamp, a number of my colleagues were disconcerted at what they viewed as his high-handedness. Many resented the President's usurpation of Congress' rightful role in trade matters. And I suspect that many others wish that they had then stood up for congressional prerogatives rather than permitting the executive to accumulate still broader powers over trade. Instead, members adopted a course of conciliation and appeasement; they should have known, as history so often reminds us, that nothing, nothing, whets the appetite for power so much as a tender morsel of the substance. 
The other shoe dangled briefly before falling to the floor with a resounding crash a few years later. This time, the issue was the 1964-67 Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. At the time, tariffs were relatively low, which meant that more attention was focused on non-tariff barriers. This posed a problem for congressional oversight. After all, while tariff changes could be restricted within a designated range of percentage rates, it was much more difficult to provide precise limits on the negotiation of non-tariff barriers. During the second session of the 89th Congress the Senate therefore adopted a concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 100, `urging the 
President to instruct U.S. negotiators in Geneva to bargain only on provisions authorized in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.' 
Now, what was the President's response to this clear, explicit instruction from the Senate? As best I can determine, the President simply cast those directions aside, for he promptly entered into two non-tariff barrier agreements that the 1962 Act had not authorized. One of these agreements was an antidumping code, for which President Johnson claimed `sole executive agreement authority.' I was a member of the Senate back then, and let me assure you that we did not look kindly on the President's blatant refusal to follow our instructions or those of the Constitution. Our response was to state unequivocally that the President's agreement did not supersede domestic law or limit the Tariff Commission's statutory discretion to implement the antidumping laws. Congress made clear that the President's antidumping agreement would be followed only in cases where it did not conflict with standing law; and Congress reiterated that no President--not even that master arm-twister, Lyndon Baines Johnson!--could encroach upon Congress' power to make the laws. 
The second non-tariff agreement that President Johnson entered into without congressional authorization was the repeal of the American Selling Price method of customs valuation. Once again, the President asserted his authority to make--or, in this case, to repeal--the laws. It is just what we are seeing happen in the case of line-item veto. Congress has given the President the authority to repeal laws. Shame, shame on Congress. Once again, and to its everlasting credit, Congress stood firm. We condemned President Johnson's refusal to heed the Senate's instructions and we rejected his outrageous belief that `executive authority' allowed him to make trade agreements that changed U.S. domestic law! Few scholars, today, of course, would agree with the President's position, but the matter was less clearly defined then. And, Mr. President, I for one am relieved that Congress stood fast in defense of its constitutional powers. I wish it would wake up one day and read history and read the Constitution again. 
The battle was not over, however. President Nixon continued his predecessor's attempts to usurp Congress' trade authority, though this time by persuasion rather than by intimidation. The different tactics of Presidents Johnson and Nixon towards the same goal may say a lot about their respective personalities and presidencies. President Johnson had launched a frontal attack upon Congress, relying on brute force and his own, ample powers of persuasion to intimidate the legislature into granting him greater trade power. Nixon, however, took a different tack; rather than storming the barricades of Congress, he tried to convince us to open the gates to him. 
The President made a powerful pitch for Congress granting him the ability to unilaterally change domestic law. He declared, with a fervor that subsequent fast track supporters have echoed, that the ability of the country to enter into trade agreements hung in the balance. The future of the United States itself was in jeopardy unless Congress would delegate to him--you will be hearing the same thing today; the United States was in jeopardy unless Congress would delegate to him--the authority to proclaim all changes to U.S. law necessitated by a trade agreement. Now, how prosperous. I will not dwell on the obvious constitutional infirmities of Nixon's proposal; suffice it to say that giving the President the power to proclaim changes to U.S. law might have raised a few eyebrows at the Constitutional Convention! 
Don't you think so? It might have raised a few eyebrows up there with that illustrious group of men that included James Madison, Hamilton, Elbridge Gerry, and others. You would have seen some eyebrows going up and down. Our Constitution's framers knew full well that lawmaking by Executive fiat is the very definition of tyranny. 
I wish that this story of the executive branch's attempt to seize the powers of the legislative had a happier ending; one of the sad truths known to all historians is that, in real life, the endings are so often confused or disappointing. President Nixon did not, of course, win the authority to proclaim changes to domestic law. However, he did succeed in pressuring Congress to grant him the authority to negotiate certain trade agreements which Congress might neither amend nor debate extensively: what we now simply call `fast track.' The President's invocation of the national interest, and the fears he raised that, without fast track--and we are hearing the same siren call today--he would be unable to implement an effective trade policy for the United States, and it won the day. In a moment of weakness--and Congress has had its moments of weakness, as in this instance--Congress allowed itself to be seduced by the President's rhetoric and his appeal to patriotic duty; and a short time later, lo and behold, fast track was born. 
Well, today, Mr. President, history appears to be repeating itself. Once again, the air is filled with the dire, somber predictions about what will happen if fast track is not approved. I read that there are all kinds of trading, all kinds of promises being made, and we are seeing arms twisted out of shape--no bones broken, you understand, but just arms being twisted. Once again, we have a President who appeals to national interest and insists that he will be unable to negotiate trade agreements without fast track. Once again, Members have ears that cannot hear and eyes that cannot see. Once again, we have a Congress that appears overawed by Executive authority and unwilling to assert its rightful role in regulating trade--in fact, a Congress that is quite willing, perhaps happy, as was the Roman senate in that case, to hand off another of its duties to a dictator or to an emperor--in our case, happy to hand off another of its constitutional duties to the Executive. 
I am sure that most of the viewing public must wonder why any elected official would willingly give up some of the power of the people, the power that, under the Constitution, is to be exercised by elected representatives of the people. Power, after all, they must imagine, is what politicians crave most. 
Oh, that we could review again the story of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, who in the year 458 B.C. was called upon by a delegation from the Roman senate. And upon inquiring why this delegation had come to him to interrupt his plowing of his small farm of three acres alongside the Tiber River, he was informed that the senate had decided to thrust upon him the power of a dictator so that he could rid Rome of the threat of certain tribes to the east, the Aequians. And being the loyal patriot that he was, Cincinnatus turned to his wife Racilia and said, `We may not have enough food to live on this winter because we won't be able to sow our fields.' Nevertheless, he wiped his perspiring forehead, took on the regalia of a dictator, and loyally assumed the responsibilities and duties that the Roman senate had placed upon him. He rid the city of Rome of the threats, and he relieved the Roman legions that were being surrounded by the armies of the tribes to the east. Within 16 days, he had accomplished this mission. And he turned back the powers of dictatorship. 
So there was the old-fashioned model of simplicity, the old-fashioned model of one who did not seek power, who did not want power. He did not want the power thrust upon him, but he willingly gave up this power. 
So, today, the people of the United States, I am sure, feel that power is what politicians most crave. Isn't it the thirst for power that causes politicians to chase campaign money like a hound on the scent of a fox? Isn't it power that opens doors, rolls out red carpets, and serves up free food and drink? Isn't it really power, more often than character, that invites the respect of others? So how can the public possibly accept the notion that Congress is actually giving up some of its power--its constitutional power--through fast track? 
Now, I am not claiming that the fast track legislation is unconstitutional; I am simply saying that the Congress is willingly giving up much of its power under the Constitution through fast track--not only giving it up, but saying: here it is, take it, relieve me of it. 
Perhaps, in this age of television, in which the 30-second sound bite is preferable to a complete and meaningful discussion of issues, some politicians have come to the realization that it is easy, perhaps preferable, to retain the illusion of power, without actually having to be saddled with any of the burdensome responsibility that comes with true power. They would rather not have it because it carries with it responsibilities. 
Think about that. If we give up the power of Congress, we no longer have to take the heat for bad decisions, do we? We can just point the finger. We can take those letters from angry constituents and say, `Sorry, not me. It is not my fault. Blame the President. That is his power now. He did that.' 
How much nicer will our reelection campaigns be? Not having to run for 3 years, it would be much nicer for me, much easier for me, to say, `That wasn't my responsibility.' What will our opponents be able to complain about? How can they possibly run negative ads against us when we have given all of our responsibility to somebody else? 
I can see the campaign ads now. `Vote for me. I didn't do anything, but I sure looked good not doing it.' And our opponents could retort, `Don't vote for him. I cannot attach any blame to him for anything, but he has big ears.' So there we have it. If we hand over all of our powers, and thus all of our responsibilities, then we can't be blamed for anything. All we need to do is keep our hair well coiffed, buy fancy suits, have a nip here and a tuck there, keep a list of snappy sound bites in our pocket--that's all it will require to be an invincible political candidate. 
Is this what we really want? Is this what the American public out there deserves? Certainly not. We were elected to do a job--to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Actually, we took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. How many of us have read it lately? We certainly are doing a sad job of it when we agree to bind ourselves to fast track and to lie prostrate, waiting for the executive caboose to rumble over us. 
I said a few moments ago that history seemed to be repeating itself. And others have said that, and for good reason. Lord Byron said, `History with all its volumes vast hath but one page.' Cicero said, `To be ignorant of that which occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.' 
So history is repeating itself. I wonder why that is. God created water and other things in the beginning. He created water, H20--two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen. And it hasn't changed. It is still the same. It is still H20. It is still two parts of hydrogen and one part oxygen. Well, human nature hasn't changed either from the beginning. It changed through Abel. Abel's blood cried out from the ground. Human nature hasn't changed. We are still a slave of it. 
So history seems to be repeating itself because human nature hasn't changed. Today, I urge my colleagues to study history: Stand firm. Do not give up your constitutional responsibility. Do not rise to the bait offered by those who accuse you of protectionism; the cause of freer and fairer trade is not served by Congress abdicating its power. Do not be fooled into thinking that no country will negotiate with the world's foremost economic power because of concern about how that country's legislative branch conducts its debates; the foolishness of that argument should be self-evident. And don't allow the threats, cajolements, incentives, rewards, punishments or imprecations that the administration may cast your way; don't allow these to sway your decision. I hope that the House will stiffen--stiffen its opposition to fast track. It is time to resist the executive's encroachments on the prerogatives of Congress. It is time, Mr. President, for Congress to throw off its cloak of humility and deference and reverence for the executive and to assert its rightful constitutional role in the regulation of commerce with foreign nations. 
Mr. President, recent polls have illustrated how ill-informed most Americans are about their Constitution. Oh, they like it, all right, but few of them can accurately answer or debate the questions about it. Even fewer, I would posit, understand how well and how carefully the Constitution balances the powers given to the three branches of Government--a balance constructed by the Founding Fathers as a defense against the evils of one-man rule. Our Founding Fathers wanted to escape the tyranny that a king can impose over a subservient and subjugated people. And that is why our forefathers fought the American Revolution. That is why lives were risked, and that is why lives were lost. Our Founding Fathers knew that every President would be tempted to amass power to himself, and they hoped that the combined strength of the elected representatives in Congress could check those power grabs. 
Of course, there were those at the Convention who were concerned about the thirst of the legislative branch for power and how it might encroach on the powers of the President. But they could not foresee the day when we would have political parties. They could not foresee the day when the President of the United States would be the titular head of a political party; how he would command hundreds and thousands of patronage positions. They could not foresee the day when television would bring to the American people the news of the second--not the news of the minute, but the news of the second. 
Isaiah, a great prophet, was right when he said:  
Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 
And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. 
And that is true. Isn't television exalting the valleys and making low the mountains and the hills? Isn't all flesh seeing the glory of the Lord together? 
There came a time when the clock struck and we had the underocean cable, the wireless telegraph, the telephone, the diesel motor train, the airplane--all of these things. And by all of these things, radio and television, the printing press--by all of these things, then, the glory of the Lord has been revealed in all of the globe. And Isaiah's prophecy has come true. 
So, our Founding Fathers could not possibly have foreseen the time when Americans would have these wonderful inventions. And when the President would have, at the snap of his finger, all of the media in that White House gather around his bully pulpit. They could not foresee these things. 
For the most part, this system has worked. And I hope and pray that it will continue to work. Thus, I say to my colleagues in the House and here: Stand firm. Hold fast, and together let us oppose this fast track to nowhere. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, William Manchester, writing in the book, `The Glory and the Dream,' would call the year 1932 `the cruelest year.' I was in the 10th grade at Mark Twain High School at Stotesbury in Raleigh County, southern West Virginia. Living in a coal miner's home, I saw and felt the Great Depression firsthand. Schoolteachers often had to reduce their monthly paychecks by several percentage points in order to get the checks cashed. The newspapers frequently carried stories of men who had jumped out of windows or pressed a cocked pistol to their temples, taking their lives because they had lost their lifetime savings, and their economic world had come crashing down around them. 
Very few men in and around the coal fields had ever owned an automobile, and those who were fortunate enough to possess an automobile jacked it up off the ground and mounted the axles on railroad crossties to keep the tires from rotting while enough money could be saved to pay for a new license plate. Many children went to bed hungry at night, their families destitute. 
The country had hit rock bottom, and West Virginia was one of the `rock bottomest' of the States. It is hard to imagine that things could have gotten much worse in southern West Virginia. There was little left but hope, and there was not much of that, hardly enough to go around. 
President Hoover, against whom I would still be campaigning 20 years later, professed to ignore the crisis as a `depression,' he being convinced that a `balanced budget' was the most essential factor leading to an economic recovery. He still wore a black tie at dinner in the White House, even when the only other person dining with him was his wife, Lou. 
Creature comforts were rare. Air conditioning was unknown, as were automatic dishwashers, electric toothbrushes, cassette recorders, garbage disposal units, electric can openers, vacuum cleaners, power mowers and record players. Phonographs were wound with a crank by hand. The family wash was done by hand on a washboard. Wet clothes were hung on a clothesline with clothespins to dry in the wind, and a refrigerator was simply an icebox kept filled by a man who knew how many pounds of ice a housewife wanted because she notified him by placing on the kitchen screen door a card with the number `100,' `75,' `50' or `25' turned up. Heavy irons for pressing clothes were heated on the coal-burning kitchen stove. Houseflies were always a summer problem, and the only preventives were spray guns and flypaper. 
We were not used to much, and if we had never had much to begin with, we did not miss it. 
Most of the coal miners by the year 1932 had a radio in their homes. It was a Majestic, an Atwater Kent or a Philco. At my house, a small Philco radio sat on a wall shelf, and it was there that we gathered on Saturday nights to listen to the Grand Ole Opry that was broadcast from Nashville, TN. I heard the `Solemn Old Judge,' the `Fruit Jar Drinkers,' DeFord Bailey on his harmonica, the Delmore Brothers, Roy Acuff, Minnie Pearl from `Grinders Switch,' Sam and Kirk McGree and Uncle Dave Macon picking the banjo `clawhammer style.' 
On some Saturday nights, I would play the fiddle at a small but lively square dance held somewhere in a coal camp where I lived or in a neighboring community. Times were bad, but life had to go on, and a Saturday night frolic helped to keep the spirits up. 
Madam President, in that year 1932, a writer for the Saturday Evening Post asked John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, whether there had ever been anything like the Depression before. `Yes,' he replied. `It was called the Dark Ages and it lasted four hundred years.' This was calamity howling on a cosmic scale, but on at least one point the resemblance seemed valid. In each case the people were victims of forces that they could not understand. 
Mr. President, in that same year of 1932, there was born a child in Massachusetts, and his name was Edward Kennedy. In 1932, of course, I knew nothing about Edward Kennedy or Edward Kennedy's birth. But today I rise on this Senate floor to salute one of the outstanding Senators in the history of this great body. He is a man whose expertise, hard work, and courage have set a lofty example to which every fledgling Senator should aspire. 
On November 6, 1962, Edward Kennedy was elected to the Senate, and so he is celebrating his 35th anniversary and we are celebrating the 35th anniversary of his arrival in the Senate. 
I well remember the arrival of young Edward Kennedy in this Chamber. Having been elected in 1962 at the age of 30, he was one of the youngest Members in Senate history. 
While Senator Kennedy may not have been the youngest Senator ever, he was certainly one of the youngest. Despite his youth, however, much was expected of this young man and I suspect that some may have wondered whether he was really up to the challenge. After all, Senator Kennedy was representing a State that had provided the Senate with some its most memorable figures, among them Daniel Webster, Rufus Choate, and Charles Sumner. In addition, Senator Kennedy was elected to finish the term of the then current President, who was none other than his brother. When one remembers that another Kennedy brother was then Attorney General of the United States, one realizes why Senator Kennedy was accorded rather more attention than the average freshman Senator. 
I am gratified to report that, far from falling short of these grand expectations, Senator Kennedy has exceeded them. He became an innovative and productive legislator. He also embarked on a path from which he has never varied: championing the interests of the working people, the poor, and the disadvantaged. His tenure as chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources during the 100th Congress was remarkable, both in the sheer volume of legislation that he sponsored and in the dedication that he displayed to improving the education and health of all Americans. 
I was the majority leader of the Senate during that 100th Congress. I worked closely with Senator Kennedy and he worked closely with me. 
In just 2 years, Senator Kennedy pushed through more beneficial social legislation than many Senators produce in a lifetime. 
Mr. President, this country has seen remarkable changes over the past 35 years. Not the least of those changes has been a shift in political attitudes from the optimism and compassion that characterized the 1960's to the more hardened and occasionally cynical climate of today. But, throughout those changes, Senator Ted Kennedy has remained faithful to his vision of an America in which the rights of those without money, jobs, health insurance, or education are protected. Others may bow to the vagaries of public opinion but not Senator Kennedy. Instead, relying on a political and legislative acumen than may owe something to his well-known expertise as a sailor, Senator Kennedy uses the winds of popular sentiment to achieve his goals. Many times where others meekly follow the course of these powerful winds, Senator Kennedy calmly lifts a dampened finger aloft to test their force and direction, then he very expertly and patiently tacks back and forth until he reaches, his chosen destination. Even the strongest headwind is not enough to dissuade him, for he knows that hard work and dedication can conquer the most imposing obstacles. 
Despite his passionate and unswerving convictions, Senator Kennedy is also one of the most accommodating Members of the Senate. Throughout his career, he has sought out partnerships with Members regardless of their ideology or party in the interests of passing wise and necessary legislation. Even in these partisan days in which we live, Senator Kennedy consistently seeks to find common ground with those at all points along the political spectrum. Senator Kennedy has repeatedly put the national interest ahead of petty partisan squabbles. 
Not that he is above partisanship at all. We are all capable of being partisan at times; some of us more than others, perhaps. 
But this open-minded approach to lawmaking, this brave refusal to succumb to the partisan animosity that permeates Congress today, may well be one of the Senator's greatest legacies. 
I said at the beginning of my remarks that I believe Senator Kennedy to be one of the most outstanding Senators this Chamber has seen. Lest I be accused of hyperbole and exaggeration, or of excessive kindness toward a friend, let me make clear that my words are not motivated by simple kindness. Senator Kennedy's legislative dexterity and bipartisan approach, are a rare combination indeed. I fear that many of today's politicians will be judged harshly by the historians of tomorrow for their fickleness, their shallow rhetoric, their willingness 
to pander to popular opinion. But not so my good friend and esteemed colleague from Massachusetts. 
I have remarked before, and I remark today, that had Ted Kennedy been living in 1789 at the time the first Congress met, he would have been a powerful factor in pressing forward with the legislation that was enacted in that first Congress. A formidable opponent, a knowledgeable and dedicated legislator, Ted Kennedy would have been in the forefront of those who were advocating the Judiciary Act, and I have no doubt that he would have left his imprint upon that legislation. 
Had he been living at the time of the Civil War, serving in the U.S. Senate, again, he would have been recognized as a forceful leader. 
In the days of reconstruction, again, Senator Kennedy would have made his mark in the U.S. Senate. 
Had he been a Senator during the years of the New Deal, he would have allied himself with Franklin D. Roosevelt and would have been a strong supporter of the landmark legislation that was enacted in those difficult years. 
I think that if Ted Kennedy had been living prior to the Revolution, he would have joined men like Samuel Adams and John Adams and John Hancock, from his State of Massachusetts, in resisting the edicts of George III, the King of England. 
So, in summation, I say that Ted Kennedy would have been a leader, an outstanding Senator, at any period of the Nation's history. 
Ted Kennedy and I have not always been the best of friends. There was a time when we were not. That time has long been relegated to the ashes of the past. When I was majority leader of the Senate, and also when I was minority leader of the Senate, and when I was majority leader again, as I have already indicated, in the 100th Congress, I leaned much on Ted Kennedy's knowledge, his expertise, his support. He was one of my strongest supporters in the Senate. In caucuses or on the Senate floor, I could always count on Ted Kennedy to be there when I needed him. 
So, Ted Kennedy and I formed a friendship in the finest sense of that word. 
We share a liking for history, a fondness for poetry, and a love for the U.S. Senate. Ted Kennedy does his work well in the committee. When he comes to the floor, he comes with a batch of papers in his hands and with a head full of knowledge in respect to the legislation which he is promoting. I count him as one of the most effective Members of the Senate. 
I admire Ted's steadfast purpose, his tireless work, his easy humor, and his kind nature. But, most of all, I admire his courage. He has experienced more personal tragedy and deep sorrow than most of us could bear and still retain our sanity. Yet, he goes on. He contributes. He endures. He laughs. He leads. He inspires. He triumphs. 
I have watched him weather and work and grow in wisdom for 35 years. 
He has an excellent staff. One would have to have an excellent staff to be able to turn out the massive amount of work and to provide the leadership that he has so many times provided in enacting landmark legislation. He is ever on an upward track. 
Herman Melville put it this way:  
. . . and there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar. 
So here is to my friend and colleague as he celebrates his 35th anniversary. May he ever soar. 
I close with a verse by one of my favorite poets, Edwin Markham, a verse that I think typifies Senator Kennedy: 
Give thanks, O heart, for the high souls 
That point us to the deathless goals-- 
For all the courage of their cry 
That echoes down from sky to sky; 
Thanksgiving for the armed seers 
And heroes called to mortal years-- 
Souls that have built our faith in man, 
And lit the ages as they ran. 
I again thank my true friend, and he is my friend, has been for all the years that he has been in the Senate, Jesse Helms, for his kindness in arranging for me to proceed at this moment. 
I thank him very much. 
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, South Dakota is a quiet state. Its cities are neither heralded in poetry like Carl Sandberg's `big shouldered' Chicago nor celebrated in song like New York and San Francisco. It is, nonetheless, a state of stunningly varied beauty, showcased in the wildflower-sprinkled long grass prairie. It still boasts free-ranging herds of bison; and in the wind- and water-carved Badlands that glow with sunset colors under the azure skies. It can be a lonely state, with long ribbons of tarmac linking small towns for years haunted by the brooding presence of nuclear-tipped intercontinental range missiles and blanketed by driving snowstorms in winter. Strong-willed and resilient personalities are required to flourish in South Dakota, and she is blessed with such citizens. One of those strong-willed, resilient South Dakotans ably serves both the State of South Dakota and the United States Senate, where he will soon celebrate both the fourth anniversary of his election as Democratic Leader and the 50th anniversary of his birth in Aberdeen, South Dakota. 
Ah, Mr. President--oh, just to be 50 again. I would be calling back almost 30 years in that event. 
I am sure that everyone here would agree that Senator Tom Daschle is strong-willed and resilient. Indeed, Senator Daschle's virtues are common to those who claim the Mount Rushmore State as their home. Like the many ranchers and farmers who live in South Dakota, Senator Daschle is a patient, hard-working man who knows that one must toil today so that one may reap the fruits of one's labors tomorrow. And, as befits a man who hails from one of the country's most sparsely populated states, in which a majority of the inhabitants are rurally located, Senator Daschle is quiet, self-contained, independent and plain-spoken. Despite his quiet reserve, however, Senator Daschle is a warm and friendly man; these qualities well suit the resident of a state whose name derives from the Sioux word for `friends' or `allies.' 
I hope that Senator Daschle will permit me to indulge in a flight of fantasy by pointing out that he shares many of the geographic and meteorological characteristics of his state. Like a South Dakota blizzard, he is capable of driving the Senate with authority, but like the tall grass prairie, he is also capable of bending with the winds of change, adapting and modifying issues in order to reach a common consensus. Like the famed Black Hills of South Dakota, Senator Daschle possesses an implacable reserve; and, as befits the representative of a state which stands geographically at the center of our Union, he has claimed for himself the ideological middle-ground of this body and this country. As I list these many and varied characteristics, it occurs to me that here is truly a fitting embodiment of the state whose changeable climate and diverse geography have resulted in the appellation `the Land of Infinite Variety.' 
From the many and varied characteristics that I have enumerated, I wish to pluck one that best captures the essence of Senator Daschle. I refer to his quietness. Quietness is an underrated and sadly uncommon trait, in this chamber and in this nation. Underrated, 
perhaps, because it is often mistaken for timidity or lack of conviction; we Americans at times place too much faith in the hearty optimism and aggressive self-confidence of the extrovert. But the true optimist, the truly confident person, has no need for bluster or vituperation. Thus the Bible instructs us in Thessalonians 4:11, `Study to be quiet, and to do your own business.' And Shakespeare, whose poetry and prose remain a bounteous font of wisdom, also said `truth hath a quiet breast.' Indeed, truth does have a quiet breast, and the heart that beats within that breast is no more steady, dependable, diligent, or uncomplaining than is the senior Senator from South Dakota. 
For many persons, turning 50--as my friend from South Dakota will do on December 9th--marks an important milestone along the road of life, prompting thoughts about where one is heading and what one has accomplished. I know that Senator Daschle will not have to concern himself on the latter score, for his accomplishments are both numerous and widely acknowledged. A champion of veterans, a dedicated friend to farmers, an ally of Indians, and a powerful advocate of providing affordable health care to all Americans, Senator Daschle has proved time and time again his willingness to fight for those who are unable to fight for themselves. His courage and persistence in these endeavors may, perhaps, be traced to his service in the U.S. Air Force, which provides further evidence--as if more were needed!--of Senator Daschle's dedication to his country. 
Clearly, Senator Daschle has no reason to concern himself on his upcoming birthday with fears that he has achieved too little. But what of that other concern I alluded to a few minutes ago, the sudden realization common to many fledgling quinquagenarians that they are leaving the comfortable environs of middle age and entering a new, unfamiliar, untested territory? I do not know whether Senator Daschle is experiencing such intimations of mortality--if he were, he would doubtless be loath to admit it--but I feel that on this account I may set his mind to rest. Allow me to offer a little of the perspective on aging that is the prerogative of those, like myself, who are more advanced in years. 
For when I entered my 50th year, the Senate was a far different place than it is today. Senators were then paid $30,000 a year. Senators Mike Mansfield of Montana and Everett Dirksen of Illinois presided masterfully over their respective parties in the Senate. It was a turbulent time nationally, and that turbulence was mirrored in the Senate. Senator Eugene McCarthy stormed out of one particularly contentious meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, angered over the President's Vietnam policy. That same year, spectators dropped a flood of anti-Vietnam War literature from the galleries to protest a conflict that had already killed over 10,000 American soldiers; the Senate responded by, for the first time, banning demonstrations within the Capitol, and I joined in that protest against demonstrations in the galleries, as I think Senators who know me would understand that I would. 
On a more positive note, that year also saw several important milestones in the history of the Senate. Maine's Margaret Chase Smith became the first woman elected to a leadership position in the Senate when she won a unanimous vote to be Chairman of the Republican Conference. That same year, the first black Senator in years, Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts, was sworn in. Senator Brooke was not only the first black Senator since Reconstruction; he was also the first from a northern state and the first to be popularly elected to the Senate. 
I hope, in suggesting how the Senate has changed since my 50th year, that I have both reminded Senator Daschle of his youth and suggested the breadth of change that he will inevitably see in this chamber over the next few decades. For if South Dakotans in their wisdom deem it, Senator Daschle may continue to toil in this chamber for many years to come, and I look forward to working with him as he builds upon his achievements. So today, before the Senate adjourns this session, allow me to look ahead to the ninth of December and wish my friend Tom Daschle a very happy 50th birthday. 
To Tom personally, may I say:  
The hours are like a string of pearls, 
The days like diamonds rare, 
The moments are the threads of gold, 
That bind them for our wear, 
So may the years that come to you 
Such wealth and good contain 
That every moment, hour and day 
Be like a golden chain. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with others in complimenting the distinguished chairman, Mr. Thurmond, and ranking member, Mr. Levin, as well as Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. Cleland. 
Of the many duties that a United States Senator or a Member of the House of Representatives is called upon to perform, one of the most important involves expressing our views on whether U.S. armed forces should be put in harm's way in defense of our country's national interests. We must weigh whether the issue at hand merits risking the lives of our soldiers, sailors, and aviators. 
Members of our armed forces cannot individually decide whether they should place their lives at risk, for they are duty bound to follow the orders of their commanders, and ultimately, of the President. Every individual in our armed forces knows that he or she may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice for the nation. Every individual who takes the oath to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines, whether in the active forces, Reserves, or National Guard, does so knowing that they carry a special burden, and a unique responsibility, to defend our nation's interests, wherever and whenever they may be called upon to do so. 
As Senators, we must help to ensure that our armed forces are ready to perform this role. This includes raising and considering difficult questions, which are included in the conference report before us, related to force readiness and the procurement of weapons systems. These decisions involve billions of dollars and involve the employment of thousands of military and contractor personnel. The decisions made here affect all military personnel and a large segment of our economy, and I, for one, do not take them lightly. 
But of equal importance are questions concerning the morale of our troops. Weapons alone do not win wars. It is our troops on the ground, our sailors at sea, our aviators in the air, and all the personnel who support them behind the lines who must combine to triumph over our nation's enemies. And these forces can only fight together as a cohesive force if they are united by common goals, morale, and strategy. 
The morale of our forces is of particular importance, for troops who suffer from weakened morale must defeat not only the external enemy, but also deal with the internal divisions and problems of their own ranks, even while they fight the enemy. Our armed forces require strong leadership to deal with such problems, while providing a victorious strategy on the battlefield. 
Sadly, such leadership has been lacking in recent years, as is evidenced by the low morale particularly among the women in our armed forces. The women in our armed forces must endure a demoralizing and hostile environment while they attempt to carry out their duties. From the shocking behavior of Naval aviators at the `Tail Hook' conventions, to the alleged rape of recruits at Aberdeen, it has become clear that the women in our armed forces face sexual discrimination, harassment, assaults, and even rape, as they carry out their duties in defense of our nation. 
The recent report by the Secretary of the Army exposes the seriousness of the problem. The report states that `sexual harassment exists throughout the Army, crossing gender, rank, and racial lines . . .' Almost one quarter of the women reported that they had been sexually harassed in the last twelve months, based upon a random statistical survey conducted by the Army. A shocking 74 percent reported that they have endured crude or offensive behavior, 47 percent reported that they received unwanted sexual attention, 18 percent suffered from sexual coercion, and 8 percent said they had been sexually assaulted. While these statistics are appalling, the footnotes only add to the outrage. `Unwanted sexual attention'--which almost half of the women reported--is defined as `unwanted touching or fondling and asking for dates even when rebuffed.' And sexual coercion--which almost one quarter of the women endured--`includes classic quid pro quo instances of job benefits or losses conditioned on sexual cooperation.' 
The Army's report found that `this issue is one of which the Army has been long aware, and that to date, Army policies and processes implemented to combat and eradicate sexual harassment have had little, if any, impact. As one soldier noted, `Women have been reporting sexual harassment for five years, and the Army's just now looking into it.' Many soldiers believe that their complaints and concerns have been ignored and that only recent media attention has forced Army leaders to focus on this issue.' 
I would note that this in fact understates the intentional neglect on the part of the Army. It is not just that Army leaders ignored complaints of sexual harassment for a number of years. More shockingly, it is that it took the media and national public attention focused on the rape of female recruits to finally force the Army to seriously address the treatment of women in the ranks. 
There is an old adage that `the fish rots from the head down.' The report states that `leaders set the values compass for the Army; it is from them that respect and dignity flow. Many leaders are currently seen as practicing a zero defects mentality, caring only about themselves and their careers. Soldiers do not uniformly have trust and confidence in their leaders. Unfair treatment, double standards, and a lack of discipline were raised to Panel representatives time and again . . .' 
Within the Army, the policy has been to `talk the talk,' but not `walk the walk'. Even while the Army brass told the troops that the policy was one of `zero tolerance' for sexual discrimination, the officers and drill sergeants knew that this was rarely enforced in practice. The report notes that a policy of `zero tolerance' is enforced for racial discrimination, but not for sexual discrimination. 
The question for the Army is what can be done to correct the problems identified in the report. I must commend the Secretary of the Army for issuing a candid and brutally honest summary of the problem. The report also identifies a number of policies that must be changed or enforced in order to ensure that women receive equal and fair treatment in the Army. 
I must note, however, that the report is silent on the question of the desirability of gender integrated training. I offered an amendment during the Committee markup of this bill, which is included in this conference report, calling for the establishment of an independent outside review commission to examine the question of the appropriateness of gender integrated recruit training in the armed forces. My amendment also calls upon the Commission to review the rules of fraternization with the goal of recommending a single consistent standard for conduct among enlisted people, and between enlisted people and officers, which spans all the services. What is appropriate for a soldier in the Army should also be appropriate for a sailor or airman or marine. 
On the question of training, the Army report notes that `a key to addressing human relations issues, including sexual harassment, is assigning enough female role models to set the example for all trainees. Twenty percent of Army accessions are women, but the training base is composed of only ten percent female drill sergeants.' The report also states that `new recruits form and hold their most lasting impressions of the Army from the cadre they encounter during initial entry training.' 
These observations suggest that female recruits might benefit from gender segregated training, in which they would be guaranteed to receive training from women drill instructors and role models. 
The report of the Secretary of the Army is a good first step, in terms of identifying the scope of the problem, and offering possible solutions. The commission that will be created as a consequence of the enactment into law of this conference report will add yet another dimension to our understanding of the problem and possible solutions. 
`People are not in the Army, people are the Army,' stated General Creighton W. Abrams, former Army Chief of Staff. `By people, I do not mean personnel . . . I mean living, breathing, serving, human beings. They have needs and interests and desires. They have spirit and will, and strength and abilities. They have weaknesses and faults; and they have means. They are at the heart of our preparedness . . . and this preparedness . . : as a nation and as an Army--depends upon the spirit of our soldiers. It is the spirit that gives the Army . . . life. Without it we cannot succeed.' 
The report of the Secretary of the Army concludes that `if there is one overarching theme to this report, it is this: we must rededicate ourselves to the fundamental truths so eloquently stated by General Abrams . . . Personnel readiness relies on a positive human relations environment. It is the vital base upon which we build the Army, and the combat effectiveness of the Army's most important weapon system--the soldier.' 
Let us hope that the Army follows the recommendations included in this report, and for that matter, that its philosophy permeates the entire Pentagon and military establishment. We cannot relent in our examination of this problem; we must ensure that the leadership of our armed forces creates an environment of fairness for the women in the services. And we must not shirk from examining objectively every aspect of this issue, including some aspects that might be labeled `politically incorrect,' such as gender segregated training and coherent across-the-board fraternization policies. I am glad that the conferees had the courage to establish the commission, and I look forward to the report. 
I again compliment my chairman, Mr. Thurmond, and the ranking member, Mr. Levin. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have enjoyed listening to my friend, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, who knows this subject up and down, back and forward, around and around. I thank him for the contribution he has made to the debate. I wish he had another hour. 
Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion during the past several months about fast track. Sadly, little of that discussion has been enlightening or informative. The administration, which submitted the Export Expansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1997 in September, has apparently decided that misleading, exaggerated, and vacuous rhetoric is necessary if it is to win fast track renewal. Thus, the U.S. Trade Representative--for whom I have great respect--has described the President's fast track proposal to the Senate in the following terms: 
What is at stake in your consideration of this proposal is nothing less than whether the United States will continue to be at the forefront of nations seeking the reduction of trade barriers and the expansion of more open, equitable and reciprocal trading practices throughout the world. 
Let me say that again: 
What is at stake in your consideration [meaning the consideration by the Congress] of this proposal is nothing less than whether the United States will continue to be at the forefront of nations seeking the reduction of trade barriers and the expansion of more open, equitable and reciprocal trading practices throughout the world . . . . This is not the time to shrink from the future, but to seize the opportunities it holds. 
Let me assure you, Mr. President, that I am fully in favor of `seizing the future.' I, too, seek the reduction of trade barriers, and I long for `more open, equitable and reciprocal trading practices.' That is why I am firmly and implacably opposed to fast track. 
Mr. President, I did not come here today to add to the miasma of confusion that fast track supporters have created with their murky logic and overheated rhetoric. My purpose is to shed a little light, if I may, into the murk by exploring the institutional and practical problems that fast track presents. I believe that it is my duty toward my colleagues and my constituents to lay out in clear, simple and direct language the reasons for my opposition to fast track. 
I haven't been invited down to the White House. I presume that my good friend from South Carolina has not had an invitation down there.

Mr. BYRD. I haven't been invited down. I am not looking for an invitation. I do not expect any invitation to change my mind. I have had the master of arm twisters ahold of my arm, Lyndon B. Johnson. He was the master arm twister. But I said no to him. 
When my first grandchild was born I gave to my daughter, the mother of that grandchild, a Bible. In that Bible I wrote these words: `Teach him to say no.' That's all I wrote, `Teach him to say no.' 
Mr. President, it doesn't make any difference if you have a vocabulary of 60,000 or 600,000 words. If you can't say no, then all these other words at some point or another in your lifetime are going to find you sadly lacking--if you can't say no. I am telling this story in my autobiography, of how I said no to Lyndon B. Johnson on more than one occasion. It was hard to do, because he put me on the Appropriations Committee when I first came here. And I felt as though I had been put through a wringer after going through a 30-minute skirmish with Lyndon Johnson but still saying, `No. No, Mr. President.' 
So, I haven't been invited down to the White House. But I can still say no and would be glad to. 
So, if the President wants to hear me say no, all he has to do is call me on this. He doesn't have to invite me down to the White House. I'll bet the Senator from South Carolina won't get any invitation either.

Mr. BYRD. I don't blame those who accept the invitation. I assume some of them will say no likewise. 
I don't expect to convince my colleagues, all of them or maybe any of them. But I do hope to lay the groundwork for the healthy, open and honest debate about fast track that this Chamber and this country sorely need. 
So let me start by making clear that Congress has and must continue to have a central role in regulating trade with foreign countries. The Constitution--here it is, right out of my shirt pocket. Here is the anchor of my liberties, the Constitution. Let's see what it says. 
Article I, section 8 assigns to the Congress the power `to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes,' assigns the power `to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,' and to `lay and collect * * * Duties, Imposts, and Excises.' Pursuant to this authority, Congress may, for example, impose tariffs, authorize reciprocal trade agreements, grant or deny most-favored-nation status, and regulate international communication. All this Congress can and must do according to the Constitution of the United States. 
Nor is this the extent of Congress' involvement in matters of foreign trade. It scarcely needs to be pointed out that Congress' central function--Congress' central function as laid out in the first section of the first article of the Constitution, the very first sentence--its 
central function is to make the laws of the land. This means that any trade agreements that are not self-executing, meaning that they require changes in domestic law, can only take effect if and when Congress passes implementing legislation codifying those changes. 
So it should be clear from the Constitution that the framers assigned Congress broad authority over foreign trade agreements. Even Alexander Hamilton, who so often championed the President's supremacy in foreign affairs, acknowledged in the Federalist Papers that Congress' authority to regulate foreign commerce was essential to prevent the President from becoming as powerful as the King of Great Britain. 
Given the President's responsibilities in conducting relations with foreign powers, Hamilton argued that Congress' regulation of foreign trade was a vital check upon Executive power. But look what we are doing, look what we are about to do. We are, through fast track, just as we did with the line-item veto, handing off the few powers that we have to check the Executive. Let me say that again. 
We are, through fast track, just as we did with the line-item veto, handing off the few powers that we have to check the Executive. We are making a king. He already has his castle with his concrete moat. I can see it out there. The Senator from Delaware can see it. Here he has this concrete moat out there, and with the king's guard standing watch in dark glasses--you know how they wear those dark glasses--with ears glued to wrist radios, and little implements on their lapels, he has his own private coach, his own chef and royal tasters, his retinue of fancy-titled king's men. You read `All the King's Men'? 
So what are we waiting for? What are we waiting for? Just call in the jeweler, contact the goldsmith, let's make the crown; let's make the crown. Crown him king. That is the road on which we are traveling. 
We gave away the line-item veto. The Roman Senate did the same. It gave away the power of the purse, and when the Roman Senate gave away the power of the purse, it gave away its check against the executive. So Sulla became dictator in 82 B.C. He was dictator from 82 to 80 B.C., and then a little later, the Senate--it wasn't under pressure to do it--voluntarily ceded the power over the purse to Caesar and made him dictator for a year. That was in 49 B.C. 
Then in 48 B.C., it made him dictator again. And in 46 B.C., it made him dictator for 10 years, just as we are going to do with fast track now for 5 years. We don't do it a year at a time. The Roman Senate made Caesar dictator for 10 years. That was in 46 B.C. But the very next year, in 425 B.C., it made him dictator for life. 
I don't know when we will reach that point, but we have already ceded to this President great power over the purse. It has never before been done in the more than 200 years of American history. It was never given to any President, the power over the purse. Now we are going to give the President fast track. So we are just waiting, just waiting for the jeweler! We are on the point of contacting the goldsmith! Let's now make the crown! 
From 1789 to 1974, Congress faithfully fulfilled Hamilton's dictate, and the dictate of the Constitution that it regulate foreign trade. During those years, Congress showed that it was willing and able to supervise commerce with other countries. Congress also proved that it understood when changing circumstances required it to delegate or refine portions of its regulatory power over trade. For example, starting with the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Act, as trade negotiations became increasingly frequent, Congress authorized the President to modify tariffs and duties during his negotiations with foreign powers. Such proclamation authority has been renewed at regular intervals, most recently in the 1994 GATT Reciprocal Trade Act, which I voted against. 
I mentioned that Congress fulfilled its obligation to regulate foreign trade from 1789 to 1974. Well, what, you may wonder, happened in 1974? 
Mr. President, it was in 1974 that Congress first approved a fast-track mechanism to allow for expedited consideration in Congress of trade agreements negotiated by the President. Fast track set out limits on how Congress would consider trade agreements by banning amendments, limiting debate and all but eliminating committee involvement. 
So we relegated ourselves to a thumbs-up or thumbs-down role. Thumbs up, thumbs down. Under fast track, Congress agreed to tie its hands and to gag itself when the President sends up a trade agreement for our consideration. 
Why on Earth, you might ask, would Congress agree to such a thing? What would convince Members of Congress to willingly relinquish a portion of Congress' constitutional power over foreign commerce? What were Members thinking when they agreed to limits on the democratic processes by which laws are made? And why, if extensive debate and the freedom to offer amendments are essential to all of the areas of lawmaking, would Congress decide that when it comes to foreign trade, we can do without such fundamental legislative procedures? 
Mr. President, the answers to these questions are straightforward. When Congress established fast track in 1974, it did so at a time when international commercial agreements were narrowly--narrowly--limited to trade. Consider the first two instances in which fast track was employed. 
The first was for the 1979 GATT Tokyo Round Agreement. The implementing bill that resulted dealt almost exclusively with tariff issues and required few changes in U.S. law. 
The second use of fast track was for the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement of 1985. The implementing language for that agreement was all of 4 pages--all of 4 pages--and it dealt only with tariffs and rules on Government procurement. 
If its first two uses were relatively innocuous, starting with its third use, fast track began to change and to develop an evil twin. I refer to the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement which, despite its title, extended well beyond trade issues to address farming, banking, food inspection and other domestic matters. One has only to see the size of the agreement's implementing bill, covering over 100 pages now, to see how different this was from the first two agreements approved under the fast-track mechanism. 
By the time of the NAFTA agreement in 1993 and the GATT Uruguay Round of 1994, the insidious nature of fast track was becoming apparent for all to see. 
NAFTA required substantial changes in U.S. law, addressing everything from local banking rules to telecommunications law to regulations regarding the weight and length of American trucks. And these changes were bundled aboard a hefty bill numbering over 1,000 pages and propelled down the fast track before many Members of Congress knew what was going on. 
I doubt that many of my colleagues realized the extent to which, first, NAFTA and then GATT would alter purely domestic law. 
Most of us thought of GATT as related to trade and foreign relations, but through the magic mechanism of the fast-track wand--presto--trade legislation became a vehicle for sweeping changes in domestic law. 
So what had happened? What had happened? Mr. President, Socrates, in his Apology to the judges said `Petrifaction is of two sorts. There is a petrifaction of the understanding, and there is also a petrifaction of the sense of shame.' I fear that with respect to the Constitution, there is not only a petrifaction of our understanding of that document, but there is also a petrifaction of reverence for the document, and a petrifaction of our sense of duty toward that organic law. So petrifaction has set in. 
Mention the Constitution to Members: `When did you last read it? What did you mean when you swore that you would support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic? What did you have in mind? Did you have in mind some foreign invader that was about to set foot on American soil? Was that it? Or did you think about emasculating the Constitution by passing line-item veto legislation or by passing fast track?" 
Has a petrifaction of our sense of duty to the Constitution set in? Has a petrifaction of our understanding of the Constitution set in? Has a petrifaction of our caring about the Constitution taken over? 
Well, fast track served to bind and gag the Senate, preventing much needed debate and precluding the possibility of correcting amendments. Think about that. We give up our right to amend. And the result, as many observers today would agree, is hardly a triumph for free trade or American workers. 
How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, it was our first and, in my opinion, greatest President, George Washington, who analogized the Senate to a saucer, we are told, into which we pour legislation so as to cool it. Washington foresaw that a country as young, as aggressive and at times as impatient as ours needed some institutional curb to prevent it from rashly throwing itself into action without sufficient reflection. 
Indeed, Mr. President, the Senate has more than once lived up to this role by providing a forum where cool minds and level intellects prevailed. 
Alas, the Senate did not fulfill this role when NAFTA and GATT came along. And the fault lies with the adoption of the artificial and unwise procedure now known as fast track--fast track. That is what the administration is telling Members of Congress we have to have. Instead of scrutinizing these proposals closely, instead of engaging in prolonged and incisive debate, we were forced to play our parts in ill-considered haste. Rather than patiently and thoughtfully evaluating the pros and cons--what did we do?--we buckled--buckled--in the face of administration pressure. 
And that is what we will do again. That is what we will do again. We are not going to think about the Constitution. How many of us cared a whit about what the Constitution said? 
Rather than pouring over the trade agreements, we peered at them from afar like tourists gawking at a distant and rapid train thundering down a very fast and very slick track indeed. 
The GATT and NAFTA experiences suggest that fast track--like the fast lane--can be risky business for U.S. trade policy. Fast track was Congress' response to a time when trade agreements were just that--trade agreements, agreements on trade and trade alone. 
Now that time has passed--it is gone--as huge, sprawling agreements like GATT and NAFTA propose changes in trade policy whose ramifications spill outwards into all aspects of domestic law and policy. Now what is our duty? What is our duty? Where does our duty lie? 
It is time that we in Congress wake up and resume a more traditional role of treating trade agreements with the care and the attention that they deserve and the care and attention that the Constitution requires that we give them. 
Now, Mr. President, I have tried to shine a few rays of truth through the murky rhetoric that surrounds this contentious issue. I have patiently laid out the history of foreign trade regulations in order to emphasize the important role that tradition and the Constitution assigned to Congress and to show how fast track has impeded our recent efforts to fulfill that role. But I would be remiss in my duties if I did not take the time to address some of the supposedly compelling justifications that fast track supporters have advanced. 
So let me start with the first myth--the first myth--of fast track, which posits that no country will negotiate with the United States unless the administration has fast track in place. How laughable, how preposterous. 
In the President's words: 
Our trading partners will only negotiate with one America--not first with an American President and next with an American Congress. 
Well, what did the framers say about that? What did the framers say about that? They said that Congress shall regulate, have the power to regulate foreign commerce. The Constitution placed the duty upon us 100 Senators and upon the other 1,743 Members of this body who have walked across this stage in the more than 200 years. So we 100 need to remember that this document--this document--places the responsibility on us. 
Do not be blinded by the glittering gewgaws in the form of words that come from the White House. Do not let a call from the President of the United States, his `Eminence,' as John Adams wanted to refer to the President, do not let a call or a handshake or a look in the eye from the chief executive, awe one--he puts his britches on just like I do, one leg at a time. And when he nicks himself with a razor, he bleeds just like I do. 
So the President said: 
Our trading partners will only negotiate with one American--not first with an American President and next with an American Congress. 
What does the Constitution say? 
As I suggested earlier, the absence of fast track in the years before 1974 did not seem to discourage nations from negotiating trade agreements with the United States. Moreover, even since 1974, fast track has been used so infrequently that it can scarcely be said to have affected prospective trade partners. 
Listening to the administration might lead one to conclude that every trade agreement since 1974 could not have been concluded--just could not have been concluded--without fast track. To hear them tell it down on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the western end, where the Sun rises--but not according to this, not according to this Constitution. The Sun does not rise in the west. 
But listening to the administration might lead one to conclude that every trade agreement since 1974 simply could not have been concluded without fast track. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. Of the hundreds and hundreds of trade agreements that we have entered into over the past 23 years, only--only--the five that I mentioned earlier have used fast track. 
`What? Are you out of your head?' Only the five that I mentioned earlier have used fast track? That is right. 
Fast track has been used on a grand total of five occasions. Indeed, the current administration alone has entered into some 200 trade agreements without the benefit of fast track. 
Mr. President, the divine Circe was an enchantress. And Homer tells us that Odysseus was urged by Circe to stay away from the sirens' isle. `Don't go near it,' the sirens' isle, with their melodious voices that came from lips as sweet as honey. `Odysseus alone must hear them. Don't let your companions hear them.' So plugging his companions' ears with wax, Odysseus ordered his companions to bind him to the mast of the ship with ropes, and that if he should ask them to untie him and let him go, to bind him even tighter. 
And so they bound him, hand and foot, with ropes to the mast of the ship. And he instructed them to disregard his order. `Don't follow my orders,' he said. `Tie them tighter than ever,' until they were a long way past the sirens' isle. 
That is what we have been hearing--these voices, the sirens. They come out of the west, down where the Sun rises at the western end of Pennsylvania Avenue. That is where the Sun rises, believe it or not, in the west. 
I say to my colleagues, plug your ears with wax if you are invited down to the White House. Plug your ears with wax or, better still, find somewhere else to go. Just do not go. Do not go down there. Tie yourselves with ropes to the columns of the Capitol. Do not go down there in the land of the rising sun, the western end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Do not go. But if you do go, plug your ears with wax, lest you fall victim to the blandishments of the sirens. 
Mr. President, I sincerely doubt that any country will hesitate to negotiate trade agreements with the dominant economic and political power of our time out of concern that that country's legislative procedures will impede a proper agreement. So do not listen to that argument. Do not listen to the argument of the administration when they say, if they do not have a fast-track agreement other countries simply will not negotiate with us. 
No country--no country--in my judgment, will hesitate to negotiate trade agreements with this country, the dominant economic and political power of the age out of concern that this country's legislative procedures will impede a proper agreement. 
If any country does entertain such concerns, then I suspect that the fault lies with the administration, whose alarmist statements and doom-laden prophecies have doubtless misled many foreign and domestic observers into thinking that fast track is the only key to open trade. The administration's Chicken Little impersonation has succeeded in whipping up false fears and phony worries that never existed before. One has only to ignore this rhetoric and look at the administration's actual trade record to see that the sky, far from falling, is still solidly secured to the heavens. 
Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
The record speaks for itself: Over 200 trade agreements entered into without fast track--and I am talking about the record which speaks for itself. The administration's actual trade record, over 200 trade agreements entered into without fast track versus 2 trade agreements entered into with fast track--200 without fast track, 2 with fast track. I might add that the latter 2 agreements have probably generated more controversy than the other 200 combined. I suspect that many of my colleagues rue the day that they allowed the administration to speed GATT and NAFTA through Congress. 
The other great myth of fast track is that the possibility of Congress' amending trade agreements will seriously hamper future negotiations. Lest I be accused of distorting the administration's position, let me quote the President's words on trade negotiations verbatim. 
. . . I cannot fully succeed without the Congress at my side. We must work in partnership, together with the American people, in securing our country's future. The United States must be united when we sit down at the negotiating table. 
Mr. President, I fully agree with the notion of a partnership between the executive and legislative branches, and I assure you that I will work with this President and with future Presidents to ensure our mutual trade objectives. But I will not accept the argument that America's trade interests are best served by Congress taking a walk, abdicating its responsibility to consider, abdicating its responsibility to debate, abdicating its responsibility to amend, if necessary, trade proposals. 
Now, the Constitution gives this Senate the right to amend and we ought not give away that right. We ought not to agree to anything less than that. This Constitution says that when it comes to raising money, those measures shall originate in the other body but that the Senate may amend as on all other bills. So there you are. The Constitution recognizes the right of the Senate to amend. The Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills. There it is. That is the Constitution. 
So Congress ought not take a walk. Congress ought not abdicate its responsibility to consider, debate, and, if necessary, to amend trade proposals. 
The President asked that we trust him alone to make trade decisions. Now, I like the President and I respect the President, but our political system was not built on trust. The Constitution did not say `trust in the President of the United States with all thy heart, with all thy mind, and with all thy soul.' Our political system was built on checks and balances, on separation of powers, on each branch of Government looking carefully and meticulously over the other branch's shoulder. That is how much trust the system has built into it. 
Our Constitution's Framers realized that the surest way of preventing tyranny and achieving enlightened rule was to divide power among distinct coordinate branches of Government. As Madison famously observed, men are not angels. Accordingly, the Framers devised a `policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives' in which `the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices of Government in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other.' 
Mr. President, that was a good reply that Diogenes made to a man who asked him for letters of recommendation. `That you are a man, he will know when he sees you. Whether you are a good man or a bad one he will know, if he has any skill in discerning the good and the bad. But if he has no such skill, he will never know though I write to him 1,000 times.' 
`It is as though a piece of silver money desired someone to recommend it to be tested. If the man be a good judge of silver, he will know. The coin,' said Diogenes, `will tell its own tale.' And so will the Constitution, Mr. President. It needs no letters of recommendation. 
The President asks for a `partnership' with Congress. He asks the country to be united at the negotiating table. But I'm afraid that what he really wants is an unequal partnership in which the administration sits at the negotiating table and Congress sits quietly and subserviently at his feet while he negotiates. Congress sits subserviently. 
Mr. President, I have a different view of the partnership between the President, any President, and Congress, a view that is rooted in the Congress and in the institutional traditions of this country. I see a partnership in which the executive fulfills its role at the negotiating table and Congress makes sure that the product of such negotiations serves the national interest, not just the interests of a party but the national interest. I don't believe that either branch has a monopoly on wisdom or a monopoly on patriotism or a monopoly on savvy. That is why I believe that each can improve the other's actions. I have no doubt that Congress, after careful scrutiny, will continue to approve agreements that truly improve trade and open markets. 
Now, I'm not interested in looking at the duties on every little fiddle string or corkscrew that is brought into this country, but they are overweighing policy matters that Congress ought to be interested in and acted about, and it may be that Congress should offer an amendment in one way or another. 
Congress must be free to correct possible mistakes or sloppiness or oversight in the negotiating process that would harm this country's interests and impede truly free trade. Congress knows full well that any amendments it may offer could unravel a freshly negotiated agreement. It knows that amendments should not be freely offered and adopted promiscuously, haphazardly, but should rather be seen as a last resort to remedy serious deficiencies in an agreement. I see no reason, however, why a legislative procedure that is considered essential in all other policy debates should not be used in debating trade agreements. 
We amend bills, we amend resolutions on various and sundry subjects, we amend legislation that raises revenues, we amend bills that make appropriations and public moneys. Why, then, if that legislative procedure is essential in all other debates, why should it not be used in debating trade agreements? 
Mr. President, I recognize the importance of opening markets and removing trade barriers. I also appreciate the tremendous difficulty, the tremendous difficulty of negotiating trade agreements that benefit all sectors of our society. 
Mr. President, I cannot support fast track. I cannot support surrendering the rights and prerogatives and duties and responsibilities of this body under the Constitution to any President. I cannot support fast track. To do so would prevent me from subjecting future trade agreements to the close scrutiny that they deserve on behalf of the people of this Nation. I can and will strive to exercise my limited powers in pursuit of freer, more open trade which serves the interests of everyone in this Nation. But I cannot, in good conscience, allow fast track to strip me and my constituents of our constitutional prerogatives and strip this branch of its rightful role in regulating foreign commerce. 
I can't do that for any President. 
Mr. President, on December 5, 63 B.C. the Roman Senate sat to debate and to decide the fate of five accomplices of Catiline. Silaneus proposed the death penalty. Julius Caesar, when he was called upon, proposed that the death penalty not be applied, but that the five accomplices of Catiline be scattered in various towns, that their properties be confiscated, and that their trials await another day. 
Cato the Younger was then called upon and asked for his opinion. He said to his fellow Senators, `Do not believe that it was by force of arms alone that your ancestors lifted the state from its small beginnings and made it a great Republic. It was something quite different that made them great, something that we are entirely lacking. They were hard workers at home. They were just rulers abroad. And they brought to the Senate untrammeled minds, not enslaved by passions.' 
And I say to my colleagues, on this question, we should come to the Senate with untrammeled minds, not enslaved by passions--partisan, political, or otherwise, keeping uppermost in our minds our duties and responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States. That is the mast to which we should tie ourselves--the Constitution. 
I close with these final words by Cato: `We have lost those virtues,' he said--speaking of the virtues of their ancestors--`we pile up riches for ourselves while the state is bankrupt. We sing the praises of prosperity and idle away our lives, good men or bad; it is all one. All the prizes that merit ought to win are carried off by ambitious intriguers, and no wonder each one of you schemes only for himself, when in your private lives you are slaves to pleasure. And here in the Senate the tools of money or influence.' 
Those are Cato's words, and his words are just as fitting today and on this question. Cato said, `The result is that when an assault is made upon the republic, there is no one here to defend it.' 
Mr. President, how true are Cato's words today! I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to proceed. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

And he said that up until the early part of the 1980's our country was a creditor Nation, the foremost creditor Nation on Earth. And that during the 1980's it became a debtor Nation, to the tune of $1 trillion.

It is amazing, when one contemplates that, if one were to count a trillion dollars at the rate of $1 per second, it would require 32,000 years to count a trillion dollars. It is pretty amazing. The Senator and his charts point to the road that we are traveling. I thank the Senator for his fine statement. He has been a student of this matter for many years and on his committee, the Joint Economic Committee, I believe it is, he has accumulated a tremendous amount of knowledge in this respect. I thank him for his presentation. I hope that Senators who are not here will take the time to read it in tomorrow's Record. 
I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to speak this morning on the subject: the `fairy tales of fast track: the myth of trade negotiations paralysis.' 
It has been said that if one wants a lie to stick, just keep repeating it, keep shouting it, until it just seems to become a reality. On the matter of fast-track procedures for congressional handling of trade agreements, we have a whopper being shouted from the housetops in congressional testimony and on the op-ed pages of our leading newspapers by people who surely ought to know better. An example of what I am talking about appears in the Washington Post today, authored by our esteemed former colleague and former Senate Republican leader, Mr. Bob Dole, who engages in vacuous, vapid vaporings in insisting that other nations will not play ball with us on trade if they think Congress is going to take a close look at what is negotiated, and, Heaven forbid, even have an opportunity to consider amendments to trade agreements negotiated by the administration. 
Here is what Mr. Dole says, in part:  
The fate of fast-track legislation this fall may determine whether the President ever will negotiate another trade agreement. 
Let us take a look again at that profound statement by Mr. Dole: 
The fate of fast-track legislation this fall may determine whether the President ever will negotiate another trade agreement. 
Now, there is an assertion. One might get the idea that fast-track consideration of trade agreements is normal practice, and that it is the normal practice in considering trade agreements, Mr. President. But, fast-track consideration of trade agreements is as rare as hen's teeth. It has been done all of only five times since the first very limited fast-track authority was granted by the Congress in 1974. So, in nearly a quarter of a century, we have used fast-track consideration all of five times on this floor. 
Can anyone guess how many trade agreements have been negotiated in that quarter of a century? The answer is, of course, hundreds--hundreds. We have had fast track on this Senate floor five times in a little over 23 years, but in the meantime, hundreds of trade agreements have been negotiated. And the Clinton administration, as a matter of fact, is quite fond of boasting of its record of entering into some 200 trade agreements, none of them subject to fast track except the GATT and NAFTA trade pacts. 
The other clarion call that we hear repeatedly from the administration, repeated by Mr. Dole again this morning, is the issue of American leadership. The United States must lead in the global economy and if Congress wants to review and possibly amend trade agreements, that's the end of that. 
Here is what Mr. Dole says: 
Global trade is inevitable, and Presidential fast-track authority is indispensable if America is to lead the community of nations into the next century. 
Another quite profound statement; and mind-boggling, indeed. I would suspect that we are going to be talking about American leadership a lot this week, as the Senate reviews the need for fast-track authority that has been requested by the administration. 
If a trade agreement is soundly negotiated and if it would be clearly beneficial to America, I think it is a pretty fair guess that the Senate will approve it without any amendment; without even the threat of an amendment. But the threat of amendments should prove valuable as additional leverage for administration negotiators on trade matters. Some of these negotiations are pretty tough, and I should think that the Senate's careful role in reviewing the product can be used to advantage. I do not think it hurts American leadership for our trading partners--some of whom are trading adversaries when they do not implement in good faith the agreements they sign with us and continue to restrict access to their markets for American goods--to know that the U.S. Senate is looking over their shoulders. It could be useful bargaining leverage, and if I were negotiating an agreement I certainly think it would be advantageous to have the weight of future Senate scrutiny to dangle over the head of a tough bargainer on the other side of the table. 
The third point that our good friend Mr. Dole makes is that somehow our trade negotiators are cooling their heels and waiting for the Senate to give assured protection to their products before beginning their negotiations. Mr. Dole says: 
Some may ask why it matters whether other countries beat us in securing trade pacts with developing nations. What are we waiting for? 
Now, there is a profound question: What are we waiting for? Mr. Dole suggests that the Senate is holding up negotiations. And nothing could be further from the truth. The administration already has authority given to it in law to negotiate trade pacts. This negotiating authority was most recently provided by the Congress in the 1994 GATT agreement, or Uruguay round, and it is good into the next century. 
I do not notice any crippling of the administration's negotiating authority or of its ability to successfully conclude trade agreements without the use of fast track. At the moment, the United States has been negotiating a so-called multilateral agreement on investment, MAI, for 2 years, which is now 90 percent or more complete, with strong American leadership and without the assurance of fast-track legislation. It is unclear whether the administration intends to try to get this agreement approved by the Congress under new fast-track approval legislation. Nevertheless, this immensely complicated and very important multilateral agreement has been negotiated without the benefit--without the benefit of a promise of the Senate's pulling a black bag of no amendment guarantees over its head. 
I think we need an analysis of all the trade agreements concluded by the administration. Let's take a look at the 
scorecard. Let's see if Mr. Dole is right that without the Senate's passing the new Export Expansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1997, all is lost--all is lost. Let's try to determine if the Founding Fathers were completely off the mark when they gave to the Congress authority over the regulation of commerce with foreign nations in article I, section 8--article I, section 8, of the Constitution, dealing with the powers of the Congress. The Founding Fathers did not want the President to have this authority, because our Founding Fathers' memories were not short indeed and the Founding Fathers were not at all enamored with the idea of a President of the United States gathering authority unto himself like they had experienced with King George III of England. So this exclusive power was not centered on the legislative branch by whim or by fancy. There were weighty considerations of a system founded on carefully balanced powers. 
Therefore, let's not get stampeded by all the alarm bells, all of the Roman candles, all of the fire crackers of lost American leadership, of preposterous assertions about the behavior of our trading partners if we don't steer our constitutional system further in the direction of executive power. The scaremongers say that the Sun rises in the west. I don't believe it. I don't believe the Sun rises at the western end of Constitution Avenue. If it does, that's a very recent phenomenon. 
If our trading partners truly want to make market arrangements for new flows of goods and services with the United States, we certainly have learned that they will do so, even in the reality of scrutiny of the Congress over those deals. That has not stopped any country or group of countries from negotiating with us to date. So why should it happen now? Let us not shortchange ourselves. Don't belittle ourselves. Let's not lose confidence in ourselves. This is America, the engine of world growth; the largest market, the most coveted market in the world! It is embarrassing and it is wrong to say that the role of the Congress is standing in the way of success, damaging to our world leadership, or an obstacle to getting good agreements. And it is absolutely preposterous to maintain that other nations will not negotiate with us if we follow our constitutional system. 
If trade agreements are in the national interests of other nations, they will be at the table. They will be at the table, in my judgment, Congress or no Congress. Now, when was the last time that Congress rejected a trade agreement or emasculated it beyond further international consideration? These arguments put forth by the administration, and dutifully repeated--dutifully repeated by our distinguished former Republican leader, are just a pretext for not going through the rigors of defending such agreements, and all parts thereof, before the elected representatives of the people who are going to be subjected to them, certainly affected by them, and who will perhaps pay for them. 
I hope that the Senate will have an informed, lengthy, robust debate on trade this week. It is high time that the Senate talked about such agreements; high time that the Senate talked about the trade deficits that we are experiencing. 
My distinguished and informed and most learned colleague, Byron Dorgan, has been talking about this from time to time over the long weeks and months. I have seen him bring charts into the Chamber. I have heard him discuss the shortsightedness of our negotiators and how we continually let ourselves be taken to the cleaners in trade negotiations. 
So I hope that we will have a good debate on trade this week because, as I say, it's high time that the Senate talked about the trade deficits we are experiencing, about the barriers that exist for access to foreign markets and about the real advantages and disadvantages of trade for our economy. 
Mr. President, so much for the vacuous, vapid vaporings of those who would have us steer away from the constitutional authority of the Congress and go down that road that we have been traveling on for so long--of taking a beating in trade negotiations.

Do we want to bind and gag ourselves and not be able to speak for our constituents and speak for our country? Do we want to illuminate the listening public as to what is really going on here? Is that what we are talking about? Fast track means we will hear nothing, say nothing, see nothing, right? We will offer no amendments. We can't do that on behalf of our constituents in the next 5 years; is that right? Am I right?

We are being asked to give up the people's power under the Constitution to legislate, to amend, and to debate.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier this week, Senators received a `Dear Colleague' letter and accompanying material from my friends and colleagues, Senators Chafee and Domenici. This letter included several representations regarding the substance and effect of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment in comparison to that of the Chafee-Domenici amendment to S. 1173, the ISTEA reauthorization bill. 
I have already addressed a number of these issues on the floor over the last two days. However, I thought it would be valuable for Senators to review a memorandum that evaluates in detail the representations made by Senators Chafee and Domenici in their `Dear Colleague' letter. This analysis was prepared by Dr. William Buechner, Director of Economics and Research at the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.

Mr. BYRD. While the distinguished Senator from Virginia is on the floor, I disagree with the Senator in suggesting that we all ought to enter into some kind of an agreement with the White House as to what the criteria ought to be in applying the line-item veto. I think if we do that, we are further legitimizing what is an illegitimate end run around the Constitution. I'm not for entering into such agreements concerning criteria. 
While I have the floor, I am not supporting this measure because it has an item in it that was wrongfully vetoed by the President and because that item is now included in this resolution. I'm supporting it because I think the administration was arbitrary and capricious in exercising the line-item veto in the way it used it. That is why I have said that Senators can vote for this resolution even though they support the line-item veto. A vote for this resolution doesn't mean they support the line-item veto, nor does it mean they are against the line-item veto. 
It says that Senators believe that the administration, in applying the line-item veto, acted capriciously, acted arbitrarily, acted without justification, acted without a credible basis. That is what Senators are voting on. That is why I hope they will all vote for the resolution. 
May I say to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, don't count me in when it comes to helping the administration to establish criteria by which it will apply this infernal, nefarious line-item veto.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am not willing to assume that the President has a monopoly on wisdom. I have represented the people of West Virginia now for 51 years in one office or another. I think I have a pretty good idea of what they need, what they want, and so on. 
But in this particular instance, the item that was vetoed for West Virginia was on the Department of Defense's 5-year plan. 
He vetoed the item that would have been in West Virginia, and I say, let's give it right back to him by his own criteria. He made a mistake in vetoing it. I say let's put it right back on the President's desk, let him exercise his constitutional veto, and then let the Congress exercise its constitutional option of either overriding that veto or sustaining it. 
I have sat right here and listened to three former Governors talk about the line-item veto. What is beyond my comprehension is how Senators can confuse the so-called line-item veto at the State level with the line-item veto at the Federal level. They are two different spheres of action. The distinguished Senator from Florida, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, all three of whom are former Governors, came from States that have the line-item veto. Well, so what? As Governors, they were acting under the constitutions of the State of Virginia, the State of Florida, and the State of Arkansas. But now they are operating under the aegis of the United States Constitution. They are two different things. I don't find the constitution of the State of Virginia written into the U.S. Constitution. I don't find the constitution of the State of Florida written into the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution refers to legislative powers `vested in a Congress of the United States.'

Mr. BYRD. We are talking about two different powers. We are talking about the powers that the 47 Governors have, dealing with the so-called line-item veto. Those are powers under their State constitutions. But the Senator from Virginia is no longer a Governor; he is a Senator. The Senator from Florida is not a Governor any longer, and he is not to be governed in his actions here by the constitution of the State of Florida; he is to be governed here by the oath he took to support and defend the U.S. Constitution--not the constitution of the State of West Virginia, not the constitution of the State of Virginia, but the United States Constitution. That is the Constitution by which we are governed here. 
The line of demarcation, the line of separation of powers, the line of checks and balances is more strictly delineated at the Federal level. It is more strictly drawn, more finely drawn at the Federal level than it is at the State level.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't intend to protract the debate. But I agree that if this is going to be done, if we are going to have the line-item veto, let it be done the way the framers provided that it be done; namely, through an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, not by statute. I don't think we can do it 
by law. I do hope that the High Court of the United States will uphold the contention that I am making and will strike this infernal and nefarious law dead, dead, dead!

In the statement of administration policy, we are told, and I quote, `The administration strongly opposes this disapproval bill.' 
Well, if I understand it, the administration is willing to work with the Congress in restoring half of these items; half of the items. I cannot understand how it can disapprove the bill when it is willing to restore half of the items that are in the disapproval bill. 
Also, the statement of administration policy that comes from the Office of Management and Budget says, `The President's action saves $287 million in budget authority in 1998.' 
In the very next sentence, it says, `* * * we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of the data provided by the Department of Defense that was out of date.' 
How much is the President's action really saving? He claims to save $287 million by virtue of the exercise of the line-item veto. But he follows in the next sentence, and says, `* * * we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding * * *' 
How much really can the administration claim to have saved?

Mr. President, Cato, the Elder, lived between the years 234 B.C. and 149 B.C. He was a great Roman statesman, and he once went to Carthage and viewed the operations of the Carthaginians and saw the progress they were making in building a prosperous regime and one that had considerable warmaking power. Cato brought back to the Roman Senate some figs that had grown in Carthage just to demonstrate the fact that Carthage was `not very far away, gentlemen. This is a country you had better keep your eye on. You had better watch these people. They are growing stronger every day and they don't live very far away, as evidenced by these fresh figs from Carthage.' 
And, indeed, that great statesman, Cato, the Elder, henceforth closed every speech, every communication, every letter, with the words, `Carthage must be destroyed!' I shall close this speech now and perhaps some future ones with the words, `The line-item veto must be repealed!' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Don C. Womack, who served as superintendent of the U.S. Senate Press Gallery from 1973 to 1981, died of cancer Thursday morning at his home in Arlington at the age of 87. 
Don was born in Danville, Virginia August 22, 1910. He moved to the Washington Area in 1935, and attended the Corcoran School of Art and George Washington University. He managed a string of movie theaters in Northern Virginia before taking a job as staff assistant in the House of Representatives Periodical Press Gallery in 1948, beginning a 33-year career as a press liaison on Capitol Hill. 
Don began working in the Senate Press Gallery in 1951. He briefly left to serve as superintendent of the House Periodical Gallery in 1954 and 1955, then returned to the Senate to be deputy superintendent, and continued in that capacity until his promotion in 1973. 
Don became superintendent of the Senate gallery during a tumultuous time--the beginning of the Watergate hearings. He weathered the storm, and received a commendation from the Standing Committee of Correspondents, the governing body of the Congressional press galleries, for his handling of the hearings. 
During his tenure as superintendent, Don presided over press coverage of the Senate during such major events as the end of the Vietnam War, the Panama Canal Treaties debates, and the ABSCAM hearings. He assisted with media arrangements for the Republican and Democratic Conventions and the Presidential Inaugurals from 1948 to 1988. He was a tremendous help to Senators, staff members and the members of the press.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, some days ago, the two distinguished Senators, Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici, offered an amendment which they proposed to call up at some point during the debate on the highway bill. There has been no floor discussion of that amendment. I have seen and read various things that are being written about the amendment and in criticism of the amendment which Senators Gramm, Baucus, Warner and I have offered for printing. My colleagues and I had offered an amendment several days ago and indicated we were offering it for printing, and that we intended to call it up at such time as the amendment tree was dismantled, and we would have an opportunity to call up the amendment. 
There have been some discussions of our amendment, but I think it is appropriate to talk about the amendment now that has been offered, I assume, as an alternative to our amendment. I don't know what the prognosis of this bill is--whether it will be taken down and no action taken on extending the highway bill, or whether there will be a 6-month extension, or whether there will be a 6-year bill. I should think that the chances for the latter are diminishing with every passing minute. 
In any event, it seems to me that there ought to be some discussion about the Chafee-Domenici amendment. I have spoken to Mr. Chafee a number of times about the amendment and have indicated to him that I thought we ought to have some discussion of it so that certain questions might be clarified. I personally have a few things to say about the amendment. I think the public is entitled to some enlightenment as to what it does and what it does not do. So that is the reason why I have chosen to take the floor at this time. 
The sponsors of this amendment, my friends Senators Domenici and Chafee, have brought forward an amendment that claims to be an alternative to the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment. I think when all Members thoroughly review the Domenici-Chafee amendment they will find that it is not an alternative at all. Rather, it is an effort designed to obfuscate and confuse Senators into thinking that they, the authors of the amendment, have accomplished the same ends as the Byrd-Gramm amendment. 
Senators ought not be confused. I can understand how they are being confused, however. There have been no discussions of the Chafee-Domenici amendment on the floor. There has been discussion of it in memos that have been passed around, letters, articles in various publications, one of which was Congress Daily on yesterday, which was not accurate in many ways. Inasmuch as there has been considerable discussion of the Byrd-Gramm amendment, I think there ought to be an explanation of the Chafee-Domenici amendment and it ought to be out here on the floor in open view where everybody can see what is being said and hear what is being said and make up their own minds. 
I feel very much like I am being shot at by someone behind a barricade. They don't come out in the open in public view and take their shots at the Byrd-Gramm amendment there, but I am being shot at. All kinds of things are being said about this amendment that I have offered, many of which things are absolutely not true. Also, many things are being claimed on behalf of the Chafee-Domenici amendment that are likewise inaccurate. So I think that there ought to be more discussion regarding the Chafee-Domenici amendment. Let's talk about it. 
The differences between these amendments--the Chafee amendment on the one hand; and my amendment on the other--are as simple as they are stark. The Byrd-Gramm amendment authorizes an additional $31 billion in contract authority for investment in our Nation's highways over the 6 years covered in the underlying ISTEA bill. 
The Domenici-Chafee amendment authorizes not even one, not even one additional dollar in contract authority for this 6-year period. 
The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment authorizes the spending of a 4.3-cent gas tax that is now going into the highway trust fund on our transportation needs over the next 6 years. The Domenici-Chafee amendment does not authorize any of this gas tax revenue to be spent on our highway, bridge and safety needs. That is a big difference. Our amendment authorizes the spending of the 4.3-cent gas tax that is now going into the highway trust fund. 
We say it ought to be spent. The American people are being told that that is what it's for. They are not being told that if it goes into the general fund, it will be spent on the various and sundry other programs, such as Indian roads, research, Head Start, education, parks, or just put into the General Treasury. They are not being told that. They think it is going into the highway trust fund to be spent on transportation needs--highways, mass transit, bridges. I think we owe them, in all honesty, an explanation. We ought to try to see to it that that money is spent for highways, mass transit, bridges, and so on. 
We are not saying in our amendment that it `shall' be spent. But we are authorizing contract authority, and then come next spring when the Appropriations Committees meet and we have debate on the budget resolution, we will get into discussions as to whether or not there will actually be obligation authority to spend that money and, if so, how much, and so on. We are saying if savings are there, from which the $31 billion will come, and if we are going to spend those savings, then, transportation needs are top priority. 
But the Domenici-Chafee amendment does not authorize any of this gas-tax revenue to be spent on our highway, bridge, and safety needs. Members should not be surprised by this. My friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, had stated in earlier debate on this bill that he does not believe that the 4.3-cents gas tax should be spent on our transportation needs. That is his view, and I respect him for that. He isn't running for a rock to hide under. He is just announcing from the steeple tops that he doesn't believe that the gas tax ought to be spent on transportation needs. He thinks it ought to go toward reducing the deficit. He is very plain and open about that, and you have to admire him for that. That is his view, and I respect that. 
However, that is not my view. It was not the view of the 83 Senators who voted in favor of an amendment on this floor on May 22 of this year that called for the 4.3 cents to be transferred to the highway trust fund and spent on our transportation needs. 
The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment keeps faith with our vote on May 22. It keeps faith with the millions of American citizens who fill their gas tanks and pay their gas taxes, with the expectation that these funds will be spent on the construction and rehabilitation of our highways and mass transit and bridges. The Domenici-Chafee amendment tells those millions of Americans and those 83 Senators that they must wait for another day, wait until next spring, wait until we have the next budget resolution before the Senate, and, perhaps, maybe--we don't know--we might consider authorizing the spending of your gas taxes on the Nation's highways and bridge needs, and then again, we might not. We don't make you any promises. But, by all means, don't do anything on this bill; don't take action on this bill, the highway authorization bill. Wait. 
The Domenici-Chafee amendment says that notwithstanding the fact that we are currently debating a 6-year highway authorization bill, now is not the time to decide the authorization level for highway spending for the next 6 years. Don't do it now--not now, not here. Wait. You Members here who are waiting with open mouths and open arms to see legislation pass that will assure your State and your State's transportation department of so much contract authority so that they can at least begin to think about it and plan about it, all of you just wait, don't do anything now. This is that old 6-year highway bill that comes out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Wait. Don't do it on that bill. Wait. Wait until some day in the future--maybe never. 
I have said as clearly as I can what the Domenici-Chafee amendment does not do. Allow me to take a moment to explain what the Domenici amendment does do. The Domenici-Chafee amendment seeks to establish a complex and convoluted process that basically enables the Senate to hide under a rock when it comes to the issue of highway taxes and our highway needs. The Domenici amendment proposes a new, Rube Goldberg, fast-track process for each of the next 5 years that would allow the Congress to increase highway and/or mass transit authorizations in some yet-to-be-determined amount each year, if the budget resolution for any such year allows it. You can just forget about this highway bill. Just wait, wait until another time, and if the budget resolution allows it, then we might increase highway and/or mass transit authorization. That will be determined next year--maybe, but not now. 
Not surprisingly, the amendment would also allow the Congress to ignore all those new procedures and do absolutely nothing. Members know that I am not in favor of fast-track procedures. I don't favor fast track on trade, and I am not going to vote for fast track. I don't favor fast-track procedures. We have too many of them now. In my view, they trample on the rights of all Senators and they cut off meaningful debate. When it comes to the Domenici-Chafee amendment, I think all Members should cast a careful eye on this so-called fast-track procedure, because this fast-track amendment may very well be the slow track to additional highway 
spending. 
So they say, take a look at our amendment, and if you are going to increase contract authority for your State and your State and your State and your State, we will know that at some point next spring--not now. This is the highway bill. That is the way we have been accustomed to doing it. But forget it, that is that old 6-year highway bill. Don't fool with it or pay any attention to that. 
I am quite surprised that Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, would go along with that idea. His committee has been the key committee when it comes to jurisdiction in authorizing contract authority. But now he has joined in an amendment that says: Not now, maybe next year sometime--maybe. There is no guarantee. Maybe next year and, if next year, we are going to have a fast-track procedure. 
When I was a boy, I read a book called `Slow Train Through Arkansas.' Well, that was in the old days when they believed in voodooism and snake oil and patent medicines that were sold by traveling con salesmen, and so on. So, next year, under the Chafee-Domenici amendment, we will have a fast track--not the `Slow Train Through Arkansas,' but a fast track. 
If Senators vote for the Domenici-Chafee amendment, you are not voting for a single dollar in your State for contract authority over the next 6 years--not a single dollar. The Chafee-Domenici amendment is saying: Wait until next year, we will take a look at it then. And then in the budget resolution, when that comes along, we will take a look at it then. Mind you, we are not saying in the Chafee-Domenici amendment that we are going to spend any of that gas-tax money on highways. We are going to let that stay in the Highway Trust Fund. Let that money accumulate, and next spring, other governmental needs can compete with highways in the use of that money in the trust fund. 
Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici are not assuring you Senators that that money in the highway trust fund is going to be spent on highways. They are saying we are not even sure we can do that at all. We are not assuring you that you are going to get any extra money. We are going to wait until next year, they say. When the budget resolution is up here next spring, then we will talk about it, they say. Then we will decide what we do with that money. We may spend it on highways; we may not. We may spend it on Indian roads; we may not. We may spend it on parks and recreation. We may spend it on the national forests. We may spend it on Head Start. We may spend it on welfare. There are a lot of things we may spend it for, they say. But we don't make that decision here. Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici say that we will make that decision when we have the budget resolution. 
So if you are on the Budget Committee, you are going to have control of that. The Domenici-Chafee amendment says that on this 6-year highway authorization bill we should do nothing, nothing, nothing toward authorizing additional highway funding. We should put that decision off until another day. That other day may never come. That other day need never come. 
If Members want to know how the authorized spending levels contained in the Domenici-Chafee amendment differ from the levels in the Byrd-Gramm amendment, they need look no further than the first section of the Domenici-Chafee amendment. I say the same to Commerce Daily. When Commerce Daily gets ready to write again, I suggest they look at the Chafee-Domenici amendment. Look at it. Don't take somebody else's word for it. Don't take some aide's word for it. I am not speaking disparagingly of aides. We have to have them, and I have some excellent aides on my staff, and so have other Senators. But go look at the amendment yourself. Look at the Chafee-Domenici amendment. Read it. They will find it stated very clearly there. 
That amendment reads, and I quote from section 3001(A)(2) of the Chafee-Domenici amendment:

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take the floor at this time for several reasons, one being that the Senate would be on the ISTEA bill if the regular order were called for at this point. No other legislation is before the Senate. Consequently, I feel it is appropriate to be talking about the ISTEA bill. 
Second, three of my colleagues, Senators Gramm of Texas, Baucus, and Warner, and I have introduced an amendment to the ISTEA bill and we have explained that amendment and discussed it upon more than one occasion. As we have explained, our amendment provides that 90 percent of the funding will be distributed on the same basis as in the ISTEA bill before us, and that 10 percent would be allotted for discretionary as is the case in the ISTEA bill before us. In the amendment, which I have coauthored with the other three Senators, I have provided that in the 10 percent discretionary portion, $2.2 billion would be allotted to the Appalachian regional highways--$2.2 billion of the $3.1 billion in discretionary funding. The overall amount of funds that would be provided by our amendment would be $31 billion. 
The basis of our amendment is that inasmuch as the 4.3-cent gas tax has been ordered by the Senate to go into the trust fund as of October 1 this year, that money should be spent for transportation purposes. 
The American people, being under that impression, and having every right to be under that impression because of the legislation that was passed recently stating that the 4.3-cent gas tax would go into the highway trust fund, that would be broken down as follows: 3.45 cents for highway funding and 0.85 percent would be for mass transit. 
There is a considerable amount of confusion, some of which I think has been deliberately spread, some of which may be accidental. There is some misinformation that has been spread about the amendment that my three colleagues and I have sponsored. So I believe at this time, there should be some discussion so as to clarify our amendment, what it really will do, what it will not do, and also it is my opinion that we should understand what the Chafee-Domenici amendment will do and what it will not do. 
My colleagues who are coauthoring my amendment and I have taken the floor on at least two occasions to describe our amendment. And most recently, during the time of the last discussion of my amendment, Mr. Chafee presented me with a copy of the Chafee-Domenici amendment. 
However, I haven't heard any explanation of that amendment as yet. I think we ought to have an explanation before we act on the bill, one way or another, and certainly before sine die adjournment. I hope that we will get a 6-year highway bill, but with each passing day, the prospects of such are by that degree diminished. 
But in any event, I would want Senators to have a better understanding of my amendment and certainly the amendment by Senators Chafee and Domenici before we go out or before we leave this subject entirely. 
I have called for Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici. I wasn't able to contact Senator Domenici, but I was able to contact Senator Chafee. I wanted to let them know that I hoped we could use this time, when no other Senator is seeking recognition, to discuss this matter and particularly to have some explanation of the Chafee-Domenici amendment. 
Mr. Chafee was in the Intelligence Committee at the time and was busy there, but he very kindly came to the floor and has indicated to me--he is here on the floor now and he can speak for himself--that on tomorrow, he will seek some time to discuss and explain the amendment that he and Mr. Domenici have offered. 
At this time then, Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the Appalachian Regional Highway System, because that figures very importantly in the amendment which I have offered for printing, and I think that the Members of the Senate ought to have a better understanding of the background of that particular subject matter. I also want to direct some comments to today's edition of Congress Daily to an item therein which bears the headline: `DOT Study, Domenici-Chafee Letter Hit Gramm-Byrd Plan.' 
There are some inaccuracies in that article, and I hope to address some of my remarks to those inaccuracies. I also would be pleased if the other three cosponsors of our amendment could come to the floor and, likewise, make some remarks. 
All three offices have been alerted, and it is my understanding that those Senators will come at such times as they can be free from other appointments. I apologize for, in a way, for taking the floor at this time. I know that the other cosponsors are very busy, and I know also that Mr. Chafee and Mr. Domenici are busy, but I shall proceed. 
First of all, let me address my comments briefly to the Appalachian Development Highway System. 
Mr. President, when I was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates 51 years ago, West Virginia had only 4 miles of divided four-lane highways--4 miles! Let me say that again. The entire State of West Virginia had only 4 miles of divided four-lane highways in 1947, the first year in which I served as a member of the West Virginia Legislature. 
I can remember an article that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post by a Mr. Roul Tunley, on February 6, 1960. I was a Member of the U.S. Senate then. That was my second year in the U.S. Senate. In Mr. Tunley's article, he said this: `Its'--meaning West Virginia's--`Its highway system is several decades behind that of its neighbors.' I haven't forgotten that quotation. I have been carrying it around up here somewhere in my gray matter now for these 37 years. 
I cannot forget it. It is etched into my memory. The Saturday Evening Post, a national publication, said, in an article by Roul Tunley, with reference to West Virginia's highway system: `Its highway system is several decades behind that of its neighbors.' 
Now, Mr. President, those words have, as I say, been etched into my memory. They have been burned into my memory, virtually seared into my memory. 
I was a Member of the other body when the Interstate System was inaugurated. President Eisenhower was in his first term. 
In any event, in 1956, which was during the 84th Congress, Congress passed legislation to provide for a gas tax to be placed into the highway trust fund. I was a Member of Congress at that time. 
In 1965, 9 years later, Congress passed the Appalachian Regional Development Act. It provided for an Appalachian regional highway system. That was 1965. It was fiscal year 1966; in other words, calendar year 1965, when Congress appropriated its first moneys toward the Appalachian regional highway system--1965, fiscal year 1966. It has been a long time ago. 
So, over 30 years ago, Congress enacted legislation saying to the people of Appalachia, the people of the 13 States in Appalachia, that an Appalachian highway system was going to be established and funded. 
West Virginia is the only one of the 13 States that is wholly within Appalachia. But contrary to the understanding of a good many people, I suppose, West Virginia is not the only State in Appalachia. During these intervening 32 years, West Virginia's Appalachian system has become 74 percent complete. For the entire Appalachian region, however, the highway system is something like 78 or 79 percent complete. 
Now, the Interstate System all over this country is 100 percent complete--virtually 100 percent. That is something like 43,000 miles, I believe. 
But the Appalachian highway system remains, a good bit of it, yet to be completed. West Virginia, as I say, is 74 percent complete. The other States in the Appalachian region are about 78 or 79 percent complete. So West Virginia is behind the region as a whole. 
A great many people have criticized me over the years for acting in my Appropriations Committee to get moneys for West Virginia's Appalachian corridors. But as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I provided not only money for West Virginia's Appalachian corridors but also funding for Appalachian corridors in all of the 13 States of Appalachia. Nothing was said about that by my critics. But that is neither here nor there at the moment. I just mention it in passing. 
The point is that while the Interstate System has been completed all over this country, the Appalachian highway system is yet to be completed. The people in Appalachia have been promised for 31 years that that system would be completed. It isn't completed yet. So they have been living on a prayer and a promise, in considerable degree. About one-fourth of the system--one-fifth to one-fourth of the system--is not yet complete. And I think it is about time we fulfilled our promise that Congress made to the millions of people who live in Appalachia that their system at some point would be completed, too. 
Now, Mr. President, I see on the floor my friend, Senator Gramm. If he would like to speak for a moment----

Mr. BYRD. He indicates that I should go ahead. 
So, with the passage of the Appalachian Regional Development Act by Congress in 1965, the Appalachian Development Highway System got its start by providing smaller regional centers in the Appalachian region with four-lane expressway links to the Interstate Highway System. The new corridors were devised to open areas with development potential where commerce and communication had previously been inhibited by a lack of access. 
On June 17, 1965--32 years ago, and then some--the first Appalachian corridor construction project in West Virginia was contracted for a section of corridor D, U.S. 50 in Doddridge County that is between Parkersburg, WV, and Clarksburg, WV. 
The Appalachian corridor highway construction era really picked up steam in West Virginia following the November 1968 approval by the voters of a $350 million road bond, the proceeds of which were used to provide the State's matching share for corridor construction. 
During these years, for the most part, funding has been directed toward all four uncompleted corridors, D, G, H and L. When the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act, ISTEA of 1991, came along, I asked that language be included authorizing the completion of the Appalachian system. And that was done. 
The Appalachian Development Highway System in West Virginia comprises a total of 428.9 miles of roadway, completed or under construction, in design or in corridor location study phase. 
In the case of the Appalachian system, I think it would be informative to point out that Appalachia's rugged terrain has made roads very expensive to build. Early roads usually followed the topography, that is, they followed streams, valleys and troughs between mountains, and the resulting highways were characterized by very low travel speeds, long distances due to winding road patterns, often very unsafe road conditions, roads built to poor design standards, unsafe, short-sight distances, and extremely high construction costs which further discouraged commercial and industrial development. 
Now, I should say that miles constructed, alone, do not really measure the impact of a development highway system. Its success is measured in how it allows the region to be opened up for development and how it allows for the improvement of its inhabitants' condition. 
A 1987 survey taken by the Appalachian Regional Commission showed that between 1980 and 1986, 560,000 jobs were created in the Appalachian counties with a major highway, compared with 134,000 jobs created in those counties without a major highway. It is clear the highways are the lifeline and the lifeblood of the Appalachian region. The idea of a regional interconnected network of highways is as vital today as it was in 1965. It has the same purpose as the Appalachian corridor system which was created 32 years ago. 
The National Highway System was designed to provide an interconnected system of principal arterial routes which would serve major population centers--water crossings, ports, airports, other intermodal facilities and travel destinations--while meeting national defense requirements and serving interstate and interregional travel. 
A factor which is often overlooked in connection with Appalachian regional highways is the factor of safety. It is important that States in Appalachia have modern, safe roads. Current accident rates on the highways in the area of corridor H --if I may take one example, in West Virginia--are above the Statewide average. The accident rates along in that area are above the Statewide average. The State of West Virginia itself has accident rates which are above the national average. Because much of the State's road system was built in the 1930s, the existing roads reflect a happenstance response to topography rather than strategic planning. 
Shortly, I will yield to Senator Gramm, but while I am on this aspect, namely, the Appalachian highways in the ISTEA amendment which Senator Gramm, Senator Warner, Senator Baucus, and I have introduced, the Appalachian regional highways, along with various trade corridors and bridge repairs constitute 10 percent of the total--the total being $31 billion; 10 percent being $3.1 billion--the 10 percent being precisely the same breakdown as in the ISTEA bill that is before the Senate. In that bill, 90 percent goes to formula funding and 10 percent to discretionary to be determined by the Secretaries of Interior and Transportation. 
So, I simply wanted to say for the record that Congress and the Federal Government promised to the people in the 13 States of Appalachia 32 years ago a highway system that would be modern, that would be safe, and that would contribute to the commerce and communication, economy and upbuilding of that region and the well-being of its people, and that promise has not been fulfilled yet. I think it is about time we consider fulfilling the promise that Congress made to the people of Appalachia. That is what I am attempting to do in this amendment, to go a long way in halfway fulfilling the promise. 
The promise--$2.2 billion, and $300 million in the bill itself--is $2.5 billion, and it is estimated that the total cost of completing the Appalachian regional system in the 13 States of Appalachia is something like $6 billion to $7 billion, the Federal share, and the Federal share is 80 percent. 
So in this particular ISTEA bill, which would be for the next 6 years, of course, we would only take advantage of 5 years because the first year of the 6 years is already underway. It started on October 1 of this year and the gas tax just began going into the trust fund as of October 1 of this year. Consequently, we would not see that money until next year, so it would be 5 years out of the 6-year life of this ISTEA bill that we would provide something like $2.5 billion for the Appalachian Regional Commission highways in 13 States--not just in West Virginia, 13 States. Hopefully, the next ISTEA bill, 6 years down the road, would make further provision and perhaps at some point in the not-too-distant future the people of Appalachia could look up and see their modern, safe, highway system completed, and the rest of the country, including the Congress, could look the people of Appalachia in the eye and say, `We kept our promise.' 
That is what I am fighting for here today. That is why I hope to reach the ears and the hearts of my colleagues so that they have a better understanding of why this money is being provided in our amendment. 
Mr. President, there may be an attitude around, and at times I have sensed an attitude, to the effect that the people of Appalachia have no right to expect appropriations for an Appalachian Regional Commission system, and that moneys spent in one region of the country for highways is to the disadvantage of the voters, the taxpayers, the people of other regions of the country. There seems to be such an attitude in editorials and columns and so forth over the years; that what the people in Appalachia are getting by way of highway funding is pork and that they were actually getting more than their share. A lot could be said about that. 
But this attitude that appropriations projects in one section of the country benefit only that section, they don't benefit the whole country, and, therefore, should not be made, and that it is unfair to focus funds on a particular area, a particular State or a particular region of a country, that that is an unwise, unfair and unjustified expenditure of the taxpayers' money, I want to address that. 
I want a Senator who is far better known than I am to address the matter for me, and I will call on none other, therefore, than Daniel Webster. I refer to his reply to Hayne. He took 2 days to reply to Senator Hayne, namely on the 26th and 27th of January, 1830. Hayne had spoken on Thursday and Friday of the previous week. Webster had taken 12 or 13 pages of notes, and over the weekend, he thought about his speech, and then on the following Tuesday and Wednesday, the 26th and 27th, he made his speech. 
He addressed Senator Hayne, as well as Senator Hayne's statements and charges, namely that the people of the whole country should not have to pay for internal improvements that occur in a particular State. 
So Webster took the floor on that occasion and spoke as follows. I have gone back and read Webster's speech, and I will quote from it precisely. This is Daniel Webster:  
I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal round the falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the Atlantic to the Western waters, as being an object large and extensive enough to be fairly said to be for the common benefit. 
Let me say that again: 
I look upon a road over the Alleghanies-- 
He is talking about my country when he talks about a road over the Alleghenies, the Allegheny Mountains. That is a part of Appalachia. Appalachia extends farther, a larger area than the Alleghenies. But Webster said: 
I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal round the falls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the Atlantic to the Western waters, as being an object large and extensive enough to be fairly said to be for the common benefit. The gentleman-- 
Meaning Mr. Hayne-- thinks otherwise, and this is the key to his construction of the powers of the government. He may well ask what interest has South Carolina in a canal in Ohio. On his system, it is true, she has no interest. On that system, Ohio and Carolina are different governments, and different countries; connected here, it is true, by some slight and ill-defined bond of union, but in all main respects separate and diverse. On that system-- 
Mr. Hayne's system-- 
On that system, Carolina has no more interest in a canal in Ohio than in Mexico. The gentleman, therefore, only follows out his own principles; he does no more than arrive at the natural conclusions of his own doctrines; he only announces the true results of that creed which he has adopted himself, and would persuade others to adopt, when he thus declares that South Carolina has no interest in a public work in Ohio. 
May I interpolate. The same thing has been said about the Appalachian Highway System, or at least implied. Why should people build highways across those rugged mountains, those stream valleys that have been there for millions of centuries? Why should the taxpayers of America pay for highways to cut through those Allegheny Mountains? Why should we have to do that? 
Webster says, as he said to Hayne, `the gentleman thinks otherwise.' 
And he said: 
Sir, we narrow-minded people of New England-- 
Webster is referring to himself and others from that area-- 
Sir, we narrow-minded people of New England do not reason thus. Our notion of things is entirely different. We look upon the states, not as separated, but as united. We love to dwell on that union, and on the mutual happiness which it has so much promoted, and the common renown which it has so greatly contributed to acquire. In our contemplation, Carolina and Ohio are parts of the same country; states, united under the same general government, having interests, common, associated, intermingled. 
`Having interests, common, associated, intermingled.' 
In whatever is within the proper sphere of the constitutional power of this government, we look upon the states as one. 
That's Webster. `. . . we look upon the States as one.' Now listen to what he says to those who would criticize the expenditure of public moneys for internal improvements. By the way, that was one of the main planks in Henry Clay's `American System,' which advocated a national tariff, internal improvements, and a national bank. Clay was instrumental in getting funds for the old Cumberland Road, the old national road. The next time that the distinguished Presiding Officer drives from Washington over to Wheeling, WV, he will travel on the old national road, the old Cumberland Road. 
It was begun in the year 1811, and that was the gate to the Midwest and the West. By 1838, Congress had appropriated a total of $3 million--think of it, $3 million--toward the construction of that old national road, the old Cumberland Road. Begun in 1811, by 1838, Congress had appropriated the enormous sum of $3 million of the national taxpayers' money for construction on the old Cumberland Road. 
And Henry Clay had a great deal to do with the appropriations of those funds for that old Cumberland Road. 
Well, now continuing with Webster. 
I am sure that Henry Clay, if he were in the Senate, would make my case for the Appalachian regional highway system. 
Clay on one side--oh, I would like to have him here; that great Senator from Kentucky would make my case--and Webster would also make my case, those two great Senators, because they saw the beauty and the wisdom and the justice and the fairness in committing the national resources to the development of a section of the country, not just one State. But even Webster would go so far as to say, if it were just in one State he would not stand up here and ask why he should support it. 
But let him speak for himself here.  
We do not impose geographical limits to our patriotic feeling or regard; we do not follow rivers and mountains, and lines of latitude, to find boundaries, beyond which public improvements do not benefit us. We who come here, as agents and representatives of these narrow-minded and selfish men of New England, consider ourselves as bound to regard with an equal eye the good of the whole, in whatever is within our powers of legislation. Sir, [he addressed the Chair, `Sir'] if a railroad or canal, beginning in South Carolina and ending in South Carolina, appeared to me to be of national importance and national magnitude, believing, as I do that the power of government extends to the encouragement of works to that description, if I were to stand up here and ask, What interest has Massachusetts in a railroad in South Carolina? I should not be willing to face my constituents. 
Oh, I wish he were here to defend our case. We have been promised for 32 years that this system would be completed. It is not completed yet. And when we seek justice in relation to the completion of that system, we bear the slings and arrows of fortune and the criticism of those who would say, `Well, why? You're getting less money than those people in Appalachia. Those people in those 13 States of Appalachia are getting a little more than you are.' What kind of statesmanship is that? That is a shortsighted statesmanship in the eyes of Daniel Webster. 
I should not be willing to face my constituents. These same narrow-minded men would tell me, that they have sent me to act for the whole country, and that one who possessed too little comprehension, either of intellect or feeling, one who has not large enough, both in mind and in heart, to embrace the whole, was not fit to be intrusted with the interest of any part. 
Webster--talking about internal improvements. 
Sir, I do not desire to enlarge the powers of the government by unjustifiable construction, nor to exercise any not within a fair interpretation. But when it is believed that a power does exist, then it is, in my judgment, to be exercised for the general benefit of the whole. So far as respects the exercise of such a power, the States are one. 
One; e pluribus unum! 
It was the very object of the Constitution to create unity of interests to the extent of the powers of the general government. In war and peace we are one; in commerce, one; because the authority of the general government reaches to war and peace, and to the regulation of commerce. I have never seen any more difficulty in erecting lighthouses on the lakes, than on the ocean; in improving the harbors of inland seas, than if they were within the ebb and flow of the tide; or in removing obstructions in the vast streams of the West, more than in any work to facilitate commerce on the Atlantic coast. If there be any power for one, there is power also for the other; and they are all and equally for the common good of the country. 
Now, Mr. President, I would like to yield, without losing my right to the floor, to my colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, for such comments as he may wish to make on this subject matter, and I ask unanimous consent to do so.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have yielded to the distinguished Senator, and I just as deeply appreciate his statement. I hope the Senators will read it. It is needed, I think, to disabuse Senators from what they are being told by Congress Daily and by letters and tables that are being distributed. I don't accuse anyone of acting in bad faith. I am in no position to do that. But certainly misstatements should be corrected, and I hope will be, beyond what Mr. Gramm has already said. 
Mr. President, Senator Chafee earlier said--he told me that we would, on tomorrow, get the floor and speak with reference to the Chafee-Domenici amendment. I have been insisting to them that their amendment be explained. The amendment which I offered on behalf of myself and my three distinguished colleagues was explained, and we were criticized because we had mentioned, on the 9th, I believe, of October, before the recess, that we were going to offer such an amendment, but we didn't actually have it ready by then so a considerable amount of discussion went forth as to why we didn't have it, to the effect that Senators couldn't comment on what they couldn't see. 
But on that same day I believe Senator Domenici indicated that he was going to offer an amendment, and, of course, we didn't get to see that until one day this week. So we haven't heard an explanation of it yet. I want an explanation of it. Just as we attempted to do our best explaining to our colleagues and to the American public what our amendment does, I think the American people ought to have an explanation right here on this floor as to what the Chafee-Domenici amendment does. That will give us a chance, perhaps, to refute some of the misinformation that is being bandied about. 
As I say, I don't ascribe to anyone any intentions to go with misinformation, but I think the public and our colleagues have a right to expect us to clear up some of the confusion. So, for now I'll not say any more along that line because, as I say, Mr. Chafee has indicated we'll talk some tomorrow, and he indicated that he would yield to me for some comments at that time. I hope that Mr. Baucus and Mr. Warner will also have a chance to comment at that time, particularly with reference to the statement by Congress Daily of today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Gorton today in bringing the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill before the Senate. The Senate completed its action on this bill in September. The formal conference was completed on September 30, and discussion and negotiation regarding a limited number of outstanding items was finally completed just a few days ago. The conference report was filed on October 22, and was approved by the House last Friday by a vote of 233-171. Inasmuch as we are now several weeks into the fiscal year, I hope that the Senate will be able to complete its consideration of this appropriations measure expeditiously, so that the bill can be presented to the President and the agencies can begin implementation of the programs funded for fiscal year 1998 once this bill is enacted. 
The agreements before the Senate today total $13.8 billion in budget authority, and $13.7 billion in outlays, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office. This conference agreement substantially fulfills the commitments for Interior bill programs included in the bipartisan budget agreement of which I had no part and which personally I don't recognize, and incorporated into the budget resolution earlier this year. 
Mr. President, as with nearly every conference, reaching agreement on this conference report required difficult choices and a search for balance between competing priorities of the House, the Senate, and the administration. This bill provides important resources to address important needs for our public lands and natural resources, as well as for Indian programs, energy research and development, and our core cultural programs. The major legislative provisions of concern have been modified to address some of the concerns of the administration. 
Mr. President, Senator Gorton has done an excellent job of summarizing the many factors at work in reaching the agreements contained in the conference report now before the Senate. The negotiations over the special $700 million land acquisition account were protracted, with each side giving some in order to reach a final agreement. We do not yet know whether the President will approve or veto this legislation. As Senator Gorton has suggested, many changes were made to this bill to reflect the concerns of the administration, while protecting Congress' role--while protecting Congress' role in determining the expenditure of funds and proper oversight responsibilities. Just as no Member of Congress got everything he or she might have wanted from this appropriations measure, neither did the administration. But the overall product is a good one, and I hope it will be enacted. I do not believe that closure on further issues of concern will be easier if the bill is vetoed. 
Among the highlights of this conference report are these: 
Funding for the National Park Service remains a priority. The recommendation includes an operational increase of $79 million over the fiscal year 1997 level. Other significant park increases are provided for construction and land acquisition. 
A significant initiative to focus attention on the operational requirements and habitat restoration and maintenance backlogs of our national wildlife refuges is supported, with increased funding of $40.8 million above fiscal year 1997. 
As to our Nation's energy research and development programs, the investment in those programs is continued. Fossil energy research and development is funded at $362.4 million, which is $2.3 million below the fiscal year 1997 enacted level. Increases above the budget request are provided to sustain technology development programs intended to produce environmental benefits while improving energy efficiency. 
On another matter, the conference agreement fully funds the President's request for tribal priority allocations at $757.4 million, an increase of $76.5 million over fiscal year 1997 levels. 
As to the National Endowment for the Arts, the conference agreement includes $98 million to continue the National Endowment for the Arts. A package of reforms is included in the bill to address concerns over the use of Federal funds in support of the arts. These reforms include an increase on the amount of funds allocated directly to the States; a cap on the amount of funds that can be awarded to each State from the competitive grants pool; changes in the structure and composition of the National Council on the Arts; prohibitions regarding grants to individuals; and an emphasis on arts education. 
With reference to land acquisition, this bill provides a special land acquisition account as recommended in the budget resolution. The account is funded at a level of $699 million, which includes $315 million for the Headwaters Forest, CA, and New World Mine, MT; $22 million in special payments for affected local areas in California and Montana; and the balance is available for priority land acquisitions, exchanges, and maintenance to be identified by the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, and for which the committees on appropriations will have final approval. The conference agreement includes legislative language establishing initial parameters for the completion of the two large exchanges. 
Mr. President, it is my privilege and great pleasure to serve as the ranking member at the side of our very able chairman, the senior Senator from Washington, Mr. Gorton. We have worked closely, as we always have, on the product that we present to the Senate today. In his stewardship of this bill as chairman of the committee, Senator Gorton has been very fair, he has been bipartisan in his handling of the many programs and issues which were negotiated in the conference. I commend this conference report to the Senate and urge Senators to support its approval. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged against both sides.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been intrigued--modestly, if I may say, so as not to exaggerate--at the plethora of complaints that are being in some instances stridently expressed about the President's use of the line-item veto. I suppose what amazes me so much about this matter is that all of this vast panorama of problems that could be expected to occur in the train of passage of the Line-Item Veto Act have been addressed time and time and time again on this Senate floor by me; by my colleague, Senator Moynihan; by my colleague, Senator Levin; by my colleague, Senator Reid; and many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including, of course, former Senator Mark Hatfield. We spoke to the galleries here and across the land repeatedly about what could be expected from the use of a President's line-item veto pen should such legislation be passed. We also spoke of the constitutional ramifications of a line-item veto. At the time, I felt that in all probability our expressions of concern were falling upon deaf ears. 
So of late it has been brought home to me very clearly that although one may speak with stentorian voice, as with the combined voices of 50 men or as if his lungs were of brass, there will nonetheless be ears that will not hear, there will be eyes that will not see, and there will apparently be minds that will not think. 
So one is left with very little consolation other than to know that what he or she said as a warning in days past was on point, and that history will prove that the point was well taken. 
Mr. President, I see my dear friend, Senator Moynihan, who is a great teacher. I wish I would have had the opportunity to sit in his classes--a man who is noted in the Congressional Directory as having received 60 honorary degrees. That will make one sit up and take notice--60 honorary degrees! I have never counted my honorary degrees. But I suppose that if I have been the recipient of ten or a dozen, that would certainly be the limit. 
But Senator Moynihan has foreseen the ramifications of this unwise legislative action by the Congress--and it is now coming home to roost--the so-called `Line-Item Veto Act.' He has joined 
with me previously many times in discussing the act here and elsewhere. He has joined with me, as did Senator Levin and former Senator Hatfield and two of our colleagues in the other body, in a court challenge against the Line-Item Veto Act. And he joins with me today in cosponsoring this bill to repeal the line-item veto. 
So I am going to yield to him. I have legislation that I have prepared to repeal this act. Senator Moynihan has joined with me in the preparation of the legislation. And I am going to yield to him because, as I understand it, he needs to get to another appointment right away. So I gladly yield to my friend for as long as he wishes. I ask that I be permitted to yield to Senator Moynihan without losing my right to the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, our most learned Member, for his eloquent statement in support of the legislation that I am introducing on behalf of myself and the Senator from New York and the Senator from Michigan. He has never faltered in his opposition to the passage of legislation that would give this President, any President, Democrat or Republican, line-item veto authority. And as he has said so many times, if this is something that is going to be done, it ought to be done as the framers made provision for, and that is by way of a constitutional amendment which will constitute the judgment, hopefully the considered judgment, of the American people from whom all power and authority in this Republic springs. I think Senator Moynihan's reference this morning to the `New Federalist Papers' essays is timely. He was kind enough to give me a copy of that volume which I have not yet had the opportunity to read but which I shall very soon. And he has printed in the Record today one of the essays from that volume. I shall look for it in the Congressional Record with great interest.  
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate passed the so-called Line-Item Veto Act on March 23, 1995. The legislation went to conference where it lay dormant for something like a year, and I am told that the standard bearer of the Republican Party in last year's Presidential election prevailed upon the leadership in both Houses to get this matter out of conference and get it passed into law so that, I assume, he, Mr. Dole, would then feel that he would become the first wielder of the pen under this act. 
So the leadership went to work and on March 27--these dates are so etched in my gray matter between my two ears that I will never forget the dates. If anything ever happens to my mind and I lose my memory, I daresay this will be one of the last things that will be lost. So, on March 27, 1996, the Senate stabbed itself in the back by adopting that conference report. 
I have answered the Senator's question.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank again my friend, the Senator from New York. 
I have been trying to get in touch with Senator Levin, but I have been unable to do that today, so I will not add his name at this point until I can be reassured by him that he wishes to be a cosponsor. I have no doubt that he will be. But I shall in due time add his name, and others', if they so wish.

Mr. BYRD. We will recall that the President had disapproved various projects that had been included in the Fiscal Year 1998 Military Construction Appropriations Act. The President, under his newly gained authority, had disapproved 38 of the projects, 
In the letter, Mr. Raines states: `The President used his authority responsibly to cancel projects that were not requested in the budget.' He doesn't have any authority that I know of to cancel projects solely on the basis that they were not requested in his budget. He can do it, of course. He has the veto pen. But he is not acting on any `authority' that I know about. It is not in the Constitution. He doesn't get any authority there. 
He doesn't get his authority from the Line-Item Veto Act to `cancel projects that were not requested in the budget.' That Line Item Veto Act sets forth certain criteria for the guidance of the President in exercising the line-item veto pen. But nowhere in those criteria will there be found a criterion which says that the President may `cancel projects that were not requested in the budget.' Yet, Mr. Raines refers to such authority in his letter. `The President used his authority responsibly to cancel projects that were not requested in the budget.' 
Well, I say, as I have said many times, that the administration--whatever administration is in power--will see that Line Item Veto Act as it wishes to see it. It will read into it whatever it wants to read into it. It will hear whatever it wants to hear from anonymous bureaucrats working in the subterranean tunnels of the White House who will advise the President as to what should be stricken by the veto pen. We can trust them to expand upon the power that has been given them in the act. And they will read into it and interpret the words, and constantly be expanding their power. I predicted that that would be the case. 
Mr. President, I hope with this legislation to be able to remove that sword of Damocles that we ourselves helped to suspend over our unlucky and graying heads. But we have nobody to blame except ourselves. I am not going to blame the President if he uses that authority that we have given to him. We gave it to him without a whimper; no resistance. Resistance? No. We eagerly gave it to him. `Take it, Mr. President. Take it. Take this authority. Take this legislation. Use your veto pen.' 
President Reagan said we had the line item veto in every State government. `They have it at the State level. Give it to me. If the States can have it, why can't I have it?' I have heard that argument ad nauseam--that if the States have the line item veto power, therefore, why not have it at the Federal level? Why not let the President have the line-item veto? The Governors have it. They balance their budgets. Of course, I argued time and time again that they don't really balance their budgets. They go into debt just as the Federal Government goes into debt. But we were told, `The States have the line item veto. The President should have it.' 
Mr. President, that kind of an argument signifies and reveals a lack of knowledge on the part of those who use the argument. This is the Constitution of the United States. It is not the constitution of the State of West Virginia or the State of New York or the State of Alabama or the State of Tennessee. It is the Constitution of the United States of America. And this Constitution, while it contains some inhibitions upon certain actions by the States, does not attempt to tell the State governments how they shall legislate. It assures the States of having republican forms of government. But it does not say to any State, `Thou shalt not have the line item veto.' 
The Constitution, with reference to legislative powers, speaks of the Congress. `All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.' 
There are 50 States. There are 50 State constitutions, and whatever any State wishes to write into its constitution as to a line-item veto power, there is no prohibition in this Federal Constitution against the State's doing it. 
The theory and the system of separation of powers and checks and balances are more finely drawn at the Federal level than at the State level. Under our Federal system, we have the separation of powers. We have mixed powers. We have checks and balances. That is at the Federal level. 
I heard a Senator say the other day, `Well, I am disappointed that when the President exercised this veto, he didn't do as we are accustomed to seeing done at the State level with the line-item veto.' But, Mr. President, that Senator was talking about two entirely different things--apples and oranges, black and white. This is a Federal Constitution that was meant to guide the Congress and the Federal departments and officers of government, and the framers very wisely provided a scheme whereby there would be checks and there would be balances. There would be the separation of powers, and there would be the interweaving and overlapping of powers between and among the departments. That is at the Federal level. 
The State constitutions are different. The State of West Virginia may have the line-item veto. The State of West Virginia has a constitution, and in its legislative branch it is governed by that State constitution until and unless the State takes actions that violate the Federal Constitution. But as to how the State will legislate and as to how the Governor of the State will exercise his veto pen, that is entirely up to the State under its constitution. There can be 50 State line-item vetoes. But those are State constitutions. Those are State governments. 
We are talking about the Federal Constitution. Why Senators haven't been able to distinguish between the State and Federal governments. I can't understand. I thought they would have learned that in their civics classes long, long ago. But they should have learned it back in the elementary schools. There are 50 State governments. There is one Federal Government. Each is supreme in its own sphere of actions. But if there is any conflict, the Federal Government--the Federal Constitution--will then prevail. It is that simple. One doesn't have to be a Phi Beta Kappa to know that. Yet, Senators, many of them, and many Members of the other body, in explaining their support for this ill-advised, unwise piece of legislation, took the stand and said, `My own State has it. It works well there. I think that the Federal Government should have it'--thus displaying an amazing lack of knowledge of the Constitution, an amazing lack of knowledge of constitutional history, an amazing lack of knowledge of American history and the history of England. 
The Framers of the Constitution were very well aware of the colonial experience and what had happened in England. They knew that a king had had his head severed from his body on January the 
30th of 1649. Imagine that. Parliament created the High Court of Justice which concluded that Charles I was a tyrant, a traitor, and an enemy of the good people of England, and that he should have his head severed from his body. That court was created on January 6, 1649, and 24 days later King Charles was dead. He was executed in front of his palace at White Hall before thousands of people. He and his father, James I, had believed that kings ruled by divine might and that they were above Parliament and above the people. 
So it is out of that history that the liberties and freedoms of the American people were born. And they are written down and guaranteed in this Constitution. 
But I have said these things many times, and, no doubt, if the Lord let's me live and keep my voice, I shall have the opportunity to say them again on several occasions. 
I feel so strongly about this. The Congress of the United States has never, never committed such an act as it committed in enacting the line-item veto. That action flew in the face of the plain English words that are in this Constitution. And Congress did it nonchalantly; cavalierly. Was it being guided by the Constitution? No. Was it being guided by the polls? Apparently. Because it was a popular thing. The American people believed by a tremendous majority that the line-item veto was to be desired. 
It won't reduce the national debt. I say to Senators, take a good look at the budget after this year and after next year, if, God forbid, this ill-advised piece of legislation still governs the legislative process. The savings that accrue from the line-item veto will indeed be meager 
I read in the newspapers where the President said he was saving X amount of dollars by these vetoes. Well, he cut out a little item in West Virginia. `Ah, that's why Senator Byrd is against the line-item veto. There it is. He likes his pork. That's why he is opposed to this.' 
Well, I am not going to ask the President for it back, and if I did, he could not put the vetoed item back. He has cut off its head. He cannot breathe new life into that stiff and cold corpse. After having committed the act of execution, after having wielded the ax, he cannot put it back. I have seen something here and there in the newspapers to the effect that the administration would be willing to negotiate with Senators to restore such vetoed projects. Well, Mr. President, use your pen. Veto the item in West Virginia. There will be other bills coming to you. There will be other items for West Virginia. 
The President's advisers may say, perhaps you can get Senator Byrd to negotiate with you if you tell him you won't veto that piece of pork. Perhaps he will vote for your nominee for such and such a position or he will vote for such and such a treaty or he will vote with you on the fast-track bill. Just tell him that you don't want to line-item veto those West Virginia items, that West Virginia pork. Senator Byrd may then come to his senses. 
Well, I say go to it. `Lay on, Macduff; and damned be him that first cries `hold, enough.' I am not negotiating with any administration over any item for West Virginia. 
So much for that. So much for the suggestion that Senator Byrd's pork for West Virginia is why he is against this line-item veto. Well, perish the thought. That has never guided my thinking. I feel more strongly about what the Congress has done in enacting this piece of trash, the line-item veto, than I do about all of the pork that those hollows could possibly hold among the high and majestic mountains of what I consider to be the greatest State in the Union, whose motto is `Moutaineers are always free.' 
Mr. President, could the Senate of the United States give away its advice and consent power? No. Could the Senate of the United States give away its power to try impeachments? No. There are other powers in the Constitution that this Senate and the Congress, as the case may be, cannot give away. And I maintain that the same is true with the legislative power that is set forth in the first sentence of the Constitution. 
There are those who would be willing to sit down with the White House, with the representatives of the President, on items that he may threaten to veto. There are Senators, there are Members of the House, who may be willing to sit down and negotiate with the White House, to come to terms, as it were, to yield to the administration on this matter or that matter, or some aspect of the appropriation which he has threatened to veto. There will be those who may very well be lured by the siren call of negotiation in order to save the project of a particular Member of the Senate or House of Representatives. 
I say to my colleagues, don't negotiate, because when an item has reached the stage of conference, I think that we have reached a stage when it is too late to negotiate. 
Some subcommittees spend weeks and months in studying appropriations bills that come under their jurisdiction. The people who sit on a particular subcommittee that has jurisdiction over a particular appropriation bill are, for the most part, experts in the subject matter of that appropriations bill. Some have had experience for years and years, perhaps even decades, in dealing with that particular appropriation. They know the subject matter well. They have worked over it. They have had their staffs work on it. They have received the budgets that have been submitted by the President. They already know what the wishes of the administration are. And from time to time they receive further guidance as to the wishes of the administration with respect to a particular project or program, or with respect to all of the items in the President's budget that are within the jurisdiction of that subcommittee. They have had all that guidance all along and it has been good. And we welcome that guidance. 
But once the subcommittees go through all of these months of labor, and with their staffs working hard on legislation, it is too late when, at the last minute, the White House sends its representatives up to Capitol Hill and says, `This is veto bait. That item is veto bait. That project is veto bait. The White House will not accept it. The White House wants thus and so. That wasn't in the President's budget.' 
Where in the Constitution are we told that the Congress may only consider items that are in the President's budget? Is that inscribed in any law, that Congress may only consider items that are in the President's budget; that Members of Congress can't add items of their own, based on the needs of their own constituents, needs which they, the elected representatives, know best? Where is it written that Congress has to be confined only to the items that are in the President's budget? Where is that set down in stone? I have never seen it in stone or in bronze, or inscribed upon any piece of granite. It just isn't there. 
I am not willing at that point, then, to sit down and be jerked around by any administration, Republican or Democrat. They are all the same, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to this matter that we are discussing. 
I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee for 6 years. I said, `There will be no politics in here, no partisanship.' When Senator Hatfield was chairman of the committee there was no partisanship. When Senator Stennis was chairman of the committee we didn't have politics in the committee. As far as I am concerned, there are no Democrats and no Republicans on the Appropriations Committee. We are all Members of the Senate and there is no partisanship. If they want to argue over politics they can do it on the floor, but we don't do it in that committee. 
And I feel that Members have just as much right under the Constitution and laws of this land, its customs, traditions and regulations--just as much right as any administration has to request appropriations for projects and programs that are deemed to be in the interests of the constituencies of the elected representatives. 
So I will not hear--I have ears, but will not hear those who exhort, `That little item you have in West Virginia is veto bait.' I say, `Go ahead, go ahead, veto it. Lay on, Macduff.' That's the way I feel about the projects of other Members. 
I want to help the President where I can help him. I want to help the administration where I can help it. There have been times when I have helped Republican administrations and Republican Presidents. But this is one Senator who will not be persuaded or swayed by threats that, `That item is veto bait. You'll have to modify it, you'll have to do it our way or the President will veto it.' 
So, Senators, don't negotiate. In so doing we legitimize what I consider to be an illegitimate end run around the Constitution of the United States. We legitimize it. That's where the administration wants us. That's where they would like to have us--under their thumb. `Oh, we've got them now, they are negotiating.' 
Finally, just a word more about the letter that I received yesterday from Director Raines, the Executive Office of the President. It says in the last paragraph, `While we strongly oppose S. 1292'--we? Who is `we'? I wish the President would have signed the letter himself. But I understand he can't sign all the mail that goes out of his office. I know who is purportedly the author of the letter. But, nevertheless it says:  
While we strongly oppose S. 1292, we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data provided to the Department of Defense. 
Now, in saying that, the President, through his 
surrogate, admits that some of the projects were canceled based on errors, based on inaccuracies, based on data that were inaccurate and provided by the Department of Defense. The administration was mistaken in exercising the veto pen, and they admit it there. 
I would like for any Senator within the range of my voice, or anybody else, to tell me how Mr. Raines, or the President, or anybody in the administration, expects to, `restore funding for those projects that were canceled as a result of inaccuracies in the data provided by the Department of Defense.' Mr. Raines says that we--I assume that he means by `we,' the personal pronoun `we,' I assume he means the President and the administration, `we'--`While we strongly oppose [this disapproval resolution] * * * we are committed to working with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were canceled. * * *' 
Now, how is the funding going to be restored? Those projects are dead. The head has been severed, the corpse has been laid out on a piece of cold marble and every drop of blood has been drained from the veins of those projects. How, then, do they propose to restore funding? How is it going to be done? The item has been canceled. The President has unilaterally exercised a legislative act and unilaterally repealed that legislation. It is dead. That project is dead. The line-item veto does not give the President the authority to restore it. It may have been an item that he canceled 5 minutes after he had signed the bill into law. He may have slept on it a while and then overnight thought, `Well, I think it might be a good idea to cancel a few more of those items,' and he cancels a few more. And the third day after the bill has become law, some of his aides come to him and say, `Mr. President, we think we have found some more. We didn't find it written in the four corners of the appropriations bill, we found it in a table. We found it in a committee report.' 
These aides will say to the President, `You know what? We have been working 36 hours and we find projects on these tables that are not in the bill. Don't look in there, Mr. President. But there are tables that were used in some hearings, or used during markup. And in those tables we have found some more items that we think you ought to consider vetoing,' 
and the President goes back and he vetoes them. Then along comes the 5th day, the 23rd hour and the 59th minute, and the President thinks, `Ah, that Bob Byrd, he said one day, he wouldn't negotiate. Can you find another item for me? I want to strike one of his projects. I'll make him rue the day he said those words.' 
In any event, those items are gone. The President cannot go back and restore them, no matter how sorry he may be. He finds from the Department of Defense data that he was mistaken; the data were wrong. It is too late. 
So how does Mr. Raines intend to work with Congress to restore funding for those projects that were cancelled? Tell me how? How do they intend to restore funding? They can't be restored by inoculation, by the use of a needle. How do they intend to restore funding? 
As I was saying earlier, they claimed that they saved x millions of dollars through these cancellations, but Senators should watch. That project that they struck out of that bill for West Virginia this year, I intend to try to put it back next year, because it can be justified. It is important to the defense of this country. It is in the 5-year plan of the Department of Defense. I intend to put it back in. 
That may be a year away. So, have they saved money? How much does one subtract from the figures that they say they save through their actions, through the President's actions in line-item vetoing these projects? As we look back a year from now, how much will they have saved when some or most of the items will have been put back into the bills we pass next year 
Many of the projects will be put back, so the President's veto of projects really won't constitute savings after all. What it will result in is perhaps increased costs because of inflation or other reasons; the items will cost more when they are put back. 
Therefore, while it warms the cockles of my heart to see in the letter from Mr. Raines that `the administration is committed to working with Congress to restore the funding for those projects that were canceled,' I shall go home wondering what is meant by that, how they will work with Congress to restore the funding. How will they do it? 
Mr. President, I hope that by introducing legislation today to restore the legislative branch to the standing and the stature that it has had for over 200 years, I hope to contribute to the welfare of my country, the well-being of our people, the perpetuation of the dream of America and the dream of a system that has its roots, not just in Philadelphia in the year 1787, but also in the colonial experience, and the history of England, roots that extend back, yes, as Montesquieu thought, even to the ancient Romans. 
I hope that we will restore the system which was given to us by our forebears and which they expected us to hand on to our sons and daughters. 
Who saves his country saves all things, saves himself and all things saved do bless him. 
Who let's his country die let's all things die, dies himself ignobly, and all things dying curse him. 
Mr. President, let us act and let us work to save our country!

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with reference to the highway bill, on yesterday I, on behalf of Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner, introduced an amendment for printing only and also for the purpose of having that amendment appear in the Congressional Record. And I was not offering the amendment in the usual sense that I was calling it up, and so consent was granted. 
At that time I indicated that there were several Senators who wished to be added as cosponsors of that proposed amendment. And I wish to add these names today to those that I stated yesterday: Senators Brownback, Campbell, Conrad, Craig, Glenn, Helms, Levin, and Kempthorne. And I wish to remove the name of Mr. Coats. That name was included in error yesterday. And so I ask unanimous consent that the Record show that the name of Mr. Coats was removed and also to indicate the additional cosponsors.

Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, I had intended to ask unanimous consent that that motion not be amendable. But I thought I should let Mr. Chafee know that I intended to make such a request. He might want to object to it. I had a right to make the motion. He could not keep me from doing that. But I wanted to get consent that it not be amendable, and I thought he had the right to know about that. And I realize he could object to that, and he will. He has told me he will object to that. 
Now, my purpose in wanting to get such consent is simply this: 60 votes are required for me to waive the points of order under the Budget Act. However, my motion would be amendable, it would be open to amendment, and such an amendment to my motion would require only a majority of votes, so that if all 100 Senators were present and voting, only 51 votes would be required to amend my motion, which, standing alone, would require 60 votes. 
If the motion to amend my motion to waive were to carry, then a simple majority could add the authors' motion to amend my motion. That would put me at a disadvantage in that it is my understanding that Mr. Domenici might make a motion, the purpose of which would be--and I don't know that he is going to do this --he would repeal the gas tax, the 4.3-cent tax. That may or may not be based on rumor. I haven't heard Senator Domenici say that, but I anticipate that such a motion or some other motion might be made. If that were the case, if that were to be adopted by a majority vote, I would be put at a great disadvantage in trying to get 60 votes for my motion, so I do not intend to make that motion at this time. 
But it may be that at some future time we can work out something whereby I could get a vote on a motion to waive points of order under the Budget Act against my amendment. That is a motion that is made quite frequently here. Sometimes it carries, sometimes it doesn't. So I intended to make that motion because I feel that the sponsors of our amendment have 60 or more votes in support of such motion and in support of such amendment. 
Several Senators have indicated to me and have indicated to my three cosponsors that while they will not cosponsor the amendment, they will support it, so that we feel we would have more than 60 votes. But I am not at this time going to make the motion for the reasons I have stated.

Mr. BYRD. On another matter, I'm informed that on yesterday the distinguished, the very distinguished, Senator from Rhode Island reached his 75th birthday. Oh, to be 75 again! I experienced that happy occasion 5 years ago. Today is the 23rd of October. In 27 more days I will reach my 80th birthday. Hopefully the Senate will be out of session because I don't want anything said about it. 
But I must congratulate this crusty New Englander, whom I admire hugely, on his having reached his 75th birthday. He is a great American. He is truly a fine Senator. As a man he is a real man. He is honest, and he is one who deals fairly with his colleagues right up on the board, straight across the board, nothing under the board, and he says what he thinks. If he agrees with one, he will agree; if he doesn't, he will say so, but he won't go out of this Chamber in any fit of distemper. It is a matter to be stated, and that is it. 
So I admire John Chafee. The people of his State are fortunate in having a man like John Chafee here. I think we are all fortunate in having a Senator like John Chafee. I greatly admire him. 
Let me just recall a few lines to a little poem titled the `Multiplication Table of Happiness.' I hope I can repeat it, having focused my thoughts on the line-item veto, the highway bill, and on the various other matters today. 
Count your garden by the flowers, 
Never by the leaves that fall; 
Count your days by the sunny hours, 
Not remembering clouds at all. 
Count your nights by stars, not shadows; 
Count your life by smiles, not tears; 
And on this beautiful October afternoon, 
Count your age by friends, not years. 
Now, after the distinguished Senator makes a response, if he feels that he has to--he doesn't--but if he wants to say anything--I saw him start to rise--then I have a question back on the highway bill I wish to ask him.

Mr. BYRD. That is right. And I am glad the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, has pointed that out. I have had several Senators say, for one reason or another, they would not cosponsor the amendment but that they intended to vote for it when the time comes. I am glad the Senator has brought that to the attention of the Senate. 
The reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA II as it is often referred to, will set the authorization levels for the next 6 years for major portions of our national transportation system. And I congratulate the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, for his decision to take up this 6-year bill rather than the 6-month extension proposed by the other body. 
In the end, however, the committee did not report a bill that in my view provides sufficient highway funding authorizations for either the Appalachian Development Highway System or the entire National Highway System. 
The levels reported were constrained by the allocation of budget authority provided to the Committee on Environment and Public Works by the budget resolution. And that allocation does not allow anywhere near the levels of highway authorization that can be supported by the highway trust fund revenues over the coming 6 years, nor the levels that are seriously needed to prevent further deterioration in our National Highway System. 
Senators will recall that last year I, along with Senator Gramm and other Senators, urged the leadership to allow us an opportunity to vote on an amendment to a tax measure to transfer the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax which was going toward deficit reduction into the highway trust fund where it could be used for increased highway and transit spending in the coming years. At the request of both the majority and minority leaders, I deferred offering such an amendment during last year's session. 
On May 22 of this year, I joined 82 other Senators in voting for an amendment by Senator Gramm in support of transferring the 4.3 cents gas tax--Mr. President, I think I left my cough drops in the office. I can assure all Senators, however, I do not have whooping cough nor do I have consumption, but I have had a severe cold. If I could proceed, I will do so by rereading the sentence that I stumbled on. 
Earlier this year, I joined 82 other Senators in voting for an amendment by Senator Gramm in support of transferring the 4.3 cents gas tax to the highway trust fund and spending it on our rapidly deteriorating transportation systems. 
And then on July 14, I joined with 82 other Senators and expressed in a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle, as well as to the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Roth and Moynihan, the view that additional funding for transportation is urgently needed. 
We 83 Senators urged that the conferees on the Reconciliation Act retain the Senate's transfer of this gas tax into the highway trust fund so that it could then be used for additional transportation spending in the future rather than being applied toward deficit reduction. 
Ultimately, the balanced budget agreement did include the transfer of the 4.3 cents gas tax into the highway trust fund, beginning October 1, 1997. And as a result, the highway account of the highway trust fund will receive additional revenues totaling almost $31 billion over the next 5 fiscal years. 
One would think that the budget agreement would have taken this additional revenue into account in setting the allocations of budget authority for the pending 6-year highway bill. Instead, under the reported bill, the cash balances in the highway trust fund will grow massively over the next 6 years. 
The Congressional Budget Office tells us that under the committee reported bill the balance in the highway trust fund will be just over $25.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 1998. And according to CBO, that trust fund balance will grow each year thereafter, to an unprecedented level of almost $72 billion by the end of fiscal year 2003. In other words, if we accept the levels of contract authority provided in the reported bill for the next 6 years, we will have accomplished nothing by placing the 4.3 cents gas tax into the highway trust fund other than to build up these huge surpluses which have the effect of masking the Federal deficit. 
I have called for increased levels of infrastructure investment for years. And yet, despite my pleas and despite the needs of our States and of our constituents, we in the Congress have allowed much of the Nation's physical infrastructure to fall further and further into disrepair. 
As the chart to my left shows, the Federal spending for infrastructure as a percentage of all Federal spending, 1980 through 1996, has significantly declined since 1980. And it was more than 5 percent at that time. And as of 1996, it is less than 3 percent. 
So in that year--in that year--Federal spending on highways, mass transit, railways, airports, and water supply and waste water treatment facilities amounted to just over 5 percent of total Federal spending. But as I have already pointed out, our 1996 Federal spending on these same infrastructure programs had dropped to less than 3 percent of total Federal spending--less than 3 percent of the total Federal spending. 
Nowhere is there infrastructure investment more inadequate than on our Nation's highways. Our National Highway System carries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. The 
construction of our national interstate system represents perhaps the greatest public works achievement of the modern era. But we have allowed segments of our National Highway System to fall into serious disrepair.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have read and heard some things that are being said about the amendment that do not conform to the proper rules of exactitude. I don't say it is intentional. I think some of these things have been said, perhaps all, through a misunderstanding. I am willing to see it in that way. 
There is a great deal of misinformation that has been spread. I can understand why, to some extent. The amendment has not been available for Senators to read. Now it is available, and Senators and their staffs will be able to read for themselves. 
It does not bust the budget. It will not intrude upon other programs. It will not mean that other programs will be cut. 
I have read a letter or memo recently which indicated certain other programs--by the way, many of them are funded by my own Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of the Interior, and I have supported those programs for years and years and intend to continue to support them. I would not vote to cut them. It would not result in the cutting of any programs. 
I can think of those two things in particular. As we go along further in the debate, there will be other matters that I hope can be straightened out and the light of truth can be focused on them. 
If the Senator thinks of other things being said, I will be happy to respond.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I would view that happening with some disappointment, if not sadness. I hope that no effort will be made to repeal the gas tax. If that happens, that would mean an increase in the deficit. And if the author of such an amendment happens to think that that would bar the amendment that has been offered by the distinguished Senator and two others of my colleagues, and myself, and has been cosponsored by 37 additional Senators--if the author of such an amendment thinks for a moment that that would bar the carrying into the effect of the amendment we have been discussing, that Senator would be sadly mistaken because there are moneys in the trust fund sufficient to carry out the purpose of the amendment that I am offering, or will be offering at the appropriate time, which I have sent to the desk for printing. So, No. 1, it would increase the deficit. No. 2, it would have no effect on the amendment that is being offered by the other Senators and I.

Mr. BYRD. Let's go back to 1990 just a bit. The distinguished Senator has specificated the 4.3 cents. Let's go back to 1956, when I was in the Congress. We passed the interstate highway bill during the Eisenhower administration and I voted for it. We passed legislation providing for a highway trust fund and for taxes on fuels that would be deposited into that highway trust fund. And it was clearly understood by the American public then that that money was going to come back to the public in meeting their highway and other transportation needs. So that thought was thoroughly ingrained into the minds and hearts and pocketbooks of the American people more than 40 years ago. 
Now, we come up to 1990, 34 years subsequent thereto, and we go to the meeting that was held over at Andrews Air Force base. I was part of that meeting. We passed the legislation as part of a package. President Bush entered into that agreement. I believe that former Speaker Foley was there and was part of it. Several us were there. A part of that package provided that 2.5 cents of the fuels taxes be for deficit reduction, temporarily, and that we would put it into a trust fund. That was in 1990. It was to go back into the trust fund in 1995. 
Tomorrow, I am going to lay a clearer outline in the Record. But I know that our friends--and they are our friends; I consider them friends--are going to argue that the American people did not understand this money to be used for transportation needs, that the American people, all along, have known otherwise. But that is not the case. I go back to 1956, and there are people who were infants at that time--I should even say babies, some who hadn't been born yet who, for the next 34 or 36 years after that period were paying taxes on gasoline at the pump and who believe clearly and had good reason to believe because that is what they were told and that was a fact, that those gas taxes were going to be returned to the States by way of transportation infrastructure. So that's what the American people have been told. We know now, and it has been made clear in a recent study titled, `What Americans Think About Federal Highway Investment Issues.' This is presented by the Transportation Construction Coalition Commission' Opinion and Survey. 
It is not surprising then that fully 75 percent of Americans say that the United States should use the gas tax exclusively to pay for road and bridge improvements and not on nontransportation programs. Fully 71 percent of Americans want the $6 billion in gas tax revenues, now spent on nontransportation programs, shifted to highways and bridge safety improvements. Indeed, 69 percent of the majority say the U.S. Government should place an even higher priority on highway and bridge improvements of any type than it does now. 
So I thank the distinguished Senator for asking the question. I say, yes, there was a brief interlude in those years between 1956 and 1997 when some of the gas taxes were to be used on reduction of the deficits. But that is not the case now, and it was not the case for 34 years prior to the year 1990.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I call the attention of the Senator to a letter dated October 9th, signed by Mr. Chafee and by Mr. Domenici, to colleagues, in which the two Senators promise that there will be an amendment forthcoming. They even enclose an one-page summary of their amendment. And they say, `We hope that we can have your support for this important matter.' So on October 9th they had an amendment. That was before the recess occurred. 
They had an amendment, apparently, then, because they sent this to all their colleagues. I don't believe I received one. Maybe I did. I'm not sure. 
In any event, they had the amendment then. Why have they waited until this date? They had it on October 9th. Today is October the 22nd, and we still don't see the amendment. But that is not so important. 
May I say to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island that the States know that they may not get the full authorized level. They never did under ISTEA, under ISTEA I, in previous years. They didn't get the authorized level. 
May I also add I will be glad to join with the Senator and with Mr. Domenici in raising the caps. I will be happy to do that at the proper time, and I will urge that that be done. But there is time for that, yes. 
Yes, the pressure is going to increase. No doubt about it. The pressures will increase because the people are going to want to get what they have been promised. Say what you like, but on May 22, 83 Senators voted that 4.3 cents should be returned to the trust fund and be spent on highway needs. That was 5 months ago. Only half of the task has been done, the transfer of the tax, but no spending of that revenue is currently authorized. So, I think when the people out in the various States, the hills and hollows, the seashores, read about this amendment they are, indeed, going to increase pressure to have us live up to the commitment that we know has been made and which was being urged by 83 Senators on May 22nd. 
I thank my good-natured friend, Mr. Chafee. He is always very good natured, humorous, pleasing to get along with. I enjoy serving with him. I thank him for yielding.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which was enacted as part of the balanced budget agreement, included a provision which ended the use of the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax for deficit reduction and instead placed this tax into the Highway Trust Fund beginning on October 1, 1997. That was a very important first step in restoring integrity to the Highway Trust Fund. It ended the practice of using any Federal gasoline taxes for deficit reduction. This Senator was not alone in seeking to end the practice of using Federal gasoline taxes for deficit reduction. On July 14 of this year, I joined 82 other Senators in signing a letter addressed to the Senate majority and minority leaders, as well as the chairman and ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senators Roth and Moynihan, and that letter is fairly brief.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the important first step, as I say, which we 83 Senators sought in our letter has now been achieved; namely, the transfer of the 4.3 cents per gallon gasoline tax from deficit reduction into the Highway Trust Fund. I believe it was Senator Gramm who offered the amendment to do that. He offered that amendment in the Finance Committee and the Finance Committee adopted that amendment. So that was accomplished in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Unfortunately, the six-year ISTEA reauthorization bill reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee does not allow the use of one penny--not one copper penny--of this 4.3 cents gas tax for highway construction over the next six years. In effect, it allows these additional gas tax revenues to build up huge surpluses over the next six years. The time has come to put our money where our mouth is. We either mean it or we don't mean it when we write letters urging our leadership not only to place the 4.3 cents per gallon gas tax into the Highway Trust Fund, but also to take the next step and allow it to be used in the ISTEA bill before the Senate. 
Did we place the 4.3 cents gas tax into the trust fund simply so that the unspent balance of the trust fund could skyrocket to historic levels, while our bridges crumble, while our constituents sit in ever-worsening traffic jams, and while congestion chokes off the economic potential of our Nation? Is that what we meant? That was not my intention in championing the transfer of this tax, and I don't believe it was the intention of my colleagues, those who supported placing the revenue into the Highway Trust Fund. 
And so, today, three of my colleagues and I--Senators Gramm, Warner, and Baucus--are joining in saying to the Senate that we are preparing an amendment to the pending ISTEA bill to authorize the use of the full amount raised by the highway account share of the 4.3 cents gas tax for highway infrastructure and bridge programs over fiscal years 1990-2003. Over the life of this bill, this will mean that an additional $31 billion in contract authority will be made available for the National Highway System. 
Mr. President, we must do more to address the continuing and destructive trend of Federal disinvestment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. According to the Federal highway administration, our investment in our Nation's highways is a full $15 billion short each year, just to maintain the current inadequate conditions of our National Highway System. Put another way, we would have to increase our national highway investment by more than $15 billion a year to make the least bit of improvement in the status of our national highway network each year. 
Now, as I say, joining me in offering this amendment as principal cosponsors are Senators Gramm, Baucus, and Warner. Although our amendment is still in the process of being drafted, we nevertheless have reached agreement as to the distribution of formula funds among the various States.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I encourage all Members to review carefully these tables. They will show that each and every State in the Nation will receive a sizable boost in funding under this amendment. Each and every State will receive increases under the same percentage distribution called for in the underlying bill. 
We have not put together a new formula in this amendment. For the donor States, the amendment still ensures that they will receive a minimum of 90 percent return on their percentage contribution to the Highway Trust Fund. Moreover, our amendment, like the committee reported bill, utilizes 10 percent of the total available resources for discretionary purposes. Increased discretionary amounts of contract authority will be available for the Multi-State Trade Corridors initiative, as well as the 13-State Appalachian Highway Development System. 
Mr. President, we understand that a point of order will be raised against this amendment by its opponents. But I think it is important to remind Members that the bill before us is not an appropriations bill; it is an authorization bill. A point of order lies against this amendment because it causes the Environment and Public Works Committee to exceed the levels that they can authorize to be spent. Adoption of this amendment will not change the scoring of the deficit by one thin dime. 
Opponents of this amendment claim that the increased highway spending authorized by the amendment will cause drastic cuts over the next 5 years in other discretionary spending. Included on the possible list for elimination or drastic cuts--I am talking about a list that I understand has been circulated by opponents--are such things as Navy ship building, law enforcement, Section 8 housing, EPA, National Forest Service, Title I education, Head Start, NIH, and on and on. 
Mr. President, that argument is an obvious red herring. First of all, because highway construction requires a number of years to complete projects, the amount of outlays that would be necessary in the discretionary portion of the budget to pay for the pending amendment is not $30 billion. We are told instead by the experts at the CBO that the figure is $21.6 billion. 
Secondly, the enactment into law of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment will not cause any cut in any Federal program. Let me say that again. The enactment into law of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment will not cause any cut in any Federal program. 
In other words, each year's transportation appropriations bill from fiscal years 1999-2003 will contain an obligation limit for total highway spending. That limitation will be set each year in light of the circumstances being faced by the Appropriations Committees in any particular year. Let me put it another way. If we do not adopt this amendment, we will have precluded, for the next 5 years, any consideration of additional highway spending. 
Third, regarding the question of outlay caps on discretionary spending, I fully support and will strongly urge the Budget Committee chairman and the Senate to include in the budget resolution for fiscal year 1999 the necessary provisions to increase discretionary caps for the following 5 years if the economy continues to perform, so that those savings will accrue. As Senators are aware, since the adoption of the balanced budget agreement earlier this year, the projections of revenues have dramatically increased and the projections for spending have been dramatically cut. The result is a far better forecast than was thought to be the case even when we all voted for the balanced budget agreement this past spring. In fact, OMB's recent midsession review now projects revenues over the next 5 years to be $129.8 billion greater--greater--than those projected in the balanced budget agreement. On the spending side of the budget--and this is important--the forecast is also much brighter than it was a few short months ago. Compared to the balanced budget agreement, OMB now projects in its midsession review that total 
spending over the period 1998-2002 will be $71.6 billion less than was projected in that agreement. 
Our amendment will provide that if the savings and spending for fiscal 1998-2002, which I have just identified, are still projected to exist in connection with the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution, and if that budget resolution calls for using any of those spending savings, then those spending savings must go toward fully funding the highway program. 
In conclusion--and I say `in conclusion' because I only intended to take 15 minutes of the hour, I am not here to debate this amendment this afternoon. There will be plenty of time for that. Nobody is going to run for the doors when that time comes. There will be plenty of time to debate it when my colleagues and I have fully fleshed out the amendment. But we wanted to put Senators and the country on notice that we have an amendment, and we wanted to do that before this upcoming recess begins. 
Let me point out again that our amendment would provide the authorization of an additional $31 billion of contract authority within a 5-year period, 1999-2003. It doesn't add to the deficit. It will call for a consideration, in the fiscal year 1999 budget process, of using additional spending savings to cover the outlays that will occur from the contract authority provided in this amendment. 
So I urge all colleagues to favorably consider this amendment during the next week, look at the tables, and understand that your State--I am talking to all 100 Senators, to each of them individually--your State will have its highway moneys increased under this amendment. Your State will benefit from this amendment. So I hope that you will examine the benefits that will accrue to your State in additional highway spending under this amendment. 
Mr. President, let me, in yielding the floor, thank my three colleagues who are the main cosponsors of the amendment. 
Let me also thank the two leaders for allowing us to impinge upon the time of the Senate at this point for a whole hour if it is needed. 
Let me say to all Senators who want to debate our amendments that there come a time to debate it. This is an important amendment. This is a major amendment, and its importance to the country cannot be exaggerated. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the remaining time let me also thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and others on the committee who worked long and hard, in putting together the bill that was reported. 
Now, I have discussed with the distinguished chairman of the committee, the need of the Appalachian corridor States for additional moneys, and that need hasn't been met by this bill. The distinguished chairman from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, came to my office and listened to my concerns. He listened courteously, and I thank him for the consideration that he gave me. But we have a bill here that does not meet those needs that have languished for 31 years. So I feel compelled to do what I can for the Appalachian States and the people therein who have been promised for 31 years that those Appalachian corridors would be funded. I feel the need to do what I can to advance their cause. 
And other Senators have come to me saying, `We need more money. We need more money.' Six years ago, when we had the ISTEA bill before the Senate, I found, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I found $8 billion, a little over $8 billion which enabled the Senate to get off the dime, as it were, where it was stalled. That bill wouldn't move. So we divided the $8 billion, half I think among the donor States and half to those States which had acted to increase the resources for transportation within their own borders, such as my own State, which had raised its gasoline tax. It had done more than many of the other States had done within the respective borders of those States to try to meet those needs. 
So, I was able in that instance to find that $8 billion, so Senators have again come to me and said listen, we need more money. We need more money. So I have done my best to find that money. 
There will be a time, as I have said, when we will debate this matter. But I did want to thank the distinguished chairman for his work and I hope he will understand the necessity that compelled me to try to get more contract authority for highway construction all over this country. I will be ready to do my best to defend the amendment when we are ready to introduce it. 
Mr. President, at this time I would like to state the names of additional Senators who have indicated they want to cosponsor the amendment: Mr. Akaka, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Ford, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Robert Kerrey, Mr. Harry Reid, Mr. Shelby. That completes the list as of now. 
I urge all Senators who, having heard this discussion today and who, feeling that they would like to be cosponsors--I urge them to be in touch with my office, Mr. Gramm's office, Mr. Warner's, or Mr. Baucus', and let us know that.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman has asked a pertinent question. I think I have already answered it. The amendment is still being drafted, but, in view of the fact that the Senate is about to go into recess--I understand there won't be a session here tomorrow--we, who are the chief cosponsors, felt that we ought to announce to Senators that there will be an amendment. We put tables in the Record, and at such time as the amendment is ready to be offered, all Senators will then have it made available to them. Senators are entitled to see it when it has been finished.

Mr. BYRD. As the distinguished chairman knows, the department has had some difficulty in calculating the numbers even for the bill that is before the Senate. Now we have an amendment that only last night the four chief cosponsors finally agreed upon, and it takes some time for the department to run the tables, run the figures and get them ready. Senators know that. The Senator from Rhode Island and other Senators know that. We could have waited until we came back to announce that we have an amendment, but we felt it was the better part of wisdom, because it is being talked around here. This amendment, without its having yet been produced, is already being criticized, and things are being said about the amendment that are not true. So we felt that before we go into recess we ought to make that clear, that there are mistaken conceptions of what the amendment does. We ought to set that record straight. But the amendment will be made available in due time. 
And while I am on my feet, I would like to say we ought to have an ISTEA bill this year. We ought not settle for a 6-months extension. We ought not settle for a year's bill. Next year is an election year. If we can't reach an agreement this year, how easy is it going to be to reach an agreement next year, during an election? We ought to focus our energies and our attention and our talents on promoting action on the bill this year, a full 6-year bill. 
Now, that's the best I can give the Senator in answer.

Mr. BYRD. Come one, come all. This rock will fly from its firm base as soon as I. 
Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island has made some comments questioning the fact that people in this country--I think it is a fact--the people in this country go to the gas pump and buy gasoline under the impression that their tax money goes into the highway trust fund and that it comes back to meet their transportation needs. 
Was the Senator here in 1956? I was here in 1956. I was here and I supported President Eisenhower's interstate system. I was here. My wife was buying gas at the pump then. In 1956, Congress created that highway trust fund. She was buying gas at the gas pump then, and the people were told that the gas tax was going into the trust fund tax, and that money was going to be used for highways. 
And so for over 40 years the American people have believed that their money that they were spending at the gas tank, that portion that was the Federal tax, was going into the highway trust fund. That is no Alice in Wonderland story. That is no make-believe story. That has been a fact. I voted for it 41 years ago. 
In 1990, it was diverted. That is when it was diverted, 1990. I was here. I voted for that. I went over to those long meetings that we had with Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman and Mr. Domenici and I guess Mr. Warner was there, Mr. Hatfield was there. Anyhow, Senators on both sides of the aisle were there. And we came up with a package. Yes, we diverted it. We voted to do that. 
But recently the Senator from Texas offered an amendment, which said that the gasoline tax should again go into the highway trust fund. 
So let's not break faith with the American people. They have been told it is for highways, and that is what this amendment says it will be used for if the savings are there. I just wanted to make that point. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. I have two things to say. I hear that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has an amendment. I hear that he has one. I have seen papers to that extent, memos, or letters something like that. I didn't read them, but I have seen them around the desks. So he, too, has an amendment. I haven't seen it. We four sponsors think that even though our amendment is not ready, we should clear the air and clear the record as to what it will not do, because many things are being said in the Senate about our amendment that are absolutely incorrect. I have seen some of the papers on the desks around here saying what this amendment purportedly will do. We Senators wanted to clear the record today to say that it will not do this and it will not do that and it will not do other things stated in the propaganda that is being spread. That is all. I thank the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be very brief because we have other business that is going to come before the Senate. 
Before the Senator from New Mexico leaves, the Senator talks in terms of waiting, waiting until we can consider other competing needs. We are saying, `Let's keep faith with the American people.' If there are savings, let's spend the money in the trust fund for that which the American people think it is to be spent for, not other competing needs. That is just what we are saying it is being spent now for--for other competing needs. We are saying, stop it, keep faith with the American people. Spend it for highways if it is going to be spent. 
Other competing needs--like what? Cutting taxes? Is that what it is? The distinguished Senator mentioned how the budget is going to bulge when the baby boomers get on the scene. I voted against a tax cut, Senator. I said let's put it against the deficit, let's take what you would spend on a tax cut and apply it on the budget. Let's balance the budget with it. I said I'm against a tax cut that the Republicans proposed and I'm against the cuts that the President proposed. 
Now, we are simply saying, let's spend it for highways if it is going to be spent and if the savings are there. Of course, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the members of the Budget Committee are going to make that decision. But the people need to know something now. Why do we do it now? Because, we have a highway bill before the Senate, that is why. Now is the time. Don't wait until the opportunity has passed and say, `Well, we should have done it when the highway bill was before the Senate.' Let's do it now. 
The distinguished Senator says he will welcome the debate. 
I, too, welcome the debate, and we won't be running for the mountains crying for the rocks to fall on us. When the debate comes, we will be ready. 
As I say, we just wanted to put to rest some misunderstandings that were being spread. I don't blame anybody for that. They were jumping to unmerited conclusions. We wanted to set that straight. When the time comes, the amendment will be offered, and I welcome any and all cosponsors, as do the other sponsors. I don't intend to convince my friend from New Mexico. I honor and respect him. He is one of the brightest minds I have ever seen come in this Senate, but let's keep faith with the American people. 
Ananias dropped dead, and so did Sapphira, his wife. They lied, they lied to God. I'm not saying anybody has lied, but I am saying we are not keeping faith with the American people. The American people were told by us in 1956, Senator--I was here; I was over in that other body--they were told that the money was going into that trust fund and would be coming back home to meet the transportation needs of the people. 
So, let's keep faith with the American people. And we will renew this debate on another day, I say with great respect to all my friends. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased and I am proud to join with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my friend, a friend in every sense of the word, Ted Stevens, in offering legislation to put back on the President's desk those projects which were line-item vetoed, at least those projects that Senators want to put back before the President for his consideration, and if he wants to veto that bill, he can do so, and then Congress can override or sustain his veto. 
Mr. President, I think that one of the most significant things that has happened in the history of this country was the passage of the Line-Item Veto Act. To me, it was one of the most shocking abdications of duty that Members of the Congress have committed. I am not here today to say `I told you so,' but I am here today to say that this pernicious act should be repealed. 
I hope that the Supreme Court of the United States will strike it down, but there has to be a case brought. I attempted that with other colleagues in both Houses, and the Supreme Court, as everybody knows, said we didn't have standing, even though the act itself anticipated that such a case would be brought by Members of Congress. 
I am not here today to argue that. But I am here today to just take a few minutes to point out for the record why the Line Item Veto Act is an unconstitutional act. No matter what the Supreme Court ultimately says, I will always think it is an unconstitutional act. The distinguished chairman has already stated the law and what the instructions were in that law as to what actions Congress may take and when, and all of that. So I will not attempt to go into that. He has already indicated what was brought out in the hearings this afternoon. One thing was that the administration's right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. 
I was called by Mr. Raines on Monday as to the one item that I had that was line-item vetoed. I was told that certain criteria governed the actions of the President in using the line-item veto pen. I was told that the one item that is to be located in West Virginia was, in the face of the governing criteria, to be line-item vetoed. I stated to Mr. Raines, `That is an incorrect statement of the case. This item is in the Defense Department's 5-year plan, and the design has already been started. It is under way. So your criteria don't fit this project.' And he indicated that he would have to take another look, therefore, and asked me to send down the papers from which I was reading, which I did, and he indicated that he would get back to me, which he did not. And I don't fault him for not getting back to me. He has other things to do, I am sure. 
But what I am saying is that this action on the part of the administration was an abuse even of a bad law; an abuse even of a bad law. 
In the very first section of the very first article of the Constitution these words are to be found. It is one sentence. Section 1: 
All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. 
That is very plain. It says that only the Congress has the constitutional authority to make laws. `All legislative powers' --not `some powers'; not a `few powers'; but `All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.' It doesn't say the President may share in that. The President doesn't have any lawmaking power. He is limited to the veto power insofar as making the laws are concerned--the veto power as set forth in the Constitution of the United States. 
So he has no lawmaking power. The Constitution states the limits of his veto authority. 
It states in section 7 of article I that, and I read: 
Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. 
I will not read the rest of the language dealing with the veto. 
But Congress in the passing of the Line-Item Veto Act went far afield from the Constitution of the United States. Congress in the Line Item Veto Act said, in essence, that when the President signs an appropriation bill into law, he has 5 days thereafter during which time he can cancel out certain portions of that bill which has already become law. 
So that is what he did in this instance. He signed into law a bill, and then, unilaterally, he came along 5 days later and changed that law. He amended it. He struck out certain items. If that bill were before the Senate and if Senator Stevens or Senator Grassley or Senator Bennett or any other Senator wished to move to strike an item in the bill, which, in this case, was to be at Camp Dawson in Preston County, WV--if any one of those Senators moved 
to strike that item, they could do it. But before they could succeed in striking that item, they would have to have a majority of the Senate to support them by a vote. 
The vote could be by voice. It could be by division. It could be by rollcall. But they would have to have a majority of a quorum in the Senate in order to be successful in striking that item. They would not yet have fully accomplished their aim, however. A majority of the Members in a quorum of the other body would likewise have to support the striking of that item. If all 100 Senators were present, they would have to have 51 votes. If all 435 Members of the House were present, they would have to have at least 218 votes in order to successfully strike that item. A majority of each House would have to support the conference report. But in any event, in the first instance, a majority of each body would have to support the amendment in order to strike the item from the bill. 
Striking an item from a bill is amending a bill. After the President has signed a bill into law, then under this Line-Item Veto Act, a President--Democrat or Republican, it doesn't make any difference--may after the first 10 minutes, after the first 5 minutes, after the first 2 days, 3 days, or 4 days, even on the fifth day, he may go back and singlehandedly, unilaterally cancel out an item in the law; in other words, strike it out; change the law. He could, if he wished to, line-item out 90 percent of the law, which in that form, as a bill, would probably not have passed either body. But one man, or woman, if it should be, as the President of the United States may unilaterally amend a bill. That is amending a bill. 
The Senator from Iowa if he offers a motion to strike my item from the bill is moving to amend the bill. He is pursuing the legislative process. That is the lawmaking process. He is amending a bill. As I have already said, he can't do it alone. His vote only counts for 1 out of 100. He has to have a majority. 
But not so with the President. The President may amend unilaterally, after he signs the bill into law. According to the Constitution, if he approve the bill, he shall sign it. Well, he must have approved it, or he wouldn't have signed the bill. He approved it. He signed the bill into law. Up to 5 days later, he may go back and change that law unilaterally. And that is what he did in this instance. He changed the law unilaterally. He struck out Camp Dawson. 
Did Senators really intend to give one man in the White House that kind of power, that kind of legislative power? Can they really believe that the Framers who wrote this Constitution would have ever intended that that be done? It is mind-boggling--mind-boggling. It is mind-boggling to me to think that a majority of these two Houses would give any President--any President, Republican or Democrat--that kind of power. And with that kind of power the President, be he Republican or Democrat, holds the sword of Damocles over the head of every Senator and every House Member. 
Am I going to vote against a certain treaty, or some nomination? The President may say, `Look, you have an item in the bill. You have done a great job. You have done a great job for the State of West Virginia. I am really proud of you. The people down in your State love you. You did this, you did that. And I want you to have this item. But can we bargain a little here? Can we negotiate a little bit? Can you help me on what I want that is in the bill? Can you help me on this nomination?' Or whatever. `Maybe we can reach an amicable agreement here where you will get your item, and I will get mine.' 
Now, I do not want to say that I am not willing to listen to the administration. We do that all the time when the subcommittees bring these bills to the floor. The subcommittees on appropriations work for weeks in hearings. They listen to witnesses. They talk with their staffs. They look over the correspondence. They study the needs of the various agencies and departments. And then they get together and they mark up the bill in the subcommittee. Then it goes to the full committee. Then it comes to the Senate. During all of this time, the administration is telling us what they want and what they don't want. We understand that. We know all about that. We know what they want and what they don't want. But it may be the collective judgment of the subcommittee to do otherwise. So the subcommittee brings this bill to the full committee, and it is then brought to the Senate. And we act on it, and it goes to conference. Then what happens? 
Well, I have been treated to just a little bit of it lately. This is no surprise to me. We pass an amendment like this--a bill like this--and give it to any President. He will hold over your head a hammer. So, as we go to conference, the administration people come into the conference, or they come into our offices, or wherever they meet with the leadership, and they say, `Look, this item the President will veto. If that item is in there, the President is going to veto it. This item we want. This item the President will veto unless you modify it.' 
I knew that would be the situation in which we were going to find ourselves once this Line-Item Veto Act was passed. 
So, as far as I am concerned, it impinges upon a Senator's or a House Member's freedom of speech. They have to be a little bit more careful about what they say about any administration. 
It impinges on a Senator's freedom to act in accordance with the wishes of the constituents who send him here. And to that extent he is that much less a free man, less able to exercise his own independence. The distinguished Senator from Alaska has said we do not intend to negotiate. We intend to send this down to the White House if the majority of each body will vote for it. 
Let me say here what I said in the committee today. If the President wants to line-item veto a West Virginia item, I am not going to negotiate with the administration. 
Negotiating is over as far as I am concerned. When the subcommittee works its will, has its hearings, marks up its legislation, brings it to the full committee, the full committee acts, amends, modifies, changes, or whatever, and when the House does the same, when the collective wisdom and judgment of the subcommittee and the full committee and both Houses has been reached, if the President wants to veto it, go to it. Why should we sit down and negotiate in order to keep him from wielding his line-item veto pen? Let him use his veto pen only as instructed in the original Constitution. Let him use it. And then Congress can work its will. It can either sustain his veto or override it, but there should be no negotiating. 
That is what every administration will want us to do. They want us to get in a position where we will continue to negotiate and they will continue to ratchet us down, they will continue to get what they want, but they want you to negotiate for whatever your constituents need. Whatever your constituents need, how you feel about your constituents, that is negotiable. Then they throw out that threat: `Well, the President will veto that.' The President will line item that out. Well, so what! `Lay on, Macduff; And damn'd be him that first cries `Hold, enough.' 
We like to know what the administration is thinking. It is worthwhile to have their judgment. It helps to guide us in our deliberations. But once both bodies have acted and get into conference, then for the administration to come up here and say, `Well, this is vetoable, if you don't change that. We don't like it,' I am not for negotiating now. Let the President use his line-item veto pen. I hope that Senators and House Members who voted for the line-item veto will get their bellies full. I hope they get a bellyful of it and they probably will, because this is just a start. There are several other appropriations bills coming along. 
Think of the time that this costs. Senator Stevens held a hearing today, had a good attendance, a lot of Senators were there. They weren't elsewhere doing other things which were important likewise. It took a lot of their time. It took the time of the generals and admirals who were up from the Defense Department, and that is going to be repeated over and over and over again. Look at the time it is taking now. We have already taken time. The subcommittee took time. The full committee took time. And there are Members on those subcommittees and full committee who have great expertise in legislative areas under the jurisdiction of those subcommittees. And then all that goes for naught because a President, Republican or Democrat, wants this or wants that or does not want to go along with a Member whose constituents feel there are needs to be met and acts accordingly. 
The administration has been given a hammer to use over the heads of Senators and could threaten anything that a Senator wants as a way to get the President's way on unrelated matters. It greatly enhances the President's bargaining position in the legislative process. Go home tonight, all Senators, and before you close your eyes in slumber, think of what we have done. We have given one man, who puts his britches on just as I put mine on--one leg at a time--we have said you may amend a bill unilaterally. You do not have to worry about a majority in the other body or a majority here. You may amend a bill all by yourself. You may strike an item out. That is amending a bill. You are the super lawmaker. 
Not by this Constitution he isn't. I cannot understand how, or whatever got into the Members' minds when they voted to give any President the line-item veto. But it is done. It is done. I hope they will think now and that somebody will bring a case and the Supreme Court will strike down this infernal, pernicious, illegitimate gimmick. 
But in the meantime, I will follow the Senator from Alaska. If he gets ready to introduce legislation to repeal the Line Item Veto Act, I am ready. I am ready to join him. Just go home and read once again, Senators who are listening, section 1 of article I. `All legislative powers herein granted'--and if those legislative powers are not herein granted, they do not exist. `All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States . . .' 
And then go over to section 7 of article I and read the language: `Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve,' meaning the bill, the resolution, `he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.' It does not say he may amend it unilaterally. `If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.' 
Now, that is the Constitution. And we have no right as Members by legislation to give any President the right unilaterally to amend a bill. We do not have that power. I do not think Congress has the power. I do not think it can give away its constitutional power to make all laws. 
There is only one other thing I would say, and then I am going to sit down. I have said already there is a strong probability that the Senate will have to consider items that it has already considered in the committee process over and over again, amounting to a tremendous waste of precious time. Senator Inouye cited a number of vital systems that have been added by the Congress to the defense bill over the years such as greatly increasing the purchase of stealth fighters, the Osprey helicopter, C-130 aircraft, C-17's and other systems which at the time were opposed by the administration and probably would have been subject to the line-item veto and killed. Where would we then have been during Desert Storm? 
This is a strong case that the administration does not have a corner on wisdom, and that if it uses the line-item veto to simply protect its budget as delivered, we will lose the great benefit of that wisdom and shortchange the historic contributions that have been made over the years. 
I thank all Senators for indulging me. I have fought this battle over and over and over again. And I am willing to fight it over and over and over again. I do not believe that I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, then only to turn around and vote, in violation of that Constitution, to give any President the unilateral right, power or prerogative to, in essence, amend a law by striking an item. 
I hope more than anything else, before God sees fit to call me home, that the line-item veto will be struck down either by the Supreme Court or by the Congress itself. That is my prayer.

Mr. BYRD. No, I do not suggest you yield the floor. 
I just wanted the recognition to state for the record that I do have a measure to the bill, to the ISTEA bill. I wanted all Senators to be aware of that. I would like them to take a look at my amendment when it is ready. Before they make any judgment to go with anybody else's amendment, I have an amendment that I think will appeal to them, to every State. But the leader has already stated that I have an amendment, so that takes care of that situation. 
Secondly, I just want to say that whenever we can do our conference reports on appropriations, I would like to do them. They are privileged. I would like to get as many of those bills down as we can get down so we do not have to include them in a continuing resolution. 
If the President is going to item veto any of them, I want him to do that in ample time for us to offer a resolution to put those items right back on his desk. If he wants to veto that, OK. He has that right under the Constitution. We, likewise, have the right to either override or sustain. But I would like for him to have time to veto those. 
I hate that item veto with a passion. But it is there, until the Supreme Court knocks it down. I cannot see how the Supreme Court can avoid knocking that--killing that bill which most Senators voted for, which most Members voted for, but it is coming home to roost now.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that concerns me and, in my opinion, does not receive enough attention, enough attention or enough action by the Congress. This is the issue of youth alcohol use. It is a serious problem in the District of Columbia, as it is throughout the Nation. 
Alcohol is the drug that is used most by teens. If we are concerned about drug use by teens, this is the drug that is used most by teens. Information compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse indicates that, among children between the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetime experimented with alcohol. 
Let me say that again. Among children between the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetime experimented with alcohol. That is not a very good reflection on their parents, I would say. In the last month, approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders--now, get that--in the last month, approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. What are we coming to? Eighth graders--8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. What does that say about the parents? What does it say about this Nation of ours? Eighth graders are generally 13-year-olds. Every State has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. Unfortunately, though, two out of every three teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages. 
Alarmingly, junior and senior high school students drink 35 percent of all wine coolers and consume 1.1 billion cans of beer a year. Yet, again, every State and the District of Columbia have laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. Alcohol is a factor in the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds: accidents, homicides, and suicides. In approximately 50 to 60 percent of youth suicides, alcohol is a factor. Alcohol is involved. In 1995, there were 1,666 alcohol-related fatalities of children between the ages of 15 and 19. Drinking and driving kills. Links have also been shown between alcohol use and teen pregnancies. And links have been shown between alcohol use and sexually transmitted diseases. 
According to a Washington Post article from July 17, 1997, entitled, `The Corner Store,' the District outranks every State with regard to deaths and diseases related to alcohol. In addition, according to Joye M. Carter, chief D.C. medical examiner, in 1993, 50 percent of the homicide victims had consumed alcohol. 
In order to begin to address the distressing cost of alcohol to this city, and its children, I am offering three commonsense amendments to this bill, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1998. The amendments I have sent already to the desk. 
The first one would prohibit alcoholic beverage advertisements on billboards, signs, and posters and other forms of advertising in certain publicly visible locations in the District of Columbia where children are likely to walk to school or to play. I believe this is an important, commonsense measure to help to shelter innocent children of the District of Columbia from the daily bombardment of messages tempting them to partake of alcoholic beverages. There is a lot of fuss made about advertisements concerning smoking. Nothing is said about advertisements concerning alcohol. That, apparently, is taboo. 
Competitive Media Reporting estimates that the alcoholic beverage industry spent more than $1 billion on alcohol advertising in 1995. That is an enormous amount of money, and this advertising is often crafted to particularly appeal to impressionable children. Our children are bombarded with slick and ingenious messages that drinking alcohol will lead to popularity; you will be popular; it leads even to good looks, and leads to a magnetic personality. Nothing could be further from the truth, of course. Drinking alcohol more often leads to wrecked automobiles, unwanted sex, coarse and stupid behavior, and more often than we like to contemplate, a space in the cemetery with a tombstone resting above--especially in the case of young drinkers. Ads filled with singles playing exciting outdoor sports, or sophisticated adults combining alcohol with an elegant evening out, mask the darker view of children cringing and hiding when Daddy weaves drunkenly through the door from a bleary-eyed evening spent in the company of a bottle, or several bottles. 
Similar bans have been enacted in Baltimore and Chicago to protect children in those cities. Why not here? Given the large number of liquor stores in the District and the number of signs enticing children to try a substance that they are barred from using by law, it is important that we take action now. Let us not delay and miss this opportunity to make a positive difference for the District's children. 
It is my understanding that similar legislation is currently pending before the D.C. Council. It is not clear whether the council will act expeditiously on this important matter. Thus, it is incumbent upon the Congress to provide this 
important protection to the District of Columbia's children as they walk to school and as they play in their neighborhoods. In my opinion, the amendment, although I believe it is crafted to survive legal challenges, does not go as far as I would like in protecting the District's children. I urge the council to explore additional ways to expand this protection. 
I am sure that some will challenge this amendment, arguing that commercial speech is protected from such bans under the First Amendment. As a matter of fact, the beer industry challenged the Baltimore ordinance banning outdoor, stationary alcoholic beverage advertising which is almost identical to my amendment. The circuit court has upheld the Baltimore ordinance as constitutional. 
Children cannot readily interpret media messages. Their ability to analyze information is not yet fully developed, and, thus, they are more vulnerable to being swayed by advertisements. This fact is of particular concern when the substances being advertised are illegal for consumption by minors. According to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, in Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated versus Schmoke: 
This decision thus conforms to the Supreme Court's repeated recognition that children deserve special solicitude in the First Amendment balance because they lack the ability to assess and to analyze fully the information presented through commercial media. 
The Fourth Circuit decision goes on: 
After our own independent assessment, we recognized the reasonableness of Baltimore City's legislative finding that there is a `definite correlation between alcoholic beverage advertising and underage drinking.' We also concluded that the regulation of commercial speech is not more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interest. . . 
Mr. President, in addition to its decision, the Court determined that Baltimore's ordinance was not more restrictive than necessary to accomplish the stated goal of protecting children from alcoholic beverage advertising. 
The Court of Appeals specifically cited the ordinance's inclusion of an exemption, which is also included in my amendment, for commercial and industrial areas. According to the decision, `* * * Baltimore's efforts to tailor the ordinance by exempting commercial and industrial zones from its effort renders it not more extensive than is necessary to serve the governmental interest under consideration.' 
The exceptions to the ban included in my amendment are numerous and result in a narrowly tailored approach to achieving the goal of protecting children in areas they frequent while staying within the confines of permissible restrictions on commercial speech under the Constitution. Banning billboard advertisements for alcoholic beverages where children play and go to school are reasonable safeguards that communities can take to address youth alcohol use. So, I urge my colleagues to join me in this worthwhile and narrowly tailored effort to protect the children of our Nation's Capital. 
My second amendment, Mr. President, would increase the number of Alcohol Beverage Control Board inspectors in the District and focus enforcement on the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. The D.C. Alcohol Beverage Control Board has just three inspectors in the field in addition to their chief, who also performs inspections of alcohol outlets. These four inspectors are responsible for monitoring over 1,600 alcoholic beverage outlets. This is a sad state of affairs for a city that has more alcohol-influenced crime than any other city of comparable size. In contrast, Baltimore employs 18 regular inspectors in addition to a number of part-time inspectors. 
It is illegal for persons under the age of 21 to purchase, possess, or consume alcoholic beverages in the District. In addition, the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited. However, these laws are not being adequately enforced. 
In May of this year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest [CSPI] conducted a sting operation at small grocery and convenience stores in which alcoholic beverages are sold. The sting operation used youthful looking twenty-one-year-olds to purchase beer. In 63 percent of the cases, the young looking subjects were able to buy beer without presenting age identification--63 percent of the cases. Clearly this is not good news. It is not legal to sell alcoholic beverages to minors. The low probability of enforcement of this law results in lax age identification checks. My amendment strengthens the District's ABC enforcement efforts by bringing the number of inspectors up to a level comparable to other cities of this size. It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in this important effort to address the serious issue of alcoholic beverage sales to minors. 
My third amendment calls for the General Accounting Office [GAO] to conduct a study on the District's alcoholic beverage excise taxes. It is my understanding that the level of taxation in the District is amongst the lowest in the Nation. According to local activists concerned about the effects of alcohol consumption on the District, raising the excise tax on alcohol could be the single most effective means of reducing alcohol consumption in the District. This amendment would require the General Accounting Office to study: (1) the District of Columbia's alcoholic beverage tax structure and its relation to surrounding jurisdictions; (2) the effect of D.C.'s lower excise taxes on alcoholic beverages on consumption of alcoholic beverages in D.C.; (3) ways in which the District of Columbia's tax structure can be revised to bring it into conformity with the higher levels in surrounding jurisdictions; and (4) ways in which those increased revenues can be used to lower consumption and promote abstention from alcohol amongst young people. 
The study would also explore whether alcohol is being sold in proximity to schools and other areas where children are likely to be. In addition, would the creation of alcohol free zones in areas frequented by children be useful in deterring under-age alcohol consumption? 
These are important issues. They are important issues that ought to be explored. The information obtained in the study will be useful in determining the need for possible future adjustments of the excise taxes in the District on alcohol that might reduce the high costs that alcohol abuse imposes on the District of Columbia. 
The District of Columbia is our Nation's Capital, a centerpiece for our Nation's Government, as well as a hometown for 600,000 people. It should be a shining star in the constellation of American cities, but it is not. Sadly, that star is tarnished by neglect, abuse, and by the complex forces that hold sway over and within it. The corrosive effects of alcohol abuse further erode its beauty and grandeur. I believe that these three amendments make a positive step toward repairing the District so that it might claim its rightful place at the pinnacle of American metropolitan areas. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendments en bloc.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the President's National Security Advisor, Mr. Sandy Berger, two days ago made an important statement on U.S. policy toward Bosnia, in particular the question of keeping United States' ground forces in the region beyond June of 1998, in order to keep the peace in an area where political reconciliation has lagged behind the actual military separation of the opposing forces. It is not surprising that political, economic and social reconciliation would proceed at a pace commensurate with the levels of extensive brutality and violence which characterized the Bosnia conflict prior to the introduction of U.S.-led NATO forces two years ago. In what might be characterized as a trial balloon, Mr. Berger stated, according to the New York Times of yesterday, September 24, 1997, that the `international community' will be required to `stay engaged in Bosnia in some fashion for a good while to come.' 
The question is for how long should the United States remain while expending billions of defense dollars and risking the erosion of U.S. readiness by tying our forces down in Bosnia? The problem, as I see it, is that our European partners have said that they will not remain on the ground in Bosnia unless the United States does, and when we leave, they will. I find this to be a very unreasonable position, in that Bosnia is not paramount in the vital interests of the U.S., and at some point our European allies should consider taking the responsibility for acting as the military security force in that European country. This is not to say that the U.S. could not provide continued logistical, intelligence, and other supporting roles while the Europeans take their turn at bat in Bosnia. 
I call the attention of my colleagues to the provision in the Department of Defense conference report, Section 8132 which requires the President to certify, by May 15, 1998, his intentions regarding keeping our forces in Bosnia on the ground beyond June 30, 1998. The certification must include the reasons for the deployment, the size and duration of the deployment, the missions of our military forces, the exit strategy for our forces, the costs of the deployment, and the impact of it on the morale, retention, and effectiveness of U.S. forces. This is a very good, very complete provision, and it will trigger a debate, as it should, in this body, regarding the future policy of the United States in Bosnia.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, The President this week submitted to the Congress the `Export Expansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1997', designed to renew so-called `fast track' procedures for trade agreements. There are many issues associated with this proposal, evidenced by the reports that the White House has essentially established a `war room' to marshall the votes in the Congress to support its proposal. We all know the United States needs to be competitive in foreign markets, and we all know the administration needs to strike the best deals it can with foreign nations on behalf of American business and consumers. There is no dispute over these goals. My concern today is over the procedure which the administration wishes to incorporate in considering this proposal which is driven by the insistence by the Clinton Administration that it can only be effective in promoting U.S. trade and negotiating such agreements if the legislative vehicle we consider is subject to one up-and-down vote, after a period of limited debate. 
The administration has elevated its desire to eliminate the opportunity for the Congress to amend such enacting legislation to the stature or degree of a religious mantra. The administration seems to think that any agreement it submits to the Congress will, in fact, be amended, forcing it to renegotiate agreements it has reached with foreign nations and thereby shredding its stature as a negotiator The argument goes that fast-track authority is critical because it sends to our negotiating partners a necessary promise of good faith, that is, they will know that the deals hammered out at the negotiating table won't be dismembered by amendments in the Congress. The proposition is now being stated and restated by the administration's legions ad nauseam that without fast track all is lost, American leadership is gone, nations won't negotiate with us, our strategy on trade as a nation will fail, the sky will go dark, all life forms will perish, and on and on. These assertions are repeated at every opportunity, as if repetition really makes them valid. I say they are wild exaggerations, wild exaggerations, wild exaggerations, which underestimate both the capabilities of our negotiators and the sound judgment of the Congress of the United States. 
Mr. President, the insistence on the no-amendment strategy reveals a staggering lack of confidence on the part of the administration in its own negotiating prowess. It suggests that, heaven forbid, possible weaknesses in the agreements that are reached will be discovered and acted upon by the Congress. It shows no sense of confidence--no sense of confidence--on the part of the administration that it can prevail in arguing the merits of a particular agreement to the Congress, thereby forcing the administration to return to the negotiating table to change an agreement. From what I understand, for instance, the relative tariff barriers between the U.S. and Chile are such that an agreement reducing the Chilean barriers is desirable. Why would the Congress not want to support an agreement that is in our interest in penetrating the Chilean market, to even out the playing field on trade matters between the U.S. and Chile? 
There is no inconsistency between supporting free trade, or freer trade, as negotiated by the administration around the world, and preserving the right of the Congress not only to scrutinize the agreements reached for their worthiness, but also to question, if necessary, parts of the agreement that might appear not to be in our overall interest. If the administration does its job and negotiates sound agreements, they should be approved by the Congress as such, intact, regardless if there is `fast-track' procedure or not. The Senate is not unresponsive to arguments made by the administration that an international agreement that it has negotiated is in the national interest and that amendments could unravel it. That is not to say that if there is a flaw in the agreement that is serious enough for renegotiation, it may just be in the American national interest for the negotiators to be forced to go back to the table by the people's elected representatives and get it right. If they do the job right in the first place, renegotiation should not be necessary. 
Mr. President, one could just as easily make the case that, if the Senate retained amending authority, our negotiators might just come up with a somewhat better product, knowing that the entire agreement will be scrutinized by the elected representatives of the American people. After all, the agreements that are negotiated are presumably on the behalf of the American people, the same constituency that is represented by this Senate. On the other hand, the Senate has a responsibility to turn back amendments that might be offered representing special interests, but not the overall American interest. That is the `American Way.' Would such amendments be offered? Possibly. Would they be approved by a majority of Senate? Not if the American interest in the overall agreement would be hurt. This body has the capability of exerting leadership on trade, just as on any other matter. It can do what is in the best interests of the nation and yet not kill trade agreements through special interest amendments. 
The administration, in its insistence on a no-amendment treaty on trade indicates either a lack of confidence in the integrity of this body, or a lack of confidence on the part of its own negotiators, or just simply a desire to have its way and not have to do the hard work of convincing the Senate of the value of the agreement that it has just negotiated. 
It wants to have it the easy way, no questions asked, just present the agreement to the Senate and the House of Representatives and both bodies just roll over and sleep, sleep, sleep; not have to do the hard work of convincing the Senate of the value of the agreement that it has just negotiated. 
None of these reasons seems to justify eliminating through a special procedure the power of this body to amend if a majority of this body, or the other body, finds it necessary to do so. None of this justifies Congress' handing off its exclusive power under Article I Section 8, of the Constitution, to `regulate Commerce with foreign nations'. The amending potential is a healthy check on sloppy work. The amending potential can prevent a lazy presentation of the issues, or just plain bad negotiating results. 
Here is what one pundit says about the need for fast-track negotiating authority. According to David Rothkopf, in an article appearing in the current issue of `The New Democrat': `If the United States doesn't have fast-track authority it cannot negotiate agreements.' 
Piffle! That is sheer nonsense, `If the United States doesn't have fast-track authority it cannot negotiate agreements.' 
It goes on to say that this is supposedly a crucial tool that the `administration needs,' according to Mr. Rothkopf `to 
ensure that U.S. businesses and workers are treated fairly in the global economy.' I contend that this is all a non sequitur--it just does not follow that preserving the power of the Senate over legislation is inconsistent with America's ability to negotiate agreements. If the Congress does not want the trading environment supposedly created by particular agreements, it can vote the whole thing down. Fast track authority does not, somehow by itself, produce an immediate supporting of freer trade in the Congress. 
The administration has expended a huge amount of energy in an exercise to convince the Congress to foreswear its normal ability to amend legislation. And there will be some in here who will fall for that. The administration might be better served to put those tremendous energies into negotiating sound agreements with our negotiating partners and then selling the value of those agreements to the Congress on the merits of the agreements themselves. 
Mr. President, the highly respected head of the U.S. Trade Representative's office, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, who did such an excellent job in negotiating an intellectual property agreement with China, made a presentation before the Senate Finance committee on yesterday, Wednesday, in support of the administration's fast track proposal to the Senate. She asserted that fast track is `critical to increase access to foreign markets.' I would think, rather, that good solid provisions in a trade agreement, resulting from negotiations that focus on what is in our national interest, will increase America's access to foreign markets. Fast track consideration of poorly negotiated, badly constructed provisions would not necessarily give us increased access. Fast track of the Intellectual Property agreement with the Chinese did not make the negotiating process with the Chinese, always excruciatingly difficult, any easier. There is no substitute for tough implementation and policing of solid provisions, as Ambassador Barshefsky well knows. She is a fine negotiator, but had to negotiate that agreement twice, and it still is not clear that we have free access to the Chinese market and that the provisions safeguarding U.S. intellectual property are yet in place in the Chinese market. This has nothing whatever to do with fast track, slow track or any other track on the Senate floor. It has to do with the implementation of agreements to gain access to those markets, a very serious problem in the Pacific where the deficits we are running on our merchandise account are so huge, and growing, that they themselves are the single major factor jeopardizing the administration's so-called `free trade' philosophy. 
Mrs. Barshefsky stated in her testimony that, under fast track, the `Congress and the President work together.' We can, and do, certainly work together, day in and day out on legislation of all kinds and all subjects without, however, crippling our authority to amend those vehicles. Can one really say that we in the Senate are less serious about trade when we wish to scrutinize and carefully assess all parts of a trade agreement? Nonsense! 
Mrs. Barshefsky echoes the administration's line--here it is: `if we do not renew fast track, . . . our trading partners are not willing to wait for us to pass another bill.' Who believes that? Who will believe that? In other words they won't negotiate with us if we in the Congress don't grant the administration nonamendable rules and limited debate concessions. This is absurd! Absurd. If our trading partners believe that trade agreements with us are in their own national interest, it strains my credulity to hear that they will not negotiate trade agreements with us in the absence of fast track. From 1934 to 1974, there was no fast track, and Mrs. Barshefsky testified that in those 40 years, `Congress gave the president authority to negotiate mutual tariff reductions with our trading partners. Congress renewed that authority repeatedly over the years and successive Presidents used that authority to dramatically reduce tariff barriers around the world.' So, apparently over that 40-year period, our trading partners were willing to negotiate with us with no mention of truncated legislative rules. Everything was fine. 
Mrs. Barshefsky goes on to testify that to complete the negotiating agenda of the World Trade Organization, in government procurement, intellectual property rights, agriculture and services, where we seek enhanced global access to markets, `we must have fast track authority to enter these various talks or countries will not put meaningful offers on the table.' Now, who is so gullible as to believe that? I just do not believe this assertion, provided the agreements to be reached are in the interests of the negotiating countries. And we have to assume that that will be their goal, to reach agreements that are in their own interests. Countries seek to promote their self-interests, fast track or slow track, or whatever track, and it is the job of our negotiators to get the best deal possible. It is just a typical bargaining situation. 
Mr. President, Senators might well consider the impact of fast track-no amendment authority on the basic leverage available to U.S. negotiators. I believe the proposition that fast track enhances U.S. negotiators' capabilities is open to very serious question. It would be a matter of enhanced leverage for U.S. negotiators that a certain matter should be included in an agreement because it is a matter of strong concern to the Senate. The threat that a provision would not be supported by the Senate is a threat that I as a negotiator, if I were a negotiator, might like to have as additional leverage in a negotiation. Fast track eliminates this form of leverage. There is nobody watching over your shoulder. The administration maintains that fast track authority prohibiting amendments `tells U.S. trading partners that the United States speaks at the bargaining table with one voice and that the Congress will not seek to reopen trade agreements after they are negotiated', according to the documents accompanying the President's proposal delivered to the Senate yesterday. I think that, on the contrary, this basically weakens the leverage available to our negotiators in dealing with tough issues at the table vis-a-vis the representatives of other nations. 
It is our apparent inability to implement agreements which promise access abroad that is the central trouble in our trading situation, and the continued inability of the administration to address and begin to solve it will be the key problem--not fast track--over the next decade regarding the so-called global market. Indeed, the administration would do well to worry about congressional reaction over the next couple of years to this situation. It would do well to spend less time trying to manipulate protective devices around its agreements when they are considered by the Congress. 
Does the frenzied attempt by the administration to wrap a protective cover around the agreements it negotiates have anything to do with what has been generally acknowledged to be an overselling of the NAFTA--the North American Free Trade Agreement--a few years ago? That was oversold. The overpromising of the benefits of that agreement should instruct us that the administration needs to be more careful in evaluating what it has actually accomplished. A dose of reality and caution in marketing the prowess of our negotiators would be well advised. If the Senate provided the President the authority to negotiate trade agreements, but failed to give him protection against amendments, it would not be the end of the world. The skies would not fall, the mountains would not crumble, the waters in the oceans would not rise. It would not be the end. My bet is that a good agreement with Chile, for example, could be reached which would sail through the Congress. At the same time, one would hope that the era of the oversell would be ended. And we have had that oversell for many, many years. Every administration that comes in, Republican and Democrat, wants to have it all their way. They don't want Congress to have a say when it comes to amending a trade treaty. 
This extensive marketing job for fast track is a transparent attempt, using the most exaggerated series of assertions I have heard on any matter in a long time, to stampede the Senate into abandoning its constitutional right, its constitutional power, its constitutional prerogatives over fundamental legislation affecting the people of the United States in the market and at the mall. Now we hear a drumbeat that if you are for unlimited debate, if you are for amendable treatment of trade agreements and implementing legislation, like virtually all other kinds of legislation, you are a protectionist--you are a protectionist. 
What a bad word. That's what you are. If you want to uphold the powers of the Constitution vested in the Senate and House, if you want to uphold those powers when it comes to trade, you are a protectionist. Fie on you--a protectionist! 
If you are for shortchanging the legislative process, you are for free trade. That makes no sense whatever to me, for I am for free trade if it is fair to all parties, but I am for protecting Senate powers and responsibilities in the handling of legislation which is, after all, our constitutional duty. And what do we mean when we say, `I am for protecting the Senate's power'? It means I am for protecting the rights of the people, because those rights are given life here in this forum of the States. That is our constitutional duty, as I say. We should think long and hard before we concede this authority. Senators need to read the fine print of the legislative proposal to understand just what broad powers are being relinquished and they need to go back and read the Constitution again. The administration, I think, has it exactly backwards: instead of concentrating its energies on accumulating as much leverage as it can vis-a-vis our trading partners, it is marshaling these energies in the opposite direction--wrong way Corrigan--inward, to convince the Congress to reduce its leverage, and by extension, the nation's vital leverage abroad. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. I appreciate the fiscal constraints facing this bill and the difficult task that our chairman has accomplished in a fair and bipartisan manner. However, I would hope that we could take a second look at this methane recovery program. 
Mr. President, this program is not a new start as the House committee report suggests. Congress appropriated money specifically for the Coal Mine Methane Program in fiscal year 1995. Some of the funds for this initiative were obligated prior to the rescission bill enacted in 1995. While the Department may have gotten off to a slow start with this program, for the past 18 months it has had five teams under contract to prepare phase II detailed project designs. The original appropriation to initiate these projects has been exhausted, and the funds requested for fiscal year 1988 are necessary to complete the ongoing project designs. I am told that the five teams have provided costsharing in excess of thirty percent. 
The Department of Energy has indicated that the Coal Mine Methane Program can make a significant contribution to the effort to curtail greenhouse gases and estimates that within five years coal mine methane collection and utilization systems could reduce emissions by an amount equivalent to 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide [CO2] each year. The Department's research is expected to demonstrate that the private sector can, remarkably, generate profit by utilizing and destroying these waste gases. Given the large, cost-effective and near-term potential of this research, the Department has proposed the Coal Mine Methane program as one of its global climate change research initiatives. 
As the sponsor of Senate Resolution 98, I am clearly on the record in opposition to any binding international greenhouse gas emissions agreement that would injure the American economy or put us at a competitive disadvantage with any other countries. At the same time, I strongly believe that we in Congress should promote the development and use of technologies that can become economically competitive energy sources and which, at the same time, reduce potential greenhouse gas emissions. 
The Coal Mine Methane program clearly meets these standards. Turning pollution into useful energy at a competitive price, with no subsidies and no new regulation, can be good for electric consumers, good for the environment and good for America, in general.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, today marks the 210th anniversary of the most successful political experiment in thousands of years of human history, because on this date in 1787, the United States Constitution was signed by a majority of delegates attending the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. This ingenious living document, thoughtfully crafted by our Founding Fathers more than two centuries ago, owes its enduring quality in great measure to one of its most basic, yet most ingenious and revolutionary ideas--namely, that the power and sovereignty of the United States Government ultimately rests in the hands of its citizens. 
An active and educated citizenry, is therefore an essential component of the constitutional machinery that keeps our Government in tune. A citizen of the United States not only has the right to hold opinions, but he has a duty to work through his elected officials in behalf of those opinions. If the Government is not being run effectively, efficiently, and constitutionally, citizens of the United States have a responsibility to work to correct that course through the exercise of their right to vote. It is not only a right, it is a privilege. In other words, the Government that stands over us is ours to endorse or to change. 
Unfortunately, however, a recent poll commissioned by the National Constitution Center, an organization established to better educate Americans about the Constitution, reveals that a shocking number of people in this country have virtually no knowledge of what is contained in this vital document, and, thus, have no clue about how it affects their everyday lives. 
In fact, according to the survey, only 5 percent of Americans could correctly answer 10 rudimentary questions about the Constitution. That is an embarrassingly low percentage. How can citizens be expected to meet their Constitutional responsibilities when they lack even basic knowledge about how our Government operates? 
While 84 percent of those polled felt that to work as intended, the U.S. Constitutional system depends on an active and informed citizenry, only 58 percent surveyed could name the three branches that comprise our Federal Government--only 58 percent. And, less than half knew how many Members make up the U.S. Senate. 
These are not difficult questions, but basic knowledge taught to schoolchildren at a young age when I was coming along, and should be taught today to schoolchildren at a very young age. Yet, only 66 percent of those surveyed knew that the first ten amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of Rights--only 66 percent. Some even responded that the first ten amendments to the Constitution are called the Pledge of Allegiance. Now, think of that. 
I wonder how many listening right now to my voice know how many amendments have been added to the Constitution since 1787. Only 19 percent of those surveyed answered correctly. There have been 27 amendments. 
The 27 amendments that have been added to the Constitution--which include the first 10 amendments, or the Bill of Rights--reflect the genius that our Founding Fathers demonstrated in the creation of the document, by equipping the document with the inherent flexibility to accommodate the changes of a growing nation. Such flexibility is intended to be part of a continuing process, which gives the Constitution life and relevance to the daily affairs of all Americans. A course of apathy, and an ignorance of our civic responsibilities and rights threatens to completely undermine the democratic principles on which our sacred Republic was founded--the very principles which Americans say they value so highly. 
If there is anything encouraging to come from the results of the National Constitution Center's poll, perhaps it is that 9 out of 10 people surveyed said that they were proud of the U.S. Constitution. On this anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, I hope that more citizens will demonstrate that pride by taking it upon themselves to learn more about their Constitution and their Government, and teach their children, so that they can adequately perform the responsibilities which were conferred upon them in Philadelphia in 1787 by some of the greatest minds in history. 
Our first Chief Justice John Marshall once stated `The people make the Constitution, and the people can unmake it. It is the creature of their own will, and lives only by their will.' If that will is motivated mostly by ignorance and misinformation our hard won, sacred freedoms appear to be in grave, grave peril indeed. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the dismal results of the National Constitution Center's poll be placed in the Record at this point. 
I thank Senators for listening and I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the fiscal year 1998 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill. This is a bill that is very important to the continued protection and management of our Nation's natural resources, to our energy future, to the well-being of our Indian population, and to the cultural and historical heritage of our country. I hope the Senate will move quickly in its consideration of this bill. If there are amendments--and I am sure there will be some--I encourage Senators to come to the floor and let us have the debate and then vote on those matters that are controversial. The start of the fiscal year is less than 3 weeks away, and we still face a difficult conference with the House. 
It has been my high privilege to serve as the ranking member at the side of our very able chairman, the senior Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton]. He is an absolute master of the details of the Interior bill. He is a student, and a good one, of much of the history that we protect in this bill, and he is a very fair arbiter of the competing demands that fall within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. This bill was put together in a very bipartisan manner, and it is responsive to priorities identified by many Senators, by the administration, by the public, and by the agencies that are charged with carrying out the directions provided in the bill. 
Mr. President, the reach of the programs in the Interior bill is vast, and not much of the funding provided in this bill is spent here in Washington. Rather, the dollars that we are considering today will flow out to more than 370 national park units, over 500 national wildlife refuges, 121 national forests, more than 435 Indian hospitals and clinics, 16 different museums of the Smithsonian Institution, and to countless other locations where the research and technology development supported by this bill occurs. 
So these funds will reach from the northernmost point in Alaska to the southernmost tip of Florida and from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the islands in the western Pacific. 
The extent to which this bill makes its presence known in each State is reflected in the number of requests that Senator Gorton and I receive for project funding each year. While no one receives every item he or she requests, I believe that Senator Gorton has done an excellent job of trying to accommodate high-priority items within the allocation assigned to this subcommittee. This bill contains approximately $13 billion in funding for the base programs, as well as an additional $700 million for priority land acquisitions and exchanges. This bill is at its allocation figure, so any additional funding sought by Senators will need to be offset. 
Senator Gorton has summarized in a very detailed and clear way the items and the details of the bill thoroughly. So I will not attempt to cover them again. 
While this bill provides needed resources to address protection of some of our most important national treasures, we still have a long way to go. The National Park Service has a $6 billion maintenance and rehabilitation backlog. The Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Smithsonian, and other agencies also have considerable backlogs. Continued pressures to balance the budget on the back of discretionary spending will further impede our efforts to provide the resources necessary to protect the wonders with which we have been entrusted. 
For all of the pride that we take in our National Park System, it is also crumbling before us. Visitors flock to these national treasures every year--not only American visitors and their families, but increasingly, visitors from other countries. They come to partake of the historic, the cultural, and the scenic resources that have been so carefully preserved and entrusted to the National Park Service. 
Mr. President, as a reflection of our infrastructure and restoration projects, this bill takes into account the needs. And as a reflection of the patriotism and commitment to future generations, we should be doing more to preserve and to protect these wondrous resources. 
Innovative fee structures, enhanced partnership efforts, and expanded use of volunteers--all of which are supported by this bill--are not the sole solution to the needs of our national parks. Rather, we must commit funds to allow major infrastructure and restoration projects to proceed. When the house is crumbling, we must tend to the foundations and not just make minor cosmetic repairs. 
Lastly, Mr. President, I extend a word of appreciation to the staff that have assisted the chairman and me in our work on this bill. They work as a team, and they serve both of us, as well as the full Senate, in a very effective and dedicated manner. They have taken years to acquire this expertise, and it is a vast benefit to Senators and to the people who research. On the majority side, the staff members, I believe, have already been mentioned by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, as well as on my side of the aisle, which he kindly referred to. This team works under the tutelage of the staff directors of the full committee--Steve Cortese for the majority and Jim English for the minority. 
This is a good bill, Mr. President, and I urge the Senate to complete its action promptly. 
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, just as the world was recovering from the shock last week of the sad news about the tragic and untimely death of Princess Diana--including the disturbing discovery that alcohol may have been linked to the crash--it was again rocked by reports of the death of another of its beloved heroines. Mother Teresa, considered by many to be a living saint, died last Friday at the age of 87. Like Princess Diana, who dedicated much of her attention to the needs of the unfortunate, Mother Teresa was a beacon of hope for countless people who were all but abandoned by mainstream society. But, unlike Princess Diana, Mother Teresa chose to highlight the plight of the destitute by becoming destitute herself. Although a physically small woman, Mother Teresa was a colossus of inspiration. She had little more to offer than kindness, faith, and tenacity, but Mother Teresa ably provided the world with much, much more. 
Mother Teresa embodied hope. She served God by reaching out to the poor. She dedicated her life to humanitarian aid, making personal sacrifices that most of us cannot easily understand. Mother Teresa traveled to areas where most would fear to go; she embraced AIDS patients and lepers, cradled dying babies, and brought a glimmer of hope to the hopeless. She rejected modern-day comforts, and when she left this world she owned little more than her sari and her rosary beads. 
Mother Teresa's name is recognized throughout the world, and her influence is immeasurable. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Earlier this year she was presented the Congressional Medal of Honor. She is one of only five people ever to be awarded honorary citizenship to the United States. Mother Teresa shared her time with some of the world's most impoverished and unfortunate citizens. Her light burned with superhuman brightness to illuminate the darkness in others' lives. 
Born in 1910 in an Albanian region which later became a part of Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa's father died unexpectedly when she was a young girl, and she first learned to care for others while helping her mother look after her two sisters and others in the community. At the age of 18, she joined the Sisters of Our Lady of Loreto, an active mission in India, and spent two decades with the order, first as a teacher and then as a principal. In 1948, an inner voice told her it was time for a change. Sister Teresa left the convent with the vision of starting her own school, determined to dedicate her life to helping the most forsaken and abandoned. Possessing no capital, she first taught by scratching letters in the dirt with a stick. By 1950, she had established a new religious order, and named it the Missionaries of Charity. 
The vision that began with a tiny stick drawing on a gritty street, has grown into an assembly of 600 clinics, orphanages, soup kitchens, maternity homes, refugee centers, and havens for the poor, sick, and dying in more than 100 countries. These facilities are staffed by 4,500 nuns, 500 brothers, and thousands of volunteers from around the globe. 
She refused to accept steady funding or fund-raising money from government, private, or religious institutions, relying instead on her faith in God. Yet, she soothed those in pain and brought smiles to cheerless faces, never forgetting the forgotten. The world is a better place because of the sacrifices she made and the warmth she radiated. Mother Teresa once said, `To God there is nothing small. The moment we have given it to God, it becomes infinite.' With her passing, Mother Teresa joins with God's infinity. May her acts of unselfishness and compassion be an inspiration to us all to strive, each in our own way, to make life better for all of those who lives we touch.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I will vote against tabling the Harkin amendment. It is a good amendment with the worthwhile goal of protecting the health and lives of young Americans. 
Both the tobacco and alcohol industries have received well-deserved criticism in recent years for a variety of questionable or unsavory practices, including what many of their critics have identified as the use of advertising campaigns specifically intended to entice young people to try, and then become hooked on, their products. In response, the tobacco industry has been attacked at both the State and Federal levels, but, unfortunately, much less attention has been directed toward the alcohol industry. 
Certainly, tragedies like the recent alcohol-related death of a Louisiana State University student demonstrate that a national effort to save our young people from the destructive forces of alcohol is warranted. 
This amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill will boost the ability of the States to enforce age and identification requirements for the purchase of cigarettes, but, importantly, at my request, the amendment also addresses the need to shore up the enforcement of checks for the purchase by minors of alcohol. 
The amendment encourages States to couple their youth-smoking prevention efforts with State laws that prohibit underage drinking. These issues go hand in hand in preventing our youth from using destructive substances. 
According to statistics from the Federal Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics, the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds--accidents, homicides, and suicides--often involve the use of alcohol. Efforts to curb the sale of alcohol to minors, therefore, can be expected to yield high payoffs to our society. 
Under the original amendment, Federal funding was to be used to increase supervision of retailers to ensure that they examine the identifications of customers purchasing tobacco products. But language I added calls for coordinating the oversight of identification checks for alcohol sales along with those tobacco-related programs. It only makes sense that store clerks who are already checking ID's for cigarettes also be checking ID's for alcohol. The exercise is called `carding,' checking identification cards to verify that the buyer is not under the legal age. It is such an easy step that can help prevent a teenager from getting drunk and getting behind the wheel of a car--`carding' for age. Perhaps it would be more aptly described as `carding for life.' I hope that this amendment may indeed result in saving lives.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this reconciliation bill. It hands out tax cuts much like adults dole out candy to pacify rowdy children. The American people are not children, and I believe that we underestimate both the public's eagerness for these cuts and our people's comprehension of our Nation's fiscal situation. 
Mr. President, this is no criticism of those Senators who worked for the tax cut. I accord to every Senator the right to express his own convictions and his own beliefs. And I respect every Senator's convictions and beliefs. I happen to differ with many of my colleagues in this instance. I just do not think that it is wise to have this tax cut. I differ with this administration in that regard. The American people are not children. I have been in politics more than 51 years, and the easiest vote for me ever to cast is a vote to cut taxes. That doesn't take courage. It doesn't take a brave man to do that. That is easy. 
Let us first note that the past actions of the Congress in approving the tough deficit reduction measure called OBRA in 1993 is largely responsible for all but erasing the bloated and damaging deficits of the 1980s. That piece of legislation and the steady economic growth we have experienced over the past several years have all but brought us into budget balance. The legislation we passed called OBRA in 1993 and the steady economic growth that we have experienced and are still experiencing are what have brought us into budget balance, almost. Passed without a single Republican vote--not one Senator on that side of the aisle, not one Republican Member of that body on the other side of the Capitol, not one voted for that legislation. Not one. That passed, as I say, only by Democratic vote. Without a single Republican vote, that politically unpopular measure--OBRA 1993--was the castor oil that has mostly cured this Nation's serious bout with red ink disease, and set us on a straight course to budget balance. May I add that this cure has been achieved without the arsenic-laced medication of a balanced budget amendment, which so many in this body had prescribed as the only cure for the ailing patient. They were wrong, and we have turned the corner on our budget woes while at the same time preserving, at least for the moment, the checks and balances so vital to our continued life as a viable republic. But this legislation pending on the Senate floor today threatens to negate our progress and throw the body politic back on the critically ill list. 
The outyear losses from the tax cuts contained in this bill could propel us backward in time to the irresponsible 1980's. May I note that we are voting on this reconciliation bill without the benefit of the administration's economic assessment of the outyear impact of these tax cuts. We shouldn't have to do that. We are rushing to approve these tax cuts in the misguided belief that the people are clamoring for tax relief, regardless of the consequences for the deficit in future years. 
Although I applaud the sincerity of those who differ with me, realizing that a tax cut would be part of any deal, who have tried to make those cuts more fair in their distribution, I cannot fathom the justification for supporting this whole package based on the meager benefit that might accrue to the nonwealthy. In my view, those of us charged with the responsibility to govern must take a larger view of our total fiscal policies and remember the lessons of the past two decades. 
I am one of the miserable few who retains the miserable memory of having voted for the tax cut that Mr. Reagan espoused when he first went into office. I voted for that tax cut, and I have been kicking myself in the rear ever since. I was wrong. 
That and the massive buildup in national defense and the massive growth of entitlements. These are the things that have brought upon us the ills of today, in large measure. 
We are only now emerging from the crippling restrictions of a massive deficit, debt which hampered our ability to invest in our Nation's physical infrastructure, to repair roads and bridges, maintain the treasures of our national parks, and provide basic amenities to our people like clean, safe water. There are people in West Virginia who are lacking in that treasure of safe, clean drinking water. There are people in other rural States all over this Nation who need clean, safe water. They don't have it. That same deficit has also prevented investment in our people's abilities through education, training, and health policies. Before we have even paused to experience the sweet liberty of freedom from that crushing burden, we are eagerly engaged in digging our way right back into debt through these massive back-loaded tax cuts. 
Back loaded. Ah, how sweet it is, to tell the American people, `We have cut your taxes!' Nobody likes to vote for a tax increase. I don't like to do that. And there are times when we really need to cut taxes, but this is not the time. 
Since the budget has not been balanced since 1969, I guess nobody in this town can bear the thought of being in balance. Without the hot breath of the deficit master on our necks each and every working day, we might actually be able to return to a time when we could address some of our real problems in this country. We might even see a little creativity and common sense come out of this city. We might have to learn to plan and to be proactive about our Nation's problems instead of slapping on the green eyeshades every morning and focusing on the comforting familiarity of the deficit devil which has become an all-purpose collective excuse for doing nothing much at all. 
Before we all break out the champagne bottles and congratulate ourselves on helping the poor, beleaguered population by making the easiest, no-brainer vote in all of politics--the easiest, no-brainer vote in all of politics, a tax cut; how easy; how easy it is--let us sober up for 1 minute and contemplate the obvious fact that one fairly severe recession in the next several years coupled with the impact of these back-loaded tax cuts will throw us right back into the deficit canyon. That is all it will take. 
Let us further jog our all-too-short memories and recall that the national debt as of July 25 is a whopping $5.28 trillion. Yes. Let's reduce the deficit. But let us put that money on that national debt. Further, I am told that the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office and the interest due on that debt for fiscal year 1997 is $358 billion. That is just the interest due on the debt--$358 billion. That is $358 for every minute since the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was born--$358 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. This is not small change, my colleagues. And it seems to me that even using the new, new, new, new math, and without benefit of a hand-held calculator, anyone can see that we cannot prudently afford this tax cut. 
So I am critical--yes--of the Republican Party for advocating this tax cut. I am critical--yes--of this administration and this White House, of my own political party, for advocating a tax cut at this time. It is pandering to the American people. It is pure political demagoguery. That is what it is, pure and simple. 
Additionally, any informed observer of our Nation's demographic trends can easily see that a low birth rate in our Nation's large and aging baby-boom generation are fusing a fiscal time bomb steadily ticking along on its inevitable course which will detonate in the second decade of the next century. 
The second decade of the next century. But who cares? Many of those of us who vote for this tax cut today will not be here. We will not be around. Some of us will be in our rocking chairs, enjoying retirement. 
Do not count me in that crowd. We will not be to blame. Who will be around to blame us? 
That time bomb could lead to a mushroom cloud, a mushroom cloud that spreads over the country, a cloud of returned budget deficits if we do not think of ways to responsibly sap its destructive potential. 
Mr. President, simply put, our Nation does not need and can ill-afford tax cuts at this time--not the tax cuts that are included in this reconciliation bill, not the tax cuts promulgated in recent years as a result of the so-called Contract With America. 
I did not sign on to that contract, the Contract With America. We do not hear much about that contract these days, not much anymore. I never signed on to that contract. Here is my `Contract with America,' the Constitution of the United States. Hallelujah! No signed contract for me. I signed the oath to uphold and defend this Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is my contract. 
But not any tax cut. Such tax cuts threaten to enlarge the deficit right at the time we are close to erasing it. Then we are going to bloat it again, going to blow it up again. More importantly, tax cuts of the sort being considered today could mushroom the deficit in the outyears, precisely at the time when our Nation will be graying. 
See, I once upon a time had black hair, black as a raven's wing. Not anymore. I went through a graying process. And today my hair has turned not to silver but to the 79th wintry snow--I should say 80 in November. But precisely at the time when our Nation will be graying, and slowly moving closer to the detonation of that time bomb, the explosion of retiring baby boomers that threatens to implode our Nation's fiscal house. 
There can be no argument, as there was in the early 1980's, that these cuts are needed for economic growth. That was the argument they used back in the early 1980's. We had a new President. His name was Ronald Reagan. My people said, `Give him a chance.' They wrote me letters and postcards and said, `Give him a chance.' Well, against my own better judgment, I voted for his tax cut. In those days, we could argue that the cuts were needed for economic growth. That is one of the arguments Mr. Reagan so well used. 
We are currently in our sixth consecutive year of economic growth, the stock market continues to reach record high after record high after record high. They wonder how much higher it can go. It became 4,000, and then it became 5,000, and then it became 6,000, then it became 7,000, then it became 8,000. How much higher can it go? I could have become a rich man, perhaps, if I had known how to play the stock market. But I am one who remembers the stock market crash in 1929, so I have been afraid, afraid of that market ever since. Unemployment recently dipped below 5 percent. Think of it! And inflation has remained in check. The stock market has risen into the stratosphere, beyond the opening in the ozone layer. 
Does this sound like an economy that needs a jump-start through a tax cut? We were on the right track in 1993. That was the right track. We don't need this tax cut now. To provide a tax cut now is like encouraging someone who has just paid off a huge credit card debt, complete with whopping interest payments to go on a wild and uncontrollable shopping spree. Where is the learning curve? Where is the learning curve? 
Mr. President, it appears to this Senator that the justifications for the tax cuts contained in the pending legislation do not extend beyond the realm of pure unadulterated politics, pure unadulterated politics. Tax cuts are now, as they have been in the past, the easiest vote a Member of this body could ever make--easiest vote. Tax cuts sell well on the campaign trail. They make even rubber chicken taste good. They seem to magnetically draw checkbooks out of our coat pockets, but in our current fiscal situation they do not represent sound fiscal policy. 
Tax cuts are not in the best interests of our Nation at this time. I cannot state that strongly enough. To fully prepare for the budget pressures of the next century, we will need fiscal discipline as never before envisaged. We will need budget surpluses, not a teetering see-saw of a balance weakened by looming, back-loaded tax cuts whose costs continue to escalate and whose effect will be to tilt the see-saw back toward deficit spending. We will need to make many difficult decisions with regard to Federal entitlement spending. 
In short, Mr. President, we will need compromise on many fronts of our budget debate. However, if we are to be truly faithful to the principles of fiscal order and balanced budgets, and if we are going to be mindful of the America that we leave to our children--we hear so much about our children--if we are truly mindful of the America that we leave to our children and to our grandchildren, there is no place, no place for tax cuts in any compromise proposal at this time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I reserve the right to object not for the purpose of objecting, but for the purpose of making a brief statement with respect to my vote on the last rollcall vote. I think the Senate made a mistake, and I had hoped to be here in time to express my opposition to the motion to waive all points of order. 
I think that was a mistake. These are the reasons why it is a mistake. I was not--along with most of the other Members of this body--a conferee on this resolution. I know very little about what's in the bill--only by asking questions of staff and listening to other Members. But I had nothing to do with the conference report that was brought back. Many of the Senators in here are in the same boat. 
What goes into that conference report depends a lot on the actions of the House of Representatives. They are a part of the conference report that comes back here for us to vote on. Our only recourse--inasmuch as we cannot amend the conference report, our only recourse, if indeed we want to get a vote on something in that conference report, is to make a point of order if the point of order is available. 
The Byrd rule was devised for the purpose of keeping extraneous matter off reconciliation measures because there was very little time on a reconciliation bill for debate, and on a conference report, there is no opportunity to amend it. And so we devised the Byrd rule to keep off these pieces of extemporaneous legislation that were often complex, costly, and needed to be aired and debated by the representatives of the people. That was the purpose of the Byrd rule. 
I looked over the Byrd rule violations that were involved here. I saw none that I would question. Some of the Byrd rule violations are good, in my view. But at least I had the opportunity, I had the right to raise a point of order and get a vote. I could not amend the conference report, so a point of order would be my only way to delete from the bill an extemporaneous matter and get a vote on it. And now the Senate has adopted a motion that waived all points of order. It took away your rights, your rights, your rights, and my rights, if we had wanted to make a point of order under the Byrd rule. 
It was a bad precedent. What are we going to do the next time--the next time we bring in a reconciliation bill? The first thing, if the majority so wishes, could be to move to waive all points of order? They have the votes. They have the votes. We might be in the majority the next time, or we may not be. 
Another thing that happens in these conferences is, the administration, which is a separate branch of Government--and I still hold that there are three equal, coordinate branches of this Government. I don't salute the executive branch. I don't serve under any President. I serve with the President. But the administration goes into these conferences, whether it is a Republican administration or a Democratic administration, and tries to dominate those conferences, tries to get matters included in the conference report right at the last minute so we won't have time to air them under the limited time for debate. But there is still a point of order that a Senator has a right to make, and especially under the Byrd rule, because usually if the administration wants to put in something, it may be an authorizing measure, it is something which ought to be debated. But because they can get it in the reconciliation bill, if they can get by the Byrd rule points of order, then they are home scot-free. I am opposed to that. I think we made a mistake. It is a bad precedent. And I only wish I had had time to express my viewpoint before we voted. Maybe it would not have changed any votes, but still I would have had an opportunity. I thank all Senators for listening. I apologize for imposing on your time.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am supportive of the effort to appropriate the funds necessary for the study outlined in the manager's amendment to S. 39, beginning in fiscal year 1998. In fact, it is my understanding that the manager's amendment is written so that a number of sections in S. 39 will become effective only after funding for the first year of the study has been provided. It is clear to me that full funding for this research is a critical element of the agreement on S. 39.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to express my congratulations to the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gregg, and Ranking Member, Senator Hollings, for a very thorough, fair, and bipartisan Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriation Bill. It is my understanding that Chairman Gregg was most respectful of his ranking member's concerns in drafting this legislation. It is my further understanding that Chairman Gregg and his staff have embraced Senator Stevens' philosophy as chairman of our full committee that embodies open disclosure, full cooperation, and respect for the interests of the members of both sides of the aisle. As a result, we have before us an excellent bill, drafted in the spirit of bipartisanship with the best interest of our Nation at heart. 
The appropriation bill before us provides $31.6 billion dollars for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and related agencies. This is an increase of $1.4 billion over current levels. It is about one-half a billion dollars below the President's request, excluding the administration's request for advanced appropriations. Again, the committee has demonstrated its commitment toward fighting crime and supporting law enforcement initiatives by providing the Department of Justice with $17.3 billion in appropriations. When taking offsetting collections from fees into account, the Department's total resources made available in this bill are about $19.3 billion. Within this amount many important programs are funded, including the President's COPS on the Beat Program, 1,000 more border patrol agents in the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a new block grant program to address juvenile crime and related programs, and an increased budget for initiatives addressing violence against women. Also included is $3.075 billion for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, an increase of $238 million above the current year. Funding increases are provided to complete the new forensics laboratory at Quantico, VA, and to combat child exploitation on the Internet. A total of $1.091 billion is provided for the Drug Enforcement Administration and $332 million for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Mr. President, we have before us a good bill that I will join Senators Hollings and Gregg in supporting. In closing, I commend the work of committee staff. On the majority staff, I acknowledge and thank Jim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, and Dana Quam for their professionalism and spirit of bipartisanship. On the minority side, I thank Scott Gudes and Emelie East for their many hours of work on this bill.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1048, the Transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. 
The Transportation appropriations bill may be the most important of all the appropriations bills. It establishes the Federal investment level in our Nation's highways, airports, passenger, rail, and mass transit systems. I have spoken many 
times on the Senate floor regarding the importance of maintaining and improving the Nation's physical infrastructure. Our economy is highly dependent on the efficient movement of goods and people. Congestion and capacity constraints on our Nation's highways and delays at our airports cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars each year in lost productivity. But while the estimated costs associated with congestion grow each year, our Federal investment in infrastructure has continued to decline significantly. 
Indeed, since 1980, our national investment in infrastructure has declined, both as a percentage of our gross domestic product and as a percentage of our Federal budget. The bill before the Senate today seeks to reverse the destructive trend of Federal disinvestment. Most importantly, as far as this Senator is concerned, the Federal aid highway obligation ceiling will rise to a historic high of $21.8 billion, an increase of more than $3 billion, or 17 percent. Our Nation's airports will enjoy a 16-percent increase in Federal funding for critical capital and safety improvement projects, an increase of $260 million. 
Now, Mr. President, these additional highway funds are sorely needed in all States of the Nation. Indeed, the historic $3 billion increase is still only one-fifth the size of the increase that the Federal Highway Administration estimates would be necessary to cease deterioration in the condition of our National Highway System. Put another way, if we wanted to see a net improvement in the condition of our roads and bridges, we would be required to provide an increase in excess of $15 billion in the bill, or a total of almost $37 billion. Unfortunately, the restrictions that have been placed on domestic discretionary spending through the Federal budget process preclude us from providing such an increase through this bill. But I still want to commend the managers for making our Federal investment in highways a priority in the development of this bill. 
These highway funds are not the only critical investments in this bill. The Transportation appropriations bill includes our entire annual investment in critical safety programs in all modes of transportation. These include investments to maintain and modernize our air traffic control system, programs for the prevention of drunk driving, funding for rail safety inspectors and motor carrier inspectors, as well as programs of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board. 
Mr. President, when one considers the costs to society in terms of the thousands of lives lost each year through accidents involving our transportation system, the devastation is great. Whether it be highway deaths, or airline disasters, or train accidents, it matters little to those who lose their lives, or to those who are permanently disabled, or to their families, as to which mode of transportation was involved. We simply must do all that we can to reduce the death and the destruction that occurs annually in our various transportation systems. 
In doing so, we not only save lives, we also save the billions of dollars that these accidents cost the economy each year in terms of property damage and lost productivity, as well as the health care costs--and they are often long-term--associated with these tragedies. 
I believe it is necessary to point out, Mr. President, that it will require a two-step process for us to get increased highway construction funding, as well as highway safety funding to our States. This appropriations bill is the first step, but it will be equally essential for us to pass the surface transportation authorization bill in the very near future. Our major Federal highway construction, highway safety, and mass transit programs are set to expire in less than 10 weeks' time. As has been the usual convention, the annual appropriations bill sets an obligation limitation on these highway construction, highway safety, and mass transit programs. 
But it is the responsibility of the authorizing committees--the Committees on Environment and Public Works and Commerce and Banking--to provide the necessary contract authority so that these programs will continue beyond September 30. I know it has been the stated desire of the majority leader to bring such an authorization bill before the Senate as soon as possible. And I am one of many Senators who anxiously await an opportunity to debate a new surface transportation authorization bill on the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, I commend Senator Shelby for his excellent work in his first year as chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee. He held a thorough and informative set of hearings at the beginning of the year. I was pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in some of them. And I also commend Senator Lautenberg, the ranking member of the Transportation Subcommittee, who, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, toiled diligently to ensure that the budget resolution treated transportation as an important budget priority for the coming year. 
Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg have continued to act in the cooperative bipartisan fashion that has always characterized the workings of the Transportation Subcommittee. 
Mr. President, these Senators, who act as managers of a bill as important as this is, put an immense amount of time into their work. They conduct thorough hearings. They work with able staff. They conduct markups on the bill at the subcommittee level, and the bill is generally approved by the Appropriations Committee. The bill has usually emanated from the subcommittee, and seldom does the full committee make changes in those subcommittee actions that go into the formulation of the bill. 
I know that Senator Shelby has worked hard, and he has done a good job, as did Senator Lautenberg when he was chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee. They are both highly dedicated to their work, and they are both very well respected. And I want to commend both of these Senators. They are working in the best interests of the Nation. They are working in the best interests of the States that make up the Nation. And they are working in the best interests of the future and the people who will depend upon adequate modes of transportation today and in the future. 
I also want to thank the Presiding Officer. I note that he listens to what Senators are saying. And that is important. He is alert to what is going on, on the floor. He is alert to what is being said. He is not working crossword puzzles. He is not signing his mail. He is not reading a book. He is busily engaged in the business of presiding. So I compliment all of these whose names I have mentioned. 
As I think of the work that is done by Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg, I used to be the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee a good many years ago. I was instrumental years ago in helping to get the first appropriations for the metropolitan transit system here. That was before most Senators were Members of this body. But I saw the need for a transportation system in the District of Columbia to serve the metropolitan area, and I supported mass transit throughout the years. When I was chairman of the full committee, I did not come to bury mass transit. I came to praise mass transit and to save mass transit and to help mass transit. I am sorry to say that I have not been accorded the same reciprocity toward highways, especially from some of the Members of the other body. I don't mention names because that is against the Senate rules. 
But we are all working for the Nation. And when we work to improve the transportation of the Nation, we work to build the Nation's prosperity. We work for the increased safety of those who travel, and we work for the young men and women who will be the leaders of the Nation in years to come. 
It reminds me of a bit of verse by Will Dromgoole. One might think that that author was a man. The name is Will, but it was a woman.  
An old man traveling a long highway 
Came at evening, cold and gray 
To a chasm vast and wide and steep, 
With waters rolling cold and deep. 
The old man crossed in the twilight dim; 
The sullen stream held no fears for him. 
But he turned, when he reached the other side. 
And he built a bridge to span the tide. 
`Old man,' said a fellow pilgrim standing near. 
`You are wasting your strength in building here. 
Your journey will end with the passing day, 
And you never again will travel this way. 
You have crossed the chasm deep and wide; 
Why build you a bridge at eventide?' 
The builder lifted his old gray head. 
`Good friend, in the path I have come,' he said, 
`There followeth after me today 
A youth whose feet must pass this way. 
This chasm, which was but naught to me, 
To that fair youth might a pitfall be. 
He, too, must cross in the twilight dim. 
Good friend, I am building this bridge for him.'

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Mr. Hagel, for his excellent statement. I thank him for joining with me in the preparation, development and promotion of this resolution. And I thank him for the time that he has yielded to me. 
Mr. Hagel and I, along with 63 other cosponsors, developed S. Res. 98, which was reported favorably from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and is pending before the Senate today. The resolution seeks to provide the Senate's views as to the global climate change negotiations now underway. These negotiations have, as a goal, a revision of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Rio Pact. 
Mr. President, my years of recollection go back farther than that of most Senators. I am not a scientist, but I have lived long enough to see what I believe are some very definite changes in the climate pattern affecting our country. Droughts, floods, storms appear to me to be more erratic, more unpredictable, and more severe in these later years of my life than in my earlier years. I can remember when there were no air conditioning units in Washington or anywhere else where I lived. We have recently seen heat waves--severe. We have seen droughts--severe. They seem to be happening more frequently. So I believe in my own mind and heart that something is happening out there. Something is happening. Something is happening to our climate. As I say, I am not a scientist, but the majority of scientists who study climate patterns tell us that there apparently are changes going on in the climate pattern and that anthropogenic interference is probably the cause of some of this change. 
All the data are not in, but I, for one, believe that there is sufficient evidence of, first, a probable trend toward increased warming of the Earth's surface resulting from human interference in natural climate patterns. I believe that a steady increase in accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is taking place. I believe that there is some relationship between the warming trend and such accumulations, enough to justify our taking some action and taking it now. The scientific foundation of this case is plausible enough, in my personal judgment, to put into motion a sound global program, because the trends and the effects are long term. Certainly the Senate, under the Constitution, is obligated to communicate its views and advice on the treaty negotiations. The Constitution, in outlining the powers of the President, says he--meaning the President--shall have power `by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties'; `by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties. . . .' It doesn't just use the word `consent' of the Senate. It also uses the word of `advice.' All too often we let ourselves to be limited to consenting to or rejecting treaties. But we have an obligation to advise the administration as to the Senate's views concerning a treaty, especially this treaty which can have such far-reaching ramifications. 
I do not think the Senate should support a treaty that requires only half the world--in other words, the developed countries--to endure the economic costs of reducing emissions while developing countries are left free to pollute the atmosphere and, in so doing, siphon off American industries. There are those who say that the United States is responsible for the situation that has developed. They claim that the United States should bear the brunt of the burden. But the time for pointing fingers is over. In this particular environmental game there are no winners; the world loses. And any effort to avoid the effects of global climate change will be doomed to failure from the start without the participation of the developing world, particularly those nations that are rapidly developing and will rapidly increase their carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Count me as a global environmentalist, who insists that all nations that spew forth major concentrations of carbon dioxide, or that will be spewing forth major concentrations of carbon dioxide, must step up to the plate in these negotiations and make good-faith, specific, binding commitments to control and reduce these emissions right from the start. 
Industry is fueled, in large part, by fossil fuels, which are the primary--primary--cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Let us examine the role of China in that regard. As a percentage of total world consumption in the year 2015, China alone will account for 42 percent of all the coal burned worldwide while the United States will account for only 16 percent. The increase in China's use of coal should alarm every environmentalist who is concerned about global warming. 
So, if you are a true environmentalist--I am not talking about fanatics--if you are a true environmentalist, as I am, then you should be alarmed about the situation that I have just mentioned with respect to China. And there are other countries, such as India, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, that are classified as developing countries. I say they need to step up to the plate, just as we do, just as the annex 1 countries do, just as the developed countries do, when the negotiations are taking place and make binding, specific commitments to reductions of greenhouse gases and to make those commitments to start now, not somewhere in the future. 
From 1995 to 2015, China will increase its coal consumption by a huge 111 percent, compared to only 22 percent for the United States. Yet, despite its future role as the world's leading contributor to the problem of carbon emissions, China has indicated steadfast refusal to apply any type of binding obligations upon its own economy and industry. I believe that, if the treaty does not commit the developing nations like China to binding commitments, there will be no incentive for China and the other nations of the developing world to make responsible and environmentally sound choices as they develop. 
The committee report that is before the Senate contains a brief but accurate summary of the history of the global change negotiations. Most of the nations of the world signed up at the Earth summit in Rio in 1992 to a Treaty that set voluntary goals for nations to start limiting their carbon dioxide emissions. Unfortunately, most nations of the world, ourselves included, failed to take the actions needed to meet those voluntary goals. 
As a result of this failure, the parties met again in Berlin in 1995 and sought to impose a timetable whereby legally binding limits on national carbon dioxide reductions would be put into place. Unfortunately--unfortunately--a fundamental error--I would use the word `blunder'--a fundamental blunder was made in Berlin in that only the so-called developed nations, or Annex I nations, were to impose such a legally binding regime on themselves. Developing nations got a free pass. 
The concept which is embodied in the Byrd-Hagel resolution is that developing country parties should join the developed world in making new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the same compliance period. 
Now, does this mean that the Senate is insisting on commitments to identical levels of emissions among all the parties? Certainly not. The emissions limitations goals, to be fair, should be based on a country's level of development. The purpose is not to choke off Mexico's development or China's development. The purpose is to start addressing the greenhouse gas problem in the only meaningful way we can, that is, through globally and through binding commitments up front. The timeframe could be 5 years, 7 years, 10 years or whatever. The initial commitment to action, starting upon signature in Kyoto, could be relatively modest, pacing upwards depending upon various factors, with a specific goal to be achieved within a fixed time period. There are plenty of tools to encourage the developing world to make meaningful commitments. 
The message to U.S. negotiators is that all nations--that is the message of this resolution--particularly those that are making and will in the future make a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions need to make commitments at Kyoto that unequivocally demonstrate a tangible action program--action, not just words--to tackle the problem of climate change; and the need to start with their best efforts to act on those commitments immediately, not 5 years down the road, not 10 years down the road but immediately, and not settle for vague promises to return to a future negotiation to get serious. 
American industry has expressed concern that a treaty without developing country commitments would encourage capital flight and a loss of jobs in the United States. We do not as yet have available the administration's current best assessment of the economic impacts of various levels of emissions targets in the United States. However, preliminary work done by the Argonne Laboratory on this matter is worrisome in that its worst case scenario shows a very negative economic impact on American industry. 
Mr. President, as I have said, we do not yet have a clearly articulated economic assessment by the administration, and so it is impossible to make specific judgments as to the economic impacts on particular industries and how they can be mitigated by other tools that could be included in the treaty. Dr. Janet Yellen, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, stated in a hearing before the Environment Committee on July 17, the administration has not settled on a particular set of policies to reduce emissions and intends to engage all interested parties in a White House conference on climate change this fall. 
The American people need to understand the situation and the actions to be taken. The President is committed to this major public education campaign, and I note that he yesterday convened a meeting of scientists at the White House to discuss 
the evidence regarding global warming and to begin that educational process. 
There surely will be costs if the United States is to make the changes to our existing industrial base and to our lifestyle necessary to meet the goals of the treaty. Our smokestacks must be cleaner and our automobiles more efficient. There are many ways to achieve these goals, but we must be able to tell the American people what will be required to meet any proposed commitment. 
The Senate is doing the right thing in addressing the negotiations in a principled way without attempting to micromanage those negotiations. It is possible that the Senate will have a binding revision to the Rio Pact presented to it within a year. Given the tremendous implications for this agreement, the Byrd-Hagel resolution also suggests that the leadership create a bipartisan group of Senators to monitor the negotiations and report periodically to the full Senate on the nature of the agreement as it is being shaped by our negotiators. The nations of the world are all in this global boat together. It is not a boat of which only half will sink while the other half stays afloat. Unless we all pull our oars in the same direction and plug the large leaks as well as the small leaks, our ship will flounder and surely sink. This resolution will give the Senate and the American people a seat at the negotiating table and add strength to our U.S. negotiating team. 
I thank all Senators for their attention, and I hope the resolution will be adopted by a substantial majority. 
Now, some of the Senators who have signed on to the resolution may have differing views about the treaty, but there is one thing that we are in agreement on--one or two things. These are set forth in the resolution beginning and concluding with the resolving clause. One, that all nations, all nations must take steps now, at the time of the signing of the treaty, to begin limiting their emissions of greenhouse gases. Mere promises will not be sufficient. Mere promises will not get by this Senate. A treaty will have to have the approval of a two-thirds supermajority in this Senate, and that is what we are telling the administration. We are letting the Administration know that this Senate is not just going to consent or not consent on a treaty. This Senate is going to fulfill its constitutional obligations not only to consent but also to `advise' and consent. And the resolution also provides that such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the economy of the United States. 
So I suggest that all Senators read the resolution's resolving clause. That is where we come together. That is where Mr. Hagel's views, my views, the views of others who are signatories of the resolution blend and constitute a consensus. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend and I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator has asked this question. Earlier he had indicated that we had agreed on certain things. We agreed on one thing: that we would enter into a colloquy. And I always reserve the right to express my own views on matters, and not necessarily agree to the expressions of others as to how they think and what they think I say. 
May I say that I am only expressing a personal viewpoint here. The Senator said earlier that there were Senators in this body who signed onto the resolution who want to kill the treaty. That may be so. This Senator is not one of those. I am not out to kill the treaty. 
But what I was out to say--and the reason I got behind this effort--was to send a message to the administration that if the Senate is not included in the takeoff, if the Senate is not included at the beginning, if the Senate is intended to be shut out of doing its constitutional responsibility of advising as well as consenting in making a treaty, then count me out. 
If you want to really kill this treaty, abide by the Berlin Mandate and let the developing countries off the hook until some future time. That is what will surely kill the treaty, and I will join in stabbing it in the heart, if that is the case. If that treaty comes back here and the developing countries are left off the hook, count me in on the assassination of the treaty. It will be done in public view. It won't be behind a bush. 
Mr. President, the Senator raised an important point. The Europeans have erected what they call a bubble, which is simply a mechanism for them to trade off emissions levels from one country to another so long as they honor overall an average which conforms to the treaty-imposed cap on developed country emissions. This is viewed by some, including me, as a technique to maximize the economic competitiveness of European countries by keeping emissions reductions to a minimum as a result of the trades that would be available under the bubble from one country to another within the European Union.

Mr. BYRD. I believe that if the United States is going to enter into binding commitments to limit or reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we need to remain competitive vis-a-vis the Europeans, and everybody else, for that matter. Therefore, an emissions trading mechanism whereby we can exchange our higher level emissions by buying emissions credits from, let us say, Russia or other nations with lower emissions, is an example of one potential tool that the U.S. negotiators might explore in the climate change negotiations.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I personally believe that it could have such an effect. There are a number of other tools that are under development, and these, in my judgment, should be further explored for inclusion in the proposed treaty in order that our own economic growth not be penalized by the 
treaty. These tools include joint implementation involving partnerships among industries in the developed and developing countries. There are, as well, many areas where other U.S. programs and initiatives could be enhanced to further the same objectives, such as cooperative technology ventures and enhanced research and development of both fossil fuel development technologies and alternate fuel technologies. These tools and programs may also have an advantage in encouraging the developing world to make meaningful binding commitments. So they should be explored as a natural companion to provisions establishing binding commitments. 
The purpose would be to level the competitive playing field so that the United States is not placed at a disadvantage and to help insure that all the world's economies will share the responsibilities to tackle the global warming problem.

Mr. BYRD. That would not be a correct interpretation of the resolution. In my testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations on June 19, I made the following statement and deliberately repeated it for emphasis: `Finally, while countries have different levels of development, each must make unique and binding commitments of a pace and kind consistent with their industrialization.' I believe that the developing world must agree in Kyoto to binding targets and commitments that would begin at the same time as the developed world in as aggressive and effective a schedule as possible given the gravity of the problem and the need for a fair sharing of the burden. That is what the resolution means. The resolution should not be interpreted as a call for identical commitments between Annex I Parties and Developing Country Parties.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, again, may I say that this resolution has been introduced and developed every step along the way with concurrence between Mr. Hagel and myself. It just so happens that my name is at the beginning of what is called the Byrd-Hagel resolution. I have no problem if it is called the Hagel-Byrd resolution; we are both in this resolution. We both believe the words of the resolution, and we both believe that the resolution speaks for itself. And we also understand we may have different views as to specific questions. I respect the views of every Senator. So I will attempt to respond to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. I thank him for his statement which indicates that he is concerned, has studied the matter, and is a reasonable man. 
I thank Mr. Chafee for this opportunity to discuss in greater detail the resolution that Mr. Hagel and I and others of our colleagues have brought to the Senate. In response to the Senator's question, I will repeat a portion of the testimony I delivered on June 19 of this year before the Committee on Foreign Relations. There I stated that the resolution accepts the thesis, which is still the subject of some dispute, that the increasing release of carbon dioxide--CO2--and its accumulation in our atmosphere are causing a very gradual heating of the globe which has many adverse consequences for us all and I am, indeed, convinced that climate change is a looming threat to the global environment. That is a statement I made at that time.

Such participation by the developing country parties could, in my judgment, come in a number of forms. As I stated before the Foreign Relations Committee, while individual countries have different levels of development, the resolution holds that each country must make unique and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with their industrialization.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it was John Stuart Mill who said that `On all great subjects, much remains to be said.' I think we will all be saying a good bit more than has been said here as the days come and go. We are not yet debating the treaty itself. But my distinguished friend, Mr. Kerry, has just said, in his judgment, there is nothing in this resolution that is inconsistent with the Berlin mandate. 
Mr. President, that is not my view at all. I think we only have to read the resolution itself--it speaks for itself--and we will find that it is inconsistent with the Berlin Mandate, and I intended to say that. 
Mr. President, I will try to elaborate on my view with a two-part observation. First, with respect to significant emitters, such as China, it makes no sense for the international community to begin this effort by agreeing to unchecked emissions growth from newly constructed, but inefficient, power-generating and industrial facilities. It is neither cost-effective nor environmentally beneficial to go back and retrofit dirty smokestacks. 
We all know that China in particular has near-term plans to increase its power-generating capacity exponentially. We must anticipate the prospect of significant new industrial development in China and other places by providing incentives for deployment of new, cleaner technologies. In short, we must bring back from Kyoto some commitments that China and other large emitters will grow in a smart way. 
I want to make it clear that the current approach of the State Department is not acceptable to this Senator under the terms of the resolution. Their approach will not work. A promise by the developing countries to only negotiate at a later date is simply unacceptable. Any agreement resulting from negotiations in Kyoto, or thereafter, that includes binding commitments for developed countries must also include serious, specific, and binding commitments by the developing world. 
I thank all Senators.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Thursday evening, July 10, 1997, the Senate confirmed the nomination of George J. Tenet, of Maryland, to be the Director of Central Intelligence. I am delighted that the Senate has taken this action, based on the unanimous recommendation of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
George Tenet is well known to many members of the Senate, as he served with distinction as a staff member, and then Staff Director of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the service of Senator David Boren, of Oklahoma, when he was Chairman of that Committee. When Senator Boren retired, to take up the post of President of the University of Oklahoma, George became the Assistant to the President for Intelligence matters on the staff of the National Security Council, and served with great distinction in that capacity. As a result of that service, he was asked by Mr. John Deutsch to be the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence when Mr. Deutsch was appointed Director, and he has served as the Acting Director since January of this year when Mr. Deutsch returned to the private sector. Mr. Tenet has been praised on the floor by the current leadership of the Senate Intelligence Committee, by the Chairman, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, and the Ranking Democrat, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey. They have praised Mr. Tenet's capabilities, judgment and character. I wish to express my own confidence in his leadership and I believe he has the capacity to bring the agency out of the unfortunate period that it has recently experienced which was tarnished by espionage scandals, and too rapid a turnover in the Office of the Director. He faces the challenge of bringing morale up, as well as restoring public and Congressional confidence in the intelligence organization of the nation. It is his responsibility to ensure that the Intelligence Community performs on the basis of the highest standards of integrity, and that the tremendous analytical, technical, and personnel resources that the community possesses, without rival in the world, are brought to bear on the often dangerous and difficult targets and areas of concern that constitute the intelligence agenda of the nation. 
Mr. Tenet is already known as a strong leader with clear focus and a broad vision. I do not believe there is any recent Director of Central Intelligence that I have dealt with that brings as strong a knowledge of and constituency in the Senate as he enjoys. Intelligence in the confusing and shifting world of this post-cold war era is vital to both branches of the national government, and to be successful must enjoy the strong support of both of them. George is uniquely qualified to bring about a working consensus on the priorities, activities and budget of the intelligence community. He enjoys an extraordinarily deep reservoir of support here in the Senate, and I believe in the White House and the Intelligence Community as well. He is an outstanding choice, and the President is to be commended on his selection. I look forward to working with him to ensure that the highly dedicated, talented and courageous individuals who serve the nation silently day and night across the globe enjoy the support that they need to carry out their duties. I wish him a long, fruitful and rewarding tenure as our new Director of Central Intelligence.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, of the funds appropriated for law enforcement grants in the bill before us, my amendment would ensure that $25 million would be provided for grants to states for programs and activities to enforce state laws regarding youth access to alcohol. This amendment adds no money to the bill and needs no offset. 
All states prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. In addition, thee are a range of other laws regarding youth access to alcohol that states may have on the books. For instance, some states, in addition to prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverage to minors, have laws prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors, and still others ban possession of alcoholic beverages by minors. 
Mr. President, just today in The Washington Post there is an article regarding a sting operation in Arlington County in establishments that sell alcohol to minors. According to the officer in charge of the operation, minors purchased alcoholic beverages without any kind of I.D. check in 57 percent of the establishments visited. This is a disgrace, Mr. President, and, I am afraid, a not uncommon occurrence. I concur wholeheartedly with a quote of Eric, who is 19 years old and who participated in the sting operation. According to Eric, `We've figured out why we have an underage drinking problem.' With the media and advertisements besieging our nation's youth with unrealistic messages about alcohol consumption combined with insufficient enforcement of laws already on the books, what you wind up with is, indeed, an `underage drinking problem.' The article concludes by saying that County officials even warned establishments that they would be using underage people to buy alcohol, and, still, 57 percent of the time the underage participants in the operation were able to purchase alcohol without challenge. What would the percentage have been had the letters not been sent? Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from The Washington Post be printed into the Record.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, alcohol is the drug used most by teens with devastating consequences. According to statistics compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, among children between the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetimes experimented with alcohol. As I consistently remind my colleagues, in the last month, approximately 8 percent of the nation's eighth graders have been drunk. Eighth graders are 13 years old, Mr. President! Junior and senior high school students drink 35 percent of all wine coolers and consume 1.1 billion cans of beer a year. And I will repeat what is common knowledge to us all--every state has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. Knowing this, how is it then that two out of every three teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages? As if the dangers of youth alcohol consumption are not bad enough, statistics have shown that alcohol is a gateway to other drugs such as marijuana and cocaine. 
Drinking impairs one's judgment and when mixed with teenage driving there are too often lethal results. In 1995, there were 2,206 alcohol-related fatalities of children between the ages of 15 and 20. For many years, I have taken the opportunity when addressing groups of youth West Virginians to warn them about the dangers of alcohol, and I have supported legislative efforts to discourage people, particularly young people, from drinking any alcohol. I am proud to have sponsored an amendment two years ago which requires states to pass zero-tolerance laws that will make it illegal for persons under the age of 21 to drive a motor vehicle if they have a blood alcohol level greater than .02 percent. This legislation helps to save lives and sends a message to our nation's youth that drinking and driving is wrong, that it is a violation of the law, and that it will be appropriately punished. 
Our children are besieged with media messages that create the impression that alcohol can help to solve life's problems, lead to popularity, and enhance athletic skills. These messages coupled with insufficient enforcement of laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol by minors give our nation's youth the impression that it is okay for them to drink. This impression has deadly consequences. In the three leading causes of death for 15 to 24 year olds, accidents, homicides, and suicides, alcohol is a factor. Efforts to curb the sale of alcohol to minors have high payoffs in helping to prevent children from drinking and driving death or injury. 
There is a link between alcohol consumption and increased violence and crime, and I believe that directing funding to programs to enforce underage drinking and sale-to-minors laws will have a positive effect on efforts to address juvenile crime. According to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, on college campuses, 95 percent of violent crime is alcohol-related and in 90 percent of campus rapes that are reported, alcohol is a factor. 31.9 percent of youth under the age of 18 in long-term, state operated juvenile institutions were under the influence of alcohol at the time of their arrest. These statistics are frightening and they need to be addressed. 
This amendment will send a clear message to states that the federal government recognizes that enforcement of underage drinking laws is an important priority and that we are willing to back that message up with funds to assist states in their efforts. It is not good enough to simply urge better enforcement. We must provide the resources. 
In addition, Mr. President, I would like to say to my good friend, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, that I intend to work with him when S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1997, is being reauthorized and before the Senate in order to authorize funding for this program in the coming fiscal years. 
I call on my colleagues to support this amendment which will help states and localities better enforce youth alcohol laws and protect our children.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Cochran, the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Bumpers, the ranking member, for bringing to the Senate Floor the Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations Bill. This bill will provide funding for all activities of the Department of Agriculture, except those of the Forest Service, and the functions of the Food and Drug Administration, the Farm Credit Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
This bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, provides $50.7 billion in total obligational authority for the coming year. That is nearly $1.1 billion more than the bill reported by the House Appropriations Committee, and $1.6 billion below the President's request. It is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. 
This bill is $3.2 billion below last year's level, due largely to reductions in mandatory accounts. The subcommittee's discretionary allocation in budget authority was increased from $13.1 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $13.8 billion in this bill. 
This bill provides funding for programs vitally important to all Americans. These include agricultural research necessary to keep our farmers competitive in the global marketplace, conservation programs to protect the environment and productivity of the land, rural development programs to serve the millions of Americans who live outside our cities, and programs to promote U.S. agricultural products throughout the world. Funding in this bill for the Food Safety Inspection Service and the Food and Drug Administration ensures we will have safe food and blood supplies and that pharmaceuticals and medical devices will be safe and effective. 
I would like to specifically remark on the inclusion of funding for the second year of the Potomac Headwaters Land Treatment Watershed Project, a program to protect the Potomac River and its headwater feeder streams from a possible harmful accumulation of agricultural pollution. I am aware that some Members of Congress have expressed concern about the June 1, 1997, Washington Post article and an American Rivers' report that, in part, attributed pollution in the Potomac to West Virginia poultry production. These reports raised concerns but were one-sided in that they did not address the responsible actions already underway to mitigate possible problems that can be associated with poultry waste. Funding in this bill will continue the exemplary efforts by public officials and West Virginia small family farmers to balance economic interest with environmental goals by providing Federal money for technical assistance and loans to help family farmers design and institute the type of measures necessary to prevent pollution in rivers and streams. The program achieves benefits for a broad base of interests, extending from my beautiful state to the Chesapeake Bay, and is an example of government at its best. I thank the members of the committee for recognizing the widespread concerns held by the millions of people who draw their drinking water from the Potomac, and for taking action to alleviate these concerns. 
In all this is a very good bill, and I am happy to support its passage. Again, I congratulate Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers for their hard work. I also commend the work of the subcommittee staff: Galen Fountain and Carole Geagley, for the minority, and Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott Poindexter, and Rachelle Graves, for the majority.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Harkin amendment to fund the Food and Drug Administration's youth smoking prevention initiative at $34 million for fiscal year 1998. This is a worthwhile amendment which has my support. I applaud the efforts of Mr. Harkin to provide funding for this important initiative. Tobacco use among minors is illegal, and we should make every effort to prevent it. 
I am particularly pleased that the amendment by Mr. Harkin has been strengthened at my urging to encourage States to couple their youth smoking prevention efforts with State laws that prohibit underage drinking. These issues go hand in hand in preventing our youth from using destructive substances. 
Alcohol is the drug of choice among teens as well as a lot of adults, I am sorry to say, and the consequences are devastating. According to statistics compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, among children between the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetime experimented with alcohol. In the last month, approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. 
Think of that, eighth graders. Approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. What's the matter with the parents? I wonder what the parents are doing letting their children in the eighth grade drink. I wouldn't consider myself much of a parent if I let my children drink. If they do that, I blame myself. But the fact is that 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. It is pretty hard to believe. That would not have happened in my day going to school. 
In 1995, there were 2,206 alcohol-related fatalities of children between the ages of 15 and 20. According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, 37.5 percent of the young people who have consumed alcohol have also used some illicit drug, while only 5 percent of young people who have never consumed alcohol have used some illicit drug; 26.7 percent of those who have consumed alcohol have tried marijuana, while of those who have never consumed alcohol only 1.2 percent have tried marijuana. And 5 percent of youths who have partaken of alcohol have tried cocaine, while of those who do not drink alcohol only one-tenth of 1 percent have tried cocaine. 
So it is not just that alcohol is a real starter not only for more alcohol but for illicit drugs, for marijuana, for cocaine. 
Every State has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. How is it then that two out of every three teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages? Again, what is wrong with the parents? The parents are sleeping on the job. Two out of every three teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages. In my case, they would buy a good basting as well. My parents, they would not have put up with that, not with me, nor would other parents back in those days. We are living in a time, of course, when anything goes. 
Our children are besieged with media messages that create the impression that alcohol can help to solve life's problems, 
lead to popularity, and enhance athletic skills. Do you want to be a good athlete? Drink. Drink beer. Do you want to be popular with the girls? Drink beer. Do you want to be popular with the boys? Drink beer. The media messages help to leave that impression. These messages, coupled with insufficient enforcement of laws prohibiting the consumption of alcohol by minors, give our Nation's youth the impression that it is OK for them to drink. This impression has deadly consequences. In the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds--accidents, homicides and suicides--alcohol is a factor. Alcohol is involved in the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. 
Efforts to curb the sale of alcohol to minors have high payoffs in helping to prevent children from drinking and driving death or injury. So I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Harkin amendment to actively address two areas that so seriously harm the physical and mental health of our Nation's children. We have seen a great drive on in recent years by our Nation to curb the use of tobacco. All that is very well and good. I am not against that at all. But who has the nerve to raise the finger against alcohol? Who has the nerve to say, `Don't drink, period.' `Don't drink, period.' 
I congratulate my colleague, and I thank him for allowing me to join in the support of his amendment and for allowing me to add the language of my proposal that deals with drinking.

Mr. BYRD. As my colleagues will recall, the IRS has a large computer facility in my home State, in the city of Martinsburg. This facility should be an integral part of future IRS modernization efforts. Therefore, I have a question for the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee about this matter. 
In its report, the committee supported the IRS' modernization blueprint. With respect to private sector involvement, the committee said: 
In 1997, Congress directed the IRS to turn over a majority of its tax systems modernization work to the private sector. The committee is pleased that the IRS is planning to develop and implement the modernization plan through new partnerships with the private sector. 
Having said this, however, the committee included no funds in the bill for this purpose. My question is this: does the subcommittee chairman intend to recommend funding for the modernization program when a contract is let?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1023, the fiscal year 1998 Treasury and general Government appropriation bill, and commend the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl, for their very fine efforts in managing this bill. This is the first year that these distinguished Members have had an opportunity to manage this important bill which provides over $25 billion for the operation of the Department of Treasury and general Government activities. 
The bill is $456 million less than the amount requested in the President's budget. The Members are to be commended for their efforts to keep a tight rein on funding and trim back wherever possible. The bill is consistent with the 602(b) allocations for both budget authority and outlays for the subcommittee. 
Again, I congratulate Senators Campbell and Kohl for their effective work. I also commend the work of the subcommittee staff: Barbara Retzlaff and Liz Blevins for the minority and Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, Lula Edwards for the majority.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to commend the managers of the Fiscal Year 1998 VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriation Bill, Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski, for their hard work in fashioning this measure, and for bringing it to the Floor in a timely manner. The bill appropriates $90,901,535,000 for programs in Fiscal Year 1998, is within its 602(b) allocations, and is below the amount requested by the administration by about $70,903,000. 
 Mr. President, I specifically commend the chairman and ranking member for taking an extremely tight 602(b) allocation and spreading it across the twenty-one agencies. There were also additional constraints posed by the budget agreement resolved to accomplish a unified Federal budget in fiscal year 2002. 
This bill funds a diversity of agencies and programs. It is a challenge every year to develop a passable bill that addresses a variety of concerns from all Members of the Senate, the Federal agencies, and the American people. 
 Mr. President, this bill matches the President's request for Veterans Affairs, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation. The managers also protected several key programs in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, namely CDBG, HOME, and the McKinney Homeless programs. In addition, many cuts made in the proposed budget were restored. The highest priority was to adequately fund Veteran's medical programs, despite the proposed cut in the budget agreement. This bill matches the President's request for Veterans Medical Care, and restores the $27 million cut in Veterans Medical Research. 
 Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, as well as their dedicated, hardworking staff: Andy Givens and Liz Blevins for the minority and John Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, and Lashawnda Leftwich for the majority.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to commend the managers of the FY 1998 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for their hard work in fashioning this measure, and for getting it to the floor in a timely manner. The bill appropriates some $13,244,208,000 for the programs in FY 1998, is within its 602(b) Allocations, and is below the amount requested by the Administration by about $116 million 
The committee in its report indicates that the time is arriving for a review of our priorities and programs in this area, a bottom up review and a new scrutiny over programs and the extent to which they serve U.S. interests abroad. I am pleased that the Committee has focused on the progress we are making in supporting the growth of democracy and free market economies in Eastern Europe, the former states of the Soviet Union, and Russia and the Ukraine. Certainly the payoff for helping stabilize and nurture the growth of solid democratic institutions is far preferable to the extreme expense of maintaining arms races, such as we had to do during the course of over four decades of cold war. 
I am pleased that the Committee has included a provision that I suggested to provide traditional incentives, through programs such as the EXIM Bank, OPIC, the Trade and Development Program and the Foreign Commercial Service, to American companies operating in the oil-rich new sovereign nation of Azerbaijan. The bill pays appropriately high attention to the Caucasus, including Georgia, and Armenia, as well as Azerbaijan, and I think it is appropriate. American companies need the unstinting support of our government so as to compete effectively in that region, in light of the fact that foreign nations provide heavy assistance to their firms in that region. We need to keep the playing field level so that our firms stand a fighting change of success in that region in the development of Caspian region oil. 
I am pleased that the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. McConnell has offered an amendment to restore the earmark for Egypt in the bill. I believe that there should be a time in the not too distant future when the earmarks for Egypt and Israel should be reduced and finally eliminated. They are in effect entitlements which have accounted for a large percentage of our national program, and I do not think they should be regarded as permanent. They must be subject to review just as the rest of our programs are. Having said that, however, I believe that, so long as the earmark for Israel remains in the bill, that for Egypt must as well. 
Egypt has been a pillar of strength and support for the United States across the board. It has served to pick up the flagging momentum of the peace process which resulted from the negative actions by the Israeli Prime Minister and his right wing constituency in initiating inflammatory new settler housing in disputed Arab territories throwing a cold bucket of water on the momentum of that process. The Egyptian government has acted with courage and constancy in bringing its good offices to bear as an intermediary between the Israeli government and the Palestinians as a time when the United States needed help in that role;. I did not agree with removing the earmark for Egypt, just at a time when I think Egyptian actions were serving as invaluable support for the United States in keeping the peace process moving against a difficult adverse current established by Israeli actions. So, encourage the President of Egypt, Mr. Mubarak, to continue his efforts to play the constructive role that he has been playing in the Middle East. 
I would also point out, Mr. President, that Egypt and the United States have a special security relationship, a relationship that proved invaluable to the United States during the Gulf War against Kuwaiti aggression, is the basis for extensive exercises and joint operations day in and day out, together in the Middle East. Our two nations work closely together to counter terrorism, and extremism, to protect the secure flow of oil from that region, and the safe use of the vital air and sea routes in the region. It should be clear that Egypt's important strategic, geographical position, commanding the waterways linking the Gulf, Europe and the United States, makes her an indispensable strategic partner of the United States. This is a relationship that requires nurturing and regular dialogue and support.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I had hoped to speak briefly before this last vote to explain my reasons for voting against the amendment. This is a politically sensitive vote, and I did not have the opportunity to explain in advance. 
I am sympathetic to the concerns of Senator Smith with regard to religious minorities in Russia or anywhere else. The effect of the law recently passed by the Russian Duma is to discriminate against any religious group not recognized by the Soviet Government in 1982, which has the effect of recognizing the rights only of Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. This represents an onerous act of discrimination against religious minorities within the Russian Federation. 
I note that if the same standard included in the Smith amendment was applied to all other nations, we would be forced to terminate our foreign aid to other key United States allies, including Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. These nations, along with others, could not pass the test included in the Smith amendment. This amendment, therefore, discriminates against one nation, even while it claims that discrimination is its concern. Just as Russia should apply one standard in the case of all religions, so should the United States apply one standard in the distribution of foreign aid with all other nations. 
Finally, I would note that there are other diplomatic methods that can be used to deal with this problem. When the United States was concerned about Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union, we were able to greatly increase such emigration by using quiet diplomacy. As soon as the Congress enacted laws publicly attacking the Soviets on this matter, emigration was sharply reduced. The Smith amendment could well have the same effect, and would only make matters worse for religious minorities in Russia, as Nationalist elements in the Duma may react in anger to this action. 
I am not a strong advocate of foreign aid. I don't carry a brief for Russia, and as far as believing that religion should not be discriminated against, I don't think anyone in this Chamber would feel more strongly than I. But let me read to Members what the annual State Department report on human rights states in its report concerning Israel. 
Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status. 
Under the complex mixture of laws and regulations that apply to the territories, Palestinians are disadvantaged under Israeli law and practices compared with the treatment received by Israeli settlers. This includes discrimination in residency, land and water use, and access to health and social services. 
Reading from the same United States State Department report, concerning religious minorities in Israel: 
In civic areas where religion is a determining criterion, such as the religious courts and centers of education, non-Jewish institutions routinely receive less state support than their Jewish counterparts. The status of a number of Christian organizations with representation in Israel has heretofore been defined by a collection of ad hoc arrangements with various government agencies. Several of these organizations are negotiating with the Government in an attempt to formalize their status. 
Attempts to establish meaningful negotiations are ongoing. 
Another paragraph, under the subject of--this is very fine print, and I have some difficulty reading it--`National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.' The State Department report says: 
The government-- 
Meaning the Israeli government-- does not provide Israeli Arabs, who constitute 18 percent of the population, with the same quality of education, housing, employment, and social services as Jews. Government efforts to close the gaps between Israel's Jewish and Arab citizens have resulted in an estimated 180 percent increase in resources devoted to Arab communities between 1992 and 1996. Nevertheless, significant differences remain. 
Now, Mr. President, I felt that Senators ought to know my reason, and I certainly want my constituents to know my reason, for voting against this amendment. I wanted to call to the attention of the Senate the problem here in rushing to vote on matters that we don't clearly understand when we come to the well to vote. And I have that problem as much as anybody. But it seems to me there is some inconsistency here in handing out foreign aid--the American taxpayers' money. 
If foreign aid is going to be used as an enforcer of human rights, then we ought to be consistent. That is all I am saying. If we are going to be consistent, my colleagues, remember that you may be asked one day to cut off aid to Israel, or to cut off aid to Turkey. Senators know that I have fought battles on this floor here in support of Turkey, and so I am not saying this with any animus whatsoever toward the recipient countries; that is not it. I am just calling attention to the fact that we voted, in this amendment, to apply an `enforcer,' if I may use that term, concerning human rights, and it is not an enforcer tool that we apply consistently across the board against our friends. I don't know how we can defend votes like this to the American people. 
I feel as strongly as anyone about religion. I am not of the religious right and I am not of the religious left. I don't claim even to be a good man. My Scripture tells me that no man is good--but this is another matter. And I hope that Senators know that we don't even have a waiver provision in this amendment. I should think that there ought to be a waiver--a national security waiver. The President should have an opportunity to waive this provision under certain conditions. That is not in this amendment. What I am saying, I certainly don't say critically of the author of the amendment. My sentiments, I am sure, are much like his in the overall. But I think we make the mistake when we vote without really understanding what we are voting on in a matter of this kind. This is a very politically sensitive matter. It is pretty difficult to explain your vote against this kind of an amendment --pretty difficult. 
Finally, I note that there are other diplomatic methods that can be used to deal with this problem. When the United States was concerned about Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union, we were able to greatly increase such immigration by using quiet diplomacy. As soon as the Congress enacted laws publicly attacking the Soviets on that matter, immigration was sharply reduced. 
The Smith amendment could well have the same effect, and would only make matters worse for religious minorities in Russia, as nationalist elements in the Duma may react in anger to this action. 
Mr. President, that is the explanation of my vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in February 1987 the Senate and House passed S. Con. Res. 18 (100th Congress) authorizing the printing as a Senate document of `The Senate 1789-1989.' A compilation of some 80 addresses that I had delivered during the 1980's on the history of the United States Senate, the book formed part of Congress' commemoration of its bicentennial. Between 1988 and 1993, the publication appeared in four volumes: two volumes of the addresses, together with a volume of classic Senate speeches and a statistical appendix. Printed in a large format with attractive historical illustrations, these books received favorable reviews. Volume I was awarded a prize by the Society for History in the Federal Government and commended by the American Library Association. Additional printing industry awards went to several of the Government Printing Office contractors involved in the books' manufacture. 
Through the Government Printing Office, copies of these volumes were distributed to government depository libraries throughout the country. The printing resolution stipulated that `in addition to the usual number of copies, there shall be printed with suitable binding 5,000 additional copies for use by the Secretary of the Senate.' These copies have been and continue to be distributed to educational institutions and other appropriate recipients. In addition, the Superintendent of Documents purchased for sale 4,600 copies of Volume I; 2,300 of Volume II; and 1,000 each of Volumes III and IV. Reflecting the superior quality of the books, the Government Printing Office offered these volumes at an average price of $56. 
In April of this year, my office inquired of the Government Printing Office, as we do periodically, how many of each volume had been sold and how many remained on hand. This time, we were astonished to learn that the number of volumes remaining was a total of 3,260 less than it should have been when we subtracted the number of copies sold since our last inquiry from the number that had remained at that time. When we asked GPO about the fate of these other copies, we were informed that there had been a `stock reduction'--apparently meaning that 3,260 of these beautiful valuable volumes were disposed of. 
On April 23, I wrote to Michael DiMario, the Public Printer, to request an explanation. On May 6, he responded that there had indeed been such a stock reduction in order to save storage costs and streamline sales operations. He further stated that, if additional copies of these volumes were ever needed, they could of course be reprinted. No one who has seen these beautifully crafted books could possibly believe that it would be cost effective to destroy more than 3,000 copies and reprint them later, rather than simply paying for lower-cost off-site storage until they should be needed. If such a reduction was in fact necessary, I cannot fathom the distorted thinking that would destroy books of such long-term value without at the very least informing the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, or my office, and giving us the opportunity to acquire these copies to make them available to various educational entities. When I expressed these further concerns to Mr. DiMario, I did at last receive an apology and an acknowledgement that it had in fact been an error to dispose of the books without prior notification. 
What of our nation's libraries? I have in mind those at the public and community college level that may lie outside the depository program. Would they not welcome surplus copies of selected government documents once thought worthy of being included in the Government Printing Office's sales program? Are we so distorted in our priorities that we prefer to shred such useful information rather than to disseminate it? 
I continue to be gravely concerned about this unfortunate incident, which demonstrates a major flaw in the procedures of the Superintendent of Documents and the Government Printing Office. Perhaps this was simply an unfortunate exception. Or perhaps it reveals a pattern of inattention, carelessness, or even malfeasance. What other titles in the Superintendent of Documents' inventory may have received similar treatment in the name of `stock reduction?' I, for one, would like an answer.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the recommendations of the defense subcommittee for the Department of Defense Appropriations measure for FY 1998. The $247.2 billion recommended for the programs under the jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee is within the subcommittee's allocation in both budget authority and outlays, and is $1.2 billion below the amount authorized by the Senate for these programs in the Authorization bill which was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate last week. The recommendations have been unanimously supported by all members of the Defense Subcommittee, an event which is noteworthy, and is a reflection on the judgment, experience and abilities of the distinguished leadership of the subcommittee, my friend, the Chairman, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and the senior Senator from Hawaii, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Inouye. 
The bill is noteworthy for the consensus that underlies it, and the Senate is fortunate to have these two senior Senators, with vast experience in defense matters, at the helm of our post-war defense spending. Central elements of American leadership in the post-cold-war world are the readiness, capabilities and further development of our military forces, present in all major regions of the world, exercising leadership in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific. While the agenda for American leadership will change, and is changing, we have witnessed, several times in this century, the risk that abdicating such a leadership role can entail. The need for such leadership is a jointly held responsibility of the Administration and the Congress. It is clear that America is not retrenching radically from its commitments and its far-flung presence as a result of the end of the cold war, in some historical variance with the practice of our nation in times of peace in the past. 
Mr. President, the quality of life and the need to attract excellent, motivated people for the armed forces is a critical ingredient of our long-term success in carrying out our commitments. I note that the Subcommittee has produced recommendations with a top priority of fully supporting our men and women in uniform, including funding for a 2.8 percent pay raise for military personnel. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill, worthy of the strong support of the Senate. It is the product of a truly bi-partisan process, and comes with the unanimous support of the members of the Appropriations Committee. I commend the leadership of that Committee, and the capable staff of Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye in putting this bill together.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, on Friday, July 11, I read of the retirement of the giant advertising mogul, the macho, motorcycle-riding, man-beast, popularly known as Joe Camel. 
Apparently old Joe is throwing in the towel and forever taking off his black, wrap-around shades to pack his hump and slip quietly off to the anthropomorphic rest home for flashy marketing tools. It is rumored that his bunk mates will be that patch-wearing, black-and-white spotted seller of Budweiser, Spuds McKenzie and Alex, the Golden Retriever who finally wore himself out retrieving bottles of Strohs beer from the refrigerator for his ever-demanding master. 
I, for one, will not lament Joe's departure from the American advertising scene. Maybe R.J. Reynolds' decision to retire him from the murky business of luring impressionable young people to `light up' will influence other corporate giants like Budweiser to `kick the habit' and ask their famous mono-syllable frogs to croak their last croak. Budweiser might even finally be moved to blow the whistle on the `Bud Bowl.' 
Our kids are faced with enough temptations through peer pressure, and because of the influence of a fast-paced, morally anemic society without the influence of cute and clever cartoon seducers such as Joe the Camel; the Budweiser frogs; football-helmeted, dancing beer bottles; or pomp and circumstance parading dogs, holding bourbon bottles instead of diplomas in their mouths. 
All of these Madison Avenue devices, designed to project harmless or hip images to young impressionable minds, only serve to reenforce the lure of a sterile, pleasure-seeking existence which suggests no goals, but a good time on Saturday night. 
I, for one, am delighted with the news of Joe Camel's departure and heartened by the fact that at least some in our attention-fractured, apathetic society have been outraged by the not-so-subliminal attempts to use children to fill up corporate coffers. There is a lesson here for those whose allegiance to profits outweighs any sense of moral obligation. It is, to paraphrase a famous quote, that those who ride the back of the tiger, or the camel for that matter, might just end up inside. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one of the most difficult and intractable problems facing the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] is the civil war in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In recent years, we have witnessed mass murder and genocide on a scale not seen in Europe since the Holocaust. We have also been concerned that this conflict could spill over into neighboring countries, which would force NATO to intervene under much worse circumstances.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and I am asking that I be included as a cosponsor. This amendment addresses some of the lessons to be learned from the Persian Gulf War in relation to the health of U.S. military personnel who served in that operation, many of whom are suffering from what has come to be called Persian Gulf War Illness, or Gulf War Syndrome. 
This amendment requires the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to assess the needs of, and prepare plans to provide effective health care to, veterans of the Persian Gulf War and their dependents. It also directs the DoD and VA to consider the health care needs of reservists and former members of the military who suffer from Persian Gulf War Illness and who have fallen through the cracks of the military and veterans health care systems. If ultimately implemented, this plan, which is due by March 1, 1998, would be a significant improvement over the existing tragic situation faced by many Gulf War veterans and their families. This is the responsible way to deal with this issue, rather than leaving these families to struggle individually to deal with the effects of the invisible wounds suffered in the service of our Nation. I have spoken previously about a soldier struggling to provide health care for his child, fighting to cope with the child's severe deformities and health conditions that may have resulted from his exposure to toxins during the Gulf War, and about service members who have left the military because of their declining health and who cannot get medical insurance because of health conditions they believe are the direct result of their service. 
A special concern that has arisen from our Gulf War experience concerns the use of new and investigational drugs and vaccines to protect our military personnel from the deadly effects of chemical and biological weapons. My colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, has taken a particular interest in this matter, and I commend him for his vigilance in looking after the interests of our military personnel in this regard. This amendment contains a provision to modify the U.S. Code to require notice to all service personnel whenever new or experimental drugs are being administered. It also requires the Secretary of Defense to ensure that all service members' medical records accurately document the administration of these drugs, so that possible involvement in future post-war illnesses can be better studied. 
In addition to looking at ways to deal with the health after-effects of the Gulf War, this amendment also implements other lessons learned from health problems arising from that conflict. It requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a system to better monitor the health of military personnel before deploying them to future operations overseas, and to 
maintain those records more efficiently. This will correct deficiencies noted from the Gulf War experience. The amendment also requires a plan to better track the daily movements and locations of units and individuals during future military operations. We have seen how important this is, given the difficulty that DoD has had over the past year in identifying those units that were in the vicinity of the Khamisiyah ammunition depot when U.S. forces destroyed it after the Gulf War, possibly releasing toxic chemical nerve and blister agents into the atmosphere. In admitting this incident, DoD officials first said only a small number of troops were in the immediate area, but, over time, the number of units has continued to grow, and the number of individuals affected has climbed to over 27,000. The number is expected to continue to grow as more information becomes available. Mr. President, these delays only add to the concerns of our veterans, and only continue to delay the effective medical treatment of affected soldiers. 
Also in preparation for future wars in which chemical and biological weapons might be employed, this amendment requires a plan to deploy a specialized chemical and biological detection unit with military forces sent into those dangerous situations. In the Persian Gulf War, some 14,000 chemical alarms were set out and DoD witnesses have testified that the alarms sounded an average of three times a day, for a total of some 1.7 million alarms. Yet, most were dismissed as false alarms or battery tests. That is not information designed to instill confidence in these alarms, to say the least. A specialized unit could provide more reliable detection and confirmation of the threats faced by our forces. 
On the medical front, this amendment calls for a review of the effectiveness of medical research initiatives regarding Gulf War illness, as well as a recommendation on the adequacy of federal funding for this issue. Last year, I offered an amendment, which was adopted, that provided $10 million for independent scientific research into the possible role of low levels of chemical warfare agents in Gulf War illnesses and their impact on the children of Gulf War veterans. This was a field of inquiry that had not been previously addressed by the Department of Defense or by the VA, and I am pleased that the DoD has moved quickly to award those funds to peer-reviewed research programs. I hope that these studies will provide answers in an expeditious manner, so that any findings might be rapidly put to use in providing effective treatment for our Persian Gulf veterans. It will be helpful to have an assessment of whether our efforts to date to help these soldiers and their families have been sufficient. 
Finally, this amendment initiates a program of cooperative DoD-VA clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of medical treatment protocols for Persian Gulf veterans suffering from ill-defined or undiagnosed conditions. 
Mr. President, these are useful provisions that will continue to place a much needed focus on the lingering and serious health concerns remaining from the Persian Gulf War. The slow and half-hearted efforts of the Department of Defense to address the health concerns of Persian Gulf veterans over the last six years has fed the cynicism that is spreading throughout our military, causing soldiers to lose confidence and faith in the system that is supposed to support them, and which they are expected to obey without question. That cynicism is a dark and spreading cancer that must be caught and corrected early, before the system is weakened beyond repair. This amendment is a step in that direction, and I am pleased to cosponsor it. I thank my colleague, Senator Dodd, for his efforts.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a newspaper article entitled `Wishes do come true for Kids' appeared in the Saturday, June 21, 1997, edition of the Washington Times. The article relates the story of a charitable foundation--Kids, Inc: which was established in 1982. The foundation has helped gravely ill youngsters in 17 states find some measure of happiness in their last days by financing a special vacation with their family members, or meeting a celebrity, or attending a circus, or participating in a group outing such as a VIP tour of the U.S. Capitol. 
The article also tells about the moving force behind this very worthwhile volunteer organization--retired Army Colonel John G. Campbell of Burke, Virginia. 
I am not surprised to read of Colonel Campbell's efforts to help some of our most vulnerable citizens. I have known Colonel Campbell for many years. He accompanied me on a congressional delegation to China and on several trips to dedicate military facilities in the state of West Virginia. He has served the country in uniform and as a staff member of the U.S. Senate. I have always found Colonel Campbell to be a man of competence, compassion, and Christian conscience. I thank and commend him for his efforts on behalf of the children who have benefited from Kids, Inc., and wish him and his wife, Jan, well.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the recent scandals and confusion concerning gender relations in our armed forces demonstrate a clear need to review the experiences, practices, regulations and laws regarding these matters as soon as possible. The nation has been treated to a range of incidents and official responses, from the cases of abuse of authority at the Aberdeen training facility and other military bases in the nation, to the controversy over the treatment of Air Force First Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, and that of flag officers in the different services. A comprehensive independent review is needed on the full range of these issues, and I am pleased that the Armed Service Committee adopted a proposal of mine, which was co-authored by Senators Kempthorne and Cleland, of the personnel subcommittee, and supported by the full Committee, to establish an independent commission to work on this matter. 
The commission proposal is included as Section 552 of the bill. In summary, the provision establishes an 11 member commission to study issues related to gender integration. All of the commission's members would be appointed by the Senate. They would be chosen from among private citizens with knowledge of these matters--at least two from academia, at least four former military members, and at least two members of the reserve components. The duties of the Commission include (a) reviewing the current practices of the Armed Forces, as well as relevant studies and private sector training concepts regarding gender-integrated training; (2) reviewing the laws, regulations, policies, directives, and practices that govern personal relationships between men and women in the armed forces; (3) assessing the extent to which those laws, regulations and policies have been applied consistently throughout the Armed Forces without regard to service, grade, or rank of the individuals involved; (4) providing an independent assessment of the reports of the various bodies that the Secretary of Defense has established to look into these matters; and (5) examining the experiences, policies and practices of the armed forces of other industrialized nations regarding gender-integrated training. An initial report of the Commission is due on April 15, 1998, and a final report by September 16, 1998, with findings and any legislative and other recommendations the Commission deems necessary. These dates were selected to allow the second session of this Congress time to act, if it wishes, on any recommendations that the Commission might provide. 
Mr. President, clearly we are in the middle of a national debate on gender relations and on general conduct in the services, and the work of this independent commission to review the main issues which have arisen seems urgent, and I hope will be of use to the Senate and to the nation. I also hope that all of us will keep our eye on the goal of producing the most effective, combat-ready, disciplined and tough fighting force that the nation can field. I believe that effectiveness, discipline, unit cohesion and morale must not ever take a second place to any other goal, since the premier responsibility of the military is the national security of our nation. 
I again thank the committee for its strong support of my proposal, and I hope that the commission can be put into place as soon as possible after the Congress has completed its work on this bill and it has been signed into law.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment which I am offering enables Air National Guard units in West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and California to maintain their full complement of 12 C-130's. Without $13 million in operations and maintenance funds and $4 million in personnel funds, these units would be forced, prematurely and perhaps unwisely, to reduce their airlift capacity to 8 aircraft per unit. 
The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 1998 reduces the Air National Guard inventory of C-130's in these five states from 12 aircraft per unit to 8 aircraft in accordance with earlier Air Force program decisions. However, it makes no sense to reduce the C-130 units until the completion of the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR] process by the Department of Defense. The purpose of the QDR is to reassess the U.S. defense strategy, force structure, readiness, modernization and infrastructure. Why not have the benefit of that reassessment before we make such decisions? 
The Air National Guard C-130 units are major players in the air mobility plan of the United States Air Force. It is my belief that a reduction of the type proposed in the budget is premature, without the final conclusions of the QDR process. More and more reliance is being placed upon our reserve component forces as the active duty military establishment downsizes. It is not prudent to reduce the aircraft and manpower levels of the very organization that is expected to respond to global crisis situations, while supporting numerous U.S. Air Force mobility missions in Bosnia, Southwest Asia, Central America and throughout the United States. Consequently, the amendment I am offering will restore the force structure, personnel, and funds necessary to continue to operate these units at 12 aircraft.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, wrote a book titled `Pandemonium.' Milton, in `Paradise Lost,' designated the Palace of Satan as pandemonium. Mr. President, what we have seen going on here is pandemonium, and in light of what I have just said, Senators can draw their own conclusion as to what I mean by that word. 
This is a very important amendment to the reconciliation process. It extends the overall time from 20 hours to 30 hours. It reduces the time on any amendment in the first degree to 30 minutes. It reduces the time on any second-degree amendment to 20 minutes. May I proceed for an additional 2 minutes?

Mr. BYRD. After the first 15 hours have expired, time on amendments in the first degree and in the second degree will be limited to 20 minutes each. The amendment provides for 30 minutes equally divided for debate on a motion to reduce the time, which can be done now without any debate. It requires unanimous consent for managers of a reconciliation measure to yield back any time. At the present time, they may yield time back without unanimous consent. 
Now comes probably the most important provision in the proposal. If Senators will turn to page 19 in their rule books. I will read the language from the cloture rule: 
After no more than thirty hours of consideration of the measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been invoked, the Senate shall proceed, without any further debate on any question, to vote on the final disposition thereof to the exclusion of all amendments not then actually pending before the Senate at that time and to the exclusion of all motions, except a motion to table. . .

Mr. BYRD. I repeat: 
After no more than thirty hours of consideration-- 
I am reading from the present cloture rule-- 
After no more than thirty hours of consideration of the measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been invoked, the Senate shall proceed, without any further debate on any question, to vote on the final disposition thereof-- 
Meaning the final disposition of the reconciliation bill-- to the exclusion of all amendments not then actually pending before the Senate at that time and to the exclusion of all motions, except a motion to table, or to reconsider and one quorum call on demand to establish the presence of a quorum (and motions required to establish a quorum) immediately before the final vote begins. 
Therefore, Mr. President, we do away with this situation in which pandemonium reigns supreme and where scores of amendments remain to be acted upon after the expiration of the time on the reconciliation bill and people want to call those up--and they have a right to call them up and get a vote thereon. 
This amendment encourages Senators, if they want time to debate their amendments, to call them up at the beginning of the debate, call them up early, when they will have time to explain their amendments. But when we reach that final 30th hour, under this amendment language, which is already tried and true--it is in the cloture rule--we close all debate, all voting on amendments to the reconciliation bill with the exception of any amendment in the first degree and any amendment in the second degree which may be then pending. That is it. No more of this vote-o-rama.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the halls of the Capitol have been filled recently with cheers and rejoicings for the balanced-budget agreement reached between President Clinton and the Congressional leadership in May of this year. We have been told time and time again that balancing the budget is crucial to the future of our Nation and that enacting this budget agreement will eliminate the Federal deficit. Well, Mr. President, I find it interesting that the reconciliation legislation before the Senate today has nothing to do with balancing the budget. Rather, S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, will bring us farther away from our collective goal of balancing the budget by reducing revenues some $76 billion below what they would otherwise be over the next five years. 
Mr. President, the Senate has already approved legislation this week to balance the Federal budget. On Wednesday, June 25, the Senate approved S. 947, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997. Despite its deficiencies, that legislation provides for some $127 billion in deficit reduction over the next five years. These savings, coupled with the $96 billion in discretionary savings provided in the Budget Resolution, will likely produce a balanced budget in the next five years. While I had intended to support passage of the first reconciliation bill, I became deeply concerned about a provision in the bill emanating from the Finance Committee that would raise the eligibility age for Medicare from sixty-five to sixty-seven years. As reported, the bill already included a provision to create a National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to study ways to preserve and protect the Medicare program for future generations. If the bill thus created a commission to study and propose recommendations to protect Medicare in the future, why was the aforementioned increase in the eligibility age included in this bill? Is that not why we are creating the commission in the first place? Mr. President, the important and controversial issue of raising the eligibility age for Medicare beneficiaries should be decided by a national debate--not in the opaque cloaking of a reconciliation bill. Thus, because of my deep concerns about this provision on both substantive and procedural grounds--and my general frustration with the haste and confusion with which the Senate was considering the overall measure--I decided not to support passage of the first reconciliation bill. However, let me affirm that my vote against this measure in no way reflects any unwillingness on my part to pass spending cuts to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, let me now turn back to the pending matter, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. All Senators should be aware that, on the heels of approving a deficit-reduction plan to balance the budget, we are about to approve subsequent legislation to weaken--and possibly undermine--that very 
balanced-budget plan. I have not kept secret my fervent opposition to this foolish idea of cutting taxes while simultaneously trying to balance the budget. Doing so is simply so illogical that a third-grade student, with just a pencil, paper, and a modest knowledge of the fundamentals of mathematics, would be sufficiently equipped to reach the same conclusion that tax cuts and deficit reduction do not mix. I am confident that such a student would choose, like this Senator chooses, not to include such tax cuts in a plan to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, as I stated in my remarks on the Budget Resolution approved last month, by including these tax cuts in this balanced-budget plan, we are with one hand digging deeper the very hole our other hand is trying so hard to fill. We should not rely on such ambidexterity to balance the budget. We should shelve all tax cuts until after we firmly erase the budget deficits that have so plagued our nation in recent years. Tax cuts were, after all, the primary culprit for the rapid escalation in the federal budget deficit in the 1980's. It is all too easy to enact tax cuts and save the pain for later. We have done it before, and the lessons learned from that exercise should instruct us not to do it again. 
Mr. President, traditionally, one of the most powerful arguments in favor of tax cuts has been that they spur economic growth. I do recognize that properly constructed tax cuts can produce some positive economic results in certain circumstances. However, no matter how strongly one believes that tax cuts stimulate economic growth--and there are some in this body who unequivocally adhere to the supply-side dogma--there can be no sound argument made now that tax cuts are necessary to boost the economy at this time. We are currently in our sixth consecutive year of economic growth, the stock market continues to reach record high after record high, unemployment has just dipped below five percent, and inflation has remained in check. Mr. President, such a performance hardly bolsters the case that tax relief is necessary to inject new life into our economy. 
If anything, Mr. President, our current economic situation should reinforce the notion that reducing the deficit is more conducive to economic growth than cutting taxes. To illustrate this point, let me remind all Senators what actions have led to four straight years of declining deficits and to one of the healthiest American economies in the last thirty years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the FY 1997 budget deficit will be approximately $67 billion, or less than one percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Just five years ago, we were facing a budget deficit of $290 billion, or about 4.7 percent of GDP. This considerable improvement in the fiscal order of our nation did not occur by accident. Rather, it can be traced directly to the passage in 1993 of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (OBRA-93) by the 103rd Congress and its 
subsequent signing by President Clinton. That legislation combined responsible spending cuts and revenue increases to begin the painful--but necessary--process of eliminating the deficit. There can be no doubt of the success of OBRA-93 in bringing down the deficit and stimulating economic growth. OBRA-93 achieved such positive economic results not by cutting taxes, but rather by convincing financial markets that we were serious about reducing the deficit. These markets drove interest rates downward and consequently rewarded American taxpayers with lower interest payments on the federal debt, as well as lower interest payments for the purchase of a home, car, or an education. 
Mr. President, even if I were convinced that we must cut taxes before balancing the budget, I would also hope that any such proposal would not explode revenue losses in the long term. Unfortunately, S. 949 is flawed when judged by this standard. As reported, this legislation includes a significant backloading of many of its tax cuts to mask their true cost. As such, while the bill purports to reduce taxes by no more than $85 billion over the next five years, I suspect that these tax cuts will cost considerably more in the out years than we are being led to believe. The Joint Committee on Taxation's estimates reveal that the annual cost of these tax cuts would more than double between the years 2002 and 2007--thus reducing federal revenues at the same time our nation is preparing to face the rising entitlement costs that will stem from the retirement of the so-called `Baby Boomers.' I defy anyone to explain to me the flawed logic inherent in this proposal. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me explain my views on the Democratic alternative amendment that was offered by the distinguished Minority Leader. In looking at the Senator's proposal, I saw that he had made a considerable effort to ensure that these tax cuts are more fairly distributed and that the cuts do not explode in the long term. For this improvement, I applaud Senator Daschle and the other Members who have worked on this proposal, which is, in this Senator's opinion, an improvement over the pending legislation. However, I was unable to support his amendment to this legislation because it also provided for tax cuts prior to balancing the budget--a notion that I cannot philosophically accept. I hope that my vote against this proposal is not misconstrued as anything else but a determined, unyielding opposition to tax cuts at this time. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, despite my unequivocal opposition to this pending reconciliation bill, I would like to commend the members of the majority and minority leadership, and the Budget and Finance Committees, who have been able to bridge the gap between the White House and both parties in Congress to forge the budget compromise that we have considered this week. I know how difficult such compromise can be to reach, and, more importantly, to sustain. Nevertheless, I would much prefer not to have seen these tax cuts being debated at this time on the Senate floor. Such a debate is akin to arguing with your mother on whether or not you can eat dessert before finishing your broccoli. We may all want to eat the sweet and leave the vegetable, but we should know better--and our mothers would surely remind us so. I fear that the Senate will come to regret the action it takes on this legislation, though only the passage of time can be the final arbiter in this debate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week I was proud to celebrate West Virginia Day, marking the 134th anniversary of the birth of my great State. Born in the midst of a terrible war, the mountain State still bears witness to that difficult four years of struggle, from Harper's Ferry to battle sites across her hills and farmlands. But she also still stands fast, and holds onto the traces of earlier history in her sturdy log barns and cabins and the winding rows of moss-covered stones bounding fields and cemeteries. Crumbling now, these long stone walls are losing their battles to the honeysuckle vines and the frosty upheavals of the centuries, but they remind us still of our forebears who settled this rugged and beautiful country and who bequeathed to us a legacy both tangible and intangible. For just as these early settlers left us these stacked stones, they also left us an even greater gift, a gift no one else on Earth has ever truly shared--our American freedom and the remarkable form of government that keeps Americans free. 
Next Friday, on the Fourth of July, we in the United States will celebrate the declaration of our freedom and the announcement of our intent to form a new government, not bound by happenstance of birth or caste, but one that gives each man an equal opportunity to rise above the circumstances of his own beginning and to make of his life whatever his ability and ambition would allow. The government that was painstakingly crafted in the years following this turning point in history combines the best of many forms of government, while avoiding their excesses. I never cease to wonder at our great and lasting fortune in having been blessed with a collection of Founding Fathers who were able to blend so many differing viewpoints and draft a Constitution that is so well thought out, and so finely balanced, that it has survived over the last two centuries with remarkably little change--remarkably little change. It demonstrates an ability to cooperate that has been in rather short supply around here in recent years. 
The drafting of the American Constitution was the work of many minds. The Declaration of Independence, though conceived by a committee of five, was penned by a single versatile, very remarkable man. The group formed for this work was comprised of notables including John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert Livingston--whose namesake graces our Government today with his presence in the other body, Representative and chairman of the Committee on Appropriations in the House of Representatives, Bob Livingston. These were brave men to undertake what was then an act of treason against the British monarch, King George III. They decided unanimously to select Thomas Jefferson for the delicate job of putting into words the message they wanted to send to George III, and to the world. And of all the powerful and lyrical speeches that have ever been captured on the page, surely the grace, courage, and idealism of the Declaration of Independence ranks high. Thomas Jefferson's legacy to this Nation is a rich one, including the nucleus of our Library of Congress formed from his own 
collection after the destruction of the War of 1812, his contributions to the Continental Congress, and his service as President. But the soaring majesty of his words--beginning with `When in the course of human events * * *'--would stand alone as a monument to the man. Even as he lay dying at his mountaintop home in Monticello in 1826, Jefferson struggled to last until the fourth of July before succumbing to the call of the angels. John Adams, who died that same day--what a coincidence, what a coincidence--50 years after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, observed with his last breath that the young Nation was safe, because `Jefferson still lives.' He did not know that his friend had already died a few hours earlier. 
The birth of our Nation, like the birth of my beloved State of West Virginia, was marked by conflict ignited by the Declaration of Independence, and the fireworks that we will watch next Friday serve as a vivid reminder of the price of our freedom. But many of us will watch those fireworks amid gatherings of friends and family, and the sting of battle will be but a distant memory. In West Virginia, the Fourth of July is marked in traditional ways, with parades and large family reunions, gatherings of kin from around the State and around the country. In cities like Weirton and Ripley, high school bands and volunteer firemen will step out smartly behind banners carried by majorettes in sequins that glint in the bright afternoon Sun. Local politicians and beauty queens will decorate the open tops of mirror-polished convertibles. And families will cheer as the Stars and Stripes goes past, carried proudly by an Eagle Scout. The very sight of Old Glory stirs the pride in even the most jaded or unpatriotic among us, when it is surrounded by such homespun and heartfelt pageantry. 
After the parades, long tables will be laid under the old trees shading the yard--it may be a churchyard; There may be a cemetery nearby. Many hands will share in the labor of cooking, and the fragrance of meat grilling will blend with the sweet aroma of home-made pies and cakes. Children with watermelon juice dripping down their chins will run past grandparents in lawn chairs, waving their sparklers at the darkening sky as the dogs bark and give chase. When finally the fireflies give way to the stars, fathers will set up the roman candles, fountains, and noisemakers in a spectacular reprise of the `rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,' penned by Francis Scott Key as he witnessed the battle over Fort McHenry. 
And after the glories of the Fourth of July, after the sleepy children are put to bed and the dishes are washed, the gathered kinfolk will scatter like the fallen rocks of the old stone wall, back to their homes, to be gathered again for next year's reunion. The strength of their families goes with them, and the love and pride they have in their union and their country will be renewed. There is no better Nation on Earth, no Nation more blessed, than this one. So, for this happy Fourth, I wish my fellow Senators Godspeed as they go to their many homes throughout the several States of the Union. I wish them all a safe journey in their weekend 
travels. I also wish God's blessings to all Americans traveling or residing abroad, who will gather at U.S. Embassies to celebrate with their fellow Americans on the Fourth of July in reunions of strangers that are still, intangibly, our kin as citizens. So with God's blessings on everyone, everyone who is a part of the U.S. Senate, everyone who is part of the family of the Senate, we will come together again after we have celebrated the invisible yet lasting legacy of the men who gave us the Fourth of July. Henry Van Dyke captured this deep seated pride and kinship we all feel for our country, and never more so than on this holiday, in his poem, `America for Me:'  
'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down 
Among the famous palaces and cities of renown, 
To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,-- 
But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things. 
So it's home again, and home again, America for me! 
My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be, 
In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars, 
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars. 
Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air; 
And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair; 
And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study Rome 
But when it comes to living there is just no place like home. 
I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled; 
I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains filled; 
But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day 
In friendly West Virginia hills where Nature has her way! 
I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack: 
The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back. 
But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free, 
We love our land for what she is and what she is to be. 
Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me! 
I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling sea, 
To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars, 
Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, earlier today, in a seven-to-two decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Members of Congress do not have the requisite constitutional standing necessary to challenge the Line Item Veto Act. 
That decision overturns the April 10 ruling of the U.S. District Court, which held that the Act does, indeed, injure Members sufficiently to confer standing. Moreover, having granted standing, the District Court went on to conclude that the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of Congress' Article I lawmaking power. 
As the Senator whose name titles today's decision--Raines v. Byrd--I am obviously disappointed that a majority of the Supreme Court denied standing to Members of Congress. However, I remain mindful of the fact that the most important decision in this matter lies ahead. In the meantime, I am somewhat heartened by the fact that at least one member of the Court was willing to consider the merits of our argument. In what I believe will be a vindicated position, Justice John Paul Stephens wrote that `. . . the same reason that the [Members] have standing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is unconstitutional.' 
Madam President, let me take this opportunity to personally thank two groups of individuals who, I know, share my concern with the Court's decision. 
First, I wish to thank my Senate colleagues--Senator Moynihan, Senator Levin, and former Senator Hatfield--for their support, their wisdom, and their counsel throughout this process. Although this has been a collaborative effort, I, for one, have valued their contributions. And there were two Members of the other body who, likewise, joined us--Mr. Skaggs and Mr. Waxman. Of course, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the absolutly stellar legal work provided to us by Lloyd Cutler, Louis Cohen, Alan Morrison, Charles Cooper, and Michael Davidson. Despite the temporary setback, I am convinced that no other group of attorneys could have provided us with better, or more sound, advice. 
Finally, be assured that there will come a time when a State or locality, or an individual or group of individuals, will feel the brunt of the misguided legislative gimmick called the line-item veto, and will seek judicial relief. When that time comes, I will stand ready at the helm to support that effort.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, last Friday negotiators from the tobacco industry and State attorneys general announced the landmark agreement addressing the impact of tobacco use on our Nation, particularly our young people. Although this important deal will likely face many obstacles and has a long way to go toward implementation, it is an unprecedented first step toward curbing tobacco use and paying for the harm caused by that use. 
This process has caused our Nation to focus on an important public health danger and is an important step in working toward a meaningful solution. 
While I applaud the action being taken to address the pernicious health effects of tobacco, I am concerned that its evil twin, which also has a staggering impact on our Nation, is to a large measure being ignored. 
Mr. President, the cost of alcohol abuse to our country is staggering. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health, alcohol is used by more Americans than any other drug. And the results are devastating. 
The flood tide of alcohol causes more than 100,000 deaths each year in the United States. Alcohol abuse and alcoholism imposes approximately $100 billion in cost each year on society. Links have been found between alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver, as well as other harmful health conditions. Alcohol is a contributing factor in assaults, murders and other violent crimes, including fatal drinking and driving accidents. 
At the bottom of every empty bottle is another family in crisis, another career being destroyed, or another dream washed away. 
The amendment I am offering today would eliminate the tax deduction for alcoholic beverage advertising expenditures. In addition, it would increase funding for a number of programs that educate and prevent the abuse of alcohol among our Nation's youth. 
What should be of the utmost of our concern in our Nation is the impact of alcohol on our children and our grandchildren. 
I am introducing this amendment on behalf of the children who died because they were drinking and driving, and on behalf of the millions of children who are drinking right now without the full appreciation of what they are doing to themselves and what they could potentially do to others. 
Alcohol is the drug of choice among teenagers. 
Mr. President, more specifically, and looking at this chart compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, the use of alcohol by our Nation's youth is highlighted among different age groups, including children between the ages of 12 and 17. Among children between the ages of 16 and 17, 69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetimes experimented with alcohol. 
Clearly, as made evident by these alarming statistics, alcohol is the leading problem among teenagers--not marijuana, not cocaine. 
In the last month, approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been drunk--have been drunk. We are talking about eighth graders, 13 years old--13-year-olds. I never heard of such a thing when I was in my teens, as a young man, or in my middle age. We are talking about eighth graders, 13-year-olds. 
Every State has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. How is it then that two out of every three teenagers who drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages? 
The youth of this country, who at the delicate age of 15 should be enriching their minds with schoolwork, improving their bodies with exercise, and discovering the wonders of life through God and family values, instead are experimenting and endangering themselves with booze. Junior and senior high school students drink 35 percent of all wine coolers and consume 1.1 billion cans of beer a year. I know, because I pick some of them up off my lawn--I am talking about the beer cans, not the young people. 
I will repeat what is common knowledge to us all: Every State has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. Alcohol is a factor in the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds--the three leading causes--accidents, homicides, suicide. In approximately 50 percent to 60 percent of youth suicides, alcohol is involved. 
Links have been shown between alcohol use and teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Eighty percent of the teenagers do not know that a can of beer has the same amount of alcohol as a shot of whiskey or a glass of wine. By the time they are in college, 40 percent have binged on alcohol during the previous 2 weeks. 
In 1994, 8.9 percent--almost 95,000--of the clients admitted to alcohol treatment programs that received at least part of their funding from the State were under the age of 21, including over 1,000 under the age of 12. And 31.9 percent of youth under the age of 18 in long-term State-operated juvenile institutions were under the influence of alcohol at the time of their arrest. 
While our Nation's education system needs repair, it seems that our society has been successful in teaching these kids something. The problem is that what we have taught them is deadly. 
Drinking impairs one's judgment. We all know that. Nobody will dispute that. Alcohol mixed with teenage driving is a lethal, a lethal combination. We read about it all the time in the Washington Post, the Washington Times, and every newspaper in the land. In 1995, there were 1,666 alcohol-related fatalities of children between the ages of 15 and 19. The total number of alcohol-related fatalities that year was 17,274. Mr. President, for many years I have taken the opportunity, when addressing groups of young West Virginians, to warn them about the dangers of alcohol. I supported legislative efforts to discourage people, particularly young people, from drinking any alcohol. For example, 2 years ago I authored an amendment that requires States to pass the zero-tolerance laws that will make it illegal for persons under the age of 21 to drive a motor vehicle if they have a blood alcohol level greater than .02 percent. This legislation not only helps to save lives but it also sends a message to our Nation's youth that drinking and driving is wrong, that it is a violation of the law, and that it will be appropriately punished. Unfortunately and tragically, we all know someone, whether it is a family member or a friend or an acquaintance, whose life has been cut short by a drunk driver. These are senseless losses that are devastating to the families and the friends who are left behind. 
As if the aforementioned statistics about youth alcohol use and the results of that use are not frightening enough, young people who consume alcohol are more likely to use other drugs. 
On the chart to my left, Senators will note these statistics, compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, statistics which show that 37.5 percent of young people who have consumed alcohol have used some other illicit drug, versus only 5 percent of young people who have never consumed alcohol; 26.7 percent of those who have consumed alcohol have tried marijuana, versus 1.2 percent of those who have never consumed alcohol; 5 percent of youths who have partaken of alcohol have tried cocaine, while only 0.1 of 1 percent of those who do not drink have used cocaine. So it is not a question that is even debatable that youths who drink alcohol are more likely to use other drugs. 
Mr. President, as the aforementioned facts and figures indicate, alcohol exacts a tremendous cost on our society. These costs are not always clear-cut. For example, consider the costs of the lost productivity of a person showing up at work on a Monday morning with a hangover and inadequately performing his or her job, perhaps making a mistake that results in injury. How many of us would like to ride in the automobile that was made on such a Monday morning? How many of us would like to fly on the airplane whose maintenance man or woman, whose mechanic was on a binge the previous day? While there is no way to accurately gauge the enormous costs that alcohol exacts upon our society, there can be no doubt that the pleasures of alcohol consumption exacts a considerable price on our Nation. 
The purpose of the amendment that I introduce today is simple. My proposal would simply tell all producers of alcoholic beverages that they can no longer deduct the costs of their advertising expenditures on those products from their Federal income tax liability. While advertising is generally deductible as a legitimate business expense, I believe there exists a moral, legitimate reason to create an exception for 
producers of alcoholic beverages whose products exact such considerable costs on our society. My proposal would not make illegal any advertising of alcoholic beverages. It does not say that any advertising of alcoholic beverages is unconstitutional. It does not attempt to ban such advertisements, nor would it create any additional Federal bureaucracy to regulate alcohol products. Rather, it would simply end the American taxpayers' subsidization of alcohol advertising by amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include a disallowance of any deduction for any amount paid or incurred to advertise or promote by any means any alcoholic beverage. This is not a sin tax. It is, rather, an end to the sin subsidy that has left American taxpayers footing the bill for both alcohol advertising and the high health care costs inflicted on society by alcohol consumption. Now there may be those who argue that it is wrong to single out alcohol advertising expenses. I counter that with the question: What other product, with the possible exception of tobacco, costs society $100 billion each year? What other product results in more than 100,000 deaths each year in the United States? The statistics are indeed staggering. 
Mr. President, in these complicated times, the innocence of youth, the innocence of youth is dashed away at an early age by the irreverent messages spewing from the television set. Profanity and violence on television programming are interrupted only by the aggressive commercials seeking to influence viewers in the name of profit. Our impressionable youth, pressured by the self-indulgent motives of revenue-hungry corporations are bombarded by countless images glorifying an unrealistic view of reality, often insincerely portraying alcoholic beverages as an ingredient for ideal lifestyles. Our children are besieged with the message that if you drink you will attract beautiful women, if you drink you will be popular, if you drink you will excel at sports. Are these the images of reality or do they leave out something important? Do they leave out some important facts about alcohol consumption? What about the negative and all too prevalent results of alcohol consumption--the hangovers that result in lost productivity, the tragic deaths, the injuries caused by a drunk behind the wheel, the hospital visits for alcohol poisoning, the horrible effects of cirrhosis of the liver and the families torn apart by alcohol abuse. 
The industry indicates that their advertisements do not target young people, although this is debatable. A January Wall Street Journal article, detailing a competitive media reporting survey commissioned by the Journal, found that beer advertisements are often aired during programs that are watched by large numbers of adolescents. The findings of this survey are extremely disturbing. In one example, referenced in the article, a beer ad ran during the airing of a popular cartoon show on the MTV station of which 69 percent of the audience was comprised of children under the age of 21.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, looking at another chart to my left, this chart demonstrates competitive media reporting estimates that the alcoholic beverage industry spent more than $1 billion on alcohol advertising in 1995. 
In contrast, in 1995, the Federal investment in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism was a mere $189.8 million for alcohol research. Does the industry expect us to believe that it would spend this huge amount of money--$1.1 billion--if it were not getting something for that money? Some may argue that this legislation would adversely affect the advertising industry by forcing producers of alcoholic beverages to eliminate their advertising expenditure. Poppycock. I do not believe that this would be the case. 
Alcoholic beverage producers spend large amounts of money to advertise their products because it encourages people to consume their product and it, therefore, increases sales. Eliminating the advertising deduction will not eliminate the fundamental business practice. By making these advertisements less profitable, this amendment may reduce the overall amount of alcohol advertising in our society. However, let there be no doubt that the alcohol ads will keep on running. You can bet your bottom dollar on that. They will. The difference, however, will be that the American taxpayer will no longer be subsidizing this activity and that the money will go, instead, to getting the other side of the alcohol story out. That is what we need to start doing. We need to start now getting the other side of the alcohol story out. It is perhaps not the most popular thing politically to attempt to do here, but it needs to be done. 
This amendment is all the more necessary because, last year, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States decided to reject its self-imposed ban on advertising hard liquor on television and radio. I decried this decision by the Distilled Spirits Council because it is a step backward at a time when our Nation is working to curb alcohol abuse. Now hard liquor advertisements will be flowing over the airwaves. This is not the direction in which our Nation should be moving. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the elimination of the tax deduction would result in $2.9 billion in savings over 5 years. My amendment targets the savings from the elimination of the disallowance to programs to prevent alcohol abuse among our Nation's young people and to educate children about alcohol. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration would be given increased funds to supplement programs to prevent the use of alcohol among young people and to fund a media campaign designed to counteract the constant bombardment to which our children are subjected daily by alcohol advertisements. It is important to give our children information about the risks associated with the consumption of alcohol. We should not sit idly by and leave unchallenged the messages of alcoholic beverage advertisements that only good things happen to those who drink alcohol. 
This amendment will also direct funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to carry out a comprehensive strategy to prevent alcohol-related disease and disability. The CDC would be given authority to enhance and expand fetal alcohol syndrome prevention activities throughout the Nation. According to the NIAAA, fetal alcohol syndrome is estimated to affect from one to three children out of every 1,000 live births. 
To address the distressing problem of alcohol-impaired driving, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's alcohol-impaired driving incentive grant program, previously known as section 410, would receive additional funding. Funding is also made available to NTSA to launch a media campaign about 
the perils of driving under the influence. 
The Indian Health Service will receive funding for its alcohol abuse programs to address the issue of alcohol abuse, which has such a devastating effect on the first Americans. I don't refer to them as native Americans. I don't refer to them as native Americans. I am a native American. If I am not a native American, of what country am I a native? I refer to them as the original Americans, or the first Americans. 
The harm that alcoholic beverages cause our Nation is not a second-rate hangover, but a serious affliction that kills more than 100,000 people each year. By adopting this amendment, we would be making a positive effort to improve the health of our Nation, particularly of our children, and to send a sober message to those who are capitalizing on profits generated by recklessly advertising alcoholic beverages through far-reaching and seductive means, such as television. 
We should act in the best interests of the American people and announce `last call' to those who have been receiving tax breaks for peddling booze, take a step in the right direction and begin to repair some of the damage brought by alcohol in this country. Let us begin by putting a cork in the tax loophole that has left American taxpayers picking up the tab for the alcohol industry. 
Now, Mr. President, I am very well aware that a point of order will be made, or can be made. I am well aware of that. But I think the debate has to start at some point. I think that point is now. We hear a great deal about tobacco and we hear a great deal about children, about children's health. I hope those who support those programs and talk much about them would support this effort. We are talking here about children's health. We are talking here about something that kills 100,000 people every year. I am not seeking to ban alcohol. I am not seeking to regulate alcohol. I am simply seeking to end the subsidization by the taxpayers of this country of alcohol. 
Think about it. Think about it on your way home tonight as you drive out the George Washington Parkway and see someone in front of you wobbling from one side of the road to the other. Think again. Suppose your wife is up at Tyson's Corner getting ready to drive home with the children and that same fellow who was in front of your car wobbling may kill your wife and your children. 
So let's start talking about it. Let's start airing the subject here. Let's stop putting it behind the curtain, putting it under the rug, saying it is taboo. It is not. It is not taboo. Think about our children, our grandchildren. This is the product that kills other people. Tobacco may kill me. Tobacco may kill the individual who smokes it. But alcohol may not kill the person who imbibes; it may kill the innocent--the driver in the other car. 
So I hope that Senators will support my amendment. As I say, I am sure that there is a process or a motion available, but I am accustomed to those things. I say let the Senate work its will. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say that I fully understand the economic impact of the tobacco industry on the State of the distinguished Senator who has just spoken. West Virginia grows good tobacco crops as well, and the income from those tobacco crops certainly impact upon many families in many counties of West Virginia. We are talking about here, though, a product that results in the maiming and in the killing of people--innocent men, women, and children. 
The distinguished Senator from Kentucky mentions the carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions and possible implications of those emissions on health. People who breathe that air may well, indeed, suffer an adverse impact on their health. But they don't go out and maim. They don't go out and drive an automobile, lose their proper judgment, and end up killing innocent people. They do not go home and abuse their spouses if they smoke cigarettes or if they breathe air blown from them. They don't go home and abuse their children. They don't go home and assault and batter the other members of their family. 
I am talking about a product that we all know--it is not just this Senator's opinion. We all know when we read the daily newspapers about the effects of drinking and driving. We all read the newspapers in the spring following the graduation exercises at high schools, and we read, with horror, the stories of a few young people who get into an automobile and wrap that automobile around a telephone pole and they are all killed or maimed--maimed for life. 
That is what we are talking about. I am not talking about singling out an industry. I am talking about an industry that creates a product that is hurtful--not just hurtful to the person who uses it, but endangers, as I said already, the lives of others. We all know that. 
But I do appreciate the fact that the Senator is from Kentucky, and I respect him for that, and I respect his viewpoint and count him and his fellow Kentuckians as good neighbors. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator talks about red meat, eggs, and sugar. The Honorable Senator is my friend. Who ever heard of anybody eating red meat, eggs, and sugar, and getting out in the car and having that car plunge into a tree, weave all across the road, and kill and maim other people? Red meat doesn't cause an individual to drive drunk and get in the car and drive all over the highway. Eggs and sugar don't do that in their form as eggs and sugar, in their natural form. 
The Senator also, I think, made reference to the Federal Trade Commission in 1985, which found `no reliable basis to conclude that alcohol advertising significantly affects consumption, let alone abuse.' Well, let's see what the conclusions are from the effects of the mass media on the use 
and abuse of alcohol. 
The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Research Monograph-28, 1995:  
[The] preponderance of the evidence indicates that alcohol advertising stimulates higher consumption of alcohol by both adults and adolescents . . . It appears to be a contributing factor that increases drinking to a modest degree rather than being a major determinant. (Dr. Charles Adkins, Department of Communications, Michigan State University.) 
Now I shall quote Dr. Sally Casswell, Alcohol and Public Health Research Unit, School of Medicine, University of Aukland: 
[T]here is sufficient evidence to say that alcohol advertising is likely to be a contributing factor to overall consumption and other alcohol-related problems in the long term. 
Now quoting Dr. Joel Grube, Prevention Research Center: 
[A]lcohol advertising can influence children, particularly their beliefs about alcohol and, indirectly, their intentions to drink as adults. 
Finally, let me quote Dr. Esther Thorson, School of Journalism, University of Missouri: 
If research were designed to take account of what the advertiser is trying to do and if it examined the relationship between the specific structure of the message and the individual or group for whom that message is targeted, investigators probably would find `whopping effects'. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the views that have been expressed by my friend from Montana and, as I have already indicated, by my friend from Kentucky. I appreciate their views, and I respect their views. 
Mr. President, I don't think there should be any doubts in the minds of any Senator or any person who is viewing this Chamber via that electronic eye that the drinking of alcohol affects the judgment of people, and that there are many other costs that are not tangible, that cannot be translated into dollars and cents-- 
the cost of lost productivity, the cost of broken homes, the cost of children abused. And I could go on. 
I have made my case, and I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me attempt to respond to the distinguished Senator. 
I have a sense of what my responsibility is. I do not know what is in the managers' amendment. I have understood, in listening here, that there are various Senators who have amendments which are qualified and which are listed that they will call up unless the managers' amendment is satisfactory to them in respect to their several amendments. 
Now, if each amendment is called up, we at least get 2 minutes for an explanation. We get no explanation here of what is in this managers' amendment. It is not my desire to hold up action on this measure. It is somewhat embarrassing to me to have to stand and admit that I don't know what is in this amendment. I have voted on amendments today that I had very, very slender knowledge as to what I was voting on. 
I am not blaming anyone for this. I am not saying this to be critical of anyone. But I am concerned that here we are, before the American people, and it should be obvious to anyone who is viewing these actions that we are taking that many of us 
do not know what we are doing, what we are voting on, and these are very complex amendments. This is a very complex bill. 
We are at a great disadvantage because we have only 20 hours on a reconciliation measure. I tried last year to get 50 hours on a reconciliation bill, and I believe I got a majority of votes, but I believe I lost because it ran afoul of the Byrd rule. Therefore, it required 60 votes. Thank heavens for the Byrd rule. 
But, Mr. President, I do have a duty to my own conscience, if to no one else, and I am pretty sure I have a great duty to my constituents, to try to find out what's in the amendment we are about to vote on. In doing so, I am holding up the measure, I am delaying action on this measure. I am very well aware of it. 
I know the burdens that are upon the leadership, the joint leadership. I know the burdens that are on the managers of this bill. I, at least, have some idea. They have done well. They have had heavy burdens. They have spent hours, they have spent hours when I was at home with my wife, Lady Byrd, and my little dog, Billy Byrd. But they have spent hours. I saw them working here last night. I cannot understand a great deal in watching that tube as to what is at issue here. 
So I am considering asking for a division here. I think we have to shock this Senate one way or another into a realization that we have to change the rules with regard to reconciliation so that Members will have more time than we have. Here we are, we have run out of time, yet Senators have amendments that they want votes on. It is by unanimous consent that we have 2 minutes of explanation between each amendment. That is no way to operate. 
I cannot help it, Mr. Domenici cannot help it, Mr. Lautenberg cannot help it, the two leaders can't help it. That's the rule, 20 hours. 
There are Senators who insist on having votes on their amendments, and I think they have a right to have votes on their amendment. We are constrained by a rule here that just does not make sense. It may have made sense at one time. It does not anymore. We are living at a different time when we are under severe budget constraints and when the administration and the leadership enter into some kind of agreement of which I am not a part and about which I know little, other than what I read in the newspaper. 
So I have taken the floor here today to call attention to this very sad situation in which we are expected to vote on something without knowing what we are voting on. As I say, we are caught on the horns of the dilemma, and I do not feel right within myself about raising these points of concern. 
Now, the distinguished manager of the measure has suggested that we have an explanation of the amendments. That is all I am seeking in this instance. But I think we ought to get our collective heads together and try to work out some change in the rules whereby we will not be caught in this kind of situation. 
The American people would be ashamed of us. I think they would be very disappointed, and disappointed in me, too. They sent me up here to represent the people of West Virginia, and I don't know what I am voting on here. Who can blame me? My staff can't find out overnight. This morning when I came in, some of my staff stayed late into the evening hours. 
When I came in this morning, they didn't have the amendments available. They hadn't been printed. We just can't operate wisely and with any kind of solid judgment in that fashion. 
So I won't take more of the Senate's time now. But I do raise the specter of asking for a division, and a request for a division under the rules means that we vote on every divisible provision in that measure. And if I understood the Chair in response to my parliamentary inquiry, there must be scores of provisions which would be subject to division. 
I am not going to put the Senate through that today, but I warn the Senate that we had better do something about this because, otherwise, some Senator is going to feel conscience-stricken enough one day to stand up and use the rules, and there are some Senators who know something about the rules. So I raise that question here just to put Senators on notice that one Senator--one Senator--can cause all Senators to sit back and realize what we are doing and the way we are doing it is not good, not good for the Senate, not good for the American people.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't need to remind the distinguished Senator from New Mexico of his responsibility or any other Senator of his or her responsibility. As I said earlier, I am not complaining about anyone. I sympathize and empathize with the managers of the measure. They have done the best they could. You can't do any better. We have all been caught in this situation. It is not to our liking. But the distinguished manager, the chairman of the Finance Committee, sought to explain to me a minute ago, in 2 minutes, what was in this managers' packet. I didn't know anything, and when he completed, I didn't know any more than when he started. As a matter of fact, I was probably more confused. I think we would have had a little better explanation if we had a division and had each amendment explained.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't propose to have the answer to this problem. But it just seems to me that we are always caught up against a holiday, where we have a break the next week. And here we have this bill, and we will have the tax portion of the reconciliation process that will follow after that. And we are asked to cut a little of the time off here, cut a little off there. It would seem to me that if we could get started on these measures earlier, we would not be faced with a situation in which the managers have to stay here far into the evening hours, while other Senators go home. It seems to me that if we had been able to get to this measure earlier, we could have had more time. But here we are, and it seems to work out this way upon every occasion, where we are backed up to a wall of some kind, where there is the attempt to cut 20 hours down to 15, 12, or 10, or an attempt to cut 50 down to 40 on the budget resolution. We always get the question, `Would you be willing to cut some time off of the 40 hours, cut it down to 30?' `Would you be willing to go home and come back Monday and say that 15 of the hours, or 10 hours, or 20 hours have been consumed?' So I suppose these situations could be avoided. 
Let me get down to the point. Would someone explain what is in this amendment? As I explained, four or five Senators had amendments that they wanted to call up, but they were waiting to see what was in the managers' amendment. Those amendments must have been pretty important; otherwise, if they weren't in the managers' amendment, there would be a vote on each, some kind of vote, a vote by voice, a vote by division, or a vote by rollcall. There would be a vote and an explanation. Perhaps if we knew what was in those four or five major amendments, that would help.

Is there some way that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico or the distinguished Senator from New Jersey can enlighten Senators as to what is in this managers' amendment--particularly, if I may say, with reference to the four or five amendments that have qualified and were being held back to see if the managers' amendment took care of those amendments? 
As I understood it, Mr. Kennedy had one amendment.

I do not want to be a part of a problem. I am hoping we can at least get some response from those who understand what is in the amendment so that the rest of us will at least go home feeling we did our best in understanding it and that we at least made it clear that something is wrong with the way the process is working.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator is certainly doing everything that he can in the best of faith to try to explain some things about this amendment. I am sure this could go on quite a long time. It is not that kind of detail that this Senator is seeking. 
Let me say again that I am not accusing anyone of acting in bad faith. Everybody is acting in good faith. 
May I ask the distinguished manager of the bill: What were the four amendments that I understood Senators were holding back on to see what was in the managers' amendment? If we could have 
some indication of what they were about, that would be satisfactory with me.

I am not talking about the Senator. He is on the committee. He knows what is in the amendments.

Mr. BYRD. I will probably have two amendments. One of my amendments--I may offer an amendment that will attempt to extend the time on reconciliation measures. So I might say to the Senator, I want to be able to call up that amendment tomorrow, if I am able to develop one in the short amount of time that we have. 
I have another amendment that I have been working on, and I hope we could count on, say, 4 minutes equally divided between each amendment that is stacked, so we would get 2 minutes on a side. I find the explanations that are offered on amendments between votes are more edifying, in many instances, than the debates that went along earlier. Most Senators are able to capsule their remarks and focus more. But I really don't think a minute to a side is enough. I have seen some Senators cut off in the middle of sentences because the minute ran out. So, if we could say 4 minutes equally divided, would the Senator be agreeable to that?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, press reports today from the annual economic summit of the world's major industrial powers in Denver indicate that there was pressure on the United States from some of our allies to make new commitments to deep cutbacks on greenhouse gas emissions, specifically, carbon dioxide emissions. It is unfortunate that some of our allies, including the French in particular, chose this forum to change the terms of international dialogue on this issue. I commend President Clinton for resisting these surprising, new pressure tactics to shortcut the progress towards a reasonable solution at Kyoto and to try to force the United States to endorse an immediate commitment to unworkable new goals, thereby, shredding the negotiating process. We and the French are both part of negotiations intended as a follow-up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the so-called Rio Pact, signed in 1992, and approved by the Senate. The Rio Pact called upon the industrialized nations to aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000, a goal which will not be achieved by the U.S. or by most of the industrialized nations. 
As a result of the failure of most of the industrialized world to meet this voluntary commitment to reduce Carbon dioxide emissions, the parties met in Berlin in 1995 to discuss the future direction of the treaty. In Berlin, the United States agreed that new commitments should be binding upon the signatories, but the developing world was excluded from any new commitments. Unfortunately, excluding the developing world, which will be the most important emitter of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2015, exceeding the emissions of the OECD nations, was a mistake. The solution, if it is to be effective, must include all major emitting nations or it will fail to really get the problem under control. More than that, the perceived unfairness of forcing limits on the economies of only some nations, but not others, will cause political pressure to frustrate the approval and implementation of any treaty that is signed in Kyoto this December. The temptations of industries to flee from the U.S. for example, behind the safe non-binding walls of Mexico, for instance, or other developing nations, will both frustrate the goals of a treaty and unfairly penalize the developed economies. 
Therefore, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, and I authored a Sense of the Senate Resolution indicating that it is imperative for the developing world to be parties to any binding commitments made in Kyoto, that those so-called commitments should demonstrate unequivocally an action program to approach this problem in a realistic way, and that everyone should start with aggressive efforts to act on those commitments immediately and not settle for vague promises to return to future negotiations to get serious. While some countries have different levels of development, each must make unique and binding contributions of a kind consistent with their industrialization. The developing world must agree in Kyoto to some manner of binding commitments which would begin at the same time as the developed world with as aggressive and effective a schedule as possible given the gravity of the problem and the need for a fair sharing of the burden. 
Mr. President, in Denver during the last two days, some nations put pressure on the United States to agree to a whole new set of commitments beyond those agreed to in Rio, beyond the target of stabilizing at 1990 levels by the year 2010. Those nations sought to get the U.S. to agree to a 15 percent reduction by 2010, a level of reduction which would have very serious impacts on major sectors of the U.S. economy. There were no discussions of bringing the developing world into the play. I highly commend President Clinton for resisting these surprising new pressures to deviate from the Kyoto track, and set targets for very sharp new levels of reductions. Those nations should know that the United States Senate stands strongly behind the President in resisting these pressures. Reductions must be fair, well-managed, well-planned, and spread across the globe--spread across the globe. In addition, Mr. President, a wide-ranging new set of initiatives is needed to harness technology, to engage in new crash research and development technologies to mitigate the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion, as well as new energy efficiency programs, and cooperative programs between the developed and developing world. We have only begun to match the targets of carbon dioxide reductions and limitations with our technological genius and to engage in pioneering a new energy frontier type program aimed at using man's genius to tackle this global problem from every conceivable angle. 
I reiterate, Mr. President, that President Clinton is to be commended for resisting the pressure for these sudden draconian commitments. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to commend a fellow West Virginian, Charles E. (`Chuck') Beatty for his significant contributions to the Senate on the occasion of his recent retirement from the Bell Atlantic Telephone Company after more than 32 years of service. 
During the past 11 years, Chuck has faithfully served this institution. He was assigned to the Senate in 1986 when he was involved in the digital telephone switch installation. He has worked diligently and tirelessly throughout these years on any project required by the Senate, regardless of the deadline. Some of his other major accomplishments include overseeing the installation of telecommunications service for the last three Presidential Inaugurations and implementation of the state-of-the-art rewiring of the Russell Senate Office Building, which is nearly completed. No job was ever too big or too small or required too quickly. Chuck always provided the Senate whatever was needed as soon as necessary. 
Chuck was born in Cheat Neck, West Virginia, outside of Morgantown, where his parents still reside. He frequently returns to a cabin near Moorefield to enjoy the West Virginia scenery and air as well as canoeing on the North Fork of the Potomac River. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank Chuck for his dedicated service to the Senate and wish him well in his future endeavors.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, today is the 134th birthday of the State which I have been so pleased and so proud and so privileged and so honored to represent in Congress since January 1953. Born of the turmoil of the Civil War, West Virginia has never had an easy time of it. Although blessed with great beauty and rich in natural resources, my State's rugged terrain and isolated geography have worked to make her people a breed apart. 
Their independent views--they are a mountain people; mountain people traditionally have independent views, whether they live in Switzerland or Afghanistan or in Scotland or in West Virginia--their independent views, their impoverishment, their fierce loyalty to their communities, to their State and to their country have made them fodder for bad jokes, degrading sitcoms and derogatory nicknames. 
Well, I am here to tell those who would perpetuate such hackneyed stereotypes that it is they--it is they--who are backward, because in West Virginia's hollows and on her mountains live some of the finest people in all of God's great creation. 
For the most part, West Virginians are religious. They don't have, as some would like to portray, rattlesnakes in their church services. They are traditional in their outlook, they are reverent about their tried-and-true customs and patriotic about their Nation. 
In World War II, West Virginia ranked fifth among the States in the percentage of its eligible male population participating; first among the States in eligible male population participating in the Korean war; second among the States in the percentage of its eligible male population participating in the Vietnam war. Also, West Virginia ranked first among the States in the percentage of deaths its eligible male population suffered during both the Korean and Vietnam wars. 
West Virginians are generally quiet. They are not loud talkers. I don't like loud talkers. They are not loud talkers. You would not hear them from one end of the Capitol to the other talking with loud voices in the corridors. They don't do that. They are generally quiet, courteous, sincere, and accommodating. 
There is a presence of basic values among her residents that is scarce in much of the Nation in many places. West Virginians value hard work. They are not afraid of it. They love their families. They have a respect for authority. We don't burn flags in Weirton, WV, where there are at least 30 ethnic groups from the old world. They have respect for their communities and a love for their country and reverence for a Creator. 
They don't go around wearing their religion on their sleeves. They don't make a big whoop-de-doo of it, and, as far as I am concerned, most are not the religious right or the religious left. They are simply respectful of a Creator and quietly religious. 
More and more people are discovering our State. The crime is low in West Virginia, life is slower there and stress seems to float away, to be replaced by the serenity of beauty, charm and uncomplicated courtesy. Our unique mountain crafts attract attention nationwide, as do our scenic parks and our recreational activities. 
West Virginia really is a world apart. My State has come a long way from the days when she was plundered by industrial barons who lived outside her borders, plundered for her rich natural resources, and many of her citizens were used as little more than indentured servants in those days in the dangerous dirty work of mining coal, for example. Today, she is experiencing new economic growth and prosperity as a result of new roads. 
When I was a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, the lower house of the West Virginia Legislature in 1947, West Virginia had 4 miles--West Virginia had 4 miles--of divided four-lane highways--4 miles. That was when I was starting out in politics, now 51 years ago. Four miles, and then one need not wonder why West Virginians become indignant when a few dollars are appropriated by the Federal Government to build safe, modern four-lane divided highways in West Virginia; a few dollars compared with the billions of dollars that go for airports, go for mass transit and other modes of transportation elsewhere. 
So she is experiencing new economic growth. Travel our highways now, view the scenery now, experience the hospitality now, see the historic places, stand on the tops of those mountains and view the creative works of an omnipotent God. Look at her sunrises, pause at her tranquil sunsets and view the land where the early pioneers crossed the Alleghenies with a Bible in one hand and a rifle in the other, carrying a bag of seeds. 
They used the forests, dredged the rivers, and built a great State--a great State--a State that was born during the struggle between the States, the war between the States, the war among the States. 
So she is experiencing new economic growth and prosperity as a result of new roads, technology, and forward-looking leadership. In fact, West Virginia boasts four cities in the top 200 of Money magazine's 1997 list of the best places in America to live. And there are many more than four cities there and towns and rural communities that I would categorize as the best places in America to live. 
So today I say to all of those who have never tasted our glorious country cooking or danced at our traditional mountain festivals to tunes that are played by mountain musicians, never skied our shimmering slopes or paddled our wild white water, never heard the rich notes of our mountain music or gazed at our phenomenal sunsets, come to West Virginia. We will show you the way. 
Happy birthday. Happy birthday, West Virginia. May you grow, and may your people never, never change. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one year ago tomorrow, on June 21, 1996, in a hastily called press conference, the Department of Defense revealed that United States troops may have been exposed to Iraqi chemical nerve and mustard agents as a result of the post-war demolition of an Iraqi ammunition storage depot at Kamisiyah, Iraq. By September 1996, the DOD estimate of the number of soldiers who may have been exposed had climbed to just over 20,000, and the DOD announced that studies were still under way that could push that number even higher. This announcement raised new fears that Iraqi chemical warfare agents may have played a role in causing the illness among United States and coalition veterans of the Persian gulf war that has come to be called gulf war syndrome, and it exposed flaws in the manner in which the Department of Defense tracked the locations and medical histories of units and individual troops. The Department of Defense and the Presidential Advisory Committee on gulf war illnesses have subsequently attempted to address this and many other possible causes of gulf war syndrome, as have a number of congressional committees. There is still considerable uncertainty and controversy surrounding this issue. 
As a result of that announcement, I offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1997 Department of Defense authorization bill to provide $10 million for independent scientific research into the possible relationship between chemical agent exposure, particularly to low levels of chemical agent exposure, and gulf war syndrome. My amendment was adopted without debate by the Senate and supported through the conference with the House, and I thank my colleagues for sharing in my concern that our veterans be provided with the independent medical research on this subject that had not previously existed. I am eager, as I know our sick veterans and their families are also, to learn the results of these studies. 
But, Mr. President, although efforts to improve medical records management techniques in order to better understand and treat future post-war illnesses among United States troops--efforts already undertaken by the Department of Defense--are a step in the right direction, I believe that the most effective course of action is to prevent the exposures from occurring. We must not settle for just closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. We must find out why the door failed to contain the horse, and fix it. In that regard, the effectiveness of current doctrine and technology is questionable. It is not certain that our chemical detectors will provide a sufficient warning for low levels of chemical agent, and it is not certain that our military doctrine and procedures are adequate to fully protect our troops in a scenario that is not immediately life-threatening. Nor is it certain that the military anticipates the synergistic effects of different factors, such as the administration of vaccines and anti-chemical warfare agent drugs, in combination with the use of pesticides or exposure to other battlefield effluents, including chemical and biological agents. 
I am concerned that United States military doctrine has not changed to reflect these lessons learned from the gulf war experience and its aftermath. My concern is, I know, shared by many of my colleagues, who over the years have pursued these issues in hearings. Indeed, even the Special Assistant for gulf war illnesses at the Department of Defense has admitted in testimony before Congress that `We [DOD] need to learn from our Gulf experience and make the necessary changes in policies, doctrine, and technology.' 
I am pleased, therefore, that two of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin and Senator Glenn, have joined me in requesting that the General Accounting Office [GAO] initiate an evaluation of this very issue. Both of these very able Senators have, over the last several years, questioned the ability of our military to fight and win on a chemical battlefield. We have asked the GAO to address the adequacy of current policies, procedures, and technologies to first adequately defend United States military forces against single, repeated, or sustained exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agent, and to second identify, prepare for, and defend against the possible adverse effects of chemical warfare agent exposure in combination with other compounds commonly found in the battlefield, including pesticides, oil and diesel exhaust, biological warfare agents, low level radiation, medically administered vaccines, and other occupational hazards. 
It is my hope that this study will lay the foundation upon which we might make effective and targeted adjustments in next year's Department of Defense authorization bill that will give our soldiers the ability and confidence to fight and win on a chemically contaminated battlefield.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Republic of Egypt has been an outstanding leader in the Arab world in bringing an historic reconciliation between the state of Israel and its neighbors, including the Palestinians. Egyptian leaders, including President Sadat as well as the present leader, President Mubarak, have dedicated substantial energy toward such a reconciliation. There has been constant, difficult opposition to this process in the region. President Sadat's tireless and courageous dedication to peace in the Middle East cost him his life. He paid the supreme sacrifice at the hands of an assassin. And he left a lasting legacy in fashioning the Camp David Accords together with Prime Minister Begin of Israel, through the good offices of President Jimmy Carter. 
In the Middle East it has always taken three to tango. Advancing the process of making peace has required the dedication of the leaders of all three countries, Israel, Egypt and the United States. What is so dangerous about the current period is the apparent flagging of this dedication on the part of the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu, which has promoted the construction of new, and entirely unnecessary Jewish settlements in Arab portions of Jerusalem, a development sure to engender violence and the disruption of the peace process. Indeed, as I have said before on this floor, it was just when there appeared to be hopeful momentum toward resolving the outstanding issues between Israel and her neighbors that the right wing in Israeli politics initiated settlement construction activities and pulled the rug out from under this momentum. Unfortunately, attempts by President Clinton to revive this process were less than successful, in part, because of deep inconsistencies in the approach of the United States which appeared only half-heartedly--only halfheartedly--to protest the settlement construction activity on the part of the Netanyahu government. Unfortunately, the United States vetoed United Nations Security Council Resolutions protesting the settlement construction, which has, in effect, taken the United States out of the strong intermediary role that it needs to play for lasting progress to be made. 
It was precisely at this point--with the Israeli right acting to put the brakes on the peace process, and only a perfunctory attempt, only a half-hearted attempt by the United States Administration to revive the peace process--that Egypt has stepped in again to use its influence to infuse new energy into the complicated dance steps of the Middle East peace process. President Mubarak arranged for meetings last month at Sharm el-Shiek between Palestinian and Israeli leaders and has shown himself to be in the Egyptian tradition in exercising courage and creativity to bring the parties together again. Indeed, President Mubarak has assigned a key aide to act as a troubleshooter and intermediary between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has sponsored an ongoing dialogue which has been praised by U.S. and Israeli officials alike. This Egyptian initiative, in fact, appears to be the only game in town at this time. 
So I think it is very unfortunate that just at the time when Egypt is playing this central and responsible role, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee has chosen to take the extraordinarily unfair and puzzling step of removing the earmark of funds in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for Egypt, while at the same time preserving the earmark for Israel. As my colleagues are aware, those earmarks have been the practice ever since the Camp David Accords, the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, were signed in 1979. 
I was at the signing, and I had had the pleasure and the privilege of talking with President Sadat, the President of Egypt, in 1978, in Egypt. A courageous man, President Sadat, was leader in breaking the ice, and thus giving peace a chance, a chance in the Middle East. 
So, the subcommittee action, now, sends precisely the wrong signal to the Egyptians, whose assassinated leader was the pioneer in this peace process, who gave his life that there might be peace in the Middle East. 
Egypt should be commended for its diplomatic actions vis-a-vis the Palestinians and Israelis, not seemingly punished for her courage. Is Israel to be symbolically rewarded for the unnecessary and provocative action it has taken in building entirely unnecessary housing settlements in sensitive Arab lands? To add insult to this injury, the subcommittee has also taken the controversial step of approving $250 million for Jordan out of what is understood to be Egypt's account in the bill. While I certainly do not take issue with rewarding Jordan and King Hussein for signing the 1994 peace treaty with Israel and for helping on the matter of Israeli partial withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron earlier this year, it is far preferable and much more fair that the money for Jordan come equally from both Egypt's and Israeli's earmarks. 
Madam President, I do not agree with the concept of earmarks of the very large magnitude that we have been making for both Israel and Egypt. 
In my view, too much money goes to both nations--too much money. For years, this has been considered as something that was due them. 
I think such a foreign entitlement program should eventually be phased out and eliminated. But if we are going to give such earmarks as a tool of American diplomacy and foreign policy, at the very least they must fairly reflect this Nation's goals. 
These earmarks have been looked upon virtually as entitlements by both nations, Egypt and Israel. And while we in this Chamber struggle annually over the budget deficits in attempts to get them under control, while we cut discretionary spending for America, for the American people, while both the administration and the Republican regime on Capitol Hill continue to reduce discretionary spending, discretionary caps, and to ratchet down the spending for programs and projects beneficial to the American people, the taxpayers of this country, and help to build infrastructure in this country, all kinds of questions are asked and the game of one-upmanship is played as to who can cut the most. 
I am an admirer and supporter of Israel. But are there any questions asked when it comes to funding programs in Israel? Are there any questions asked when it comes to this being looked upon as an entitlement figure for Israel and Egypt? No questions asked. 
Are the American taxpayers fully aware that Congress and the Administration, every year, without any questions asked--no questions asked--provide $3 billion to Israel and $2 billion to Egypt, no questions asked, while we cut funding for water projects, sewage projects, highways, harbors, bridges, education, health, law enforcement, and Indian programs? We cut those programs. But no questions are asked when it comes to this entitlement of $3 billion annually for Israel and $2 billion annually for Egypt. 
I am against those earmarks, but if we are going to have them, at least they must fairly reflect the Nation's goals. 
What has been done as of yesterday on this matter by the subcommittee is flagrantly unfair and does a disservice to Egypt, to the United States, as well, and to our national interests in the basic process of making peace in the Middle East. I strongly oppose this action, and I hope that it can be corrected when the bill gets to the full Appropriations Committee next week, and if it isn't corrected there, then the attempt will be made at least to correct it on this floor. The action has not gone unnoticed. 
The Ambassador from Egypt and I have discussed this matter. He came to my office a couple of days ago, and then we have been in discussions since on the telephone. I received a thoughtful letter from him which I may wish to share with my colleagues. The Ambassador is disappointed and perplexed by the subcommittee action, as am I, and as true friends should be, true friends of Israel and Egypt should be. I hope it can be corrected before even more damage is done.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. 
Mr. President, on June 12, Senator Hagel and I and other Senators introduced Senate Resolution 98, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the conditions of the United States becoming a signatory to any international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions under the U.N. convention. On that same day, in addition to Senator Hagel and myself, 44 Senators cosponsored that resolution, making the total 46. 
Since that time, 14 additional Senators have indicated an interest in being cosponsors. So I will read their names shortly. But in addition to requesting a star print of Senate Resolution 98, I indicate for the Record a substantive change in the resolution. It is required that there be a substantive change in order for there to be a star print. I want a star print to show the additional 14 Senators' names. The additional names are: Senator Akaka, Senator Coats, Senator Cochran, Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, Senator Grams, Senator Lott, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Robb, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Sessions, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, Senator Specter, and Senator Stevens. 
Now, Mr. President, the substantive change would be in the form of an additional `whereas' clause. I will read it: 
Whereas, it is desirable that a bipartisan group of Senators be appointed by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate for the purpose of monitoring the status of negotiations on global climate change and reporting periodically to the Senate on those negotiations: Now, therefore, be it'. 
That is the new `whereas' clause, and those are the words that would constitute the substantive change. 
Therefore, I will ask unanimous consent that there be a star print of Senate Resolution 98 which will indicate the additional 14 Senators' names and the additional whereas clause. 
May I say, parenthetically, that I think it would be good for the administration to know that there is an independent group of Senators who have status, who have been authorized by the U.S. Senate to monitor the developments and negotiations on global climate change, and who will be authorized to report periodically back to the Senate concerning those developments. That is the purpose of the additional clause, and I, therefore, make that request.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Chair will momentarily indulge me, may I say that the Presiding Officer of the Senate, Mr. Hagel, will be conducting the hearings on tomorrow by this subcommittee which he chairs, the subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee on this very subject. 
I urge Senators to follow the conduct of these hearings. It is my understanding, in talking with Senator Hagel that there will be subsequent hearings tomorrow. These will be important hearings, and there will be witnesses appearing who will have testimony that I think will be worthwhile to the Senate as it proceeds on the course of following the negotiations, having a voice in them, and, as it were, leaning over the shoulders of the administration as the negotiations take place.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in 1964, a tall, bright-eyed, 27-year-old Harvard graduate arrived in West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer, eager to take on the ills of poverty, eager to change the world, starting with the small, rural town of Emmons, WV. 
But things did not quite turn out for the young man exactly the way that he expected them to. As John D. `Jay' Rockefeller, IV, quickly discovered, just as untold others have, there is something about West Virginia that gets into the blood and stirs the utmost depths of the soul. One West Virginia newspaper in February of last year quoted him speaking about those early days in Emmons. In that speech Jay Rockefeller reflected `In the end, I was the one who was transformed by the experience--completely transformed.' Subsequently, Rockefeller decided to move to West Virginia to live, rear a family, and build an impressive career of public service that continues to benefit West Virginians today. 
Mr. President, today marks the 60th birthday of my colleague, Senator Jay Rockefeller, and I take this opportunity to recognize this milestone for my friend and ally, an outstanding Senator, and a distinguished West Virginian. 
You can, perhaps, imagine the eyebrows that were raised initially by West Virginians, or some of them, when the young, energetic, wealthy Rockefeller moved from New York to the foothills of their State. 
He took a lot of ribbing early on--and I can tell you that it was not all good natured. Many did not see the match as one of perfect bliss. At best it might have been described as the near equivalent of a James Carville-Mary Matalin union. But Jay Rockefeller endured with determination. 
After serving a 2-year term in the West Virginia House of Delegates, Rockefeller served 4 years as Secretary of State. Then, after a 3-year sabbatical from politics during which he served as the President of West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon, he ran for and won the West Virginia Governor's seat--not the kind of comfortable, overstuffed chair one might expect a Rockefeller to occupy in West Virginia. 
Some in West Virginia have said that the sure way to end a political career in our State is to become Governor. I have referred to it, from time to time, as a good jumping off place--not a place from which I would particularly like to jump. It may well be our State's most unforgiving job. But Jay Rockefeller weathered the rough shoals of gubernatorial service in West Virginia and, in 1984, went on to win a U.S. Senate seat. That says a lot about his resolve, his vision and his determination. 
Since his arrival in the Senate, I have watched Jay emerge as a strong leader focusing on the needs and concerns that affect West Virginia and the Nation. He looks beyond the borders of West Virginia. Through his work to improve the quality of life in West Virginia, Jay has also won over many of those who were at first skeptical at the idea of a Rockefeller moving into mountaineer country. 
Jay won his people over with hard work. He has focused his efforts on aiding veterans and championed health care issues. Like so many others who throughout the years have been cured by the healing waters of West Virginia's mountain springs, Jay Rockefeller has become an enthusiastic salesman for West Virginia, boasting of its admirable, unequaled attributes to any potential convert and even drawing them in from far-flung locations around the globe. The long arms of Jay Rockefeller have reached even across the Pacific to Japan to help draw business interests to the mountains and valleys of Appalachia. He can speak Japanese. He can write Japanese. He has studied the Japanese language. 
I am glad that Jay made that life-changing decision to go to Emmons three decades ago. Since that time he has made great strides toward improving the quality of life for my people in my State, which he has proudly made his adopted home, as I have adopted West Virginia, my home, having been born in North Carolina almost 80 years ago. Today, on his 60th birthday, Senator Rockefeller's efforts to encourage development and prosperity all across West Virginia are well known. I salute his efforts. And Erma and I wish Jay and his wife, Sharon, continued success and happiness for many years to come. 
A poet whose name I do not recall said it perhaps best, and I shall use the lines of that poet in saying happy birthday to Jay Rockefeller:  
Count your garden by the flowers, 
Never by the leaves that fall; 
Count your days by the sunny hours, 
Not remembering clouds at all. 
Count your nights by stars, not shadows, 
Count your life by smiles, not tears; 
And on this beautiful June morning, Jay, 
Count your age by friends, not years.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recently I spoke just before Mother's Day with reference to what that day meant to me and generally, I think, to most Americans. It is a day that originated in West Virginia. This coming Sunday, June 15, is Father's Day. While I am proud to note the many valuable contributions made by fathers in the raising of our precious future generations, these words are harder for me to speak, since that collective noun `fathers' also includes myself. Like, I suspect, most fathers whose jobs necessarily consume much of their time and attention, I carry with me both the realization, of which I regret, that I did not spend as much time with my daughters over the years as I would have wished, and the gratitude that my very capable wife was at home to shoulder so much of the effort in the rearing of our children. And she did a fine, fine job. 
Over the course of my life, the American family has changed a great deal. More and more fathers are assuming an ever greater role in the raising of their children, from the changing of diapers to attending parent-teacher conferences. `Soccer moms' now share the sidelines--and the car pooling--with `soccer dads.' Fathers, as well as working mothers, have learned the day care drop-off and pick-up routine. There are even growing numbers of single dads taking over the traditional role of mother in addition to their usual career track, and fathers who have opted to be stay-at-home or work-at-home dads in order to become more involved in their children's lives. 
When I was a child, children were `seen but not heard' by their fathers, and no man was considered capable--or interested--in the details of raising a young child. Indeed, few men would have had any idea of how to go about caring for an infant, I suppose. And that is why I was reared by my aunt and uncle after my own dear mother died in my first year of life. I can understand and even empathize with my father, and I will always be grateful to my Aunt Vlurma and her husband, Titus Dalton Byrd, for the care and the love, the affection, the attention, and the advice that they gave to me. But, naturally, I will always wonder how my life might have been different had I remained within my own birth family. I remember nothing of my natural mother. I wish that I had more memories of time spent with my father and my siblings. I only can recall spending one week during my lifetime with my natural father. 
But I do well remember a kind and gentle foster father, my aunt's husband, who gave me my name and who encouraged me to study and to draw pictures and to play a musical instrument, who encouraged me to reach for the stars and to try to attain goals that were far beyond those which were the norm in our small mining community in southern West Virginia. 
Now, he did not want me to toil in the mines as he did. He encouraged me to read. He never bought me a cap buster or cowboy suit. He always bought a drawing tablet or a water color set or a violin or a mandolin or a guitar. He urged me to play music, urged me to develop my abilities. 
His education probably did not go beyond the second or third grade. He could manage poor handwriting. He could read. And he read the family Bible. When he left this world, he did not owe any man a penny. In all the years that I lived with him, I never heard him once use God's name in vain, I never heard him grumble at what was put on the table before him. And he and my Aunt Vlurma lived together 53 years. I do not recall ever having heard either of them raise a voice in anger against the other. 
He never forgot his little foster son. He always saved something from his lunch for me. He was a coal miner. And I can recall that late in the afternoon I would look up the railroad tracks and watch for him coming down the railroad tracks, carrying his dinner bucket. I would run to meet him. And when I came to him, he would set his dinner bucket down and take the lid off the dinner bucket and reach in and get an apple or a piece of cake. In those days, cakes could be bought for 5 cents at the store--cupcakes, as we called them, some were chocolate, some had coconut icing, and so on. But whatever the cake, he always managed to save it for me. He never failed. 
I remember his strong weathered face, his long sturdy hands and his kind, thoughtful eyes as clearly as if he had only this morning patted me on the head and gone off for another backbreaking day in the mines. 
He represented strength and security and ageless wisdom to me--it was a time when things were certain and clear and uncomplicated because he was there to make everything right. 
As in my own experience, a father's presence looms large in a child's life. A father who sits down to help with homework reinforces the importance of schoolwork. And when a father takes his children to worship services, or better yet, leads them in their bedtime prayers, he instills in them the importance of devotion and respect for the Creator's role in our daily lives. 
I am glad that more fathers are taking an interest in their children, as a general matter, I think. It is not always the case, by any means. But they are taking an interest in their children beyond the financial aspect that was all-important during my early days as a father--when I was making $70 a month working as a produce boy, working as a meatcutter, $70 a month--although that is a role that cannot be abdicated. Children are a joy and a delight, but they are also a very serious lifetime responsibility, both financially and morally. Children are not like a job--they cannot be fired, one cannot quit or resign from the responsibility of being a father, and even declaring moral and financial bankruptcy does not relieve one of the responsibility for the welfare of the children. 
So on this Father's Day, as we all remember or honor our fathers--and the scriptures tell us to `honor thy father and thy mother;' most of us were taught at home, to `honor thy father and thy mother'--on this Father's Day, as we all remember or honor our fathers may we also contemplate the great joy that is fueled by a special dad. The material things which daily drive and obsess so much of American life are only transient. When all is said and done they do not amount to much. So many things that occupy our thoughts and our concerns, most of the things we worry about, of course, never happen, but these things that we generally worry about and that loom so large in our daily lives really, really, are not all that large. Among the things that best endure are the love, the values passed on, and the small shared moments recalled with a caring, loving father. 
May I say that the man who took on the responsibility of rearing me from the tender age of less than 1 year, I have no doubt that, in Paradise, he is aware of what I am saying today, and I have no doubt that one day, according to the scriptures' promise, I can meet him again. Jesus was mindful of the Heavenly Father when he taught us to pray, saying, first of all, `Our Father who art in heaven.' 
So let me for a moment, in closing, attempt to recite some lines that were written by someone whose name does not occur to me at the moment, but I think this little bit of verse quite appropriately speaks the thoughts of most Americans, as we look forward to Father's Day. I hope we will take a little time on that day to contemplate the sacrifices of our fathers and to consider the fact that they had concerns about us and loved us.  
That Dad of Mine 
He's slowing down, as some folks say, 
With the burden of years from day to day; 
His brow bears many a furrowed line; 
He's growing old--that dad of mine. 
His shoulders droop, and his step is slow; 
And his hair is white, as white as snow; 
But his kind eyes sparkle with a friendly light; 
His smile is warm, and his heart is right. 
He's old? Oh, yes. But only in years, 
For his spirit soars as the sunset nears. 
And blest I've been, and wealth I've had, 
In knowing a man like my old dad. 
And proud I am to stand by him, 
As he stood by me when the way was dim; 
I've found him worthy and just as fine, 
A prince of men--that dad of mine. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my attention has just been called to the fact that this is the last day in which we will all be blessed by the services rendered to all Senators on both sides of the aisle by these wonderful young people who sit on the dais, to our right and to our left, who are the pages. Daniel Webster appointed the first page. Tomorrow, these pages will graduate. They go to school while they do this work here for us and for our country. They work for our country, just as we Senators seek to do our best in serving our country. Without these pages, we would find our work to be more difficult, and we can't thank them enough. 
They get up early and they go to school. They have to continue to maintain good grades while they are doing the Senate's work. And this is demanding work. They run here, they run there. They are at the beck and call of every Senator all day long. 
Tennyson said, `I am a part of all that I have met.' I hope these young pages, when they go back to their homes and to their communities throughout the country, will take with them, as I know they will, a part of us, as we will keep with us a part of them. 
I take occasion to talk with these young people every now and then. I have told them some stories over the days and weeks. I have told them the story of `The House with the Golden Windows.' I have told them Tolstoy's story, `How Much Land Does a Man Need?' And then I related to them a story that was told by Russell Conwell, one of the early Chautauqua speakers, which he had related 5,000 times--the story titled `Acres of Diamonds.' And, of course, there have been other stories. But I have found the pages to be so eager--eager to learn, eager to serve. 
I think we can all be proud of our young people. We hear sometimes about the bad apples, and there are a few bad apples around. The problem is, they crowd out our view of the good apples. Most of our young people are wholesome, fine young people. They are working in the school rooms, the libraries, the laboratories, and seeking to develop their minds. Perhaps we don't hear as much of them. But they are the future citizens of this country, the great resource of the country. And one day, they will be the chemists, the architects, the teachers, the ministers, the lawyers, the Senators. I know, I have seen that gleam in their eyes. Some of them are thinking about coming back here already--as Senators. 
I hope that we Senators have conducted ourselves in a way that will make the pages feel proud of us--proud that you have had the honor and the good fortune to serve here, because it is an honor and you have been fortunate. There are millions of young people throughout this country who would love to serve as pages in the Senate. So I hope that we have, in some way, inspired you to serve and to want to learn. I hope that you will continue to learn. Always seek to excel, to be the best at whatever you are doing. There is always a place for you at the top. 
Unfortunately, not too many people want to start at the bottom anymore. But you should be willing to start at the bottom and seek to excel and to learn. In due time, you will be rewarded. Solon said, `I grow old in the pursuit of learning.' So continue to learn all of your lives. 
We praise the great athletes, but no ballgame ever changed the course of history. Study math, science, chemistry, physics, read well; and in due time, you will contribute to your community and to your country.  
A careful man I want to be, a little fellow follows me. 
I do not dare to go astray, for fear he will go the self same way. 
He thinks that I am good and fine, believes in every word of mine. 
The base in me he must not see, that little chap that follows me. 
I must remember as I go, through summer's sun and winter's snow, 
I am building for the years to be, that little chap that follows me. 
That is the way we feel about you. Most of us, certainly, have children and grandchildren, and you are somebody's children and somebody's grandchildren, and we know that they are proud of you. 
I took a piece of plastic clay, 
And idly fashioned it one day. 
And as my fingers pressed it still, 
It moved and yielded to my will. 
I came again when days were past, 
The bit of clay was hard at last. 
The form I gave it, it still bore, 
And I could change that form no more. 
I took a piece of living clay, 
And gently formed it day by day. 
And molded with my power and art, 
A young child's soft and yielding heart. 
I came again when years were gone, 
He was a man I looked upon. 
He still that early impress wore, 
And I could change him nevermore. 
As I look back across the 80 years of my life, I have lived a full life, and it seems that it was only a little while ago when I was young, like the boys and girls who are our pages. Even then, I wanted to learn all that I could cram into my head, and I wanted to make something of myself, and to be somebody when I grew up to be a man. I, too, like you, had dreams of all the future years, of what I would do in the days to come. 
Ah, how great it is to believe the dream, 
As we stand in youth by the starlit stream, 
But greater still to live life through, 
And find at the end that the dream is true. 
One thing, finally, I want to leave with you. Always take God with you. I have lived beyond the psalmist's promise. 
The days of our years are threescore years and ten. and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength, labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 
I have lived almost 80 years and I have seen times when I have felt God was near me and listening to me, and you will see those times, too. There will be times in your lives when you will be walking in deep valleys, and you may walk in crowds, but there will be someone closer than the crowd to you. There may be no one else around you, but there is someone with whom you can communicate, someone who will share your grief, and someone who will give you strength, someone who will help lift you up from under great burdens, and that someone is the Heavenly Father. 
No man is good. We all fall short of the glory of God. But there is a God up there. 
Look at the stars tonight, if the skies are clear, and see God's wonderful handiwork. And remember that some of those stars are so far away that the light from them has been traveling millions of light-years--millions of light-years, that some of those stars are so large that they would not be able to pass between the Sun and the Earth. The Sun is 93 million miles away. Yet there are stars so huge that they could not pass between the Earth and the Sun. 
Napoleon, as he sat listening to the discussions about material things on the deck of a ship one night, pointed upward and said, `Say what you wish. Who made all of that?' 
So you will come across doubters and skeptics and cynics. But you can trust in God. Remember, there are great physicists, great scientists, men and women who have earned degrees from the higher institutions of learning, but they know that there is a hand greater than the hand of man that has created the Earth and the universe--the universes. Keep your faith in Him. 
These are the little random thoughts that I have, as we say goodbye to you tomorrow. We will always wish for you these things: work for your hands, a straight path for your feet, sunshine on your windowpane in the morning, a song in your treetop at evening, soft rains for your garden, happiness in your hearts, love at your firesides, and God's blessings always. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Stevens, in urging the Senate to adopt the disaster assistance supplemental appropriation bill upon its receipt from the House. The funding levels contained in that bill are the same as those adopted by the Senate in the conference report on H.R. 1469 on June 5 by a vote of 67 to 31. That conference agreement, however, also contained a number of extraneous provisions to which the President objected and which he advised would cause a veto. Upon receipt of the conference agreement to H.R. 1469, the President did, in fact, veto the measure. Subsequently, continuous efforts have been ongoing to resolve the differences on those extraneous provisions in a way that will allow the disaster assistance funding contained in this supplemental to reach the hundreds of thousands of victims of the recent disasters that have beset the Nation over past months. 
In all, 33 States will be eligible for the disaster assistance funds provided in the bill. As explained in more detail by the chairman, title I of the bill contains appropriations totaling $1.8 billion in support of our men and women in uniform engaged in peacekeeping operations around the world, particularly in Bosnia. Title II of the bill contains disaster assistance appropriations for a number of departments and agencies throughout the Federal Government with jurisdiction over the emergency relief efforts. Those appropriations total some $5.5 billion. The bill also contains an appropriation of over $937 million for veterans compensation and pensions. 
In all, the bill totals some $8.6 billion, the budget authority of which is fully offset by the rescissions of appropriations which are also contained in the bill. 
Regarding the extraneous matters which caused the Presidential veto, it is my understanding that they have all been resolved to the satisfaction of the administration and in a way which will allow the President to sign this bill. While I regret that the enactment of this disaster assistance appropriation bill has required many weeks and a Presidential veto in order to achieve its ultimate enactment, I recognize that the proponents of the extraneous provisions that caused the delay feel very strongly about the merits of their provisions, and I appreciate their willingness to allow the removal or modification of them in a way that will allow this bill to go forward so that its benefits can then be forthcoming to the American people for whom they are intended. 
In closing, Mr. President, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I congratulate the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Livingston, and my House counterpart, Mr. Obey, for their efforts in reaching this agreement, as well as the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens. In addition, I also thank our distinguished minority leader, Mr. Daschle, who has worked tirelessly day and night in resolving these issues. The majority leader, Mr. Lott, is also to be commended for his efforts on this bill. 
How much time do I have, Mr. President?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and joining me in the introduction of this resolution are the following Senators: Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Craig, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Warner, Mr. Ford, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Helms, Mr. Levin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Abraham, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Burns. As I say, Mr. President, I urge other Senators and their staffs to take note of this resolution and to consider joining as cosponsors within the next day or so because we welcome the support of Democrats and Republicans. 
This resolution addresses some central issues regarding the conditions for U.S. agreement to revisions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In particular, it addresses the clear need for the participation of developing nations in the ongoing negotiations to undertake such revisions to the global climate change convention, first signed in Rio in 1992, at the so-called Earth Summit. 
As my colleagues know, President Bush signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, which was subsequently approved by the Senate and ratified. The treaty calls on all signatories to adopt policies and programs to limit their greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions on a voluntary basis. The goal was to exhort industrialized nations to attempt to scale back their emissions to 1990 levels by the end of the present decade, a goal that has not been achieved by the U.S. nor by the vast majority of the developed nations. Those nations that have met the voluntary goals are those like Russia, whose economy has been in a free fall, its industries idle and its people hurting. This is not the way that anyone wants to meet an emissions reduction target. 
This is an important negotiation attempting to address the fundamental issues of man-created climate changes and how to limit the adverse consequences that have been projected by recent scientific analysis. The perceived culprits in the warming of the globe--emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, including, particularly, carbon dioxide--are caused partly by fossil fuel combustion. Limiting and reducing such combustion and its resultant carbon dioxide are a principal objective of the treaty. It is an effort which has been led by Vice President Al Gore and he is to be highly commended for his sustained effort and achievement in moving this multinational negotiation along. The schedule for the negotiations to revise the Rio Pact is to culminate in meetings in Kyoto, Japan early this December. 
The administration, as a result of the disappointing results of the voluntary goals contained in the 1992 agreement, has moved toward supporting mandatory, legally-binding, limitations on emissions to address the long-term effects of the greenhouse gases on the global climate. Worrisome as the prospects of adverse climate change are for all of us, I believe it is unfortunate that the developing world has not seen fit to step up to the plate and assume its clear responsibility to share in the effort being proposed by the United States to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is most troublesome because without the participation of the developing world, the goals of the treaty will be largely frustrated, since the amount of carbon dioxide which will be produced by the developing world will exceed--get that--exceed in total, that produced by the industrial OECD nations very soon--by the year 2015. That is not very far away. Indeed, the amount of carbon emissions produced by China alone in that year will exceed the amount produced by the United States. 
So we are talking about the country with the greatest population in the world, China. India is another, and India probably has 800 million people, perhaps more. But I should emphasize that China alone, in the year 2015, which is only 18 years away, will exceed the United States in its production of carbon dioxide. China is rapidly accelerating her demand for electricity, soon to exceed that of the United States, but China has resisted all efforts to include her as a responsible party in the renegotiation of the Rio Pact. 
Mr. President, the big carbon dioxide emitters of the developing world--including, as I have just indicated, in addition to China, the countries of India, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, and Indonesia--cannot expect to continue or expand their extremely inefficient methods for fossil fuel combustion, producing huge, growing quantities of carbon dioxide, and at the same time insist that only the developed nations, the so-called Annex I nations under the Treaty, agree to legally-binding targets and schedules for limiting these gases. This is particularly troublesome, I believe, because, first, without the participation of the developing nations the process of climate change will continue without much human control. Second, there are certainly technological ways that fossil fuel combustion techniques can be made far more efficient than at present in these nations, so that the extent of economic sacrifice that may be required to limit greenhouse gas emissions may not be onerous if all nations will pull together. Third, under the Treaty, industrial facilities in the Annex I countries will be tempted to move behind the borders of developing countries in order to escape legally-binding controls on their greenhouse gas emissions because that means that if the developing countries are not also on the hook with the Annex 1 countries like the United States, industries will be tempted to go overseas and to send their factories overseas to those so-called developing nations that are not required, if they are not required, to commit themselves to abide by the standards that are to be negotiated by our Government. It would be cheaper, then, for U.S. industries to go overseas. That means our jobs will go overseas. We have seen too much of that already in West Virginia. 
This would also frustrate the goals of the Treaty, and cause economic distress, as I have indicated, in the Annex I countries. The developing world should be encouraged to expand its industries in an environmentally responsible manner, knowing that it, too, must prepare to meet limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and not sink to the temptation for quick and dirty development by harboring industrial fugitives from the developed world's mandatory emissions controls. 
Therefore, Mr. President, the resolution I am introducing today on behalf of myself and Senator Hagel and the other Senators whose names I have stated, resolves that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to the Rio Pact or to any other agreement which would `mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing Countries within the same compliance period.' In other words, what is good for the developed goose should be good for the developing gander, in that both should be responsible for their actions if the effort to clean up the global barnyard is to be anything other than a halfway effort. And a halfway effort, in the final analysis, rerves nobody. 
In addition, Mr. President, it is not yet clear what regulatory and legislative initiatives may be required in the United States to implement the binding agreement now under negotiations. Therefore, the resolution would also require that any Treaty signed by the United States, when it is submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent, be accompanied by a `detailed explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may be required to implement the protocol or other agreement and should also be accompanied by an analysis of the detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of the United States which would be incurred by the implementation of the agreement.' I understand that the distinguished junior Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], Chairman of the relevant Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee will be holding hearings on this matter beginning on June 19, and I commend him for this initiative. 
This is a matter that will require substantial consensus building. That will take time. And I am delighted that Senator Hagel will begin those hearings in the very near future, June 19. I hope that consideration of the resolution that we are offering today will be seen as a contribution to that consensus building process. 
Now, there may have to be some adjustments made to the verbiage that we have chosen and I am sure that Senator Hagel and the other cosponsors and I will be willing to consider any proposed adjustments, be willing to sit down and talk about any changes that need to be made. And with the hearings that Senator Hagel plans to conduct, the opportunity will be offered to Senators to appear and make statements, expressing their support, raising questions, offering suggestions, as I say, or whatever. But the important thing is this. We must begin to engage in this consensus building.

Mr. BYRD. The Senator made a very important point in closing his speech. Here sit the representatives of the people in this body. Here sit the representatives of the States. It is the only forum in this country which represents the States. And so it is that it is important that this body have a voice, it is important that this body has a responsibility for oversight under the Constitution, has a responsibility to monitor the events and proceedings and developments. 
It is not my desire to kill the treaty. We are going to have to face up to this problem. It is going to impact on our grandchildren and their children and their children and their children. And so we have a responsibility to face up to it now. It is not a pleasant thing to consider, to contemplate. But that is the purpose of the resolution. That is the purpose of the hearings the distinguished Senator will conduct. We want to be in on the takeoff, not just on the landing. We have a responsibility to our people, we have a responsibility to this country and to its future. So that is why we have introduced the legislation today, and I compliment the distinguished Senator, and I look forward to working with him in this important, all important, matter. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution which I shall send to the desk may remain open for other signatories until the close of business today.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Sunday, June 1, 1997, edition of the Washington Post featured a front-page article on pollution in the Potomac River from poultry production. The story was prompted by a ranking by American Rivers, which is a national environmental organization, of the Potomac River on the group's annual list of the 10 Most Endangered Rivers in North America, and inspired by American Rivers' interpretation of a 1996 U.S. Department of Agriculture study that detected nutrient and bacterial contamination in the waters of the South Branch of the Potomac. 
American Rivers' annual promotion of its top 10 list is an effort to advance public awareness about the fragility of the Nation's water resources, a laudable goal, and newsworthy, as well. 
Regrettably, however, the media missed the real story of worth, namely, the exemplary efforts by a nonpartisan coalition of public officials and West Virginia family farmers to balance economic interests with environmental goals. And, more importantly, the media missed the spirit of cooperation needed to accomplish these goals through the voluntary implementation of farm management practices identified in USDA's 1996 study as improving the efficient use of farmland and reducing threats to the Potomac River. 
I might add that, contrary to the negative impression left by the Washington Post writer, the heart of this industry is situated in the charming town of Moorefield. This is an area which was settled in the early 1700's and contains a federally designated historic district. Moorefield's antebellum homesteads and streets are enriched by the presence of hard-working family farmers, who not only earn a real day's wage, but also represent the backbone of our Nation's economy and spirit of community. 
The poultry industry has dramatically expanded in the Potomac Headwaters, from production at approximately 46.6 million birds in 1992 to 90 million birds in 1996. Recognizing the potential growth of the industry, as early as 1990, a cooperative program between Federal and State agencies was launched to design and implement the best soil and water conservation management practices. Rapid growth of any industry usually is not achieved without problems. However, these problems have been identified and efforts are underway to ameliorate these consequences of expansion. 
To date, 80 percent of the eligible farmers in the Potomac Headwaters, which I understand is a higher than average percentage for similar USDA programs, have electively enrolled in the Potomac Headwaters Land Treatment Watershed Project, the recommended action plan to protect the Potomac from possible agricultural pollution. I am proud that I have been able to secure funds to support the Federal share of this project. 
By enrolling in this project, West Virginia farmers have voluntarily agreed to develop nutrient management plans and install animal waste structures and dead bird composters, and to improve livestock confinement areas and vegetative buffer zones. Implementing these measures will cost the average farmer in the program $12,000 over 5 years. The average farmer in the Potomac Headwaters has a net annual income of $15,000 from poultry production. 
I believe that most Americans would commend the farmer who voluntarily spends 16 percent of his income over 5 years to protect the waters of the Potomac River. Nevertheless, that is exactly what is happening in West Virginia. 
Thanks to the West Virginia farmer, the Potomac Headwaters Land Treatment Watershed Project will achieve benefits for a broad base of interests, extending from my beautiful state to the Chesapeake Bay. It would seem that this is the kind of effort that newspapers and organizations like American Rivers should be recognizing and encouraging. 
Mr. President, how many minutes do I have remaining?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the past decade, I have been continually puzzled by our Nation's failure to produce better students despite public concern and despite the billions of Federal dollars which annually are appropriated for various programs intended to aid and improve education. Not long ago, I asked a high ranking administration official during an Appropriations Committee hearing why, in his opinion, we were not doing a better job of educating our Nation's youth in light of the billions of dollars we have been spending over these past several years. The answer I got was not very illuminating. 
Mr. President, our children still rank behind those of many other nations of the world with which we will have to compete for the jobs of the future. Particularly in mathematics, where our kids will have to be especially skilled, the United States ranks 28th in average mathematics performance according to a study of 8th graders published in 1996. Japan ranked third. 
A closer look at the current approach to mathematics in our schools reveals something called the `new-new math.' Apparently the concept behind this new-new approach to mathematics is to get kids to enjoy mathematics and hope that that `enjoyment' will lead to a better understanding of basic math concepts. Nice thought, but nice thoughts do not always get the job done. 
Recently Marianne Jennings, a professor at Arizona State University found that her teenage daughter could not solve a mathematical equation. This was all the more puzzling because her daughter was getting an A in algebra. Curious about the disparity, Jennings took a look at her daughter's Algebra textbook, euphemistically titled, `Secondary Math: An Integrated Approach: Focus on Algebra.' Here it is--quite a handsome cover on the book. After reviewing it, Jennings dubbed it `Rain Forest Algebra.' 
I have recently obtained a copy of the same strange textbook--this is it, as I have already indicated--and I have to go a step further and call it whacko algebra. 
This textbook written by a conglomerate of authors lists 5 so-called `algebra authors,' but it boasts 20 `other series authors' and 4 `multicultural reviewers.' We are talking about algebra now. Why we need multicultural review of an algebra textbook is a question which I would like to hear someone answer, and the fact that there are 4 times as many `other series authors' as `algebra authors' in this book made me suspect that this really was not an algebra textbook at all. 
A quick look at the page entitled, `Getting Started' with the sub heading, `What Do You Think,' quickly confirmed my suspicions about the quirky fuzziness of this new-new approach to mathematics. 
Let me quote from that opening page. 
In the twenty-first century, computers will do a lot of the work that people used to do. Even in today's workplace, there is little need for someone to add up daily invoices or compute sales tax. Engineers and scientists already use computer programs to do calculations and solve equations. 
What kind of a message is sent by that brilliant opening salvo? 
It hardly impresses upon the student the importance of mastering the basics of mathematics or encourages them to dig in and prepare for the difficult work it takes to be a first-rate student in math. Rather it seems to say, `Don't worry about all of this math stuff too much. Computers will do all that work for us in a few years anyway.' Can you imagine such a goofy passage in a Japanese math textbook? I ask what happens if the computer breaks down or if we forget and leave the pocket calculator at home? It appears that we may be on the verge of producing a generation of students who cannot do a simple mathematical equation in their heads, or with a pencil, or even balance a checkbook. 
The `Getting Started' portion of the text goes on to extol the virtues of teamwork, to explain how to get to know other students and to ask how teamwork plays a role in conserving natural resources. What, I ask--what in heaven's name does this have to do with algebra? I took algebra instead of Latin when I was in high school. I never had this razzle-dazzle confusing stuff. 
Page 5 of this same wondrous tome begins with a heading written in Spanish, English, and Portuguese, a map of South America and an indication of which language is spoken where. Pythagorus would have been scratching his head by this time, and I confess, so was I. 
This odd amalgam of math, geography and language masquerading as an algebra textbook goes on to intersperse each chapter with helpful comments and photos of children named Taktuk, Esteban, and Minh. Although I don't know what happened to Dick and Jane, I do understand now why there are four multicultural reviewers for this book. However, I still don't quite grasp the necessity for political correctness in an algebra textbook. Nor do I understand the inclusion of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in three languages, a section on the language of Algebra which defines such mathematically significant phrases as, `the lion's share,' the `boondocks,' and `not worth his salt.' 
By the time we get around to defining an algebraic expression we are on page 107. But it isn't long before we are off that boring topic to an illuminating testimony by Dave Sanfilippo, a driver with the United Parcel Service. Sanfilippo tells us that he `didn't do well in high school mathematics * * *' but that he is doing well at his job now because he enters `* * * information on a pocket computer * * *'--hardly inspirational stuff for a kid struggling with algebra. 
From there we hurry on to lectures on endangered species, a discussion of air pollution, facts about the Dogon people of West 
Africa, chili recipes and a discussion of varieties of hot peppers--no wonder our pages are having difficulty containing themselves. They are almost in stitches--what role zoos should play in today's society, and the dubious art of making shape images of animals on a bedroom wall, only reaching a discussion of the Pythagorean Theorem on page 502. By this time I was thoroughly dazed and unsure of whether I was looking at a science book, a language book, a sociology book or a geography book. In fact, of course, that is the crux of the problem. I was looking at all of the above. 
This textbook tries to be all things to all students in all subjects and the result is a mush of multiculturalism, environmental and political correctness, and various disjointed discussions on a multitude of topics which certainly is bound to confuse the students trying to learn and the teachers trying to teach from such unfocused nonsense. It is not just nonsense, it is unfocused nonsense, which is even worse. 
Mathematics is about rules, memorized procedures and methodical thinking. We do memorize the multiplication tables, don't we? Else how will one know that nine 8s are 72 and that eight 9s are 72. This new-new mush-mush math will never produce quality engineers or mathematicians who can compete for jobs in the global market place. In Palo Alto, CA, public school math students plummeted from the 86th percentile to the 56th in the first year of new-new math teaching. This awful textbook obviously fails to do in 812 pages what comparable Japanese textbooks do so well in 200. The average standardized math score in Japan is 80. In the United States it is 52. 
When my staff contacted Marianne Jennings to obtain a copy of this textbook, I did learn one good thing about it. She told my staff that because of public outcry the public schools in her area have discontinued its use and have gone back to traditional math textbooks. Another useful purpose has been served by my personal perusal of this textbook. I now have a partial answer to my question about why we don't produce better students despite all the money that Federal taxpayers shell out. 
The lesson here is for parents to follow Marianne Jennings' lead and take a close look at their children's textbooks to be sure that the new-new math and other similar nonsense has not crept into the local school system. 
All the Federal dollars we can channel for education cannot counteract the disastrous effect of textbooks like this one. They will produce dumb-dumb students and parents need to get heavily involved to reverse that trend now!

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. All right. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I may consume from the time under my control. 
Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to support the conference agreement on the emergency disaster assistance appropriations bill, H.R. 1469, now before the Senate. I am unable to do so despite my total support for the more than $5 billion in disaster assistance payments which are included in this measure for the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who are the victims of the many natural disasters that have occurred in recent months. 
I also support the nearly $2 billion contained in the measure for aid to our men and women in uniform around the world, particularly in Bosnia, engaged in peacekeeping operations, as well as the nearly $1 billion contained in the measure for payment of veterans' compensation and pensions. 
These funds are all vitally needed for the purposes for which they are appropriated and should be made available at the earliest possible time. Indeed, it is my view Congress should not have recessed for the recent Memorial Day break without having enacted into law these funds that are contained in this bill. 
Unfortunately, as did the bill when reported out of the Senate Appropriations Committee and after Senate action, this conference agreement contains a number of controversial, extraneous legislative provisions which have no business being included in an emergency disaster assistance bill. The President has never wavered in his statement that he will veto the measure despite the critical nature of funding it contains for hundreds of thousands of people. He has urged Congress to remove the extraneous provisions and send him a clean disaster assistance bill which he can sign. Regrettably, the leadership in Congress has chosen to use this bill as a vehicle for making political points on such things as keeping the Government operating on automatic pilot for the entirety of fiscal year 1998 at 1997 levels regardless of merit and ignoring the fact that a number of activities throughout the Federal Government should not continue and should be cut or eliminated altogether. 
This so-called automatic CR and other extraneous provisions need not be on this bill. They can be raised at any time and debated in their own right as freestanding measures. They can be raised by the leadership at any time. What other reason can there be then to insist on including them in this disaster assistance measure than to make purely political points? 
I am disturbed by this decision to proceed in this fashion. I note that no Democratic Member of the conference on H.R. 1469, no Democratic Member signed the conference report. 
In not signing a conference report, I find no fault with and intend no disrespect toward the chairmen of the conference. I congratulate Chairman Livingston on conducting a very fair and evenhanded conference. I congratulate our own chairman of the conference, chairman of the Senate conferees, Senator Stevens, who also, likewise, is very aware of and always considerate of the needs of the constituencies of the Members of this body. I have always found him, over the long years of friendship that I have enjoyed with him, to be most considerate, charitable and fair. In the conduct of this conference, these two chairmen were courteous to all members and showed great patience and eminent skill in completing the conference as expeditiously as possible. Unfortunately, they had no ability to remove these controversial matters that have caused me to oppose the measure and have caused me not to sign the conference report, and I speak for others on my side of the aisle who, likewise, did not sign this conference report. Only the leadership of the two Houses could have accomplished that result. 
To those Senators who have chosen to delay the enactment of the measure in order to make political points which they hope to gain from forcing the President to veto it, I say consider this: Next time it may be your State, it may be your people, it may be your constituents. 
For the reasons I have stated, I will not vote for the adoption of the conference report. 
We must not continue to play cynical games with people who need help when a disaster has taken lives, taken homes, taken farms, taken livestock, taken livelihoods. I hope that this will be the last time such tactics are employed on an emergency disaster bill. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to have some time?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee regarding the highway reserve fund in the conference agreement on H. Con. Res. 84. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I strongly support increased Federal infrastructure spending. This budget resolution, while providing for increased transportation spending, does not provide as much infrastructure spending as I would have liked. During floor consideration of this budget resolution, I offered an amendment to provide for a reserve fund for highways that would allow for increased spending on highways above the amounts called for in the budget resolution so long as appropriate offsets are found. I believe that, once the Senate begins debate on the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act or ISTEA, there will be strong interest on the part of many Members on both sides of the aisle to find additional resources to produce a highway bill that is balanced and meets the transportation needs of all regions of the country. As such, I am very pleased that the conference agreement on this budget resolution includes a highway reserve fund that is effectively identical to the one provided for in my amendment. 
I wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee for his cooperation on this matter and ask if I am correct that the main purpose of this reserve fund is to accommodate higher contract authority and outlays for highway programs if this additional spending is offset by direct spending reductions or revenue increases?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us today is nothing more than a blueprint that, if implemented in its entirety through subsequent reconciliation and tax legislation, purports to balance the federal budget by 2002. Whether or not a balanced budget will actually be achieved in five years, Heaven only knows. Having said that, this agreement must nevertheless be recognized as the byproduct of a reasonable compromise between a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. Such bipartisan cooperation has not been witnessed in recent years, when two government shutdowns have highlighted the paucity of compromise in our federal government. 
Mr. President, I would like to commend the leaders from both parties who have worked hard to forge a balanced-budget agreement that will likely pass both houses of Congress. However, I also want to remind all Senators that most of us did not sign the Bipartisan Budget Agreement announced by the President and the Congressional leadership on May 2, 1997, and we are not thereby bound to its individual components. As much as we want to jump on this budgetary bandwagon, we must be careful not to subject this Budget Resolution to any less scrutiny than would be applied to a strictly partisan budget proposal. 
Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us today purports to achieve a budget surplus of $1 billion in FY 2002. To accomplish this task, discretionary spending will be cut by a total of $138 billion over five years, Medicare and Medicaid will be cut by $129 billion, and other mandatory programs will be reduced by approximately $40 billion. In addition, the proposal would amend budget rules to extend the statutory caps for discretionary spending and the pay-as-you-go requirements for mandatory spending through 2002. While I am concerned about the depth of the spending cuts targeted towards discretionary spending, which has been declining sharply as a percentage of the federal budget since the 1960's, I cannot ignore the substantial improvement in discretionary funding that this Budget Resolution achieves over its immediate predecessors. Furthermore, this plan places spending priorities on many needed investments in transportation infrastructure, educational assistance, environmental protection, and crime-prevention programs. 
Mr. President, if the Budget Resolution included only the aforementioned spending reductions, I would likely be standing on the floor today declaring my unequivocal support for its passage. However, the Budget Resolution before us also includes certain provisions that have nothing to do with balancing the budget. In fact, these provisions--namely, the $85 billion in net tax cuts included in Senate Concurrent Resolution 27--take us in the opposite direction and make it more difficult to balance the budget. In essence, Mr. President, if we approve these tax cuts, we are with one hand digging deeper the very hole our other hand is trying so hard to fill. Such ambidexterity should not be relied upon to balance the budget. We should eschew all tax cuts until after we firmly erase the budget deficits that have so plagued our nation in recent years. Tax cuts were, after all, the primary culprit for the rapid escalation in the federal budget deficit in the 1980's. It is all too easy to enact tax cuts and save the pain for later. We have done it before, and the lessons learned from that exercise should instruct us not to do it again. 
Mr. President, some may guarantee that the Budget Resolution before us today will balance the budget in five years and still provide such tax relief. If the economy continues to perform at close to its current pace, that very well may be true. However, if the economy turns sour in the next five years, the tenuous $1 billion surplus projected for FY 2002 under this Budget Resolution may be worth less than the paper on which it is printed here today. We may never see that surplus, or anything close to it, if we combine the contradictory goals of tax cutting and budget balancing in this resolution. Suppose, for example, that we provide these tax cuts today and then find ourselves in the year 2000 well above the deficit targets proposed by this resolution. Will we be able to repeal these foolhardy tax cuts to bring us closer to balance? Will we be able to tell those beneficiaries of these tax cuts to give them up? I have served in this body long enough to recognize that tax cuts such as the ones included in this Budget Resolution are virtually a one-way street; there is no 
turning back. We should steer clear of this diversion and stay focused on the course of balancing the budget. 
Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks, I want to remind all Senators of the actions that have helped to bring us to this point, where balancing the federal budget is well within our reach. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the FY 1997 budget deficit will be approximately $67 billion, or less than one percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Just five years ago, many Senators will remember that we were facing a budget deficit of $290 billion, or about 4.7 percent of GDP. This considerable improvement in the fiscal order of our nation did not occur by accident. Rather, it can be traced directly to the passage in 1993 of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (OBRA-93) by the 103rd Congress, with the support of President Clinton. That landmark legislation combined responsible spending cuts and revenue increases to begin the painful--but necessary--process of eliminating the deficit. There can be no doubt of the success of OBRA-93 in bringing down the deficits and stimulating economic growth. We are currently in our sixth consecutive year of economic growth, unemployment has dipped below five percent, and inflation has remained in check. The Budget Resolution before us today continues the task of balancing the budget from the propitious starting point made possible by OBRA-93, and it relies on projections of similar economic conditions in the future. Mr. President, it is safe to say that, were it not for OBRA-93, the task of balancing the budget by FY 2002 would be substantially more difficult, and the Budget Resolution before us today would not come close to balance. 
After discussing what actions have made this Budget Resolution possible, however, I believe it is also important to focus on what actions were not needed. Specifically, I am referring to the proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which was again defeated earlier this year. Without constitutionally tying the hands of this and future Congresses, the leaders of the Congress and the President have come together to forge a balanced-budget plan. The plan is not perfect, by any means, but it must serve as a reminder that, in order to balance the budget, it takes only the courage to stand in the well of this chamber and cast our vote for a specific plan to eliminate the deficit. There is no substitute for courage that can be drawn from such an ill-conceived constitutional amendment. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, let me announce my intention to support final passage of S. Con. Res. 27. 
I commend the members of the majority and minority leadership, and the Budget Committee, who have come together with equanimity to work out a bipartisan budget agreement with the White House. Compromise is never easy to achieve, but its results may well be worth our efforts. After all, let us not forget that the Senate itself was, according to `The Federalist Papers,' the `result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States.' Similar conflicting `pretensions' have helped mold the bipartisan budget agreement before this body into a reasonable approach to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the case of Air Force 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn has highlighted the need for an independent review of gender relations in the services. First, I think the publicity about this case has served as an understandable impetus for all of us to speak our minds on this issue. That is, I think, useful, in that relations among the sexes in the military obviously need a thorough, independent review in light of the scandals that have emerged in recent months. 
It is imperative though, that as we review the rules regarding gender relations in the military, we keep our eye on the ball. The ball is that the goal should always be the most effective, combat-ready, disciplined, tough fighting force that the Nation can field. Effectiveness, discipline, unit cohesion and morale cannot ever take a second place to any other value, since the premier responsibility of the military is the national security of our Nation. If gender relations must take a back seat to that goal, that is as it should be. 
In the case of Lieutenant Flinn, the military justice system has tried to do its work, in spite of all the comment and publicity attendant to this case. There is a question about whether the Secretary of the Air Force should have granted Lieutenant Flinn a general discharge in lieu of a court-martial. We all, I am sure, have opinions about that. I personally feel that the charges of lying and disobeying the order of a superior officer, never mind the charge of adultery, which, of course, no one condones, merit a disciplinary decision, and that the Secretary should not have granted her a general discharge in light of those charges. That is my opinion. Other Senators may have other views. However, I believe that the larger issue and perhaps the root of the problem in this much publicized case may lie in the military rules of fraternization. When it is permissible for members of the opposite sex to socialize, live together, or otherwise fraternize, varies considerably among the different services. The standards are seriously inconsistent. I have indicated that I intend to offer an amendment to the upcoming fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization measure which would, if enacted, establish an independent outside review commission to review the question of the appropriateness of gender integrated recruit training in the services. I think such a commission could review, as well, the rules of fraternization with the goal of recommending a single consistent fraternization standard for conduct among enlisted people, between enlisted people and officers, and among officers, which spans all the services. What is appropriate for a soldier in the Army should also be appropriate for a sailor or an airman or a marine. 
Mr. President, clearly we are in the middle of a national debate on gender relations and on general conduct in the services, and the work of an independent commission to review the many issues which have arisen seems urgent, needed and very useful. In the meantime, I believe that we politicians should refrain from urging particular decisions in specific cases, and let the system work in the best way that it can until an opportunity has been had to systematically review the rules regarding gender relations and conduct in all of the services.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the traditional start of the summer outdoor season approaches, advertisers are busily reminding us that we have only three days to ready our big yards for summer, or that hooray, we have an extra day to spend on outdoor chores--using their newest tools, gadgets, and products, of course. Well, Mr. President, most of us will enjoy an extra day this weekend. That is cause for celebration. However, the purpose is to celebrate our fallen heros, not to celebrate another opportunity to spend money. 
Memorial Day is set aside to remember the final sacrifice made by many brave men and women in the defense of our Nation and our ideals of liberty and justice. Though in many cases, years have passed since they laid down their lives for us, the memory of these fallen heros should not fade from our hearts, drowned out by the din of advertising or buried beneath a tide of sales circulars. I urge my colleagues, and the American public, to pause for a moment this weekend, that they fly their flags, pause to set aside their dirt-covered gloves, to brush the grass clippings from their pants legs, and to sit for a moment in the sun-dappled shade of an ancient tree, and thank these men and women who have--to paraphrase the preamble to our mighty Constitution--provided for the common defense, promoted the general welfare, and secured the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. 
In the United States, our fallen soldiers have been honored and remembered on Memorial Day since the time of the Civil War. That tragic conflict spawned so many spontaneous gestures of remembrance in our country that the location and the date of the first Memorial Day or Decoration Day--Decoration Day, as it was called--Ceremony is disputed. 
One of the most moving and famous of the early Memorial Day tributes occurred in Columbus, Mississippi. On April 26, 1866, the women of Columbus gathered to decorate the graves of their husbands, brothers, lovers and friends who had been buried four years earlier after the Battle of Shiloh in a plot now known as Friendship Cemetery. The plot contained the remains of 1500 confederate soldiers, but it also was the final resting place for 100 fallen federal troops. 
The time was reconstruction. In 1866, much of the South was under military occupation and was impoverished. Resentment and hatred still ran high on both sides of the Mason Dixon line. 
But, to these war-weary women, the time for hostilities was over. After scattering flowers on the graves of their own men, they decorated the graves of the union men with magnolia blossoms. 
But, like so many of our religious and secular days of remembrance, the origin and purpose of Memorial Day have become at least partially obscured by the more immediate pleasures of a day off, the flash and danger of a car race or the anticipation of good food at a picnic. 
Let me quote from a book, The Good War, an oral history of World War II by Studs Terkel. In 1982, a woman of thirty told Terkel: `I can't relate to World War II. It's in schoolbook texts, that's all. Battles that were won, battles that were lost. Or costume dramas you see on TV. It's just a story in the past. It's so distant, so abstract. I don't get myself up in a bunch about it.' 
Without a continued awareness of the real significance of this national day of remembrance, we may eventually also largely forget the difficult and invaluable lessons of the human cost and the ultimate tragedy of all warfare. Particularly today, when armed conflicts such as Desert Storm may seem glamorous, even entertaining and almost antiseptic in their efficiency, we must not forget as a nation that war always means death, destruction, broken homes, broken families, twisted and maimed bodies and devastation. 
While this Nation must never shrink from armed conflict if that is the course we must take to protect our freedoms, we must also never forget nor minimize the horror of war, else we may 
someday risk its grisly consequences too easily. 
So it is my hope, that on this coming Memorial Day, all Americans will take a few moments to remember the brave men and women who have fought and died to preserve this great nation and its principles of liberty and freedom. The personal suffering and sacrifice endured by our fallen soldiers and their families for the sake of our country must not go without a measure of recognition by each of us on this most solemn of days. These were real people, not just statistics in a history book or names chiseled on stone. These were young men and women with sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, hopes, dreams, aspirations and fears just like the rest of us. At some future time, God forbid, the names of our own sons, daughters and grandchildren could very well be among those that are read at a ceremony honoring our fallen soldiers. 
Nothing confronts us with our common humanity--with our shared responsibilities as citizens and with a renewed appreciation for the worth of our sacred and fragile freedoms like a contemplation of our national conflicts, and the sorrow, heroism, death and sacrifice that has accompanied each of them. 
This weekend thousands of American families will visit cemeteries around the nation to remember husbands, wives, sons, daughters, grandfathers, great grandfathers and friends who paid the ultimate price in this nation's conflict. All of us need to take time to show our solidarity with their grief and their sacrifice; to fly the flags at our homes, schools, cemeteries and public places; to walk the eerie quiet of Antietam or Bull Run; visit the local veterans' cemeteries; lay some flowers on the tomb of a fallen soldier; spend a quiet moment at the monuments to our honored war dead; take our children in tow and teach them about all the brave young men and women who have paid so dearly in the past so that future generations can be free; and through that conscious effort and those small individual acts put a very human face on Memorial Day. Remember, spontaneous acts of remembrance such as these were what spawned Memorial Day in the first place. And they will always be the most meaningful tributes of all.  
In Flanders fields the poppies blow 
Between the crosses, row on row, 
That mark our place; and in the sky 
The larks, still bravely singing, fly 
Scarce heard amid the guns below. 
We are the Dead. Short days ago 
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, 
Loved and were loved, and now we lie 
In Flanders fields. 
Take up our quarrel with the foe: 
To you from failing hands we throw 
The torch; be yours to hold it high. 
If ye break faith with us who die 
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow 
In Flanders fields.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I deeply regret that the other body has chosen to stand in recess for the Memorial Day break without having passed disaster assistance appropriations for the hundreds of thousands of victims of natural disasters in 33 states throughout the country. As all members are aware, yesterday afternoon the House of Representatives, by a vote of 278-67, rejected an adjournment resolution. Immediately following that vote, according to press accounts, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Livingston, sought recognition for the purpose of attempting to bring up a clean disaster assistance supplemental appropriation bill intended to provide sufficient and necessary assistance for a number of programs to ensure that there will be no delay in getting assistance to the victims of these natural disasters. As I understand it, the total amount of that proposal was approximately $1 billion. Had the House taken it up and passed this interim disaster assistance bill, I am certain the Senate could have done the same and the President had indicated that he would have signed it. 
The larger disaster assistance supplemental bill that is in conference contains some very controversial and difficult issues which have nothing to do with providing the necessary funds for disaster victims, or with the nearly $2 billion contained in the bill for aid to our men and women in uniform around the world--particularly Bosnia--engaged in peacekeeping operations, or with the $750 million in funding for veterans compensation and pension. The conferees are in agreement, to a large extent, with the funding issues in the bill. But, these contentious, extraneous issues have slowed the progress of the conference despite the skillful and patient manner with which the distinguished chairman of the conference, Mr. Livingston, has conducted each meeting of the conferees. He has shown the ability to proceed as expeditiously as possible, while at the same time protecting all Members' rights to fully air their views on each matter before the conference. I have nothing but high praise for his leadership, as well as that of the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Obey, or of our chairman, Senator Stevens, as well as for all of the chairmen and ranking members of this conference who have worked many hours to resolve most of the differences in the bill. I would have preferred, as I am sure all of the conferees would have preferred, to be able to stand here today urging the Senate to adopt a completed conference agreement on H.R. 1469, the emergency disaster assistance supplemental appropriation bill. 
Since, for the reasons I have stated, that was not possible, I express to the American people and particularly to the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims throughout the country, my deep regret that their elected representatives in Congress have chosen to recess for the Memorial Day holiday without having taken any action to address their desperate need for Federal assistance. At the same time, I urge them not to despair and pledge my efforts to do all that I can to work with the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, and the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Livinston, and Mr. Obey, to complete final action on H.R. 1469 as quickly is as humanly possible when the conference next convenes, hopefully during the first week of June.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this week is National Emergency Medical Services Week. The people who work and volunteer in the emergency medical services field provide an invaluable service for all American citizens--they provide us with a safety net. This is necessary because regardless of how careful we try to be, we are all subject to the whims of fate. Common sense and practicality are often not enough to prevent accidents caused by the carelessness of ourselves or others. In these times of need, we rely on dedicated emergency medical services personnel. They take care of us when we cannot take care of ourselves. 
I want to take this time to recognize the special disposition that a person must have to be an emergency medical service worker. These people all share common characteristics such as the desire to help, as well as the ability to feel empathy for, the people they assist. Of course, kindness and willingness to help alone are not enough. These workers must also possess the skills needed to do the job and to do it well. These skills can only be acquired through hard work and dedication. The working lives of emergency medical service workers are characterized by a lack of predictability in both content and scheduling. They have no routine to rely on. They truly must be ready for any thing at any time. 
Although emergency medical service workers across the country have many things in common, they also face many different challenges and dangers every day. There are some who must fight traffic, some who fight long distances and bad roads, and some who are forced to face the fear and possibility of losing their lives in order to try and save ours. Despite all of the challenges and dangers faced by these dedicated workers, they continue to be efficient, to be dependable, and to be effective in saving lives day after day. 
In a world which is fraught with peril, it comforts me to know that there are people that we can count on in our hour of need. And so, Mr. President, I am proud to recognize this week as National Emergency Medical Services week to acknowledge the important work and strong character of the dedicated emergency medical services personnel. We are fortunate to have this opportunity to show our appreciation for all of their tireless work on our behalf.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in early March of this year I received a letter from Charles R. Mariott, of Louisville, Tennessee, in which he enclosed a stirring poem, written by his wife Ruth and dedicated to Arlington Cemetery. The poem shows great talent and I want to bring it to the attention of my colleagues and to the audience of listeners throughout the country as we approach the Memorial Day weekend. It is a poem that exudes a spirit of patriotism which, I believe, will inspire all freedom loving Americans everywhere.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself in considerable measure with the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens]. We have been voting for a lot of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. I think we had one yesterday, 99-0. We know it is not going to be paid for. 
On this business about infrastructure, we hear it said that there is no money. I am from a State that needs infrastructure. We say there is no money. I shall state why I supported the Warner-Baucus amendment. We do not need a tax cut in this country right now. We do not need a tax cut. I say that with respect to the Republican tax cut and with respect to the tax cut that is supported by the Administration. We do not need a tax cut. When we see what we are doing in this budget resolution with respect to cutting taxes--cutting taxes at a time when we are within reach of balancing the budget, if we were to use that money that is going for the tax cut, we would balance this budget much earlier than it is expected to be balanced now and we could also use some of that money for infrastructure. If we want to know where we can get the money, that is where it can be found. Let's vote against the tax cut. 
I am going to vote against this resolution if we have the tax cut tied with it. 
I thank the distinguished Senator.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to provide a meaningful and effective mechanism that will allow the Senate to boost substantially our national investment in highways. Much has been said over the last few days, both in the Senate and in the other body, regarding the critical need for our nation to reverse the trend of national disinvestment in our Nation's highways. 
My amendment would substitute the reserve fund provisions in the committee-reported resolution with a new fund that will provide the Senate with the opportunity to consider reported bills or individual amendments that reduce spending in nonhighway areas or increase revenues to allow for increased highway funding. Mr. President, I believe that when the Senate is faced with the very difficult process of reauthorizing ISTEA, there will be renewed interest in finding additional funding for highways. But we must have the mechanism available to us to revisit the issue. This amendment will provide us with that opportunity. 
I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senators Domenici and Lautenberg, for their cooperation in the development of this amendment. 
I hope they will accept my amendment, as modified.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are told in the Holy Bible that Abraham lived to be 175 years old, that Isaac lived to be 180 years old, that Jacob lived to be 147 years old, and that Joseph lived to be 110 years old. I have consulted Scripture to see if there is any account of record with respect to the Senator who is the senior Senator of this body, Strom Thurmond, and I found that nothing had yet been entered in regard to that venerable gentleman. 
I rise today to call attention to a very historic and significant happening that will occur on this coming Sunday, May 25, when the senior Senator from South Carolina becomes the longest serving Senator in the history of the U.S. Senate. On that day, Senator Strom Thurmond, whose service began on December 24, 1954, will surpass the record set by Arizona Senator Carl Hayden, who served 41 years and 10 months between 1927 and 1969. In the entire 208-year history of the U.S. Senate, only three Senators--Strom Thurmond, Carl Hayden, and 
John Stennis of Mississippi--served for more than 40 years. 
I should point out that Senator Hayden had previously spent 15 years in the House of Representatives, giving him a combined 56 years in Congress, a record matched by no one else in either the House or Senate. 
I stand fourth on the overall list of seniority in the Senate, with 38 years and 5 months of service to date, which does not count the 6 years that I spent in the House of Representatives, beginning in January 1953, before I came to the Senate. The rest of the `top 10' include Senators Richard Russell, Russell Long, Francis Warren, James Eastland, Warren Magnuson, and Claiborne Pell. It is worthy of note that while there have been Senators throughout our history--1,843 Senators in our 208-year history--at the time that Senator Hayden retired in 1969, 9 of these top 10 Senators were then serving together in the Senate. That is quite a remarkable thing, I think. Longevity of Senate service is clearly a modern phenomenon. 
Longevity records have been set on three prior occasions in the 20th century. In 1905, William Allison, an Iowa Republican, broke the previous record of 31 years and 11 months. In 1928, Senator Francis Warren, a Wyoming Republican, broke Allison's record. And in 1964, Senator Carl Hayden, an Arizona Democrat, surpassed Warren's tenure. Now Senator Thurmond, a Republican from the State of South Carolina, will move past Senator Hayden's record. 
It is fitting for those of us in the Senate to pay tribute to Senator Thurmond on this occasion. I note that on February 19, 1962, the Senate honored Senator Hayden when he became the first person to have served in Congress 50 years. On June 19, 1970, we commemorated Senator Mike Mansfield's becoming the longest-serving Democratic leader of the Senate. And on December 22, 1995, we similarly celebrated Senator Bob Dole's breaking of his party's leadership record. 
It is also fitting for us to recall the great sweep of American history represented in Senator Thurmond's long political career. And it is indeed a remarkable political career. If one will just take the time to look at the Congressional Directory, he will view with astonishment and amazement the political record of Senator Thurmond. He won his first election as Edgefield County superintendent of schools in 1928, when he was 26 years old. Calvin Coolidge then occupied the White House, soon to be replaced by Herbert Hoover, who was elected President that year. The boom times of the Roaring Twenties were soon shattered by the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. Strom Thurmond and I remember all about those things. 
During the 1930's, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a New Deal in America, Strom Thurmond served as city and county attorney, a member of the South Carolina State Senate, and as a circuit judge. The United States entered the Second World War in 1941. And in 1942, Strom Thurmond volunteered for service in the Army. He was a paratrooper at Normandy Beach on June 6, 1944, 53 years ago. Returning to civilian life, he was elected Governor of South Carolina in 1946, 51 years ago. Two years later, he ran as the `Dixiecrat' candidate for President of the United States against the incumbent Democrat, Harry S. Truman. 
In 1954, during the Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Strom Thurmond became the first and only person ever to be elected to the U.S. Senate on a write-in vote. Senator Thurmond took the oath of office on December 24, 1954. Fulfilling a pledge he had made during that first campaign, Senator Thurmond resigned from the Senate on April 4, 1956, and ran again for his Senate seat in the Democratic primary. He won both the primary and the general election and returned to the Senate on November 7, 1956. 
During his first 10 years in the Senate, Strom Thurmond was a Democrat. When I came to the Senate, Strom Thurmond was a Democrat. I can remember looking up into the galleries and seeing the late wife of Strom Thurmond, who died early in her life, relatively speaking. I can remember coming into the Chamber that day, and seeing Strom on the back row of the Senate, I walked up to him and expressed my sorrow for the loss of his wife. 
In 1964, during the Presidential campaign between President Lyndon Johnson and Senator Barry Goldwater, Senator Thurmond changed his party affiliation to become a Republican. And he has been credited with devising the `Southern Strategy' that has so significantly reshaped the Republican Party. 
In 1981, when Ronald Reagan became President and the Republican Party gained the majority in the Senate, after 26 years in the minority, Senator Thurmond became President pro tempore and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Today with Bill Clinton in the White House, Senator Thurmond is again President pro tempore of the Senate and chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
Now, to that record of endurance we should add one further statistic. In 1957 Senator Thurmond set the record, as yet unbroken, and I imagine it will be unbroken for a long, long time, for the longest individual speech delivered in the Senate, for 24 hours and 18 minutes. From August 28 to August 29, 1957, Senator Thurmond held the floor, speaking against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. 
As a Senator who once held the floor for 14 hours and 13 minutes, and I could have held it much longer and probably would have held it much longer had I not honored a promise that I made to the then majority leader Mike Mansfield that I would give up the floor in order to let a vote occur, I held the floor for 14 hours and 13 minutes, I can attest that Senator Thurmond's exceptional stamina is quite remarkable. 
Finally, I shall not allow the occasion to pass without calling attention to a historical milestone that would be set on December 31, 1997, by Senator Thurmond's colleague from South Carolina Ernest Hollings--we all know him as Fritz--who has now served 30 years and 5 months as the junior Senator from his State. Senator Hollings will then surpass the `juniority' record of 31 years and 52 days previously held by Senator John Stennis of Mississippi. 
So we have two Senators from South Carolina who are breaking records these days. I salute both of these distinguished Senators. 
I am proud to serve on the Armed Services Committee now chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, and I am proud to sit on the Appropriations Committee, where for these many years I have worked at 
the side of Senator Hollings, a very fine Senator, a very active and able Senator. Both of these Senators have contributed greatly to the service of their country. I salute these distinguished Senators and their historical records, and I commend Strom Thurmond for his lifetime of public service to his State, to his Nation and to the U.S. Senate.  
The hours are like a string of pearls, 
The days like diamonds rare, 
The moments are the threads of gold, 
That bind them for our wear, 
So may the years that come to you, Strom, 
Such health and good contain, 
That every moment, hour, and day, 
Be like a golden chain.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, two weeks ago, on May 6, 1997, a military jury sentenced an Army staff sergeant to 25 years in prison for raping six female trainees, just one of a series of highly visible scandals regarding sexual relations now plaguing training facilities in the Army. Press reports indicate that hundreds of similar cases of alleged sexual abuse and discrimination have been reported and are being investigated at other military training commands around the country. On May 10, 1997, the senior enlisted soldier in the U.S. Army was charged with similar offenses. The extent of the scandals that have been unearthed at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, as well as other facilities, indicates to me that the time has arrived for a thorough review of further gender-integrated training in the military. There are those who feel that same-sex training has failed as a training mechanism and is adversely affecting morale, discipline and the integrity of our armed forces. This is a serious situation, involving very serious allegations with possible repercussions on our national security. The situation needs to be examined with a dispassionate attitude, and it greatly complicates our task if well-meaning advocacy groups in our country make the assumption that anyone who calls for a thorough investigation of the viability of gender integrated training and operational roles is per se, a bigot, is against equal treatment and opportunity, and is trying to roll the clock back because of his or her narrow vision. 
The Senate Armed Services committee held a hearing on this matter on February 4, 1997, at which the Army leadership testified. Certainly one of the issues we need to understand is the pervasiveness of sexual misconduct in the services. Are these isolated incidents we have been reading about, or are there systemic problems rooted in the integration of the armed forces and the environments in which they must train and operate? There was some testimony before the committee that these incidents are akin to the proverbial few bad apples in the barrel, and that what needs to be done is emphasize right and wrong, professional behavior, and punish unprofessional behavior. But, Mr. President, the numbers involved here tell a different story. The Army established a hot line for women to report sexual harassment, misconduct, or abuse last fall when the first incidents were reported. In a little over two and a half months, that hot line received about 7,000 phone calls. That is an astonishing and disturbing number. It takes little courage to make such a phone call. One wonders how many phone calls, on top of the 7,000, that should have been made were not made for fear of retaliation, or just reticence. Now, the Secretary of the Army testified that by February the number of calls on the hot line had `tapered off' to about 50 a week. This is not indicative to me of just a few bad apples in the barrel. More than one thousand of those calls have generated an investigation of some kind. Furthermore, recent surveys taken by the Defense Manpower Data Center Survey indicated that large numbers of women reported one or more incidents of unwanted sexual attention. In 1988-89, 68 percent of women reported such incidents. In 1995 a similar survey got similar results, with 61 percent of the women in the Army reporting such incidents. So this is not just your random, marginal population. There is a serious, central problem that needs to be looked at. 
This is not just about sexual harassment among soldiers of equal rank. It is about that, but it is about much more, it is about the use of power and authority of sergeants and officers whom we put in authority, over the recruits and junior people whom they are responsible to train and look after. It is about raw abuse of power of a shocking, crude kind. It is about power and sexual misconduct. It leads one to ask a fundamental question: are women actually safe in the U.S. military? As Senator Snowe said during that hearing: `As we incorporate the sexes together in tighter and tighter situations, at higher and higher stress situations, in more confined situations, common sense tells us that we are going to be dealing with a very difficult problem. Is there a danger that we are trying to minimize the very real differences here between men and women? Might there really be enough significant distinctions between being a man and being a woman that we should be more discriminating, not less, in terms of assignments and utilization?' 
The Chief of Staff of the Army, Mr. Joe Reimer, testified at the Armed Services hearing that this is an issue that is not about policy, and instead it is an issue about right and wrong. That is, it is not about whether we should have women in the military, but whether we can expect our sergeants and officers in authority to carry out their job properly, not use their power to engage in misconduct. But, I think that just begs the question. While it is about right and wrong, it is also surely about policy. It is about in what situations, what kinds of training, what kinds of operations, women and men can work effectively in the military, and in what kinds of training and operations situations the sexual diversion is just too difficult a factor. For instance, we have had gender integrated training in the military since 1974, but we have only had such training of recruits in the military for the last three years. It is in the recruit training situation that we are certainly experiencing very serious problems, and surely that needs to be revisited now. I note that there is legislation moving through the other body to prohibit mixed recruit training. That is one natural reaction to the situation, as I now understand it, and that is the approach that I would support. 
But I think the better policy question is this: are we putting people into situations that put at risk our goal of an effective trained combat force with high morale, discipline and unit cohesiveness, making that goal more difficult to achieve than it should be? Are we putting temptations in the face of people and saying to them, `overcome those temptations?'

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once again we find ourselves addressing the very difficult and emotional issue of partial-birth abortion. The bill the Senate is considering today would criminalize the performance of the partial-birth abortion procedure, unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother. I still have many unanswered questions about this matter, and, as I have indicated in the past, I am extremely hesitant to thrust the Congress into the role of the physician. I am concerned that this measure seemingly ignores the Supreme Court's determinations regarding the role of the state in banning abortions pre- and post-viability and with regard to the health of the mother. I have also noted concerns that this might be the first step in a process which may lead Congress to play the role of doctor again and again and again on specific medical procedures. 
As in the past, I have given this issue a great deal of thought and I have particularly considered the new information brought to light by Ron Fitzsimmons of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. His remarks made clear that this particular procedure is performed far more often than originally thought and not just under certain extreme circumstances which severely threaten the life and the health of the mother. In addition, an endorsement of the ban by the American Medical Association (AMA), which represents a large number of our Nation's doctors, certainly allays some of my earlier concerns about this measure. In previous votes, I had opposed banning this specific procedure; however, in light of the fact that it is not as rare as some claimed and that there appear to be other alternatives, I cannot, in good conscience, continue to oppose a ban on this specific procedure. 
Due to my concern about the serious health risk to the mother that can, unfortunately, occur during pregnancy, I voted in support of the alternative measure offered by Senator Daschle. I believe that the Daschle amendment would have been more effective in addressing warranted concerns about post-viability abortions while ensuring that severe, serious health risks to the mother are taken into account. However, that amendment was rejected by the Senate. 
Like so many West Virginians and Americans who have heard about this specific procedure, I find it extremely disturbing. Mr. President, I will cast my vote in support of H.R. 1122 to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure that is done in too many questionable circumstances.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the Minority Leader for his good efforts to bring about a thoughtful compromise on this difficult issue. He and his staff have worked long and hard to develop the language we have before us in the form of this amendment. The Daschle alternative would ban all post-viability abortions while presenting an exception for the life of the mother and a meaningful, narrowly tailored exception for serious health risk to the mother. The amendment also contains penalties for a first violation of the law in the form of a fine of up to $100,000 or the loss of the physician's license. 
While I am generally opposed to abortion, I also believe that there should be the ability to protect the mother. This issue is a very difficult and a very emotional one. I have grappled with it long and hard. While some may argue that this amendment is a paper tiger, I disagree. This amendment, unlike the underlying bill, would address all late-term abortion procedures, not just the partial-birth abortion procedure. 
Again, I appreciate the efforts of the Minority Leader, and I will cast my vote in support of his amendment.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I want to commend the managers of the agreement for the expeditious manner in which they have moved this agreement through the committee and to the floor in time for the deadline of May 15 in order that it not be subject to further action by the review conference in Vienna. As I understand it, the agreement was not submitted to the Senate by the Secretary of State until April 3, 1997. So I commend the committee. But I also wish to express my concern over the rushed manner in which the Senate has been forced to deal with this important treaty. All of us in this Chamber know that treaties are not considered by the House of Representatives, but they still have the effect and status of being the law of the land of our Nation. They have as much or even more importance, in some respects, and certainly as far as the Senate is concerned, than any bill that is passed by both Houses and has been subjected to the scrutiny of a conference committee. 
In the case of treaties, the Senate considers them and, assuming that the President exchanges the instruments of ratification, they become the law of the land according to article 6 of the United States Constitution. Therefore, the Senate has a special responsibility, in the case of treaties, to exercise due caution and great care in dealing with treaties, since there is no review or check by the other body. Additionally, the Senate provides the only forum for the debate of the provisions of treaties, and for informing the American people about their content. Because of those realities, I am very concerned about the increasing tendency in this body, as has been evidenced by the Chemical Weapons Treaty that we recently passed, and now by this treaty, to enter into time agreements that inadequately protect the rights of all Senators to debate and amend treaties, but which also fail to defend the rights of the American people to know what is in the treaties. I think it is a bad trend. I think it should be curtailed, because it does not allow Members to thoroughly study and debate these complicate and important matters. 
This committee report bears the date of May 9, 1997, when it was ordered to be printed. That was last Friday. As I understand it, it was made available to my staff on Monday of this week, and, so, I have had between Monday and now to consider the contents of the committee report. The committee report is where we naturally turn to understand the content of the treaty or content of the bill or resolution, as it were. Also, the courts turn to the phraseology of a committee report to better understand the intent of the legislature when it passes on a bill or resolution, or approves the resolution of ratification of a treaty. So it is important that Members have an adequate opportunity to study a committee report. 
It is important that they have adequate opportunity to study the hearings. It is likewise important that they have an adequate opportunity to fully debate a treaty. Let me say, again, that according to article 6 of the United States Constitution--the Constitution, this Constitution--and the laws that are made in pursuance of this Constitution and the treaties that are made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land--the supreme law of the land. 
Now, that is a very heavy burden to place upon the U.S. Senate, as it is given the sole responsibility with respect to the Congress. As far as the Congress is concerned, the Senate has the sole responsibility, a very heavy responsibility, to study treaties, to conduct hearings thereon, to mark up the treaties, to approve of conditions or reservations, amendments, whatever, to those treaties. There is no other body that scrutinizes the treaty. The Senate of the United States--and that is one of the reasons why the Senate is the unique body that it is--unique body, the premier upper body in the world today, more so than the House of Lords in our mother country. And so it places upon us as Senators a responsibility that is very, very heavy, and we have a duty to know what is in a treaty before we vote on it. We get these requests, and here we are backed up against a date of the 15th. 
We had the same problem, in a way, I think, with respect to the chemical weapons treaty. We are handed a unanimous consent request, and it is a bit intimidating for one Senator to be faced with the prospect that he will be holding up the business of the Senate if he holds up the unanimous consent request. But that is our responsibility; that is our duty. 
So, I am increasingly concerned by the trend, as I have said, that we are finding ourselves being subjected to. It did not just begin yesterday or the day before, and I am not attempting to place any blame for that. I am simply calling attention to the fact that we have the responsibility as Senators under the Constitution, to which we swear an oath to uphold to support and defend, we have a duty to know what is in this treaty. 
I am not on the committee, but I am a Senator, and I have as heavy a duty as does the Senator from North Carolina or the Senator from Delaware. That is the way I see it. I have as heavy a duty to know what I am voting on, because this is the law of the land. It is not an ordinary bill or resolution which can be vetoed by the President and which, if signed into law by the President, can be repealed next week or the following week or the next month. It is not that easy to negate the effects of a treaty if we find we made a mistake. 
Well, so much for that. Here we are debating the treaty. We have one, two, three, four Senators on the floor debating an important treaty, and we are confined within a 2 1/2 -hour time limit, I believe. Four Senators. The law of the land. We should be debating the treaty without a time limit, at least in the beginning. 
I have been majority leader of the Senate twice during the years when President Carter was President. I did not serve under Mr. Carter, I served with him. Senators don't serve under Presidents, we serve with Presidents. But I was majority leader during those 4 years. I was majority leader in the 100th Congress. I was minority leader in all of the Congresses in between 1981 and 1986. 
We had some important treaties: INF Treaty, we had the Panama Canal Treaties, and we did not bring treaties like this to the floor and ask they be debated, no amendments thereon, and in a time limitation of 2 hours. And there was a request to cut that to 1 hour. We did not do that. 
When I came here, we debated treaties, and we took our time. At some point, it is all right to try to get a time limitation after things have been aired; it is all right to try to bring it to 
closure. But I am somewhat disturbed and concerned by this trend that we find ourselves being subjected to. 
As to the substance of the treaty, I want to note that condition No. 8 dealing with treaty interpretation provides sound guidance on the meaning of `condition,' which was authored by the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, now the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, myself and former Senator Sam Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and agreed to on the Treaty on Intermediate Nuclear Forces in Europe of 1988. That is the INF Treaty. 
In that instance, I was under great pressure from my friends on the Republican side of the aisle and great pressure from my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle to bring up the treaty. As majority leader, I thought it was my duty to wait until we had resolved some critical problems that were estimated to be critical problems by the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee before I brought it up. We spent considerable time on the treaty. 
Condition (8) states that `nothing in [the so-called Biden-Byrd] condition shall be construed as authorizing the President to obtain legislative approval for modifications or amendments to treaties through a majority approval of both Houses.' 
Why was it necessary--I would like to ask this question of either the manager or the ranking manager of the resolution--why was it necessary for us to include condition (8), which certainly is a condition that I strongly support? Why was it necessary for us to include condition (8)?

Mr. BYRD. I am pleased that we have not done that.

Was that the concern?

Mr. BYRD. I thank the very able ranking manager, and I compliment him again and compliment the manager. I am glad that condition has been made clear. 
Secondly, I would like to ask the managers of the agreement their reasoning behind their view of the collective impact of conditions (1), (2) and (3). Let me preface what I have just said by reading excerpts from these conditions. 
CONDITION 1: POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES 
I read from the committee report, page 20: 
Condition (1) simply restates United States policy that no Russian troops should be deployed on another country's territory without the freely-given consent of that country. Unfortunately, Russia continues to station troops in several sovereign countries of the former Soviet Union--in several cases against the express wishes of the host country. 
CONDITION 2: VIOLATIONS OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY 
Condition (2) states the view of the Senate that Russian troops are deployed abroad against the will of some countries (namely, Moldova). It further states the Secretary of State should undertake priority discussions to secure the removal of Russian troops from any country that wishes them withdrawn. Further, it requires the Administration to issue a joint statement with the other fifteen members of the NATO alliance reaffirming the principles that this treaty modification does not give any country: (1) The right to station forces abroad against the will of the recipient country; or (2) the right to demand reallocation of military equipment quotas under the CFE Treaty and the Tashkant Agreement. This joint statement was issued, in fact, on May 8, 1997 in Vienna. 
CONDITION 3: FACILITATION OF NEGOTIATIONS 
Now, I am particularly interested in this condition. 
Condition (3) ensures that the United States will not be party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or otherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from its smaller neighbors. 
Let me interpolate right there for the moment with a rhetorical question. 
Why should we have to have a condition to ensure that the United States will not be party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or otherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from its smaller neighbors? It would seem to me that would be a given. 
Let me continue, and then I will yield to the distinguished ranking member. 
Indeed, this condition, along with much of the rest of the resolution, is specifically designed to require the United States to safeguard the sovereign rights of other countries (such as Ukraine, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) in their dealings with the Russian Federation. 
Listen to this: 
The committee became alarmed, over the course of its consideration of the CFE Flank Document, with several aspects of the United States negotiating record. This condition [condition No. 3] will ensure that the United States will adhere to the highest principles in the conduct of negotiations undertaken pursuant to the treaty, the CFE Flank Document, and any side statements that have already been issued or which may be issued in the future. 
Now, there are several questions that jump out at anyone who reads that paragraph. 
It makes reference to `side statements.' It uses the word `alarmed.' There is a condition there that ensures that the United States will not be a party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or otherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from a smaller neighbor. 
Why do we have to have a condition to that effect? Is there some confusion about what the right position is that the United States should take? Is it not a given that the United States would not be a party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate concessions from its smaller neighbors? 
I yield to the distinguished Senator.

Mr. BYRD. Well, Madam President, I came up, I suppose, at a time when political correctness did not make any difference. As far as I am concerned, it does not make any difference yet. And the pronoun `he' is inclusive. It was inclusive when I was a boy; it was inclusive when I became a man. It still is inclusive of the female. So I would not worry too much about that.

Mr. BYRD. I commend the committee for including that condition. 
I can understand how the committee would become alarmed. I think that it would have been well if all Senators could have been notified that there was--and maybe they were, I do not know, but I do not remember being notified except through my own staff that there was such a paper up in room 407 so that they could have gone up and examined it. I heard about it this afternoon, and I went up and looked at it. 
So I think the committee had a right to be alarmed. I congratulate the committee on including the condition which, as Mr. Biden has just said, locks it in, locks the administration in, so there will be no doubt that the United States will not be party to any efforts by Russia to intimidate or otherwise extract CFE Treaty concessions from its smaller neighbors. 
I would dare say, if the people in Azerbaijan or Armenia or Georgia should see that language, they would be alarmed also--they would be alarmed also. They would wonder, where does the United States stand? But the condition is there. And I again commend the committee on including it. 
Do the managers feel that U.S. policy is now clearly to protect the interests and rights of the newly sovereign nations of the Caucasus against intimidation and pressure tactics by the Russians regarding equipment that is covered by the flank agreement that we are considering here today?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is expected to vote shortly on S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Amendments Act of 1997, also known as the IDEA bill. Mr. President, I compliment the managers of the bill, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Jeffords. They have worked hard and the legislation is certainly an improvement over the current situation. 
I do have some reservations about the contents of the bill--I intend to vote for it--and about the manner in which it was brought up for consideration. 
Before I cast my vote, I would like to take this opportunity to express my concern with the legislation. First, and foremost, a committee report on S. 717 was not available until early on Monday, yesterday, and the Senate proceeded to debate S. 717 on Monday. That is not anything new around here. We are witnessing more and more of it, and too much of it. I was not able to secure a copy of the report until yesterday afternoon, which constrained my ability to read the committee report as thoroughly as I would have liked. It is unfortunate and unnecessary that our independent judgment as Senators is so often being subjected to narrow time constraints to render a decision on the ramifications of important bills such as this one. 
In addition, I have been contacted by a number of West Virginians who have raised concerns about the `stay-put' clause in the current law for violent and disabled students. The `stay-put' provision means that a disabled student cannot be removed from his or her current classroom until a hearing is held to resolve the matter. Under S. 717, steps have been taken to attempt to correct this matter by permitting local school authorities to relocate a disabled child into an alternative educational environment for up to 45 days pending an appeal if he or she brings a weapon to a school or a school function, or consumes or solicits a controlled substance. 
I think these provisions are improvements, as I say, over the present. But I don't think they go far enough. Why should school authorities be limited to a period of 45 days for the removal of a disabled student--disabled or any other student--who carries a weapon to school or uses drugs at school or school-sponsored events? Why not 90 days? Why not longer, if the situation warrants it? While I applaud the efforts of the sponsors to provide the local schools with more authority to deal with a violent and disabled child, I am disappointed that more stringent discipline provisions are not included in the final draft of the bill. We ought to consider the security and educational needs of every student in the class, in addition to the disabled child. 
Finally, I have, over the years, detailed the national problem of alcohol abuse, and have urged people, young and old, not to drink and drive--but not to drink, period. That is the way I feel about it: Not to drink. I have urged people, young and old, to abstain from drinking alcohol. Yet, S. 717 makes no reference to a disabled child who brings or consumes alcohol on school property. I know the sponsors would argue that the bill contains language that would allow local school officials to exact discipline under the same terms that a nondisabled student would face. But it is my opinion that alcohol is just as evil as any other drug defined by the Controlled Substance Act, to which S. 717 refers. Therefore, I believe that the bill should include alcohol 
under the provisions that relate to school officials' authority for the immediate removal of a disabled child who possesses a weapon or a controlled substance on school property. I hope that, when the managers again consider legislation of this type, they will consider carefully the inclusion of the word `alcohol.' It does not hurt to have it in, and it may help. 
In conclusion, I will vote for S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Amendments Act of 1997, but I would like to inform my fellow Senators that the manner in which we have arrived at this point troubles me. Proponents of the bill have argued that the quick markup of the bill and its subsequent expeditious floor clearance was necessary to avoid a subsequent demolition of the fragile agreement that has been reached. Mr. President, if it is all that fragile, perhaps we ought to start over. Mr. President, efforts to ram legislation through, not only in this case but all too many other cases, as we have seen around here in late years, are not consistent with the duties of the Senate to adequately deliberate on a matter that affects millions of disabled and nondisabled children who have a right to a safe and appropriate public education. 
Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for yielding me the time. I again congratulate the managers of the bill and I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Under section 685(d) National Information Dissemination the first five authorized activities listed have traditionally been performed utilizing the services of the national clearinghouses. 
The national clearinghouses, which have been in existence for over 25 years, have developed very effective, specialized and targeted lines of communications to State and local entities serving this population of special needs as well as to individual families. Representatives in my own State of West Virginia have communicated to me that they want to continue to be able to be serviced by these clearinghouses with whom they have developed longstanding and trusting relationships. 
Does the bill continue to authorize all the activities currently carried out by the national clearinghouses?

Mr. BYRD. I note in section 685 that the statutory language states--and I will paraphrase--that the Secretary should provide these authorized services utilizing `mechanisms as institutes which include regional resource centers, clearinghouses, and programs that support State and local entities.' 
I want to make sure that this language, even though somewhat general would allow the Secretary to utilize a Federal resource center, as well as regional centers. The Federal center provides a longstanding, vital, and supporting role in keeping regional centers supplied with and connected to the latest technical information and research development within this specialized field, in addition, the Federal resource center has traditionally coordinated some of the activities of the regional centers. 
Does S. 717 allow the Secretary to utilize a Federal resource center in this role?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this coming Sunday, May 11, is Mother's Day. It used to be that Members of the House and Senate would call attention to special days, days of special significance such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, Independence Day, and so on. I do not hear much of that being done anymore, but I like to stay with tradition. I believe that is the tried and true way. The Bible says, `Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set.' 
Mother's Day came about through the efforts of a dedicated mother and daughter from Grafton, WV. Since 1914, the United States has set aside the second Sunday in May to honor mothers. Anna Maria Reeves Jarvis, a remarkable woman who championed the cause of sanitation and family health throughout her entire life and whose establishment of Mother's Day Work Clubs kept bound the fragile ties of families and communities throughout the Civil War, was a heroine to her daughter, Anna M. Jarvis. Due to Anna M. Jarvis' efforts, she also serves as the source of a beautiful sentiment for all of us today. In honoring her mother's hope that a post-Civil War `Mothers' Friendship Day' might someday become an annual event commemorating the service that mothers render to humanity in every field, Anna M. Jarvis has provided each of us with an opportunity to remember and to delight in the love and support which our own mothers have offered to us. 
My own dear angel mother died when I was little less than a year old. She was a victim of the virulent Spanish influenza pandemic that swept the globe and swept the Nation in 1918, killing an estimated 20 million people around the world; 500,000 in this country alone. Her name was Ada Kirby Sale. In the one photograph which I have of her, gazing back at me is a blue-eyed, fair-complexioned, pretty young woman with a serious, yet sweet, expression on her face and a large bow of ribbon in her hair. How I wish that I had known her, even for one day! Even in her own distress, she thought of me, her youngest child, when she asked her sister-in-law and brother-in-law to raise me if she, my mother, did not recover from the flu. In those days they were stricken on one day and died the next. So, she asked my aunt and her husband to raise me if she, my mother, did not recover, while my father looked after my four older siblings. I had three brothers and one sister, and my father had 10 sisters and two brothers, so my father gave to various sisters my three brothers, and to Titus Dalton Byrd and my aunt, I was given. And my father kept my sister. I have always carried with me that remembrance of my mother's love for me, because she gave me two foster parents for the hard work of raising a child. 
I, therefore, was reared by my Aunt Vlurma and her husband, Titus Dalton Byrd. My name was not Byrd at that time, my name was Sale. My ancestor came from England in the year 1657, and was an indentured worker 7 years to pay for the trip across the waters. He ended up down along the Rappahannock River, in Virginia. So I am his ninth generation descendant. His name was James Sale. 
My foster mother and my natural mother were as different in appearance as two women can be. My aunt Vlurma was stocky, stockily built, olive-complexioned, and a laconic woman with dark-brown eyes. She was very religious. She did not make a big whoop-de-do about it. She was not of the religious right or the religious left. She just believed in the old-time religion. She was religious, straightforward in her dealings with people, and a good shot with a pistol. She was very good to me, though she never displayed much affection. I have no recollection of ever receiving a kiss from her. But I have many recollections of hearing her prayers as they wafted through the stillness of the night from the other room. Many times I have seen her on her knees, praying. It used to be, when I would leave Raleigh County, West Virginia, to return to Washington on a Sunday afternoon, having been back in my congressional district, she would say, `You be a good boy, Robert. I always pray for you.' 
So, she was a major influence in my life, and I thank her to this day for accepting responsibility for me out of affection and kinship with my mother, and for instilling in me strong values--strong values, a sense of duty, a sturdy work ethic, and an unshakable--unshakable faith in the Creator. 
How proud man, vain man has become. How arrogant, who has the audacity to say there is no God! I read, just a few days ago, about a poll that was taken among scientists--of all people, who should believe and who should realize that there is a Creator. And I noted that only 40 percent of those scientists, according to the poll, believed in a Creator. That was amazing. It was the same percentage as resulted from a similar poll among scientists in 1916. I took the occasion a few days ago to read from Darwin's `Origin of Species,' and to read where Darwin made reference to a Creator, made reference to God; and Darwin asked the question: Is it possible that the Creator may be so superior in intellect to the intellect of man as the human eye is superior 
to the man-made camera? Here was a scientist who did not deny the existence of a Creator. 
I ask doctors--when I go to the office of a physician, I say, `Doctor, do you believe that there is a Creator?' And I have yet to come across a doctor who has not answered without hesitation, `I do. I believe in a Creator.' I had one doctor less than a week ago talk with me in his office. I asked him the same question. And I sat, open-mouthed and open-eyed, listening to him talk about the audacity of men who would say there is no God. 
Raising a child is hard work. Even though the endeavor is leavened with joy, lightened with laugher, and sweetened with children's kisses, raising a child is a demanding job. Every mother who takes on the challenge and raises a responsible, caring individual, merits applause from all of us. 
Emerson said, `Men are what their mothers made them.' The mother figure is certainly the strongest influence over the character and development of a child in its early years. Motherhood is the most important of life's assignments. There is none other that will equal that. And the responsibility of motherhood is a particularly challenging endeavor, especially in today's world, where parenting responsibilities often have to be juggled with work responsibilities and housekeeping chores. 
I often stop to marvel at the many young mothers who work in my own office and in the various Senate offices and throughout the Government and the Nation. Poised, cool, and professional at work, one might never suspect that, after work, they must still dash to the day-care center, race home, feed husbands and children, spend quality time with the family, buy groceries, do the laundry, clean the house, and be back at the office the next morning to begin the cycle all over again. So, I take my hat off to all working mothers as we honor mothers this weekend. They maintain a heroic pace and the Nation owes them a debt that can never be paid. 
But, I also salute those women in our society who stick to the more traditional role of keeper of the home and the hearth, for theirs is a difficult job as well, and it is a job for which they receive no pay and little recognition in exchange for their priceless contribution to society. 
Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: `By and large, mothers and housewives are the only workers who do not have regular time off. They are the great vacationless class.' 
Sometimes it seems to me that the traditional stay-at-home mom is not as much appreciated today. I have always believed that a great deal of credit should go to those women who make the decision to work in the home. Theirs is the oldest profession in the history of the world: The home maker, the housewife. Managing a home and raising children are serious responsibilities, which, if well carried out, can make a significant contribution to the stability and well-being of our own country. 
I recall the story of a great painter, a great artist, Benjamin West, who went to his mother and showed her the little drawings of birds that he had made with pencil and crayon on pieces of paper. And then she took him and sat him gently on her knee and kissed him on the cheek and said, `You will grow up to be a great painter.' And Benjamin West attributed his greatness in that art as having originated with a mother's kiss. 
My own treasured wife, Erma, with whom I have been blessed to share the past 60 years--as of 2 weeks and 6 days from 
today--has devoted her life to caring for me and our household, our children and our grandchildren. With her capable hand in charge on the home front, I have had the luxury to devote myself to the duties of the Senate, free from any domestic worries. And it's a great luxury. I could not have put in the countless hours required by my office without her extreme patience and forbearance, understanding and good humor and support. Erma is the epitome of traditional family values, and my pride in the accomplishments of my daughters and their children is a clear reflection of the values and lessons that they learned from their mother and grandmother. 
While I was out campaigning in the early years, while I was out knocking on doors, driving over the hills and up the hollows and down the creeks campaigning, she was at home, my wife, with those two young daughters. It is one of the great sacrifices that I have made in public life, one that I can never retrieve--the time that I would like to have spent but didn't spend with my two daughters. But she, my wife, was there, at home and at the hearth with them. 
Family values and family structure have traditionally served as the strong backbone of the Nation, and we ought to stop and think about that, not just on Mother's Day, but every day. This strong backbone of our Nation has suffered from osteoporosis in recent years, but it is currently enjoying a resurgence of strength and appreciation because of a collective realization that most of society's ills are not a result of the success or failure of any Government program, but rather have their roots, as well as their solutions, in the most basic building blocks of our culture, like the quality of the home and the cohesion of the family. 
Society is a collection of individuals, each of which is shaped, first and foremost, in large part, by his or her own mother. The values that we all cherish, and on which society depends--like caring for others, respect for the law, tolerance, comity, perseverance, loyalty, dedication, patriotism, faith in God--are learned earliest and best from the examples set by our mothers. The woman who raised me didn't hold any doctorates, master's degree, baccalaureate degrees. I don't know that she ever went to school a day in her life, but she taught me how to live. And with that kind of teaching, one may stray from time to time throughout the years of one's life, but they will always come back--they will always come back. 
When I think of her, and I can say much about the man who was her husband, also--I will save that for another day--when I think of her stalwart faith in a supreme, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God, I think of something that made this a great country, and the same thing made the ancient Romans a great people. Theirs were pagan gods, but they believed in their gods. They venerated their ancestors. They honored their parents. The Bible says, `Honor thy father and thy mother.' When I think of the woman who took me to raise--I never knew any other mother--I think of one who was as unshakable in her faith as are the mountains of West Virginia, and she ingrained that faith in me. 
Churches and schools are important places of learning, but it is the constant encouragement and attitude of our mothers that instill in children the proper respect for church and school in the first place. We learn to pray at our mother's knee, and to read while sitting on her lap. 
In my view, we desperately need a serious bolstering of our national regard for the position of the family in our national life. One day we ought to take the people who do the TV programming that spews filth and violence and sex into the homes of America and shake them with legislation--and the day will come, I believe--that will teach those people that if they will not clean up their act, somebody else will do it for them. 
We need more Anna Maria Reeves Jarvises and more daughters like Anna M. Jarvis, who could so effectively mobilize a nation in honor of her own heroic mother and all mothers, and we should honor the role of mothers, not only this weekend, but every day. 
So this weekend, especially, let us recognize the role of motherhood, with all of the sentimentality and sweet remembrance that a day set aside for honoring unselfish love should invoke. Let us also realize that proper mothering is a tough job, with the future of our Nation riding, to a great extent, on the success of that endeavor, and let that realization guide us as we contemplate policies for an ailing society sorely in need of a strong dose of moral direction and support.  
Rock Me To Sleep 
Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight, 
Make me a child again just for tonight! 
Mother, come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again to your heart as of yore; 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair; 
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;-- 
Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep! 
Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love like mother-love ever has shone; 
No other worship abides and endures-- 
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours: 
None like a mother can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain. 
Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;-- 
Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep! 
Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue, 
Mother, O Mother, my heart calls for you! 
Many a summer the grass has grown green, 
Blossomed and faded, our faces between: 
Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain, 
Long I tonight for your presence again. 
Come from the silence so long and so deep;-- 
Rock me to sleep, Mother--rock me to sleep! 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] for his very illuminating remarks. He is the chairman of the committee in the Senate which would feel the brunt of the cuts that would ensue. He has stated them very eloquently. I hope that Senators will have been paying attention. 
Mr. President, my amendment would strike Title VII from the bill. This title contains what the proponents call the `Government Shutdown Prevention Act.' It might better be termed the `Congressional Responsibility Prevention Act' because, if its provisions were in effect for all of Fiscal Year 1998 for the thirteen regular appropriation bills, funding for all discretionary spending in Fiscal Year 1998 would be on automatic pilot. 
I offered this same amendment to strike Title VII of the bill in the committee markup of the bill, and it failed on a party-line vote of 13 yeas to 15 nays. As reported, Title VII would continue funding for any of the thirteen regular appropriation bills not enacted into law by October 1, 1997, at a rate of 98 percent of the 1997 levels for every program, project, and activity. That amounted to a cut in budget authority of some $35 billion below President Clinton's 1998 discretionary budget requests. Of that $35 billion cut, $10 billion resulted from the 2 percent reduction below 1997 levels. The remaining $25 billion in cuts would result from the fact the President's budget for Fiscal Year 1998 is $25 billion higher in budget authority than would be required under a freeze at the 1997 levels. 
During the debate on this issue last evening, after my remarks in relation to the provisions in Title VII as reported by the committee, Senators McCain and Hutchison urged me not to object to an amendment to which I ultimately agreed to which changed the percentage contained on page 81 of the bill from 98 percent to 100 percent. This means that Title VII as it now stands in the bill would provide an automatic CR for Fiscal Year 1998 for any of the thirteen appropriation bills not enacted into law by October 1, of this year, at a rate of 100 percent of 1997 levels. In other words, all programs, projects, and activities for the discretionary portion of the budget in Fiscal Year 1998 would be continued at a freeze level. 
In explaining their purpose for making this change last evening, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas expressed their view that this would pretty much alleviate the funding problems with the previous language. But, Mr. President, this is certainly not the case. 
Even at a freeze level, if put into effect for all of fiscal year 1998 for all 13 regular appropriations bills, title VII would result in cuts totaling more than $25 billion in budget authority below President Clinton's requests. So the devastation that would have occurred and about which I spoke at some length last evening, would still occur to a large extent, devastation to the programs and activities in the area of law enforcement, education, transportation and transportation safety, health and human services programs, such as WIC, LIHEAP, Head Start, and so forth. In total, cuts to these and other programs throughout the Federal Government would, as I have said, equal more than $25 billion if title VII were in effect for the full year for all 13 appropriations bills. 
Now, it never ceases to amaze me that so much time and effort are put into proposals such as this, trying to find ways to get around the responsibilities of the executive and legislative branches for making certain that the power of the purse--the power of the purse--is used very carefully and thoughtfully in every respect for every dollar of spending that we provide each year. If we focused the energy that we spend on issues such as this toward redoubling our efforts in passing budget resolutions and reconciliation bills on time, thereby enabling the 13 appropriations bills to proceed on time, we would not have as much difficulty in enacting appropriations bills, and, in so doing, we would greatly lessen the possibility of a Government shutdown. 
No one in this body supports Government shutdowns. But what this proposal would do is ensure that when the going gets tough and the issues involved in deciding the funding levels for every activity of the Government get too tough, Congress is likely to just yield to the mindless, automatic mechanism provided in title VII and thereby simply continue all programs, all projects, all activities--whether justified or not--at some arbitrary, fixed level. Even though its proponents call it a `failsafe mechanism,' it is really foolhardy. 
Furthermore, it should be obvious to everyone that this is some type of political ploy, else the attempt would not be made to attach it to a bill that the President, naturally, would find very difficult to veto. 
In fact, if one can believe what one reads in the press--and I don't believe everything I read in the press--the reasons for this proposal are set out rather starkly in an article which appeared in the April 18, 1997, issue of a publication called Inside the New Congress. That publication discusses this so-called `automatic CR' provision under a heading entitled `Automatic PR'--not automatic CR, but automatic PR. That article states the following about this proposal: 
The automatic CR proposal, crafted by Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and John McCain, with the blessing of GOP leaders, would fund discretionary programs at 98 percent FY 1997 levels in the event that a budget deal isn't agreed upon by September 30. More simply stated, the McCain-Hutchison bill would force Clinton to either compromise with Hill Republicans on a fiscal year 1998 budget or stomach mandatory cuts of 2 percent. 
I am still quoting from the article:  
`This is 100 percent politics,' says the Senate GOP aide close to the issue. `It's payback to the Democrats for the public relations war' [in 1995 and 1996 over the Government Shutdown]. 
Anticipating certain opposition from Clinton and Congressional Democrats, Gingrich and Lott apparently have convinced appropriators to tuck the automatic CR bill inside the popular $4 billion emergency spending package for disaster relief and the troops in Bosnia. By doing so, [the article goes on] Republicans will force Clinton and Hill Democrats to jeopardize much-needed funds for `the troops and for poor flood victims' to kill a `simple measure that protects citizens from a Government shutdown,' says the House leadership advisor. 
And according to McCain [still reading from the article] the GOP will dare Daschle and Democrats to filibuster the legislation by attaching the automatic CR as a floor amendment, even though Lott is uncertain if he has 60 votes to limit debate. `I'd love to debate them on this,' McCain said with an insidious smile, [still reading from the article] `We will win the PR war this time.' 
So there you have it, Mr. President. According to this article, we have in this bill a proposal that is `100 percent politics,' according to a Senate GOP aide. `It's payback to the Democrats for the public relations war in 1995 and 1996 over the Government shutdown.' 
Why, Mr. President, have its authors chosen this particular bill to include this political payback proposal? Because, as intimated in the article I have just quoted, this is a very difficult bill to hold up. It contains billions of dollars that 
are desperately needed across the Nation to aid hundreds of communities and hundreds of thousands of our citizens who have been devastated by natural disasters. It contains almost $2 billion to support our men and women overseas in Bosnia and elsewhere, who are there doing their duty. They didn't ask to go. They are there doing their duty for our country. 
So it becomes very difficult to try to fend off proposals such as this which sound good and which make good PR, but which are, in reality, fatally flawed, cynical exercises. This particular proposal does not deserve to be enacted into law. It calls for a mindless exercise in setting spending levels for 1998. No further action will be required on the budget resolution. There will be no need to hold any more hearings on the 1998 budget. We will not have to spend the time of the Appropriations Committees in going over the justifications for each of the thousands of programs, projects, or activities for which funds are requested for 1998. 
In fact, once this measure becomes law, we will not need the Appropriations Committees at all. We can simply set each year's spending at a percentage of the 1997 rate for the entire Federal Government and let it go at that. There will be no hearings and there need be no hearings, may I say to my friend from Mississippi, who is on the Appropriations Committee. There would need to be no markups and no time spent by the Senate debating spending levels on the 13 regular appropriations bills. It could work that way. Is that where we want to go? 
Never mind the fact that some programs should be eliminated. Just keep them going at last year's level anyway. And what about programs which must have increases in 1998 for reasons beyond anyone's control--such as veterans' medical care? If we fund that program on automatic pilot at the 1997 level, we will have to drop medical care to 140,000 eligible veterans in 1998. Is that what we ought to do? 
I am sure the authors of the proposal will tell us that they have no desire to cut veterans' medical care. They simply want to avoid shutting down the Government if Congress reaches an impasse on the VA-HUD bill for 1998. But, Mr. President, what they will not recognize is how difficult it is to enact bills such as the VA-HUD bill, even without the disincentive to do so provided by this proposal. If this language is in place, when the going gets tough, there will be less desire to successfully negotiate very difficult issues between the Houses of Congress and with the administration. I am convinced that, notwithstanding the best efforts of all parties, negotiations are much more likely to fail because of this so-called `failsafe' proposal. Then, when we do, in fact, fail to enact the VA-HUD bill, the veterans' medical care cut I described earlier will happen. Furthermore, this same result will occur over and over again throughout the Federal Government. 
Having said that, I do not necessarily believe that Congress will fail to enact the 1998 Department of Defense appropriations bill. That bill will make it. It is probably more likely that the DOD bill will be enacted without cuts. Perhaps one or two other bills will be enacted--possibly the legislative branch will get through so Congress itself will not have to take a 2 percent cut, and maybe the District of Columbia bill, and perhaps the military construction bill. 
But I believe it would be highly likely that, if this proposal is enacted, we will never complete action on the bills where the President has asked for major increases. In other 
words, if we enact this proposal, we will have abdicated our responsibility to thoroughly review and justify the taxpayers' money that we are spending each fiscal year. 
I say to my colleagues that this is the wrong time and the wrong place for such a device. There is no need to put a continuing resolution of this sort in place before we have even written one line of one appropriations bill and before we have even passed a budget resolution. We could consider this measure on its own at a later time. That is what we ought to do, although I would certainly oppose it then. But we could do that without so drastically encumbering an emergency disaster bill. 
Are we not just making absolutely sure that this important funding will be delayed? Certainly, that will be the result of our actions here today, unless we strike this language from the bill. The President has told me personally, by telephone, that he will indeed veto this supplemental bill if it contains this automatic CR language. 
Hundreds of thousands of Americans are suffering and are in need of this assistance. They do not deserve to have their needs shackled to a rather obvious attempt to rig the budget and appropriations process for fiscal year 1998 in favor of those in this body who would like to see across-the-board budget cuts to pay for very large tax breaks for the privileged few in our society. 
But, Mr. President, without disparaging the good intentions of the authors of the language, this is, at best, a cynical measure and, at worst, it is playing games with the lives of real people who are in trouble and who are entitled to expeditious assistance in their hour of need. 
Not only does this proposal show a callous disregard for the appropriations process and for the Appropriations Committees, but it also demonstrates an insensitive, indifferent, and unsympathetic attitude toward the suffering of the people of 33 States that stand in need of water and sewer facilities and roads and other infrastructure that have been destroyed by the raging waters of great rivers. This is playing politics on a bill that will help people who have lost their homes, their cars, their trucks, their farm machinery, their livestock, their furniture--everything that they have worked and skimped and saved for, in many instances, throughout a lifetime. 
It is politics at its worst and everyone knows that it is politics at its worst. The people in these 33 States need help. They need it as soon as they can get it. They need it now. They needed it yesterday. They needed it a week ago. And it is grossly unfair to them to use this instrument of disaster relief as a vehicle for political gain. It is cynical, and it is cruel. 
I am not an advocate of the Presidential veto. I am certainly not an advocate of the line-item veto. I am not an advocate, in many cases, of a constitutional veto that the President has had for these 208 years. But I believe that, in this instance, the President would be derelict in his duty if he did not use that constitutional weapon. And I so said to the President when I discussed this matter with him. I said that I felt that he would be derelict in his duty if he did not strike down this bill if it reaches his desk carrying this ill-conceived, ill-begotten, and ill-advised proposal. I can well say with Macduff: `Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.' 
This is politics run amuck. 
So I have an amendment that is now before the Senate which will strike from the bill the provisions which I have discussed. 
Before I yield the floor, I shall read a letter, or portions of a letter, that I received today from the Executive Office of the President, the Office of Management and Budget. 
I will read it into the Record.  
Dear Senator Byrd: 
As the Senate continues consideration of S. 672, a bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters, and for overseas peacekeeping efforts, we ask that you consider the administration's views on the pending amendment concerning the automatic continuing resolution. 
Prior to markup of the bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee the President indicated that he would veto the bill if it were presented to him with the automatic continuing resolution language contained in S. 547. His reasons follow: 
First and foremost, this bill contains $5.6 billion in urgently needed disaster assistance funds for hundreds of thousands of victims of recent natural disasters in 33 States, and this assistance should not be delayed while the Congress and the President consider a budget process issue. 
Secondly, the McCain-Hutchinson automatic continuing resolution would not provide requested funding for essential investments in education, the environment, for research and technology, and for fighting crime. It would also reduce funding below the request for critical core Government services resulting in reduced hiring of air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents, and Social Security disability claims processing personnel. It would also result in reductions in the numbers of women and infants served by the WIC program, the number of veterans receiving medical care services, and the number of kids in the Head Start program. The Federal Crop Insurance Program would be terminated. 
Finally, such a continuing resolution is premature, and prejudices the outcome of the bipartisan budget agreement. 
Our recent agreement calls for the regular order, implementing the agreement through reconciliation, tax and appropriations measures. By enacting a continuing resolution at levels significantly below the level in the agreement it would allow one House--or, in the case of the Senate, a minority in one House--to essentially veto an appropriations bill by inaction. 
The amendment adopted last night to provide for an automatic continuing resolution at 100 percent of the FY '97 enactment level does nothing to respond to these concerns. Even with the amendment adopted last night, the automatic continuing resolution provides resources over $20 billion below the President's request, and significantly below the level contained in the bipartisan budget agreement. 
If the bill were presented to the President containing the automatic continuing resolution now pending in the Senate, the President would veto the bill. 
We urge the Senate to strike the provision from the bill, and as the bill moves through the process we urge the Congress to remove other extraneous provisions from the bill so that the President can sign the legislation making available essential relief to the victims of the recent disaster, and providing resources for our overseas peacekeeping efforts: 
Franklin D. Raines, Director.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we close the debate on my amendment, I pause first to thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska for his generosity, for his courtesy, which he has accorded us on this side of the aisle and on this side of the question. He could very well have made a motion to table at any point and, therefore, shut off debate on the amendment. He probably has the votes, if we look at the Appropriations Committee vote a few days ago when we saw a straight party-line response to my efforts to strike out the language during the markup. He probably has the votes. 
So he could very well have moved to table, and could have tabled my amendment. So I thank him for his consideration in that respect. I think it is good for the Senate to have the debate on this matter. I found him to be, many years ago, not only a fine Senator but a gentleman. 
Mr. President, I also wish to express my respect to Mr. McCain, who is a genuine American hero. I respect him as one who has suffered not hours nor days nor weeks nor months but years. I take my hat off to him in that regard. 
What I say about the amendment and my motion to strike language is not said in derogation of the Senator, nor any particular Senator, for that matter. I am addressing my remarks in the main to my amendment and to the language that my amendment seeks to strike from the bill. 
We have heard much said, Mr. President, about this being an effort to avoid a manmade disaster. It has been said that the bill addresses a natural disaster. But that the language, which is supported by the other side in the main, and particularly by Senators McCain and Hutchison, is to avert a manmade disaster. 
Mr. President, let us reflect a little with respect to that so-called manmade disaster. Who caused that? 
I am against shutdowns in the Government. I had no part in bringing about that shutdown of late 1995 which continued into early 1996. 
I say to my friends, I have only to point to the words of a distinguished Member of the other body. I do not know whether Senators are all aware of the fact that we are not supposed to refer to a Member of the other body by name, and so I will not do that. I have heard that done. It should not have been done. And I have noted in the past that the House leadership has been very circumspect about calling to the attention of House Members the rule against their making mention of a Senator by name in floor debate. So I do not make mention of a House Member by name, but I call attention to some statements that were made by a very prominent House Member and one which was repeated in the Washington Post on September 22, 1995. This is what that very prominent House Member had to say with respect to manmade disasters, shutting down the Government, and I quote: 
I don't care what the price is. I don't care if we have no executive offices and no bonds for 30 days--not this time. 
So that is what a very well-known Member of the other body had to say about manmade disasters. He did not care. 
And then I refer to a quotation from the same prominent, very distinguished Member of the other body, a quotation that appeared in Time magazine of June 5, 1995, when that same Member, in referring to `manmade disasters,' said: 
He can run the parts-- 
He, meaning the President-- 
He can run the parts of the Government that are left [after the Republican budget cuts] or he can run no Government. . . . Which of the two of us do you think worries more about Government not showing up? 
Now, I could quote from the same individual additional instances, but so much for manmade disasters. This was a collective mistake that was made by the other party in 1995 and 1996. It was a collective mistake, and the so-called manmade disaster was the result of that collective mistake, which was a very definite strategy. That was the strategy. That was the Damocles sword that would be held over the Congress and over the President's head. And so the joint leadership of the Republican party sought to carry out those threats, and they got their fingers burned. They made the threats. They carried out the threats. And as a result there was the so-called manmade disaster. They got their fingers burned. Now they dread the fire. 
It was not the President's strategy. That was the strategy of the Republican leadership of the Congress. Perhaps that is now conveniently forgotten, but it does not take a slip of the memory as long as Rip van Winkle's slip of memory to remind oneself of how that so-called manmade disaster was strategized and implemented by the Republican Party in Congress. 
Rip van Winkle, as we all remember from our early studies--and as far as I myself am concerned, I read about it in Irving's `Sketch Book' back in a two-room schoolhouse in southern West Virginia--was a very amiable, idle, bibulous Dutch settler who had a termagant wife and who, while hunting in the Catskill Mountains, met up with the spirits of Hendrick Hudson and some of his companions who were playing ninepins and drinking schnapps. After taking a few drinks of that liquor with Hudson and his companions, our friend Rip van Winkle went to sleep and slept for 20 years. And when he awakened, he thought he had just taken a short nap. He went home. His wife had been dead, himself forgotten, his friends had died or were scattered, and the colonies had become the United States of America. 
Well, it seems to me that some of our friends have been asleep less than 20 years and perhaps no more than 1 or 1 1/2 years, but they seem to have forgotten whose strategy it was that brought on the manmade disaster which they now deplore. It was not mine. It was theirs. They got their fingers burned. 
Now, under the cloak of hoping to avoid another manmade disaster, they come with this language in the bill I am seeking to strike. 
Mr. President, I shall sum up the arguments that I make against the language. But before I do, there has been a good bit said with respect to the continuing `flow of funds,' to use their words, that will go to the people who are suffering as a result of the natural disasters, and it is said that delaying this appropriations bill will not delay succor and comfort and relief to those poor people who have gone through this travail in the instances to which we refer. 
I have here a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget which says that `the resulting delay from the automatic continuing resolution will impede the disaster response effort.' And I read extracts from that memorandum.  
While several Federal agencies that provide immediate relief to disaster victims (FEMA, SBA, and the Corps of Engineers) have resources available and are providing immediate assistance to disaster victims, many long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts cannot proceed until the Disaster Supplemental is signed into law. In addition, some immediate assistance will be jeopardized by delay. 
Unlike other Federal agencies such as FEMA, HUD does not currently have funds available to dedicate to the disaster recovery efforts. Any delay-- 
I repeat, `any delay-- in enacting the disaster supplemental would impede HUD's efforts to provide disaster recovery assistance. The delay would increase the uncertainty over the amount of assistance that will ultimately be provided and thus compound the difficulty in planning for disaster recovery. Affected communities would experience a comparable delay in receiving funding. 
With respect to the Department of Agriculture and the emergency conservation program, I quote from the memorandum. 
No funds remain in the program to restore farmlands to production after natural disasters. A list of eligible recipients is being developed, but no one is receiving assistance. The delay in funding means that farmland remains vulnerable to future floods (spring thaw) and less ready to be planted to cropland this year. Cropland will not be leveled, debris will not be removed from fields, pasture remains unfenced, and conservation structures remain in disrepair. As a result, the damages to farmers increase, as the planting delay reduces their farm income (later planning results in lower yields per acre). 
Now, as to watershed and flood prevention, I quote again from the memorandum by the Office of Management and Budget. 
No funds remain for new projects. 
I am talking about watershed and flood prevention. 
No funds remain for new projects, all funding has been committed to addressing earlier natural disasters. USDA offices are accepting applications from local sponsors, assessing damages, and making determinations. A list is being developed, but no one-- 
No one-- is receiving assistance. The effect of the delay is to increase the likelihood of increased damages from flooding later this year as areas are left vulnerable: streams can overflow because they remain constricted from debris that has not been removed, threatening roads and bridges with wash-out. Other infrastructure and property can end up destroyed by the failure to repair damaged levees. Also, the opportunity for non-structural measures, like the purchase of floodplain easements from willing sellers, decreases with the delay in supplemental funding because landowners need to decide now whether to crop this year or wait for the possibility of an easement buyout. 
As to emergency loans under the Farm Service Agency, here is what the memorandum says. 
Existing appropriations for these loans will be depleted by mid- to late May. Any delay in the supplemental beyond this time frame will cause farmers to wait emergency loan assistance to offset economic losses from natural disasters. This loss of credit will reduce their ability to repair farm structures and purchase inputs for spring crop planting. 
And so, Mr. President, here is a memo which I quote for the Record which clearly indicates that delay in action on this bill will spell delay for the people who are seeking relief from those terrible disasters. This bill will have some impact on West Virginia. West Virginia suffered during this time from floods. And for 40 years, Mr. President, 40 years I have been in Congress working to support the building of flood prevention structures, working in support of appropriations to provide relief in the wake of floods. 
It was 40 years ago this year, while I was in the House of Representatives, that I introduced legislation to provide for the construction of a reservoir to give future protection from floods along the Guyandotte River, which had just flooded in that instance, in 1957, the cities of Logan and Stollings and other communities along the river. 
So, I have seen the Guyandotte, I have seen the Cheat, I have seen the Greenbrier, I have seen the Tug Fork, and these other mighty rivers in West Virginia flood and take lives, destroy property, and cause hundreds and thousands of people to flee from their homes. Yet, because of their love for their roots, their love for their home State, they have gone right back in after the floods and they have hosed out the mud and the muck and sought to continue life again, as it were. 
So I know something about the suffering and losses of people and, as I say, the loss of life that comes from disasters of this kind. We had the Buffalo Creek flood disaster. West Virginia has had more of its share of disasters. So my heart goes out to the people of North Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota and the other States, as well as my own State, but not to the degree that those States have suffered in this particular instance. My heart goes out to them. I think we ought to enact this measure. I hope we will strike from the bill this language, and I am sorry that my hopes at this moment are probably not well founded. 
But, in any event, we have it clear from the President that he will veto this bill if it comes to his desk with the language in it that I sought to strike during the markup at the Appropriations Committee and which still remains in the bill, though slightly changed from 98 to 100 percent, which is a freeze. But it would still amount to reductions of $20 billion to $25 billion, or possibly even more if this language goes into effect. So, while there may be a slackening, from the standpoint of raising the figure from 98 percent to 100 percent, which makes it a freeze, which would continue it as a freeze, the President's requests that were included in his budget are in jeopardy. 
Mr. President, I hope Senators will support my motion to strike. Does the Senator plan to move to table my motion?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. May I assure the distinguished manager that I will not detain the Senate very much longer. 
Let me, in summation, state that the language that is in the bill, authored by Mr. McCain and Senator Hutchison and others, means in a practical sense that if we fail to pass an appropriation bill, all of the programs contained in that bill will receive a cut, because they will remain at a freeze; in other words, no increase over inflation. But it will be a hard freeze. This means education programs, law enforcement programs, immigration programs, transportation programs, agriculture programs and so on. 
Second, we will have lost most all of our negotiating strength with regard to fiscal year 1998 appropriations issues because all that the other side has to do is just pass the bills they want to pass and find some reason not to pass others, like the labor and health appropriations bill, and they will automatically keep those programs on a freeze level. I feel reasonably sure, also, that domestic discretionary programs are the ones that will end up feeling the automatic budget axe. 
Moreover, any leverage that the White House thinks they may have in the budget talks will turn to quicksilver, because when the rubber hits the road in these appropriations bills, any hard-won victories by the administration can easily vanish just by the tactic of bogging down certain bills. 
Fourthly, if we go down this road once we can be sure that we will go down it again next year. Slowly, slowly, we may be reducing the baseline for these programs by continuing on a freeze level and perhaps it could go below a freeze the next time around. So, we are talking about a real loss of buying power. If inflation should rise, we would be in a real hole. 
Fifthly, we will be funding programs that may need serious cutting and should not be kept on the level of a freeze. If Congress exercises its oversight--and oversight is really exercised for the main part in connection with appropriations bills, appropriations hearings and so on--we will be continuing programs that perhaps ought to be reduced. Some ought to be eliminated. But under this language that I am seeking to strike, there would not be any reduction, and they would continue at a freeze level. Furthermore, because we are already so late with the budget resolution, appropriators are now behind the eight ball in getting started with our bills this year. So it is particularly easy for the other side to make sure that several appropriations bills bog down and then we get this automatic CR in place for bills which they may not like. 
So, Mr. President, in short, this new gimmick would quite likely change the dynamic of the way we traditionally fund programs, this year and in the coming years. I hope it will not be successful. It is clearly a futile effort in the face of the President's threat to veto the bill if the language remains in it. And, to that extent, it constitutes a delay in the delivery of relief to the people who need that relief. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record at this point the memorandum by the Office of Management and Budget to which I have referred and from which I have already quoted excerpts.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are told by the Congressional Budget Office that this amendment would require cuts in all nondefense discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 1997 throughout the Federal Government of approximately 5 percent of remaining unobligated balances. Apparently the purpose of the Senator's amendment is to fully offset not only the budget authority, which the committee itself did, but the outlays that will result from these emergency disaster assistance appropriations as well. 
As I stated in my initial remarks when the Senate took up this measure, I do not agree on principle that emergency assistance to provide relief to those affected by natural disasters should have to be offset in any way. It was for this reason that at the budget summit in 1990, I strongly recommended, and that Act included, a section specifically exempting emergencies from the need for offsets. That section of the Act has worked very well and has not been abused, in my judgment, since its enactment. 
The suffering of hundreds of thousands of people in hundreds of communities throughout the Nation are awaiting the financial resources that will be made available to them upon the enactment of this legislation. We should provide that relief to them pursuant to the emergency section of the Budget Enforcement Act and thereby not require offsets of this emergency spending. Even though in this instance the committee has recommended full budget authority offsets for these emergency appropriations, that should not be a requirement for making disaster assistance appropriations. We cannot determine the time of year, the severity, or the number of natural disasters or their resulting costs, so we should not tie ourselves to any requirement that offsets should be provided for emergency disaster assistance appropriations. 
The effect of the pending amendment would be to indiscriminately cut every program throughout the nondefense discretionary portion of the budget, regardless of the ability of any particular program to absorb the anticipated 5 percent reduction required by the amendment--for example, the FBI, the Justice Department, the Judiciary, all other law enforcement agencies, the border patrol, the INS, the administrative costs of programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid will be affected. It is clear that many agencies could not absorb these cuts this late in the fiscal year without severely impacting their ability to carry out the essential services that they provide to the Nation.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be brief. This is the first appropriations bill that Senator Stevens has managed since he assumed the chairmanship of the committee. On behalf of all Senators, I want to congratulate him on the skill and expertise which he has demonstrated in the handling of this bill. It is a complex and difficult bill. It is an exceedingly important bill. Although I shall vote against it for other reasons, I feel it incumbent upon me, especially, to call attention to his excellent management of this bill. I would have expected that out of him, as I have watched him over the years. He is an outstanding member of the Appropriations Committee and takes his responsibilities very seriously there. As always, he is so gentlemanly and considerate of the needs of other Senators with respect to their representations of their respective States. I thank him for his dedication and, once again, I salute him and congratulate him on the fine example he has shown. It is an example which I hope we all will attempt to emulate.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, American involvement and interests in the Caspian Sea Region, have been increasing recently. While this region is new on the political map of American policy-makers, in that the newly-sovereign nations there were formerly Republics under the rule of the Soviet Union, they represent very substantial new opportunities for the United States. 
From the point of view of energy reserves, the tremendous hydrocarbon resources which are available for development in the region are of world-class potential. The extent of the resources which apparently exist, particularly in Kazakstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan could well serve as a long-term alternative to Western dependence on vulnerable supplies of Persian gulf oil. The proper development of the energy resources of the Caspian Sea region should also provide an invaluable impetus to the economic development of all the nations of the region. As a result of this growing potential, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY 1997 included a provision that I proposed for the Administration to develop a plan of action for the United States government to assist and accelerate the earliest possible development and shipment of oil from the Caspian Sea region to the United States and other Western markets. 
Mr. President, the Secretary of State has forwarded to the Congress, on April 15, 1997, the study which was required by the Appropriations Committee, and I am pleased to include the Summary, as well as recommended legislative and executive actions proposed by the report. It is a good report and should be of assistance to the Congress as it deliberates how to provide incentives for the United States to help promote the development of this new source of Western energy supplies, and to promote the future stability of the nations of the Caspian region, which is so necessary in order that our companies can operate effectively with the governments of those nations in developing these energy resources. 
Mr. President, the full report is available from the Department of State, which originated it. I would, however, like to point out that the interagency group which developed the recommendations puts great emphasis on the need for the Congress to review the prohibition on direct bilateral assistance to Azerbaijan which is contained in Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. The report indicates that Section 907 has the effect of limiting the influence of the United States in Azerbaijan, including the ability of the United States government to `provide financial support, such as risk insurance and grants for pipeline studies, to companies that are involved with the Azerbaijani government,' thereby giving advantage to other governments who have no such limitations placed on their 
ability to assist their companies in the competition for access and opportunities in Azerbaijan. Revisiting the necessity of retaining, revising, or eliminating Section 907, would allow our institutions, such as the Trade and Development Agency, the Department of Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, to assist U.S. companies to compete against foreign corporations, which presently enjoy the support of their own governments in the competition for business and opportunities in Azerbaijan. The report also encourages high-level political and business visits to and from the region, and in this regard I would encourage the President to invite the President of Azerbaijan, Mr. Heydar Aliyev, to make an official visit to Washington. Furthermore, the report encourages the United States to continue to play a mediation role among the countries of the Caspian region, when they are involved in disputes. This is particularly important today with regard to the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has inhibited joint development of energy and other projects, and has caused the dislocation and suffering of up to a million refugees in the region. As the report concludes, from a U.S. policy standpoint, `Caspian energy development is not a zero sum game--all can benefit from the region's rapid economic development, including Russia.' 
Mr. President, the Senate will soon be taking up the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Revisions of the Flank Agreement. I find it disturbing that some of the governments most directly affected by this agreement, particularly the governments of Georgia, the Ukraine, and Azerbaijan have refused to sign the agreement. I have received a letter from the ambassador from Azerbaijan on May 5, 1997, Mr. Hafiz Pashayev, in which he expresses his concern over what he describes as an imbalance of forces in the flank area, which includes his country, and says that the agreement poses a security concern for Azerbaijan. In this regard, he points out that there are credible reports of the provision of massive Russian arms shipments to Armenia, which could well have the effect of further destabilizing the situation in the caucasus. It is important to note that the chairman of the Defense Committee of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, Mr. Lev Rokhlin, is reported, by Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya gazeta, to have revealed that elements of the Russian government or armed forces, from 1993-96, shipped some $1 billion in arms to Armenia, including 32 R-17's, or Scud missiles and associated launchers, 82 T-72 tanks, 50 armored combat vehicles, various howitzers, grenade launchers, and other missiles and armaments. This, of course, has alarmed American oil companies located within range of these missiles in Azerbaijan, and the ambassador says in his letter that there is concern in his country that these military shipments have caused an imbalance in forces in the so-called `flank' area, and pose a `security concern for Azerbaijan.' 
The Russian Government, or elements of it, appears to have used its armed forces in recent years in Georgia, in Azerbaijan, 
certainly in Chechnya, and perhaps other states in the region to exert influence and pressure on those governments. I note that Russia has maintained military bases in both Georgia and Armenia, and I have been informed that Russian officials have brought pressure on the government of Azerbaijan to allow Russian forces to establish a base in that nation. The government of Azerbaijan has, wisely I believe, resisted these pressures and retains its sovereignty without the presence of Russian forces on its soil. Administration officials testified last week, on April 29, 1997, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in connection with the CFE Flank agreement, and have pointed out that it is the policy of the United States not to support the stationing of foreign troops such as Russian forces on the territory of any other states unless that is achieved by means of free negotiations and with full respect for the sovereignty of the states involved. We need to be careful that we do not in any way appear to countenance the imposition of Russian forces or equipment on any nation through heavy-handed tactics, tactics which might push the states of the Caspian region into positions that they would not otherwise freely assent to. Thus, it is certainly of legitimate concern that key states of the Caspian region have not agreed to the terms of the terms of the revisions of the CFE Treaty. This is a matter which I am sure the knowledgeable Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee will be discussing when that Treaty comes to the Senate floor for consideration, and I look forward to that discussion.

The funds provided are to address the most critical health and safety and emergency response needs associated with the disasters. If the additional emergency appropriations are not sufficient to address all requests from all tribes, the Bureau of Indian Affairs will have to prioritize the requests, but they are encouraged to consider the particular needs in South Dakota.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the very last sections of this bill, title VII, beginning on page 81, line 1, through page 85, line 9, contains language which its proponents call the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. I believe it could be more aptly dubbed the Adequate Oversight Prevention Act. During a committee markup of this emergency disaster assistance bill, after considerable debate, my motion to strike this proposal was defeated by a party line vote of 13 yeas to 15 nays. 
The language of title VII is the same language as is contained in S. 47, which was introduced some weeks ago by Senators McCain, Hutchison, Stevens, and others. The provisions provide that if any of the 13 regular appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998 do not become law prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, there will be an automatic appropriation for each such program, project or activity contained in that bill at the arbitrary rate of 98 percent of the funding that was provided for the program, project or activity in the corresponding regular appropriations act for fiscal year 1997. This level of funding would continue for each appropriation bill for the entirety of fiscal year 1998, unless another continuing resolution or a separate appropriation bill is enacted into law to replace it. 
If these provisions were in effect for the entire fiscal year for all 13 regular appropriations bills, the effect could be cuts totaling $35 billion, or 7 percent below President Clinton's discretionary budget request. This level of cuts would cause severe devastation to worthy national efforts in law enforcement, education, transportation and transportation safety, Health and Human Services, and a host of other programs throughout the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, I am especially concerned about the impact that this so-called Government Shutdown Prevention Act would have on our law enforcement agencies and the Federal courts. For these agencies, this proposal would, in fact, be a shutdown bill. It would itself be a severe setback in the war on crime and illegal narcotics. We finally have seen positive results from our efforts to bolster the Justice and Treasury Departments and our anticrime programs. The Bureau of Justice Statistics' most recent crime reports show that we are finally turning the corner on violent crime in America. They report a decline of 12.8 percent in violent crime--rape, robbery and assault. There is far too much crime in America. But we are starting to win the war, we hope. We should be enhancing our efforts, as the President's budget proposes. Instead, this shutdown proposal would hurt our law enforcement agencies, our men and women in uniform, as much as any terrorist or Mexican drug cartel or gang or organized crime figure could hope to. It would cause an about-face and undercut Federal law enforcement right in the midst of battle. 
Let us look briefly at what this shutdown proposal would mean to specific Federal law enforcement agencies. These are conservative estimates that were supplied by the agencies themselves. 
This proposal would cut the Federal Bureau of Investigation by $261 million below the President's budget request. It would eliminate at least 2,281 positions, including 965 FBI agents and 1,316 support staff. Reductions would include 199 agents that investigate domestic terrorism and 175 agents that develop capabilities to counter the threat from chemical, biological, and nuclear materials. We have been adding positions to the FBI to deal with terrorist acts like the bombings in Oklahoma City and at the Atlanta Olympics. This would reverse the gains that we have made in mobilizing a Federal response to domestic and international terrorism. 
Funding would not be available to complete the new FBI laboratory at Quantico, VA. We are all concerned with reports of problems in the operations of the current laboratory at headquarters. The FBI must have state-of-the-art facilities and continue to be the world's premier law enforcement forensic laboratory. We need to complete this $130 million laboratory, which is so important to Federal, State and local law enforcement. 
Funding would not be available to continue the telephone carrier compliance effort called for under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act. All Senators know just how rapidly the telecommunications industry is changing. Telephones are now portable, and they are adopting digital technologies. Without funding for retrofitting telephone switches, we will be unable to conduct court-ordered wiretaps of drug dealers and organized crime and national security threats. This shutdown proposal would cut the Drug Enforcement Administration by $106 million. It would require the DEA to absorb $36 million in must-pay bills for cost-of-living adjustments, inflation and contract costs. It would force DEA to stop hiring agents, and we would not be able to provide for the 168 new special agents that are proposed in the President's budget. 
DEA would have to cut back, rather than increase, its efforts to combat methamphetamine, or `meth,' as it is known, and drug trafficking in cocaine and heroin by the Colombian and 
Mexican cartels. DEA estimates that this bill would require a reduction in force of up to 263 special agents. It would stop dead in the water DEA's efforts to expand mobile enforcement teams that sweep through rural communities to weed out drug dealers. And it would severely set back our efforts to combat illegal narcotics on the southwest border, in Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona. 
This shutdown proposal would strike a blow against our efforts to make American borders secure against illegal immigration and drug smuggling. It would devastate the Customs Service and the Department of the Treasury and the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the Department of Justice. The proposal would cut $64 million and 201 agents from the U.S. Customs Service. It would result in reductions in antismuggling and drug-interdiction efforts, efforts that are important in keeping American borders safe and secure. 
But reductions in staffing are only one component of keeping the borders secure. The reduction would also delay acquisition of high-energy detection systems and eliminate funding for border passenger processing systems. These systems identify attempts to smuggle illegal chemicals, refrigerants, and illegal aliens across the border. The reduction would also delay funding for the automated targeting system, which increases Customs' capability to conduct intensive border inspection. 
This proposal would destroy the progress that we have made in building up the capability of the Border Patrol and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. These efforts really started with hearings on illegal immigration that I held in 1994 when I served as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The INS advises that this bill would require the reduction of $385 million and would severely impact major enforcement programs such as detention and deportation, investigations, work site enforcement, and the apprehension of illegal aliens. This bill would stop dead in their tracks our efforts to build up the Border Patrol by 1,000 agents per year. We just reaffirmed this commitment in last year's immigration bill. The Border Patrol and INS advise that if they have to operate at 2 percent below current levels during fiscal year 1998, they will have to eliminate at least 1,671 personnel that were added just this year. 
One of the real success stories in Federal law enforcement has been our Bureau of Prisons. We are putting away more criminals under lock and key and keeping them away from the public for longer periods. I fear that this shutdown bill would reverse this progress. The prison system advises us that this bill would require a reduction of $119 million from the President's budget request. They would be unable to activate a new medium security prison in Beaumont, TX. There would be no funds for the annualization costs of six new prisons scheduled for activation this year, resulting in the loss of more than 7,300 beds. We have been funding new construction. Now we need to have the money to staff and operate these institutions. Overcrowding would increase to 23 percent for the overall Federal prison system, rather than the planned goal of 12 percent for fiscal year 1998. Of course, we have learned that overcrowding is unsafe and often leads to institutional disturbances. Mr. President, we should not and we must not risk the safety of our dedicated correctional officers who serve in the Federal prisons throughout this country. 
This shutdown proposal would require the reduction of $110 million and at least 280 personnel at the U.S. attorney offices across the country. This would impact our ability to prosecute violent criminals and criminal aliens. In case after case, from the current Oklahoma City bombing case in Denver to the World Trade Center bombing case, we turn to dedicated assistant U.S. attorneys to represent the people of the United States. All our investigations by the FBI, DEA and other agencies will come to naught; our investigations of the Mafia, drug traffickers, terrorists and violent criminals will be meaningless if we cannot rely on our prosecutors to fight in court and gain a conviction for these criminals. This provision would reduce prosecutors, increase caseloads, and delay prosecution. 
This is a bad idea. This proposal would force the U.S. marshals to eliminate 61 positions hired in fiscal year 1997. The marshals are responsible for custody of presentenced Federal prisoners, finding fugitives, administering the court security program, and protection of Federal judges. They have advised us that with this reduction of $28 million, they would be unable to complete security improvements and projects at prisoner transportation holding areas. Since Oklahoma City, we have tried to build up court security with equipment and security guards, and we must not let down our guard. 
I would be remiss if I did not discuss this proposal's impact on the Federal judiciary, our third branch of the Government. In short, the impact would be devastating. It would require a reduction of $425 million from the budget request for the courts. It would require the reduction of over 3,500 positions. The judiciary estimates that appellate and district courts would be reduced by almost 1,200 positions. There would be reduced staff in courtrooms for filings, motions, pleadings and scheduling of cases. The bankruptcy court's clerk's offices would be forced to eliminate approximately 1,000 clerks. This reduction would increase the backlog in issuing discharges, closing cases and processing claims. Probation and pretrial services would be reduced by approximately 1,330 positions. The supervision of offenders and defendants would be cut in half. Panel attorney payments would have to be suspended as early as July 1998. Mr. President, what we are talking about is failing to provide for basic constitutional rights like the right to be represented by counsel. 
For education, the effects of full-year funding for 1998 at 98 percent of 1997 levels would also do great harm. College aid would be cut by $1.8 billion, 400,000 students would lose Pell grants, 52,000 children would be cut from Head Start, and aid to 2,000 local school districts would be cut. 
For Health and Human Services, dramatic cuts would occur to the NIH, Ryan White and the Indian Health Service and, moreover, WIC would serve several hundred thousand fewer women, infants and children in 1998, and the Veterans Administration would have to deny care to 200,000 veterans. 
In the area of transportation safety, the FAA would be unable to hire the additional 500 air traffic controllers, 325 flight inspection and certification personnel and 173 security staff included in the 1998 budget. 
Why anyone would think that enacting such a measure is a good idea is beyond me. Should we fail to enact one of the 13 bills, this so-called automatic measure would go into effect for up to 1 year, making mindless cuts in many beneficial programs like the ones I have mentioned, and yet all the while continuing funding in other programs that may have been slated for elimination because they are no longer needed. 
This is mindless legislating. It is very much like saying because we have missed the deadline for the budget resolution, which we have by more than 2 weeks this year already, we should enact legislation which says we will just use last year's budget resolution minus 2 percent across the board and get on with our business. 
Furthermore, the same delayed budget resolution has made it highly likely the Senate will be unable to pass all of the appropriations bills in a timely fashion and, therefore, highly likely that this automatic provision will be used. This is not to mention the obvious possible misuse of the automatic provision which could be employed by the majority if it were intent on cutting certain programs and could not get the minority or the President to go along. All that has to occur is for an appropriations bill to conveniently bog down beyond October 1, and the cuts I have previously mentioned could very magically occur without further consideration by the Appropriations Committee and without any further vote by the Senate. 
I appreciate the ingenuity and the political acuity demonstrated by the authors of this device, but I would like to remind us all that making political trump cards on an emergency disaster bill may not be appreciated by the American people, especially the disaster victims who are waiting for our help. 
It should be obvious to everyone that this is some kind of political ploy, else the attempt would not be made to attach it to a bill the President naturally would find very difficult to veto. In fact, if one can believe what one reads in the press, the reasons for this proposal are set out rather starkly in an article which appeared in the April 18, 1997 issue of a publication called Inside the New Congress. That publication discusses this so-called automatic CR provision under a heading entitled `Automatic PR.' 
Mr. President, I will continue my statement in support of my amendment on tomorrow. I yield the floor.

I can reciprocate by saying there is no Senator in this body who works harder, and few, perhaps, who work as hard and as effectively as does the distinguished Senator from Arizona. He amazes me with his ability to come up with amendments on almost every bill, and he seems to be conversant on virtually any subject to come before the Senate. I admire him for that. 
Mr. President, whether it is 98 percent or 100 percent, I have to oppose such an amendment. I join with the Senator in expressing the hope that we can discuss this tomorrow where we, hopefully, will have a larger audience. 
I prefer not to accede to his request tonight. I have lined up several speakers who are ready to speak on this language that is in the bill, and that is the language I attempted to strike in the committee earlier when we had markup. The Senator will get a vote one way or another on his proposal, I am sure. I hope, however, he would not press the request tonight, and let us return in the morning and think about it overnight. It may be I would accede to the request then, or I might not. But whether I do, he will find ways to get a vote on his amendment, or, as he says, he will move to table mine. He has several alternatives open to him. I hope we would not press the matter tonight, and we will come back, and, after a good night's rest, I will be prepared to take another look at it. 
So I am constrained to object tonight, Mr. President.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his characteristic courtesy and generosity. I would hope that we could wait until tomorrow so we could have more time, so that others on my side could be here to participate in the debate. And may I say, it may very well be that, by the time the sun rises on tomorrow, I may decide to remove my objection and let the Senator proceed with his amendment.

I shall vote for cloture, and I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to vote for cloture. We have been on the bill now 3 days. It is an emergency bill. The people who have been stricken by floods throughout the several States are in need of help. We should not delay matters here very long. 
I also hope that many of the 110 amendments that have been filed will go away without being called up. There are others against which points of order would lie, and I intend to join with my friend and colleague, Mr. Stevens, in making points of order against amendments that are not germane as he sees fit to do so. He is the manager of the bill, and I want to cooperate with him as much as possible. 
So I hope that we can get on with the bill today and make good progress and, hopefully, complete action on it earlier than the close of business tomorrow. Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Stevens.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 646, the Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act, introduced by the senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Ford. This measure would provide the American textile and apparel industry with clear oversight and enforcement of U.S. trade law, and the means to mobilize the industry's capability to compete in the increasingly competitive global market. 
For years, the U.S. textile and apparel sectors have been struggling to overcome the burdens of trade agreements that appear to mercilessly alter the textile and apparel quotas and tariffs systems, without offering the synergies necessary to compete under the new rules. Unfortunately, these burdens are magnified by unfair competition caused by overseas producers who seek to exceed and bypass these same negotiated agreements. 
In West Virginia, 2,900 textile and apparel jobs continue to survive, although the State has lost 3,000 of such jobs since 1990. Textile and apparel jobs are predominantly located in the State's more rural counties and are critical to the local economies. Additionally, these workers may not have the assets to relocate or the skills to easily transfer to another manufacturing sector. 
I believe that even the strongest supporters of laissez-faire economic ideologies must recognize the wisdom of negotiating trade agreements that avoid vast costs to, and unfair burdens on, particular segments of our economy. I am not advocating some outmoded retreat to protectionism. The United States must advocate open market and, at the same time, promote an equitable and fair trade system in which the American people have faith, in which American industries have a chance to compete, and which will curtail the shipping of American jobs overseas. 
In this regard, I believe that the Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act will provide the necessary impetus to remove the current obtrusive trade barriers from the textile and apparel industry, and invigorate the industry's ability to effectively compete in the global market. The bill's market-access provisions provide requirements for vigorous enforcement of trade agreements and for aggressive action against unfair trade practices by establishing a Special 301 authority. I have long been an ardent supporter of Section 301 and Super 301, and I believe that it is essential that the United States Trade Representative have the tools to quickly make unfair trade practice determinations and then diligently monitor and enforce corrective measures. 
This measure also allows reasonable federal investment to help the textile and apparel industry modernize and more effectively 
compete against overseas competitors. I am aware that there are many who doubt that the U.S. textile and apparel industries can re-establish themselves to be competitive global forces and, thus, will oppose this modest investment. I, however, do not doubt the abilities and spirit of these workers, just as I never doubted the ability of this nation's steel workers, who, against enormous odds, have today reclaimed their position as world class producers, following many years of struggle and uncertainty. I ask my colleagues to carefully weigh such a small investment and its possible returns against the billions we expend annually on various corporate welfare schemes for multimillion dollar industries. 
Crafting trade policies that balance domestic and international economic objectives is not easy. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act, which I believe accurately assesses the challenges of the global market and adequately provides the tools necessary to improve the competitive position of the U.S. textile and apparel industry. 
In behalf of the textile and apparel workers in West Virginia, and the nation, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act. I thank Senator Ford for his leadership in introducing the bill.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as every Senator is aware, over the past winter and now into spring, the Nation has been besieged by numerous natural disasters that have wreaked havoc on hundreds of communities across the country and have affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of our citizens. The damages from these disasters in terms of financial losses run into the billions of dollars. Many people have lost many, if not all, of their worldly possessions, things that they worked for for a lifetime. Not only their homes and personal possessions have been destroyed, but in many cases, entire communities have been wiped out, leaving many citizens with no means of livelihood. 
It is only fitting that the President and the Senate should move as quickly as is humanly possible to address the financial costs of these disasters and thereby, hopefully, help to lift the spirits of those who have lost so much. 
The bill now before the Senate contains more than $5.5 billion for the various disaster assistance programs throughout the Federal Government to provide relief for the communities and the citizens of those communities who have suffered devastation from these historic natural disasters. The largest single amount, $3.5 billion, will go to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, which has a major responsibility in providing disaster relief. In addition, the bill provides $650 million for emergency highway repairs resulting from floods in the western, midwestern, northern plains and mid-Atlantic regions of the Nation between December of 1996 and April of this year. 
This amount is $359 million more than requested by the administration, but is fully supported by the President since the committee's recommendation covers the most recent estimates of highway damages. 
For the emergency conservation program, an appropriation of $77 million is included, together with $161 million for watershed and flood prevention operations. For the Economic Development Administration, the bill contains an appropriation of $54.7 million for emergency grants. 
The bill also contains over $500 million for flood control and operations and maintenance accounts of the Corps of Engineers, and $187 million for emergency repairs of national parks, principally at Yosemite National Park. There is an appropriation of $91 million for construction activities of the Fish and Wildlife Service for damages to their resources due to flooding and storms around the country. For the U.S. Forest Service, $68 million is provided for repairs, reconstruction, and restoration of their roads, facilities, fish and wildlife habitats, etc. 
Finally, as recommended by the President, the bill contains $100 million for community development block grants, or CDBGs, to assist communities throughout the Nation with their emergency expenses in dealing with the tragic circumstances facing them as a result of these natural disasters. 
In all, Mr. President, some 33 States, including my own State of West Virginia, will qualify for these disaster assistance funds. 
The bill also contains appropriations totaling over $1.8 billion for continuing operations by the Department of Defense in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, as well as other non-emergency discretionary appropriations, including $58 million for WIC, $31 million for the District of Columbia, and $100 million for payments to the United Nations. 
It is important to note that all of the fiscal year 1997 discretionary amounts provided in the bill have been offset by budget authority cuts. The full amounts of emergency appropriations, $5.5 billion, the nearly $1.8 billion in DoD appropriations, and the $273 million in regular, non-DoD supplementals have all been fully offset. 
While I do not subscribe to the notion that emergency appropriations for disaster assistance should have to be offset, I congratulate the chairman and the various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members who searched for and found offsets sufficient to fully cover the entire budget authority recommended in this bill. 
I understand the administration is also supportive of these offsets, the principal one being a rescission of $3.6 billion from HUD's Section 8 housing program. These funds apparently cannot be obligated this fiscal year and, consequently, can be rescinded without causing undue harm to this program. 
The bill also contains a mandatory appropriation of $753 million for veterans' compensation and pensions. This amount is needed to pay for an increased caseload in this area, as well as the cost-of-living adjustment enacted last year for compensation benefits. 
Senators should also be aware that the committee recommends an increase in the 1997 highway obligation limit of $933 million. This is some $615 million more than requested by the administration, but it is necessary to ensure that no State receives less Federal-aid highway apportionments than it got in 1996. Finally, the bill advances appropriations of $198 million for title I education funding for fiscal year 1998. 
So, in carrying out its responsibilities in providing these desperately needed funds to hundreds of thousands of citizens in a fiscally responsible way, the committee has done well and I congratulate the chairman, Senator Stevens, as well as the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members, who have primary responsibility over various portions of the bill. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the bill reported by the committee contains several non-emergency, controversial provisions which, if not removed prior to the bill's being presented to the President, will cause him to veto the bill. There is no question about it, the President will veto S. 672, the pending measure, unless at least some of these objectionable provisions are removed. I have here a letter addressed to me from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Franklin D. Raines, which addresses the administration's concerns in a number of areas. Principal among those concerns is the so-called `automatic CR' language contained in title VII of the pending measure. That provision was debated during the committee markup, after which my motion to strike the provision failed on a party-line vote of 13 yeas to 15 nays. I shall have more to say about this title and the reasons why I believe it should be stricken from the bill as the debate unfolds on S. 672. 
A number of the other provisions in this bill to which the administration objects were discussed during the committee markup, with several Senators indicating their intentions to offer floor amendments on those provisions. Among those provisions are: one, a provision prohibiting the Department of Commerce from developing a plan for the 2000 decennial census that would use sampling; two, a provision that would waive certain portions of the Endangered Species Act; three, a provision relating to the promulgation of rules on RS2477; and, finally, a provision establishing a block grant to states to assist legal immigrants losing their SSI and Medicaid eligibilities. 
Additionally, I understand that there are several other possible controversial floor amendments which may be proposed by various Senators on a variety of issues. 
Mr. President, I close by asking, why is it that the majority has chosen this bill, of all bills, to attach certain objectionable amendments which the majority knows are controversial and which will cause a Presidential veto? I am not an advocate of even the constitutional Presidential veto, and, of course, I am adamantly opposed to the line-item veto. But in the case of the constitutional Presidential veto, I am not an advocate of it but I certainly would expect and would hope that the President would veto this bill if the automatic CR provision remains in it when it reaches his desk. What justifiable reason can there be to hold this disaster assistance bill hostage to such riders that have nothing to do with the basic purposes of the bill? 
Meanwhile, the hundreds of thousands of victims in 33 States who are suffering from the ravages of the disasters which this bill addresses will possibly have to wait. It suits the political agenda of the majority to have this delay and the confrontation with the President, perhaps, and unless these matters are resolved here, or in conference with the House, we may have to go through the veto process before we will be able to get these funds enacted and out to the people who so desperately need this assistance. 
So, I entreat my colleagues to rethink their positions on such controversial, unrelated matters which have no business being included on this bill. It is not too late to resolve these issues in ways that will remove the likelihood that the President will veto this disaster assistance bill. 
I, again, congratulate the chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, my long-time friend, the Senator from Alaska, and I congratulate all of the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members. I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to highlight the commendable effort displayed by the legion of West Virginia volunteers who have done so much to help their neighbors and communities affected by last month's flooding in sixteen West Virginia counties. Their selfless dedication to neighbors in need is in the finest West Virginia tradition of community spirit and support. 
The efforts of volunteers from the Fire and Rescue Departments throughout the affected area are especially noteworthy. These heroic workers rescued numerous families and individuals trapped by the raging flood waters that swept through my beloved state. You may recall some of the harrowing events displayed on television news, particularly from those hardest hit counties of Kanawha, Cabell, and Wirt. Also working during the storms and in their destructive aftermath, utility employees labored long hours in driving rain and deep mud to restore electricity, gas, water, and sewer service to the affected communities. 
Mr. President, churches have always sustained the people of West Virginia, and never more so than when disaster strikes. Aside from providing physical sustenance to the affected residents, the community churches that dot our hills and hollows have also provided flood victims with moral and spiritual comfort to ease the pain of all that has been lost. Particularly hard hit in this flood, the people of Clendenin have received extensive and much-needed support from churches, neighbors, and other charitable organizations. After all of the floods of last year, it is uplifting to see that such strong community spirit yet endures among the Mountaineers of West Virginia. This year, as in previous years, volunteers, churches, and organizations like the Red Cross have risen above the flood waters of disaster to provide comfort and hope to their neighbors. I am reminded of the words of poet, essayist, and critic Matthew Arnold: 
Then, in such hour of need 
Of your fainting, dispirited race, 
Ye, like angels, appear, 
Radiant with ardour divine! 
Beacons of hope, ye appear! 
Langour is not in your heart, 
Weakness is not in your word, 
Weariness not on your brow. 
Surely, the concerned faces and helping hands of volunteers and church workers seemed divinely inspired to the flood victims who benefited from their tireless efforts. Mr. President, I offer my thanks to all of those individuals, congregations, and charitable organizations who respond with such compassion and energy when disaster strikes.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today to ensure that adequate resources are available to reverse the very destructive trend of Federal disinvestment in our Nation's critical infrastructure of highways and bridges. The bill that I introduce would place into the highway trust fund the 4.3-cents-per-gallon gas tax that is currently used for our deficit reduction. 
Senators will recall that back in May and June of last year, there was much debate on this 4.3-cent gas tax, which was first imposed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 
During this past summer, I deferred offering this bill as an amendment to two separate tax bills, and I did so at the request of both the majority and the minority leaders. But unfortunately, another opportunity to offer the amendment to a tax bill did not arise. 
By depositing this additional 4.3-cents per gallon gas tax into the highway trust fund, Congress will have the resources to better meet the true needs of our Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
Our Federal investment in infrastructure as a percentage of the total Federal budget has declined significantly since 1980. Few economics would disagree that adequate long-term investment in infrastructure is critical to a nation's economic well-being. Only through investment here at home, only through investment to maintain and renew our own physical plant, can our economy grow and generate 
good wages for our citizens. 
Even so, our Nation's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of our gross domestic product has almost been cut in half since 1980. As a nation, we invest a considerably smaller percentage of our gross domestic product in infrastructure than our economic competitors invest in economic infrastructure in Europe and in Asia. 
Nowhere do we pay a greater price for inadequate infrastructure investment than in our Nation's highways. Our National Highway System carries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. Yet, we have allowed segments of our National Highway System to fall into disrepair. 
The Department of Transportation recently released its latest report on the condition of the Nation's highways. Its findings are even more disturbing than earlier reports. The Department of Transportation currently classified less than half of the mileage on our interstate system as being in good condition and only 39 percent of our entire National Highway System is rated in good condition. Fully 61 percent of our Nation's highways are rated in either fair condition or in poor condition. Almost one in four of our Nation's highway bridges are now categorized as either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. 
According to the Department of Transportation, investment in our Nation's highways is a full $15 billion short each year just to maintain these current inadequate conditions--just to maintain them. Put another way, we would have to increase our national highway investment by more than $15 billion a year just to avoid further deterioration of our national highway network. 
It should be noted that, while our highway infrastructure continue to deteriorate, highway use is on the rise. Indeed, it is growing at a very rapid pace. The number of vehicle miles traveled has grown by roughly 40 percent in just the last decade. As a result, we are witnessing new highs in the levels of highway congestion, causing delays in the movement of goods and people that costs our national economy more than $40 billion a year. 
So, Mr. President, it is clear that the requirement that we place on our National Highway System are growing while our investment continues to decline. We are simply digging ourselves a deeper and deeper hole. Six years ago, in 1991, it was estimated that an investment of $47.5 billion would be necessary on an annual basis to ensure that highway conditions would not deteriorate any further than existed in that year--that it would not get any worse. By 1993, that figure grew to $51.6 billion. And 2 years ago, that figure grew to $54.8 billion. Ergo, the longer we delay increasing Federal highway spending, the more expensive it will be to reverse this destructive trend, which costs our Nation dearly. 
Productivity improvements are the key to global competitiveness, rising standards of living and economic growth. Investments in highways result in significant, nationwide improvements in productivity. According to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 billion invested in highways creates and sustains over 40,000 full-time jobs. Furthermore, the very same $1 billion also results in a $240 million reduction in overall production costs for American manufacturers. 
While we can easily see the economic impact of disinvestment in our Nation's highways, we must not lose sight of the fact that deteriorating highways have a direct relationship to safety as well. We may be talking about your life. We may be talking about your life. And we are. Almost 42,000 people died on our Nation's highways in 1996. That equates to having a mid-sized passenger aircraft crash every day, killing all of its occupants. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration counts poor road conditions as a contributing factor in a large percentage of these fatal accidents, as well as those in which there are serious injuries. The economic impact of these highway accidents cost our Nation $150 billion a year, and that figure is growing. More importantly, this wasteful carnage brings incredible sorrow to affected families and friends, and the Nation loses the skills, the talents, and the contributions of the victims. 
The Senate will soon take up legislation to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. This bill will be one of the most important pieces of legislation that we consider this session. Many Members, including myself, have introduced legislation to address specific transportation needs in their States and regions. Also, many Members have spoken of the need for formula changes to bring about what they perceive to be a more equitable distribution of funds from the highway program. 
However, we must face the fact that, absent a substantial increase in the current level of spending on our highway program, we will not have the resources available to address the many important, but often competing, needs for our Nation's highway requirements in all regions of the country. 
So in the coming weeks, Mr. President, I look forward to working with all of my colleagues toward the enactment of substantially increased authorizations and appropriations for our Nation's highway system. And the bill that I have introduced today will provide a very helpful tool with which to do that.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been informed that our offices were notified 20 minutes ago, roughly, about this agreement. I assume that it was thought that if there were no objections registered within 15, 20 minutes, whatever it was, there were none and therefore we would go ahead with the agreement. 
It seems to me that at times certainly that is not in the best interest of the Senate. I am not complaining. Here is a very lengthy unanimous-consent agreement. I have not seen it. I am not one of the principal players in this situation. I probably am going to vote for the treaty. 
But the approval of resolutions of ratification of treaties is one of the unique reasons for the Senate's raison d'etre. Consequently, to just, at first blush, come up here to the floor and hear this long agreement read and then go along without objecting, at least for a little while until I can read it, it seems to me I am not doing my duty to the Senate, my duty under the Constitution, my duty to my people. 
Twenty minutes. If a hotline goes to the office on a lengthy agreement like this and I am out doing other things--and we do have other important duties that are part of the people's business--nobody in the office is in a position to approve or to object.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our indefatigable negotiator with responsibility for mediating the outstanding, difficult issues between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian authorities is back at work in the Middle East. The peace process was derailed by the intemperate action by the government led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, in supporting new Israeli settlements in Jerusalem. There appears little doubt that, regardless of the failings of Mr. Arafat to fully restrain Palestinian reactions to this action, the Israeli leader bears very heavy responsibility to undo the mischief which brought that elaborate tango of negotiations and actions called the peace process crashing down. 
Now we read of an unfolding, unprecedented scandal centered around that same Prime Minister. I have no judgment to make on that, but I hope that, as I have said before on this floor, Mr. Netanyahu will rise above the pressures on him, particularly from his right wing, and face history squarely. It is up to him to make the crucial moves that will halt the settlement construction, and take a courageous step. I call upon him, again, to do this, for the sake of the people of Israel and the Palestinians. 
It is important that the Clinton administration continue to take the position that the settlement construction must be halted. Ambassador Ross is reported today to be pressing the Prime Minister to do so. The United States has an important stake in this matter. As the strongest ally and the best friend that Israel ever had, or will have, it is surely not too much to expect some consideration of the U.S. position on this matter on the part of Mr. Netanyahu. He surely cannot expect to continue stonewalling the United States on this critical matter. I, for one, felt he should not have come to the United States to meet extensively with our President with nothing in mind to offer apparently. That is not what a good ally or a good friend does. He certainly cannot expect us to stand by while he gives an American President--our President--no more than a hello and goodbye on such a critical matter, and also then still expects the United States to provide our annual supplement of over $3 billion in American tax dollars to Israel without batting an eye--$3 billion. I wonder if the American people are aware of that, every year. 
This is a crucial period for the Likud government. I hope that it will see that support from the American people cannot continue to be in the form of a blank check no matter what that government does to stall or derail the process of making peace with the Palestinians. It does not do the Israeli people any good whatsoever for the message to go to them that whatever happens is essentially fine with the United States Government. We need to be consistent, both in Washington and in New York. The Clinton administration needs to take this into consideration, as well. We cannot take one position, against the settlements construction, here in Washington, and water it down by not endorsing the same policy embodied in Security Counsel resolutions. 
That is speaking out of both sides of our mouth. That is speaking with a forked tongue. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to speak in one voice with the administration, and I urge the administration to be completely consistent, not inconsistent, because inconsistency creates confusion. It sends the wrong message. Make it clear that we will continue to act in good faith as a mediator and as an ally of Israel, but we expect the Israeli Government to step up to the plate and make the kind of moves that will be necessary to breathe new vigor and new life into the process of peacemaking, which is so critical to the people of Israel, to the Palestinians, to the United States and to our allies. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I introduced a joint resolution on February 6 to amend the Constitution in order to clarify that document's intent with regard to prayer in our public schools. Senators Lott, Hollings, Ford, and Smith of New Hampshire have indicated a desire to have their names added as cosponsors. At the conclusion of my remarks I will ask that be done. 
Mr. President, my proposed amendment is short, but it constitutionalizes what the Supreme Court has upheld on a number of occasions; namely, that the Founding Fathers did not intend for Government and the schools to be opponents of religion but rather that they should be neutral and impartial in allowing the practice of all religious beliefs by American citizens and by even the schoolchildren of our Nation. 
I have long been concerned by the trends in our schools and in our courts to overzealously eliminate all references--all references--to religion and religious practices. It is now uncommon and rare to see any acknowledgment of the religious underpinnings of major holidays. The unfortunate effect of this misguided overzealousness has been to send the subtle but powerful message to our children that religious faith and practice is something unsanctioned, unimportant, and unsophisticated--something that only small handfuls of people practice, and usually then only on weekends. Indeed, this exorcism of religion from the school day and from most of American life has reached even into the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance and other important American documents. 
I was here on June 7, 1954, when the House of Representatives, of which I was then a Member, added the words `under God' to the Pledge of Allegiance. The next day, on June 8, the Senate likewise added the words `under God' to the Pledge of Allegiance. I think it was on June 20 of that year, 1954, that the President signed the additional language into law. 
I understand the thinking of the Founding Fathers when they drafted a Constitution that specifically forbade the establishment of a state religion and that intended to--and does--protect the freedom of all religions to observe the rituals and the tenets of their faith. The Founding Fathers and many of the earlier settlers of this country had fled from nations where State-sanctioned religions had resulted in exclusion from Government participation or even persecution of believers in nonsanctioned faiths. They were generally--talking about the founders of this Nation, the framers of the Constitution, the Founding Fathers, those who voted in the various conventions for the new Constitution--they were 
generally religious men, as the number of plaques in local churches here attest, proclaiming proudly, for example, that `George Washington attended church here.' The freedom to worship was important to them, and they sought at all cost to prohibit the Government of our Republic--the Government of our Republic, not our democracy; our Republic--from assuming the dictatorial powers of a king. Indeed, the Federalist Papers 59, in discussing the differences between the President and a king, specifically observes that the President has `no particle of spiritual jurisdiction.' There would be no `Church of America,' permitted by the Constitution. 
But in discussing the qualifications of elected officials and electoral college members, the authors are clear in encouraging participation by members of all faiths, and they pointedly note that religious belief is not a bar to election or selection. So whether you are a Catholic or whether you are a Jew or whether you are a Baptist or Methodist, Episcopalian is not something that will bar one from election. In Federalist 57, James Madison writes: `Who are the objects of popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem and confidence of his country. No qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession is permitted to fetter the judgment or disappoint the inclination of the people.' But, seeking to keep the Government from dictating a particular religion certainly did not mean that all public professions of faith must be banned, and the courts have sustained that view. 
Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for the Court in Lynch v. Donnelly emphasized what he called `an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in American life from at least 1789.' 
Now, Mr. President, the words `In God we trust,' those words appear on our Nation's currency. Proclamations of days of thanksgiving and prayer, legislative chaplains, the invocation `God save the United States and this Honorable Court' at the opening of judicial proceedings--all these and more reinforce what Chief Justice Burger was asserting when he wrote that the Constitution does not require `complete separation of church and state . . . (but) affirmatively mandates accommodation . . . of all religions, and forbids hostility toward any.' 
An acknowledgment that faith is, and should be, a part of the everyday life of those who desire it, not just an occasional weekend or holiday exercise, is a message that our children need to absorb. Schools, principals, and administrators should not react in dismay when a student-initiated religious group seeks to meet in a classroom after school. What is wrong with that? That sort of extracurricular activity should be encouraged, not frowned upon. We need not sanctimoniously strike a Christmas carol from the euphemistically named `Winter Concert,' nor tiptoe around the observance of a daily `moment of silence' for reflection, meditation, or even, if the child wishes, prayer. 
And it certainly must be permissible to discuss the role that various religious faiths have played in world history and in the history of our own Nation. Actually, it is imperative to the study of history. 
Especially in these troubled days, it is important, in these very significant ways, to send a positive message to children about private faith and religious practice. They spend 6 or more hours a day in school, 180 days or more each year. More and more, in a society where both parents work, schools are where children absorb much of their `life instruction' and develop behavioral and social attitudes, in addition to academic knowledge. School is one of the few places besides church where clean and positive messages are, or should be, instilled in our children, counterbalancing the pervasive violence and seamy morals of television. We put a premium on the diversity of education that they receive in literature, history, geography, science, and mathematics; yet, most public schools are a spiritual dead zone--a spiritual dead zone--completely devoid of even the unspoken understanding that religious faith ought to play a part, perhaps a major part, in people's lives. For fear of offending the sensibilities of the few--we are living in this age of so-called `political correctness.' I don't know what that means, and I don't care and don't intend to change my ways and attitudes to be in accordance with `political correctness.' For fear of offending the sensibilities of the few, we have denied the needs of the many. A climate of openness and an acknowledgment that many people, including children, can profess and practice different faiths, are needed in our schools, which should not be a spiritual wasteland where even the mere recognition of any spiritual faith is banned. 
Mr. President, I am normally and naturally reluctant to amend the Constitution. But I am not one who would say never, never amend the Constitution. Regarding amendments to require a balanced budget, or to provide the President with the line-item veto, I have been vociferously and adamantly opposed. These amendments would fundamentally alter the checks and balances established in the Constitution. But on the financing of political campaigns, I have been willing to seek a constitutional remedy to that scourge of public trust, a scourge that no legislation has ever been able to control. And on this issue of openly acknowledging and accepting the role that prayer and religion can and ought to play in our lives, I believe that an amendment to reaffirm the appropriate neutrality of the Constitution toward prayer and religious activity in school is necessary to swing the pendulum back toward the middle, toward the neutral middle, away from both the existing pole, where the state seems, at least, to have become inimical toward the exercise of religious freedom, and away from the opposite and clearly unconstitutional pole of dictating one religious profession of faith over any other. We do not have to completely discourage any recognition of a Supreme Being in order to avoid favoring one religious faith over another. And to do so is, in effect, a form of religious discrimination which the Founding Fathers would never have sanctioned. 
The sum total of this collective effort to bend over backwards to avoid any recognition of a Supreme Being in our schools has had the extremely damaging effect of making any expression of such a belief appear to be undesirable, unfashionable, and even something to be studiously avoided. If one mentions a Supreme Being in some circles, he is considered to be unsophisticated. Children pick up on such messages quickly. And as a result, we have produced several generations of young people largely devoid of spiritual values in their daily lives. Everywhere they turn, they meet the subtle, and perhaps not so subtle, putting down of spiritual values. 
Recently, I noted an article in the Washington Post which proclaimed that only 40 percent of U.S. scientists believe in God. Although this is precisely the same percentage as was revealed in a similar survey in 1916--and I am glad it hasn't deteriorated or gotten worse in the meantime, and that is almost worthy of some amazement that it hasn't--I find such a result personally unfathomable. 
Who, more than a man or a woman of science, should be more acutely aware that the wonders of the universe could not have just happened? Who, more than an astronomer or a mathematician, or a physicist, or a biologist, intimately familiar with the laws of probability, could better understand the impossibility of the wonders of the universe and all creation occurring simply as a byproduct of fortunate accident? 
I wonder how many of these scientists who answered the poll, which indicated that only 40 percent of the scientists believe in a Supreme Being, have read Charles Darwin? Well, no less a pioneering scientific intellect than Charles Darwin, the originator of the theory of natural selection--I have the book here in my hand--refused to rule out a Divine Creator; and he even refers to a Divine Creator in his book, `The Origin of Species.' 
Darwin asks a very penetrating question, and I'm reading from page 193 of Charles Darwin's volume of `The Origin of Species.' Here is the question that he asks: `Have we any right 
to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?' Now, that is an incisive question because I think we are prone to think of God's intellect in the context of what we think to be or know to be our own intellectual processes, our own intellects. But Darwin asks the question: `Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?' That is a great question. 
Darwin continues the dovetailing of his scientific theory with the works of the Creator when he writes this on page 194: `Let this process go on . . .'--he is talking about the process of natural selection--`Let this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument . . . might thus be formed as superior to one of glass. . . .' He speaks of a living optical instrument--in other words, the eye, which can adjust itself to light and to distance, and so on, automatically and virtually immediately; whereas, the best camera that the Presiding Officer, Pat Roberts, has will have to be adjusted a little bit for light and distance, and he will have to look through it a little bit and adjust this and adjust that. Well, that is what Darwin is talking about when he says: `Let this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument (the eye) might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?' 
So Charles Darwin himself is not backward about speaking of a Creator. `Let this process'--the process of natural selection--`go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument (the eye) might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?' 
So it is clear that even such a scientific genius as Darwin did not think it to be unsophisticated to believe in a Creator, or make reference to a Creator, a Supreme Being. 
I have read and reread many times, Mr. President, the account of creation as set forth in the Book of Genesis in the Holy Bible. I thought it well to read Darwin's theory of `Natural Selection' also. And I have done that. As a matter of fact, when I first read that book some years ago, and it made reference to the Creator in Darwin's `Origin of Species,' I was somewhat amazed. I never thought that, after hearing about Darwin's theory--the theory of evolution, and so on--I didn't think he would be so unsophisticated as to make any reference to a Supreme Being, to a Creator. But I found differently. 
So it is clear that such a scientific genius as Darwin did not feel the need to rule the Creator out of creation just because man in his limited, narrow, finite intelligence might be arrogant enough to do so. It may just be that such surveys reveal only the desire of some in the scientific field to avoid appearing unsophisticated to their colleagues. For in the minds of many misguided people, to be truly intelligent one must avoid any alignment with the alleged superstition and naivete of religion. What poppycock! For any serious student of science not to express wonder at the mystery of life and the universe and to claim instead that it is all purely a result of an accidental natural physics or chemical reaction is surely an admission of true ignorance and arrogance. 
This is not something I know a great deal about, Mr. President. I don't profess such. But I can tell you one thing. There is a hunger in this Nation for a return to spiritual values. It can be seen in the misguided tragedy of the Heaven's Gate cult, looking for a space ship lurking in the tail of a comet to take them to Heaven and away from this miserable, material world. It can be seen in the political strength of the religious right. 
Mr. President, I am not of the religious right. I am not of the religious left. I just plainly believe in the old-time religion which I saw exemplified and practiced by two humble parents--foster parents of mine--over the years that I lived with them. It can be seen in the need for our children to focus on something beyond material things in which to anchor their perceptions about right and wrong and good and evil. 
In today's turned-around, upside-down society with its diminished values and its emphasis on easy money, casual sex, violence, material goods, instant gratification and escape through drugs and alcohol, our young people need to know that it is OK to have spiritual values, it is OK to follow one's own personal religious guideposts, it is OK to pray, it is OK to recognize and then to do morally the right thing, it is OK to go against the crowd, OK to read the Bible, and OK to read Darwin's theory of natural selection--who knows? This may have been God's way of creating man--and that such activities are not strange, or uncool, or stupid, or unsophisticated.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in March of last year, the Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act. That law, for the first time in our Nation's history, gave the President the power to single-handedly repeal portions of appropriations or tax laws without the consent of Congress. I vigorously opposed passage of the act because of my deep concern over the effects of that act on our system of checks and balances and the separation of powers that has served this Nation so well for over 200 years. 
As I have told my colleagues on many occasions, I viewed the passage of that law as one of the darkest moments in the history of the republic. On January 2 of this year, I, along with Senators Moynihan and Levin, former Senator Hatfield, and Representatives Waxman and Skaggs, filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act. 
Today, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia handed down a ruling declaring the act to be unconstitutional. Among other things, Mr. President, the court held, `Where the President signs a bill but then purports to cancel parts of it, he exceeds his constitutional authority and prevents both Houses of Congress from participating in the exercise of lawmaking authority. The President's cancellation of an item unilaterally effects a repeal of statutory law, such that the bill he signed is not the law that will govern the Nation. That is precisely what the Presentment Clause was designed to prevent.' 
As Judge Jackson also stated, `Just as Congress could not delegate to one of its chambers the power to veto select provisions of law, it may not assign that authority to the President.' For the reasons set forth in his 36-page opinion, the court adjudged and declared unconstitutional the Line-Item Veto Act. 
I am very pleased with the court's decision, which I believe to be a great victory for the American people, the Constitution, and our constitutional system of checks and balances and separation of powers. 
Mr. President, I express my deep appreciation to Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Levin, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Skaggs, former Senator Hatfield, for their cooperation, and to our excellent team of lawyers for their support, for their dedication, and for their active and effective participation in this case.

Mr. BYRD. `The year's at the spring; the day's at the morn; morning's at seven; the hillside's dew-pearled; the lark's on the wing; the snail's on the thorn; God's in his Heaven--all's right with the world.' 
Mr. President, the Senate is preparing to recess at the close of this week. Some Senators will use this time to travel to distant and exotic locations. Others will return home for busy rounds of meetings. Schools around the nation are also closing their doors for spring break. For many college students, spring break has become a beach vacation ritual, replete with loud parties, little self-restraint, and the over-consumption of booze--alcohol. At home, spring sales are in full force, with stores luring credit-happy buyers away from the outdoor pleasures that warming days and budding gardens invite. The celebration of winter's passing and the rekindling of life all around us has been lost, for many, in the materialistic and hedonistic whirlwind of everyday life. Only the pastel colors of paper flowers link the climate-controlled interior of the shopping malls with the greening of the spring earth. 
But today is also the vernal equinox, that chiming peal on the celestial clock that marks the turning of the seasons, the day on which the periods of light and dark are again of equal length following the long, cold, dreary nights of winter. In 325 A.D., during the reign of that great convert to Christianity, the Emperor Constantine, the council of Nicaea met. With the help of the Archbishop of Alexandria and the astronomers of that distant day, the Council decreed that Easter should fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. So, today we may look ahead with certainty toward the Sunday after next for the enduring celebration of that central mystery of the Christian faith, the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
Mr. President, although in recent years the trend has been to strip every religious overtone from our calendar and from our schools--and thank God the Constitution protects my right to stand on this Senate floor and talk about whatever I may please. Let it be religion. The Supreme Court cannot do anything about it. 
So the trend has been to strip every religious overtone from our calendar and from our schools to rename the Christmas holiday a `winter break' and the Easter holiday a `spring break.' I am not sure that the result--a nation more interested in consumption, department store sales, junk television, and professional sports performances, than in church, community and family--is a happy one. I still believe that there is a deep wellspring of religious belief that sustains our Nation as it does in the close-knit and caring communities in which I grew up. The community churches which still thrive in West Virginia were the focal point of towns and communities of my childhood. 
And contrary to the beliefs of some of our sophisticated brethren in Washington and some of the other great metropolitan centers in this country, they do not have rattlesnakes in all of those churches. As a matter of fact, I have never been in a church where there was a rattlesnake--a few two-legged ones perhaps, but that is where they ought to go, to church. Social life revolved around Sunday services and activities sponsored by, or otherwise intimately linked with, the church and celebrations of faith. 
But as I witness the slow unraveling of our communities, their weave frayed by casual greed and picked apart by drugs and violence, I worry that the clear-flowing waters of family, church and community that nourished me and millions like me are becoming fouled and turbid. The erosion of Easter into a crass and commercial `spring break' is but one sad example of the materialistic trend in this country and in this age. More media coverage is awarded to the excesses of Mardi Gras on Fat, or Shrove, Tuesday--also called Pancake Day--than on the entire forty days of Lent. I wonder how many people who dress up and masquerade in that carnival parade recall that the original purpose of Mardi Gras was to prepare for the Lenten fasts by using up the available cooking oil and fat in a pre-fast eating binge? The binge was fun, but it did not blot out the central religious purpose of the repentant fast to follow. 
Mr. President, Easter Sunday ends forty days of religious observance beginning with Ash Wednesday, set as the beginning of Lent by Pope Gregory at the beginning of the sixth century. This coming Sunday is known as Palm Sunday, in observance of the palm-strewn entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem. The following Friday, or Good Friday, marks the day that Jesus suffered on the Cross and died. It is a solemn day indeed, yet I fear that, for too many people, it is just another day off from work, filled with errands, or shopping, or travel, with not a passing thought given to the suffering of God's only Son on the cross. 
I am not a minister. I do not profess to be worthy of the title. But I grew up in a Christian home. My foster father was a coal miner and my foster mother was the only mother I ever knew. They were religious people. They were not of the religious left or of the religious right. They were not of the Christian center or the Christian left or the Christian right. Neither am I. They just were plain, down-to-Earth, God-fearing, God-loving Christian parents. 
And, so it is that I come to the Senate Chamber today, as I say, not as a cleric or as a minister. I probably could not be one. But I do believe in the Bible and its teachings, even though I have not always found it so easy to live up to those teachings. 
Easter Sunday is not just a day to mark with brightly colored hard-boiled eggs or chocolate bunnies, or with jelly beans and plastic grass in wicker baskets. All of these ancient symbols of spring and rebirth have their place, but it disturbs me to think that children may know Christmas day only for its early morning toy-filled stockings, and Easter only for its baskets and Easter egg hunts. 
Easter Sunday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I do not ask everyone to believe as I do. I do not ask everyone to be a missionary Baptist. It does not make any difference to me whether the Senator from Illinois, the Senator from Idaho, or the Senator from Iowa is a Baptist or a Methodist or an Episcopalian or Catholic or Jewish rabbi or Moslem; it doesn't make any difference to me. I can listen to all of them and still maintain my own way of looking at things. 
So, all of these ancient symbols of spring and rebirth have their place. But it disturbs me to think that children, as I say, may know Easter only as a day for baskets and Easter egg hunts. 
Easter Sunday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And I now read from the King James version. That is the only version I will read. That is the Bible that was in my father's house. It is the only one I know and the only one I will have in my house. So I read from the King James version of the Bible the Gospel of St. Mark, Chapter 16, verses 1-7. Let us listen to Mark. He was the attendant of Peter. He speaks to us of the resurrection:  
And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun. 
And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher? 
And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 
And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 
And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 
But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 
So Easter is a vivid and lasting celebration of the promise of life after death. Like spring itself, Easter is, in its essence, a celebration of the rebirth of living things. That hope, that promise of life after death, guides our behavior in the here-and-now. It reinforces the need to act not only in our own selfish interests, but also for the common good, else we be judged unworthy of Christ's sacrifice. It sustains us when we encounter harsh difficulties and tragic events in our lives--and I know because I have experienced such, as have many others of us in this Chamber. 
We believe that there is a better life still to come. And, if we did not have that hope, then this life would be empty. The promise of a life after death comes to us through John, `the beloved disciple'. Reading from the King James version of the Bible, the Gospel of St. John, Chapter 20, verses 24-31: 
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he [Thomas] said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. 
And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 
Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. 
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. 
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. 
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: 
But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. 
And so, Mr. President, that is the promise--`that believing' we might have life. The next two weeks may be a recess for some, and for some a `spring break,' but for millions of Americans, the next two weeks are also a life-affirming celebration of the greatest gift any of us has ever received--hope in a future life. For those who have lost loved ones, Easter brings the joyous hope that we can again see, we can again be with that loved one, as I lost my grandson 15 years ago this coming April the 12th. He died on the Monday morning after Easter Sunday, perhaps around 3:30, 4 o'clock in the morning, the victim of a truck crash into a tree and a fire that devastated his beautiful body--17 years old, looking forward to graduation from high school, 6 feet 5, and 300 pounds, all man, with life ahead of him. And there are others in this Chamber who have suffered the loss of a child or a grandchild or a parent, a sister or brother or wife or husband. We can see our loved ones again. 
So Easter represents the resurrection, it is the celebration of the resurrection, and it gives us hope that there will be a future resurrection. That is what it means to millions of people in this country. 
As the sun warms our backs, and the spring breezes carry past us the mingled scents of pear blossoms and magnolia blossoms and the warm earth, let us offer our heartfelt prayers for our faith, for our family, for our church, for our community, and for our Nation. I hope that my colleagues and those who hear or read my words will also take a few moments away from the commerce of everyday life to reflect on the true reason why a recess is scheduled at this time--to celebrate this most holy of Christian holidays, Easter. 
Edwin L. Sabin captures both the solemnity and the joy of Christ's resurrection in his poem, `Easter:' 
The barrier stone has rolled away, 
And loud the angels sing; 
The Christ comes forth this blessed day 
To reign, a deathless King. 
For shall we not believe He lives 
Through such awakening? 
Behold, how God each April gives 
The miracle of Spring. 
Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to recall this miracle, and the faith that gives them and gives communities throughout our Nation the strength to persevere--to fight against the violence, the greed, and the moral decay that threaten the fabric of our families, our communities, and our Nation. 
I also invite my colleagues and my fellow citizens--and I invite myself--to again see Easter Sunday as the celebration of the resurrection and the promise that there is a life after death. William Jennings Bryan and my congenial colleague from the State of Illinois, Mr. Durbin, will appreciate this especially. William Jennings Bryan expressed it well in `The Prince of Peace': 
If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the earth the soul of man, made in the image of his Creator? If He stoops to give to the rosebush, whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come? If matter, mute and inanimate, though changed by the forces of nature into a multitude of forms, can never be destroyed, will the imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay? No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not a single atom in all of His creation, has made provision for a future life in which man's universal longing for immortality will find its realization. I am as sure that we live again as I am sure that we live today. 
William Jennings Bryan spoke those words in `The Prince of Peace.' 
Mr. President, may all of us, as we approach the blessed Easter season, enjoy renewed hope in the message that we shall live again. 
And when you get closer to 79--79 years and 4 months, as I am today--the more you will believe and begin to see more and more the truth, the universal truth, the eternal truth that God still lives, that He created this great universe and all the universes, and that He created man. I don't know how He created man. I am not worried about that, by what method or through what process all that was done. But we are told that God created man out of the dust of the ground in His own image, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. And man became a living soul. That is good enough for me. 
So, Mr. President, as we approach this Easter, let us learn again the message that comes to us from Him who said 2,000 years ago: `I, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all men unto me.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new rules to modify the ambient air standards for ozone and particulate matter. I recently wrote to the EPA and urged the agency to reaffirm the current standards, conduct additional monitoring of particulate matter and related air quality issues, and allow our States to complete action on the ambitious clean air standards that are already in place before implementing additional regulations. I was joined in this letter by Senators Rockefeller, Ford, Glenn, and Robb. 
These proposed rules have been extremely controversial, and have been sharply criticized by State Governors, municipal leaders, and business organizations. I have recently been made aware that these rules have also been criticized by other Federal agencies. 
During the interagency review of these rules overseen by the Office of Management and Budget, several Federal agencies submitted comments which questioned many aspects of the proposed rules, including their scientific basis and cost effectiveness. These comments are part of the public record. Judging by the tone of the comments from the interagency review process, it appears that many Federal agencies are concerned about these proposed rules. 
In but one example, the EPA has stated that the total national cost of implementing the ozone rule would be $2.5 billion. However, the Council of Economic Advisers has stated that the cost of full attainment of just the ozone rule could be $60 billion, or $57.5 billion more than estimated by the EPA. This is a substantial discrepancy. The Department of Transportation, in its initial interagency review submission, concluded that `it is incomprehensible that the administration would commit to a new set of standards and new efforts to meet such standards without much greater understanding of the problem and its solutions.' The U.S. Small Business Administration stated that EPA's proposed regulation `is certainly one of the most expensive regulations, if not the most expensive regulation faced by small businesses in 10 or more years.' The SBA said that `considering the large economic impacts suggested by EPA's own analysis that will unquestionably fall on tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of small businesses, this (proposal) would be a startling proposition to the small business community.' 
I understand that some of these Federal agencies had also planned on submitting comments to the EPA as part of the public comment period. However, the Oil Daily, a trade publication, has reported that these agencies were prevented from doing so. The Oil Daily reported that `according to a leaked memo, the agencies were muzzled [by OMB] * * *' The article further quotes the memo as instructing agencies that `based upon reports from a meeting this morning * * * Federal agencies will not [I repeat not] be 
transmitting comments on the EPA proposals.' 
Although the agencies provided critical comments during the interagency review process, there is no evidence that the proposed rules were significantly modified to reflect their concerns. OMB cannot, therefore, defend its `muzzling' of Federal agencies--as characterized by the Oil Daily--by arguing that the proposed rules reflect the collective wisdom and judgment of Federal agencies, when the exact opposite is the case. I would also note that the interagency review comments from last fall are part of the public record, and so there is no reason why the agencies could not also submit comments during the public comment period. EPA and OMB are apparently holding conversations with some of the Federal agencies, but the critical comments of other agencies will not be shared with Congress and other interested parties. On its face, this becomes a private comment period, rather than a public comment period. 
I am disturbed by this apparent lack of candor and public accountability on the part of the administration in discussing these rules. These proposed rules will impose significant costs, not only on our Nation, but also on Federal agencies themselves. Many agencies and departments operate facilities that will be directly affected by these rules. As the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I believe that these impacts and costs must be considered and reviewed as part of the appropriations process. 
I am, therefore, today writing to various Federal agencies requesting that these agencies individually comment on the cost of the proposed EPA rules, both with regard to the operations of the individual departments, and upon that aspect of the Nation's infrastructure that is regulated by the departments in question. I am also writing to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, requesting his comments on the cost of these proposed rules to the Federal Government in its entirety. 
As our Nation strives to balance the budget, while at the same time providing Federal programs and services desired by the public, it is important that the significant costs of new regulations, such as these, be made available and taken into account as part of the budget process. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on October 3, 1996, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 321, which I introduced, and which had the bipartisan support of both the Majority and Minority Leaders. The resolution authorizes a Senator to accept pro bono legal services when challenging the constitutionality of a Federal statute, and then only when the statute in question expressly authorizes the Senator to file such a suit. 
In addition, Senate Resolution 321 required the Select Committee on Ethics to establish regulations providing for the public disclosure of information relating to the acceptance of pro bono legal services performed as authorized by the resolution. Those regulations were adopted by the Committee on February 13, 1997, and were subsequently printed on page S1485 of the Congressional Record dated February 24, 1997. 
Specifically, those regulations state, in relevant part:

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on March 11, this body voted 99 to 0 to adopt a resolution that provides more than $4.3 million to the Committee on Governmental Affairs for the sole purpose of investigating any and all improper or illegal activities stemming from the 1996 federal elections. The investigation will cover the presidential and congressional elections, and the results will be made known to the public early next year. 
I believe that one of the primary reasons the resolution had the full support of the Senate was because of the various compromises that succeeded in making the scope of the investigation both bipartisan and fair. Absent those accommodations, the resolution would have been seen by the American people as nothing more than an attempt by one party to gain political advantage over the other. 
That is why I am deeply concerned with the direction now being taken with this measure. Unlike the resolution that received the full support of the Senate on March 11, this resolution specifically targets for investigation by an independent counsel the President, the Vice President, unnamed White House officials, and the Democratic National Committee, and it does so based on nothing more substantial than `reports in the media.' 
Mr. President, the American people are painfully aware that both parties are guilty of abusing the campaign financing system currently in place. But this resolution would seek to exploit--apparently for paritsan political advantage--the actions of only a Democratic President and the Democratic Party. Now, where is the objectivity? Where is the objectivity in that proposition? 
Even if we disregard fairness, there is simply no logical reason why the Senate needs to be spending its time on this resolution. The simple truth is that the law governing the appointment of an independent counsel already provides a process that the Attorney General must follow. That process is clearly laid out in the U.S. Code, and it does not--I repeat, does not--include sense of the Congress resolutions. 
The fact is, Mr. President, that this is an unprecedented behest. 
Never before has the Congress attempted to dictate the naming of an independent counsel. We have never passed any measure that would tell the Attorney General, as this resolution does, that she `should' apply for the appointment of an independent counsel. The reason we haven't done so is because that would unnecessarily politicize a procedure that was expressly designed to restore public confidence after Watergate by taking politics out of our criminal justice system. 
Furthermore, I find it ironic that we are debating this resolution at the same time that the Justice Department's Office of Public Integrity is actively engaged in an investigation of the very matters that this resolution seeks to have investigated. Career prosecutors are, as we speak, already working as part of an independent task force looking into fundraising efforts in connection with the 1996 Presidential election. In addition, a Federal grand jury has already begun hearing testimony in connection with campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee. But under the independent counsel statute, each of those efforts would cease. There would be no further authority for the Attorney General to convene grand juries or to issue subpoenas. Where is the logic? Where is the logic in that, Mr. President? 
The decision to invoke the independent counsel process is, by law, a decision for the Attorney General alone to make. Let us let the law work as it was intended. We should not, through some misguided attempt at grandstanding, pass a resolution that serves no legitimate purpose except to score political home runs. Such a course tends to call into question the integrity of the Justice Department and of the entire independent counsel process. 
This resolution has not had the benefit of committee examination and has been moved to the calendar by parliamentary device--I suppose through rule XIV. While that may be acceptable for some measures, and is acceptable for some measures, I feel that, on a matter this sensitive, a committee should have certainly had the opportunity to pass some judgment. The Congress is attempting to direct an Attorney General, when the law specifies the decision to invoke the independent counsel is and ought to be, by constitutional necessity, that of the Attorney General alone. 
There is a mean spirit alive in this town currently, Mr. President, which is destructive, overly partisan and overtly partisan, and thoroughly regrettable. We seem to have completely forgotten about the mundane necessities of governing, like crafting a budget and dealing with the myriad problems that face the American people. 
Instead, we are engaged in a feeding frenzy, like sharks that have tasted a little blood and hunger for more. If you have ever observed sharks being fed red meat, you know that it is not a pretty picture. And I am sure that the excesses of partisanship emanating from Washington these days and being witnessed by the American people are far from appetizing. 
No one is suggesting that we turn our backs on corruption or fail to explore wrongdoing. But I implore some in this body to cool off and to try to get a sense of perspective on this entire matter. 
Service in the U.S. Senate is a tremendous honor. Each of us has expended great personal effort to get here, including the straining of our personal lives in order to attain a wonderful prize, a seat in this great body. The benefits of winning that prize include the opportunity to participate in governing the greatest country on Earth, the United States of America, and through the quality of that governance, to inspire and to uplift our people. 
So I urge each of my colleagues to focus on that opportunity and on the great and long tradition of this body. Let's put aside this and all other unwise techniques for embarrassing each other and do something for the good of the American people. If there are those who want to embarrass themselves by wrongdoing, they will be found out because there are processes already at work to ferret out that information and bring it to the full light of day. So let us leave the investigation of campaign abuses by both political parties in the hands of the very capable people charged with conducting them and avoid the allure of `piling on' for political advantage. It is time for us to remember our real duties and our heavy responsibility to legislate and to govern for the common good and, by that example, so encourage our President to do the same. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with others of my colleagues in complimenting the distinguished Senator from Georgia on his maiden speech. 
It used to be, Mr. President, that when a new Senator came to this body, he waited several months before he spoke. 
Then when he made his maiden speech, other Senators who had been notified that he was going to make a speech would come to the floor and gather around him and listen to his speech. In those days we did not have the public address system. So Senators generally moved toward the desk of the Senator who was speaking so they could hear him better. 
I have enjoyed listening to the distinguished Senator. He comes here today as someone who is fresh off the campaign trail. I am sure that what he has had to say is something of importance, and I hope it will be read by our colleagues. He comes in the great tradition of Senators from Georgia. When I first came to Washington as a new Member of the Congress, we had Senator Walter George in the U.S. Senate, and Senator Richard Russell, who was my mentor in many ways, and it was I who introduced the resolution to name the old Senate Office Building in honor of Senator Richard Russell. Of course, there was also Sam Nunn, who followed in Senator Russell's footsteps. 
I congratulate the distinguished Senator. He is a true American hero. I know that he will be an outstanding Member of this institution. I congratulate him. 
I hope that all Senators will take note of what Senator Cleland has said in his speech today. It will be well worth their time to read that speech. 
I thank him. 
And I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, in introducing an ambitious new effort on the matter of our nation's persistent and growing trade deficit. This legislation would establish a Commission to take a broad, thorough look at all important aspects of, and solutions to the growing U.S. trade deficit, with particular attention to the manufacturing sector. 
The trade deficit, as my colleagues know, is a relatively recent phenomenon, with large deficits only occurring within the last 15 years. In the 1980's, the U.S. merchandise trade balance ballooned from a deficit of $19 billion in 1980 to $53 billion in 1983, and then doubled in a year, to $106 billion in 1984. Last year it stood at $188 billion, setting a new high record for the third consecutive year. Projections by econometric forecasting firms indicate long term trends which will bring this figure to over $350 billion by 2007. No one is predicting a decline in the near future. If we do nothing, within 2 years the merchandise trade deficit will equal the annual budget for national defense. 
To reiterate, in 1996 the United States had the largest negative merchandise trade balance in our history, some $188 billion, and it is the third consecutive year in which the deficit has reached a new record high. 
This legislation is committed to a goal of reversing that trend of the next decade. The goal of the commission is to `develop a national economic plan to systematically reduce the U.S. trade deficit and to achieve a merchandise trade balance by the year 2007. 
While it is not clear what the particular reasons for this growing trade deficit may be, nor what the long term impacts of a persistently growing deficit may be, the time is overdue for a detailed examination of the factors causing the deficit. We need to understand the impacts of it on specific U.S. industrial and manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, we need to identify the gaps that exist in our data bases and economic measurements to adequately understand the specific nature of the impacts of the deficit on such important things as our manufacturing capacity and the integrity of our industrial base, on productivity, jobs and wages in specific sectors. 
Throughout the 1980's, my own State of West Virginia literally bled manufacturing jobs. We saw the jobs of hardworking, honest West Virginians in the glass, steel, pottery, shoe manufacturing and leather goods industries--and other so-called smokestack industries--hemorrhage across our borders and shipped overseas. While economic development efforts in my State have commendably encouraged our businesses to refocus to help recover from those losses, the lack of knowledge about the causes and impact of our trade deficit leaves West Virginia, and the nation as a whole, at 
a disadvantage in the arena of global competition. 
We debate the trade deficit from time to time. We moan about it. We complain about it. But, if we do not understand the nature, of the long-term vulnerabilities that such manufacturing imbalances create in our economy and standard of living, we are surely in the dark. It appears to me that debate over trade matters too often takes on the form of rhetorical bombast regarding so-called protectionists versus so-called free traders. This is hardly a debate worthy of the name, given the problems we are facing. It is not an informed debate. We are talking past each other, and in far too general terms. It has been more of an ideological exchange than a real debate, primarily because we have not had sufficient analytical work done on the data bearing on this problem. Neither side knows enough about what is really transpiring in our economy, given the very recent nature of these persistent deficits. 
Certainly we know that the deficit reflects on the ability of American business to compete abroad. We want to be competitive. Certainly we know that specific deficits with specific trading partners cause frictions between the United States and our friends and allies. This is particularly the case with the Japanese, and is quickly becoming the case with China. It is clear that the trade deficit has contributed to the depreciation of the dollar and the ability of Americans to afford foreign products. Less clear, but of vital importance, is the relationship of the trade deficit to other important policy questions on the table between the United States and our foreign trading partners. 
Attempts by the United States to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers in the Japan and China markets, which clearly restrict access of U.S. goods to those markets, have been crippled by the intervention of other, more important policy goals. During the cold war, the United States-Japan security relationship had a severe dampening effect on our efforts to reduce these myriad barriers in Japan to United States exports. The same effect appears to have resulted from our need for the Japanese to participate in our treasury bill auctions. This becomes a closed cycle--the need to finance the trade deficit with foreign capital, resulting in regular involvement of the Japanese Government in our treasury bill auctions, seems to dampen our efforts to push the Japanese on market-opening arrangements. Naturally, without reciprocal open markets, the trade imbalance remains exaggerated between the United States and Japan, prompting further need for Japanese financial support to fund the national debt. Of course, this is a vicious circle. Thus, some argue that the need for Japanese involvement in financing our national debt hurt the ability of our trade negotiators to get stronger provisions in the dispute settled last year over the Japanese market for auto parts. 
Similar considerations appear to prevail in negotiating market access with the Chinese in the area of intellectual property. 
While our trade negotiator managed a laudable, very specific agreement with the Chinese in 1995 in this area, the Chinese were derelict in implementing it, leading to another high-wire negotiation last year to avoid sanctions on the Chinese, and to get the Chinese to implement the accord as they had promised. Again, it is unclear whether the Chinese will now follow through in a consistent manner with the implementing mechanisms for the intellectual property agreement belatedly agreed to in the latest negotiation. The highly trumpeted mantra about how the U.S.-China relationship will be one of, if not the most important, U.S. bilateral relationship for the next half century, has a chilling effect on insisting on fair, reciprocal treatment, and good faith implementation of agreements signed with the Chinese government. 
The Chinese government has again recently reiterated its desire to become a member of the World Trade Organization and certainly her interest in joining that organization is a commendable indication of her willingness to submit to the rules of that organization regarding her trading practices. There is legitimate concern however, that insufficient progress has been made by the Chinese on removing a wide variety of non tariff discriminatory barriers to U.S. goods and services, as she committed to do in the 1992 bilateral Market Access Memorandum of Understanding [MOU]. Indeed, in the 1996 report by the United States Trade Representative entitled foreign trade barriers, the amount of material devoted to the range of such barriers on the part of China is exceeded only by the material on Japan, indicating that we have a continued persistent problem that needs serious attention along these lines. 
It will only be when we truly understand the specific impacts of these large deficits on our economy, particularly our industrial and manufacturing base, that the importance of insisting on fair play in the matter of trade will become clear. 
Finally, the legislation requires the Commission to examine alternative strategies which we can pursue to achieve the systematic reduction of the deficit, particularly how to retard the migration of our manufacturing base abroad, and the changes that might be needed to our basic trade agreements and practices. 
These are the purposes of the Commission that Senator Dorgan and I have proposed in this legislation. 
I commend the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his studious approach to this question. He is as knowledgeable, if not more so, than certainly most other Senators, and perhaps any other Senators, as far as I am concerned, on this subject. I am pleased to join him in offering this proposal for the consideration of the Senate. 
I hope that many of our colleagues will join us, and that we can secure passage of the proposal in the near future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on the outstanding job performed by the West Virginia National Guard in response to the recent catastrophic floods that devastated sixteen West Virginia counties. 
Aviation, engineer, and troop command personnel have worked diligently and wholeheartedly to deliver potable water, fuel, cleaning supplies, and medicines to their fellow citizens who have been trapped by the flood waters. They have also provided transportation, cleanup assistance, and debris removal in all sixteen counties in the emergency zone. 
The approximately five-hundred men and women mobilized in these Guard units carry the double burden of civilian jobs in addition to their military roles. Despite these burdens, they are capable of responding to an emergency at a moment's notice. Thanks to the National Guard's efforts, families in many of the affected counties have been able to return to their homes and begin the repair and rebuilding process. West Virginians in Wayne and Cabell counties are still faced with removing large amounts of debris, but again, thanks to the National Guard's efforts, the cleanup is on the right track. 
I would also like to thank all of the employers throughout West Virginia who have supported the National Guard. Their willingness to continue to accommodate the National Guard through all of the flood emergencies suffered by West Virginia communities in recent years is remarkable and is appreciated by every West Virginian who has benefitted from Guard efforts. 
I offer my sincere thanks to all of the National Guard personnel involved in helping in West Virginia's recovery from this and every natural disaster. May their efforts to aid West Virginia's flood victims continue, and may they receive the recognition and praise that are so merited. They are, indeed, famous men and women to their fellow citizens.

Mr. BYRD. Ralph Waldo Emerson, in an oration delivered on August 31, 1867, said: 
This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to with it. 
`This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it.' 
As the Senate considers the proposed constitutional amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, it is my fervent hope that each of us takes heed of Emerson's portentous words. 
We have an opportunity to take an important step in the direction of restoring the people's faith in our ability to rise above partisanship and really do something about our present system of financing Federal campaigns. It is rotten. It is putrid. It stinks. The danger, as always, is that we will `circle the wagons,' and avoid taking legal action aimed at meaningful reform. 
Mr. President, as each day dawns, the public is confronted with new and increasingly garish allegations concerning the campaign financing practices that have become a way of life in our Nation. 
Mr. President, we may be able to fool ourselves, but the time has come for all of us to stop trying to fool the American people. They are more than aware that both political parties--both political parties, not just one--abuse the current system and that both political parties fear to change because they don't want to lose their own perceived advantages. One party perceives certain advantages, and the other party perceives different advantages to its cause. But the insidious system of campaign fundraising and the increasing awareness by the people of our unwillingness to change it, will eventually lead to the destruction of our very system of Government. For our own sakes and for the sake of our people we must find ways to stop this political minuet, and come to grips with the fact that we can't have it both ways. We can't continue to launch broadsides at each other and refuse to admit that we all bear the blame--all of us, in both parties. We have it in our power to change things and the excuses we creatively craft to duck that responsibility are utterly hollow and quite transparent. 
The incessant money chase that currently permeates every crevice of our political system is like an unending circular marathon. And it is a race that sends a clear message to the people that it is money--money--money, not ideas, not principles, but money that reigns supreme in American politics. No longer are candidates judged fit for office first and foremost by their positions on the issues. No longer are they judged by their experience and their capabilities. Instead, potential candidates are judged by their ability to raise the millions, and tens of millions of dollars, and even hundreds of millions of dollars that it takes to run an effective campaign. 
The average cost of a U.S. Senate race is $4.5 million. When I first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1958, I ran with Jennings Randolph, as the two candidates for the Senate. We were two candidates for two different Senate seats from West Virginia. Jennings Randolph ran for the 2-year term, the unexpired term of the late Matthew Mansfield Neely. I ran for the 6-year term. Each of us won the nomination, and then after the primary we joined together and we marshaled our monetary forces, which amounted to something like $50,000--$50,000 for two Senators. And that was more than had earlier been necessary in campaigns in West Virginia. We didn't have much television in those days. We didn't have political consultants. And so we ran on a war chest of $50,000. But the average cost of a U.S. Senate race today is $4.5 million. It can cost $10 million or $20 million or more to run for the Senate in some parts of the country today. 
Now, how in the future can a poor boy from back in the sticks of West Virginia, or any other State, hope to become a United States Senator? How can a former welder in a shipyard, a former meatcutter in a coal mining community, a former produce salesman, a former groceryman--how can one hope to ascend the ladder to the high office of United States Senator? It will be beyond the means of such persons. 
The American people believe that the way to gain access and influence on Capitol Hill is through money. And the American people are exactly right. The way to gain access on Capitol Hill, the way to get the attention of Members of this body is through money. The Bible says, `The love of money is the root of all evil.' This campaign system that we now have bears that out. 
Anyone who reads the daily newspaper would have no trouble coming to the conclusion that the best way to gain access to the White House is to be a so-called `fat cat contributor.' Now, who can fault such logic? It is as plain as the nose on your face. We have to stop this madness. We must put an end to the seemingly limitless escalation of campaign costs and their pervasive influence of the special interests and the wealthy. We must act to put the United States Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Presidency of the United States back within the reach of anyone with the brains, the spirit, the guts, and the desire to want to serve. And the proposed constitutional amendment before us today is a necessary step on the way to accomplishing that goal. 
Now, I am aware that opponents of this measure--and they have a right to their opinion--would say that it would be wrong to amend the Constitution in this fashion. They will say that, although I may be right about the need for change in our current fundraising system, I am just wrong about this proposed amendment. I am very reluctant to amend the Constitution, but I am not above amending it. The Constitution contains a provision, as we all know, that was included by the framers of that document that points the way and is the guide, the roadmap to amending the Constitution. It is well known that I believe that we tinker with the careful checks and balances of that document at our peril. But a Supreme Court decision in Buckley versus Valeo, a decision which I believe to be flawed, has all but doomed the prospects for comprehensive legislative reform of this campaign finance system otherwise. 
By equating campaign expenditures with free speech, Buckley versus Valeo has made it impossible for us to control the ever-spiraling money chase and to put anything but voluntary spending limits on Federal campaigns. This basic inflexibility makes any legislation intended to control the cancerous effects of too much money in politics complicated and convoluted. The contortions such legislation has to resort to, simply because we cannot mandate spending limits, create new opportunities for abuse as fast as we attempt to close down the old ones. 
How do we pass any statute--any statute of consequence, that is--when the Supreme Court has told us that spending equals speech? Spending equals speech. Well, if that is the case, I don't have the equality of free speech that many Members in this body profess. 
How do we place any kind of reasonable limit on fundraising and spending when the law of the land says that to do so violates the first amendment of the Constitution? How do we end $40 million Senate campaigns and $400 million Presidential campaigns when the Supreme Court tells us that those amounts are constitutionally protected? How do we really reform the system within the bounds of that judicial interpretation? The plain truth is that it cannot be done effectively unless we do amend the Constitution. 
We can tinker around the edges, of course. But we cannot enact comprehensive legislation that will get at the heart of the problem. We cannot, consistent with the Court's ruling in Buckley versus Valeo, put an end to the hundreds of millions of dollars that are raised in `soft money' contributions, or the hundreds of millions of dollars that are spent through so-called `independent expenditures.' I wish we could. But the fact is that we cannot get the kind of legislation we really need unless we first pass an amendment to the Constitution which nullifies Buckley versus Valeo. 
We have heard the first amendment invoked in Buckley. We have heard the argument that we must not infringe upon freedom of speech. I believe that a continued failure to control campaign costs is actually what is injurious to free speech for all in political campaigns. Money has become the great `unequalizer'--the great `unequalizer'--in political campaigns. Money talks. Money talks, and a lot of money talks louder than a little money. Would anyone claim that the average citizen or the small contributor has the same access to, the same influence with, politicians as the major contributor or the big PAC representative? Well, take it from me, he doesn't. Whose opinions are heard? Whose free speech is heard? Whose `speech" gets through to the people who count in Washington? 
In the case of elections, who is more likely to win but the candidate who can buy more TV time, the candidate who can afford more publicity, a bigger staff? So much for free speech. When it comes to our political system, speech is very, very, very expensive indeed. 
In a very real sense, Buckley versus Valeo disenfranchised those of moderate and less than moderate means from having their views heard and weighted equally with those who can afford to contribute huge sums. 
Who would stand here on the floor and tell me that the money that a poor coal miner is able to contribute will entitle that coal miner to the same freedom of speech and the same influence with his representatives in Washington as the wealthy can enjoy? 
In a very real sense, Buckley versus Valeo, as I say, disenfranchised those of moderate means, the individual who works with his hands, who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow. He can't speak loudly enough to be heard in the corridors of his representatives in Washington. 
The influence of money has completely contorted the intent of the first amendment when it comes to our political system. And Buckley versus Valeo has written that contortion into our organic law. 
Additionally, Buckley versus Valeo further disenfranchised those who might endeavor to run for political office because it makes it practically impossible for most individuals to afford to run for office themselves unless they are either independently wealthy or a well-financed incumbent. What is that but an effective denial of the basic right of any capable, motivated citizen to stand for Federal office? And what is that but the setting up of classes of citizens, some of whom have more basic rights, some of whom have more freedom of speech because they have more money than others? It is nonsensical. 
I believe that the Court in recent years, beginning with Buckley versus Valeo, has been far too dogmatic when it comes to the first amendment. First amendment rights are not absolute. Ever since Mr. Justice Holmes wrote that the right of freedom of speech does not include the right to falsely shout `fire'--it is all right to shout `fire' in a crowded theater if there is a fire. So there is a distinction. The right of freedom of speech does not include the right to falsely shout `fire' in a crowded theater. Ever since Mr. Justice Holmes wrote that, we have realized that there must and can be certain limitations on free speech. Certainly when there is a compelling Government interest in the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corruption, the Court has generally understood that limitations can be imposed. There could be few instances in which a compelling governmental interest in preventing corruption is more obvious than the example of the bedrock of our representative democracy--fair elections. 
As the Court said in Gibney versus Empire Storage and Ice Co., '. . . It has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced or carried out by means of language, spoken, written or printed.' 
So, Mr. President, when it comes to modern political campaigns, it is only when there are no mandated expenditure limits that an inequality in free speech arises. The only real way to correct that inequity is to mandate limits on campaign expenditures. If the rules of the game are equal for all and fair to all, then no one is at a disadvantage simply because of purchasing power. 
Mr. Hollings' amendment would begin to correct the mechanistic, sterile jurisprudence that has reared its head in recent Court decisions regarding the first amendment and set us on a more correct course. The various ingenious forms of modern campaigning with their outlandish expenditures were never contemplated by James Madison and the other framers of the Constitution--never contemplated. 
Only a blatant disregard for the obscene disadvantage which money can convey when not controlled in a political campaign could cause one to turn a blind eye to the need to respond to violence done to our Republic by a continued failure to put some limitations on campaign expenditures. 
Mr. President, the time has come to stop. We have tried the legislative course. When I was majority leader during the 100th Congress, I tried eight times--eight times--to break a filibuster against campaign spending reform. 
Robert Bruce, the great leader of the Scots, tried seven times, and it was after the seventh time--as he had lain in the loft of a barn and seen the spider attempt to spin his web from rafter to rafter, it was on the seventh time that the spider was successful in reaching the rafter--we are told that gave Robert Bruce the spirit and the inspiration and the faith he could try the seventh time and win. Well, I tried eight times. I was not successful in breaking the filibuster. I tried more times to invoke cloture than any leader has ever tried. It would not work. It is not going to work the next time. 
The time has come to stop. It is time to set aside the partisan bickering, the constant sniping, the ceaseless one-upmanship, and the incessant covering, and do something that will give us the powers necessary to get at the root of the problem. Hiding behind the first amendment will not work. If we continue to try to hide behind the first amendment, we are going to destroy the trust of the people in our Government, in our system of Government. That is a system that is based on the people's trust. 
It is not valid to hide behind the first amendment. This is about allowing more freedom of speech than less. It is about returning Government to the man in the street, to the woman who rocks the cradle and makes a home. Give them freedom of speech. It is about returning Government to that man and that woman and getting it out of the corporate boardrooms and the country clubs. 
Fear is a very terrible thing. It is terrible because it paralyzes. Fear clouds judgment. Fear of losing advantage is what has driven both parties' reluctance to enact meaningful campaign finance reform in the past, and that same fear is what is driving the current reluctance. But the fixation with maintaining advantage is blinding us to a much greater and more serious peril: the total loss of credibility. Credibility is a precious commodity. We politicians have collectively squandered our credibility over the last several years because of the unchecked rise of the influence of money in politics. Already our people do not vote. They do not vote because they think politicians are all the same and that an individual vote does not matter anymore. Politicians are not trusted because all that concerns them, at least to the perception of the average citizen, is money and winning the next election. 
I served as majority leader from the years 1977 through 1980 and again in the years 1987 and 1988, and I served as minority leader during the 6 years in between. It was a constant problem to be a leader and to program the Senate and to operate the Senate, and became increasingly a problem because of the money needs, the needs of the money chase. Senators had to go here; they had to go there; they had to raise money; they had to go for lunch; they had to go for dinner; they had to spend overnight. And it was virtually impossible to schedule votes at any time that would please any and everybody. 
The thing that seemed to be most needful in this Senate during those years that I was the leader of my party was money, running around the country with a tin cup in one's hand raising money for a little, measly $134,000-a-year job. It is the most demeaning aspect of our lives as Senators, to have to run around and raise money. And it is getting worse. 
The very fiber of what holds a Republic like ours together--trust--is ripping audibly with each new scandal, each new revelation in the press. And so I ask my colleagues to turn away from that course. We can start today. We can use what appears to be a low point in American politics to take an important step toward the good. 
We can remove this obstacle to real reform, crafted by a wrongheaded Supreme Court decision, and restore some precious equality to our political system. 
Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, who is our leader in this effort. We probably won't win today. But it will be to the American people's loss. `This is a good time,' as Ralph Waldo Emerson said, `if only we know what to do with it.' Let us not squander an opportunity to begin to fix this thoroughly rotten campaign finance system once and for all. Let us not continue to disappoint the American people out there. 
I urge my colleagues to take a stand and support this proposed amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is a most felicitous time. The ides of March, so dark with shadows of Caesar's doom some 2,041 years ago, is safely past, and that welcome harbinger of the season's turn, the vernal equinox, is close at hand. On March 15, 44 B.C., Julius Caesar was slain in the Senate of Rome by a group of conspirators led by Marcus Junius Brutus. On the following day, March 16, 2,041 years ago, Brutus went to the Forum to speak to the people of Rome, but he was forced to retire to the Capitol after threats were made against the conspirators. On March 17, today, 2,041 years ago, Antony, after negotiating with the conspirators, convened the Senate in the temple of Tellus. In that meeting, a decree was passed that no inquiry would be made into the murder of Caesar, and that all of his enactments and dispositions should remain valid for the welfare of the Republic. And that is what the Senate of Rome was occupied with on this day. 
But today in 1997, the daffodils are blooming, the grass is greening, the crocuses are peeping from the soil, and it is a time to celebrate the birth of a new season. On March 16, seven decades ago, 1,971 years after Brutus spoke to the people of Rome, one of our most sage and respected Senators was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And today, March 17, instead of meeting to speak on the death of Caesar, I am here in the Senate to honor the life of my colleague from Pindars Corners. Pindar, as I am sure my learned friend, the distinguished Senator from New York, knows well, was a Greek poet who lived from circa 522 to circa 438 B.C. Young Daniel Patrick Moynihan soon moved to New York with his family, and, after a wartime tour aboard the U.S.S. Quirinus, he, Patrick Moynihan, launched his own illustrious academic and public service career. 
Now, the U.S.S. Quirinus was named after the Sabine God of War and was identified with the deity of Romulus. 
Senator Moynihan brings a wide-ranging background to his duties as the senior Senator from New York. He has served in the cabinets of four Presidents--Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. He has served as ambassador to Indian, and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. 
He has received 60 honorary degrees from colleges and universities--60! His talents have enhanced organizations from the National Commission to Reform Social Security to the President's Science Advisory Committee. 
As an academic and as a public servant, Senator Moynihan has turned his inquisitive and incisive intellect to some of the most pressing and enduring problems of our society. His thorough and humane understanding of poverty in America and of the Social Security system enlightens and informs our discourse. The books that he has published over the years on these and other subjects are remarkable for their prescience. I know that his statements on the floor are followed closely by Members, staff, and the public, and that they never fail to bring into sharp focus the difficult core of the current debate. To hearken back to the poet Pindar, I note that he observed in his `Olympian Odes,' `Vocal to the wise; but for the crowd they need interpreters.' Senator Moynihan is the Senate's interpreter on many of the important issues facing the country today. 
And so, Mr. President, as a septuagenarian and one who is soon to become an octogenarian, I welcome Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to the club of septuagenarians. 
The Psalmist says, `The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.' 
The Lord has blessed Senator Moynihan with the gift of having reached that seventieth year. I was 10 years old when Pat Moynihan was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in that year of 1927. That was the year in which Charles Lindbergh took off on the morning of May 20, in his plane, The Spirit of St. Louis, and flew from New York City to Paris, with five sandwiches--he ate half of one. At times, he flew ten feet above the water and, at times, 10,000 feet above the water. I remember the newspaper headlines speaking of Lindbergh's flight, saying that he flew over Newfoundland at the `great speed' of 100 miles an hour. And then that was the year when, on September 22, Dempsey fought Gene Tunney. Jack Dempsey was a former coal miner from Logan County, West Virginia. Of course, the coal miners were rooting for Dempsey. And as a boy 10 years of age, I was rooting for Dempsey, also. My coal miner dad told me that we would listen to the fight on the radio, which was that marvelous invention that everybody was talking about. That was the first radio I ever saw when we gathered in the community recreation facility in that coal mining community 70 years ago. I was disappointed that evening because Dempsey did not regain the title, nor did I get to hear the fight, because there was only one set of earphones. And then a few days later, on September 30, Babe Ruth batted his 60th home run and exceeded his own record of 59 home runs. It was also in that year that Henry Ford brought out his new Model A Ford. Hundreds of thousands of people tried to get into Ford headquarters in New York to see it in December 1927. 
So, Mr. President, I offer my best wishes to Senator Moynihan on the occasion of his birthday. I thank him for all that he has contributed to his country and to the Senate. I hope that he and his charming wife Liz--and my wife Erma joins me in this--will share his day of celebration with their children, knowing that the respect of his fellow Senators and his fellow countrymen are theirs. James I said, `I can make a lord, but only God Almighty can make a gentleman.' 
Only God Almighty could make a Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, we reach another milestone in the Senate's continually unfolding history. Let us pause for a minute to reflect on a fiftieth anniversary of great institutional significance. 
On March 17, 1947, for the first time, the Congressional Record carried a section under the modest heading `Daily Digest.' 
Fiftieth anniversary? Has not the Congressional Record been in existence since March 4, 1873? By my reckoning, that adds up to 124 years, not fifty! Is it possible that there was ever a Congressional Record without a Daily Digest? Those of us who pick up the Record each morning and instinctively turn to the Daily Digest might find that difficult to believe. No one who regularly consults the Congressional Record could reasonably doubt the Daily Digest's value as the indispensable point of entry for a bulky compendium that often runs to hundreds and hundreds of closely printed, three-columned pages. 
By the mid-1940's the Record had become so thick that without some sort of daily finding aid, it was becoming practically unusable. Several commercial firms sought to remedy the situation. In 1943 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce hired Dr. Floyd Riddick, a highly regarded specialist in congressional procedure, to edit a new publication entitled Legislative Daily. The Daily's instant popularity caught the attention of congressional reformers in the final months of World War II. Desiring to expand public access to the record of Senate and House deliberations, they included in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 a provision for a Congressional Record Daily Digest. This new section would outline chamber and committee activities for the previous day and present a schedule of the current day's legislative program, including a list of committee meetings and hearings. The statute directed the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House to oversee Digest preparation for their respective chambers. 
Fortunately for the Senate, Dr. Riddick agreed to serve as Senate Digest editor. Starting the Digest was no easy task. Overburdened committee clerks initially resisted taking the additional notes for Digest citations. Getting accurate information at the committee level was particularly important, for in those distant days, once a measure cleared a committee it was pretty much in shape for final passage. Times have changed! Thanks to Dr. Riddick's persistence and expertise, the Digest that he established remains virtually intact a half-century later. 
Floyd Riddick served as Senate editor from 1947 to 1952, when he moved to the newly created post of Assistant Senate Parliamentarian. He subsequently served as Senate Parliamentarian from 1964 until his formal retirement a decade later. I say `formal,' because Dr. Riddick remained with the Senate on an unsalaried basis to prepare a history of the Committee on Rules and Administration and, most importantly, to revise the indispensable volume that now bears the title Riddick's Senate Procedure. Today, Dr. Riddick continues a productive retirement in South Carolina.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was disappointed to note that the United States, alone among its allies on the United Nations Security Council, vetoed a proposed resolution urging Israel to abandon its plans to build housing for Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem. This housing initiative, which was reported last week to have been pushed by the right wing of Prime Minister Netanyahu's party, threw a cold towel on the peace process that had been so painfully promoted through U.S. intermediation. 
Indeed, the President and the Secretary of State, Ms. Albright, both correctly criticized Israel's position on this issue. It is unfortunate that the President felt compelled to mix that clear signal of American displeasure with an American veto of essentially the same policy position, expressed in a United Nations Security Council resolution. American policy on this very important matter needs more consistency if the United States intends to maximize its influence and leadership on the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that the message of displeasure has been diluted, because that softening risks emboldening the hard-liners in Israel who act as if they do not want that process to succeed. 
I believe that the policy of the administration rightly remains opposed to the recently announced settlement initiative by the Israeli government, and I spoke out on the floor a few days ago in support of that position. It does not seem logically consistent that a Security Council resolution essentially expressing the same disapproval could in any way itself `jeopardize efforts to keep the peace process moving', as was reported by the Washington Post on March 8, 1997. Strong leadership on this matter requires sustained consistency in all foras, both national and international regarding American policy, and I hope that there will be further opportunities to make our very correct position in opposition to this new housing initiative abundantly clear. 
The Israeli leader stands at a pivotal point in the Middle East. The peace process is clearly very fragile, and great efforts are needed on a sustained basis by all the parties, not some of the parties, for it to succeed. The alarming exchange of letters between King Hussein and Prime Minister Netanyahu, released publicly yesterday reveals the damage that the Israeli housing initiative is causing. Neither the U.S., not the Palestenians, nor the Israeli people should passively allow the Israeli right wing to sabotage this process anytime it decides it has gone far enough for their taste. I congratulate the President for sending an American envoy to meet in Gaza with Mr. Arafat on the overall situation. 
I make an urgent plea to Prime Minister Netanyahu to look history in the face and to take a bold step and reverse his decision on the housing matter, regardless of the merits of the initiative in his mind from a narrow geographical perspective. This decision has become the central indicator of his government's commitment to peace in the Middle East. It is clear that, regardless of any merits which may attach to the housing decision, it is causing grave damage to the peace process which our governments have worked so painfully to engender. Therefore, I urge the Israeli Prime Minister to reverse that decision. This would certainly require considerable personal courage and political difficulty on his part, but it would mark him as a true leader at a time when such leadership is desperately needed. He alone is in the position to make a crucial change in the present explosive atmosphere. The process of peace in the Middle East has reached a vital juncture, and its future is highly dependent on the action he takes now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to voice my support for the nomination of Federico PenAE6a to be Secretary of Energy during President Clinton's second term in office. 
Mr. PenAE6a served ably as Secretary of Transportation during the first Clinton Administration, and I look forward to working with him as he assumes new responsibilities at the Department of Energy. The challenges at DOE are vast, and Mr. PenAE6a's management skills and ability to work with different groups should prove very useful in responding to the complex issues which are the responsibility of the Department of Energy. 
Prior to joining the Clinton Administration, Mr. PenAE6a served as Mayor of Denver from 1983 to 1991, and as a Colorado legislator. During his tenure as mayor, Mr. PenAE6a played an active role in reviving the Denver economy from its mid-1980s decline through a series of bold initiatives. At a time when major new international airports were not being built in this country, he gained approval for one of the largest and most technological advanced airports in the world. As Secretary of Transportation, Mr. PenAE6a proudly participated in the dedication of Denver International Airport in February, 1995. 
While he served as Secretary of Transportation, I worked closely with Secretary PenAE6a regarding the transportation issues in my home state of West Virginia. He now moves to a department that has responsibility for a different set of issues, but issues that are very important to the current and future economic prosperity of my state. Coal is not only a major economic and employment influence in West Virginia, but coal is a critical component of our national energy picture. At the present time, and projected into the future, fossil fuels remain the dominant source for our energy supply picture. At present, fossil fuels supply 85 percent of our energy requirements. Coal is the source of 55 percent of our nation's electricity. So policies that affect coal and the role of fossil fuels in our energy picture are of great interest--not just to the states that are the source of these fuels but also to the nation as a whole because of the potential for significant disruption if abrupt changes are recommended without giving the economy a chance to prepare and adjust. 
As Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary-designate PenAE6a on our energy policy issues. In addition to serving as the Ranking Member on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I also serve on the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee--both of which have jurisdiction over parts of the DOE budget. At a time of constrained budgets and pressure to downsize the Federal workforce, we must also be attentive to the realities of our energy supply picture. Thus, I have been, and will continue to be, supportive of investments in technology development that will contribute to our using and producing energy more efficiently, as well as producing energy in more environmentally-sensitive ways. The Department of Energy has a visible physical presence in West Virginia at the Federal Energy Technology Center facility in Morgantown, which employs some 550 persons directly and under contract. I look forward to working with Mr. PenAE6a to ensure a continued future for this important part of our Federal technical infrastructure. 
There is a need within the Administration for a strong voice on behalf of fossil energy, and particularly coal, and I believe Mr. PenAE6a is capable of meeting this challenge. I wish him well in his new job, and urge my colleagues to support his confirmation. I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week the Israeli leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, decided to authorize a politically volatile housing project for Israeli settlers in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem. This disappointing act has thrown into confusion the promising opening that was generated by the long and difficult, but successful negotiations last month, which culminated in an agreement returning control of the West Bank city of Hebron to the Palestinians. The United States invested very considerable efforts, negotiating talent and prestige to move the peace process along. The agreement over Hebron gave the world great hope that a long-term peaceful settlement of the outstanding issues between Israel and the Palestinians was on an upward track. 
Therefore, it is very unfortunate, in my view, that the reality of the substantial success over Hebron prompted the right wing of Israeli politics to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu into this latest act on housing settlements. According to the New York Times of March 2, 1997, `a powerful group of Mr. Netanyahu's conservative colleagues' `leaned on him' to prove his commitment to Jerusalem by building Har Homa, threatening to bring down the government if he failed. With new territorial concessions to the Palestinians looming, Mr. Netanyahu told Americans and Palestinians privately that he had to `fill his right wing tank' on Har Homa if he was to keep on the peace route. 
This is a most disappointing situation. Progress on peace is regarded as a threat by the Israeli right wing and has resulted in efforts to force the Prime Minister to retreat from his own success. The Israeli right wing should know that their behavior will have consequences in the United States, and I for one will relate my support for their agenda to their support of that of the United States, which is a fair, equitable and just peace in Jerusalem and the Middle East. The process of American intermediations between the Israelis and Palestinians is a serious matter and we cannot stand by and watch the Israeli right wing, at their whim, pull the rug out from under whatever progress is accomplished. Such actions should be understood to have consequences for support for Israel's various interests as they are considered by Senators. 
I hope the Israeli Prime Minister will do better at withstanding the pressure of his right wing and, that the considerable influence of American groups will be exercised to counter those negative pressures. I hope, as I am sure my colleagues do, that the peace process will not be derailed by the actions of an extreme right wing minority in Israel and that the settlements issue will be adjusted by the Prime Minister to reflect the opportunity that the successful Hebron agreement has provided. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, for his courtesy in allowing me to proceed ahead of him. I thank him very much indeed.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on several occasions during the last few days some of the proponents of the balanced budget amendment here in the Senate have taken to the floor and to the airwaves, and other ways to criticize those Senators who have seen fit to follow the dictates of their own conscience and oppose the balanced budget amendment which was defeated in the Senate by a single vote last evening. 
In the main, these attacks seem to have been directed especially at those Members who may have indicated support for a balanced budget amendment during a campaign, but found it impossible to support the particular amendment which was put before the Senate for a vote. 
I should say parenthetically at this point that I voted for the balanced budget amendment in 1982. I had not thought much about it at that time. I had not studied it. But following my vote for that amendment on that occasion I decided to study the matter and to consider it seriously, and consider the impact upon the Constitution. And I changed my vote from 1982 to 1986. In 1986 I voted against a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and I have been against it ever since, and I always will be against it because I have given it thorough consideration and thought. And I have come up with a conclusion that I am very comfortable with. 
So there are those who may have indicated support for a balanced budget amendment during the campaign but found it impossible to support the particular amendment, as I say, which was put before the Senate for a vote on yesterday. 
I rise today to again congratulate those Members, who, after careful study of the specifics of this particular amendment, had the intelligence and the courage and the vision to discern the amendment's obvious flaws, and the courage to follow the dictates of their own consciences. 
More and more the trend today in political life in America is to blindly endorse proposals, simply because they are popular or because they fit neatly into a set of ideological preconditions endorsed by one political party, or the other. The specifics, the details, the actual impact of many of these political `no-brainers,' if you will, is glossed over in favor of the attraction of simplicity and ideological purity. Just as we have `dumbed down' our textbooks, the last decade has made a `dumbing down' of our politics as well. I often think that we insult the American people with the obvious demagoguery which spews forth from Washington in the form of pandering and very-very-tired, old cliches. 
I would like to remind my colleagues that law and legislating is about the examination of details. We don't legislate one-liners, or campaign slogans. Here, in this body and in the other body, we put the force of the law behind details that impact mightily upon the daily lives of our people. That is a solemn responsibility. And it is more important than political popularity, or winning the next election or marching lockstep to the orders of one political party, or another. 
Especially in the case of amending the Constitution, that responsibility weighs more heavily. For in that instance we are contemplating changes in our basic, fundamental organic law--changes that, when once implanted in that revered document, can only be removed at great difficulty, and which will impact, quite possibly, upon generations of Americans who, yet unborn, must trust us to guard their birthright as Americans. 
Once the Constitution is amended, it takes quite a while to repeal that amendment, as we saw in the case of the 18th amendment--the prohibition amendment--which became a part of the Constitution in January 1919, and it was not removed from the Constitution until December 1933. In other words, it was in the Constitution for 15 years before it could be repealed. So we have to be very, very careful when it comes to amending the Constitution. It is most unlike passing a law, or amending a law, which can be repealed within the same calendar year here in the Congress. 
The suggestion has been made on this floor that to change one's mind and to go against a statement made in a campaign is somehow a disservice to this country. Well, I differ, and I differ strongly. What I think I am hearing on the floor of this Senate is nothing more than an effort to use an individual Member's vote against a popular, but fatally flawed proposal, to cut politically against that Member, and further to use the Senate floor for the crass political purpose of meddling in the politics of several of the sovereign States. 
A campaign pledge is one thing, but may I remind all of those who worship at the altar of campaign pledges that there is another pledge that each of us makes as we stand before this body and before we assume the office of United States Senator. That pledge is a solemn oath taken with one hand on the Bible and ending in the words `so help me God.' 
Now, that is a pledge that will trump all of the campaign pledges. Forget about the campaign pledges. Those who make pledges in campaigns, if it is their first campaign for the Senate, they have not been in the Senate and they have not heard the debate on a given matter. They haven't listened to their colleagues in the Senate. Oh, they have been Members of the House, as I was a Member of the House at one time. But once they enter this body, they are a Member of the United States Senate, the only forum of the States that exists in this great Government of ours. It is a different body. They then represent a different constituency--usually. And so it is quite a different thing. 
It is our oath of office that is overriding. In it we swear before the Creator to `support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.'

I thank him for reciting this jewel by a great Irish statesman, Edmund Burke, who I believe lost the next election after he had made that statement. He may have foreseen that, but nevertheless he made the statement. It still lives, and it is a very appropriate guiding charter, in my judgment, for those of us in this Chamber today.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I strongly support the adoption of the amendment introduced by the senior Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings]. On the face of it, it is a straightforward, simple proposition that attempts to preserve the integrity of the laws that we pass, and that are the subject of discussion and/or negotiation between the United States and other nations. It says that if our Executive branch negotiators reach an agreement which amends or repeals U.S. law, that agreement may not be implemented until the agreement is approved by the Congress. Who could dispute such an obviously valid proposition? 
The case at hand, the negotiation of a new telecommunications services agreement, apparently effects changes in U.S. law dealing with access to the U.S. market in relation to the access of American companies into foreign markets. This is a matter which was very controversial in connection with the consideration of the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996. In working with the Commerce committee on this legislation, I was involved in developing certain changes to section 310(b) of the underlying statute dealing with foreign ownership. The matter was so controversial that the conferees on that legislation were unable to reach agreement, and changes to the foreign ownership provisions were dropped from the final conference agreement. 
It is all the more important that our negotiations, in the light of the controversial nature of this matter, take care not to effect what amounts to a change in the law by virtue of negotiating a provision of an international agreement without taking the role of the Congress into account. The law and an agreement should not be put into conflict on such a matter, and Senator Hollings is right to insist that no such negotiated change should be implemented until the Congress has agreed by amending the law which governs the situation.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont. May I say that if he has any problem with speakers whom he may have promised some time, if I can be of any help with my time, I would like him to let me know and I will yield some of it. 
Mr. President, when the delegates gathered in Philadelphia in May of 1787, much was riding on their deliberations. No one can read the speeches and notes from the Constitutional Convention and miss the tenseness in the air as the men who gathered in May contemplated the sheer magnitude of their task. The situation in the states was critical. These men were charged with nothing less than breathing life into the promise of the beautiful prose crafted by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. They would be held accountable if they failed. 
What happened in that room in Philadelphia was extraordinary. What emerged was a near perfect balance of order and liberty, and a careful equanimity between individual freedom and the need for the security of all. George Washington described the result as, `little short of a miracle.' Indeed, one cannot read the Constitution without marveling at the genius of its sparsely worded Articles. I have often felt that surely the spirit of the Creator himself was present in the sultry air during that season in Philadelphia. 
But, the amendment which the Senate has been considering for the last 11 session days would rudely disrupt the carefully balanced powers of the three branches so assiduously planned by the Framers. It would, for the first time in our history, write a specific fiscal policy into a Constitution intended to accommodate the ages. It would subjugate every endeavor, every need, every aspiration of the people of this nation to one goal--the goal of perpetually maintaining budget balance. It would turn a system which has operated well for over 200 years because of its underlying faith in the judgment of a majority of reasonable men and women into a system that shackles that judgment to the whims and politics of a minority. And because of its unworkable rigidity, the amendment would, before long, be deliberately circumvented, thus laying the groundwork for the slow undoing of the people's reverence for their organic law. 
This idea, which seems so simple on its face, has been born of mass frustration and political expediency. Ours is an age transfixed by efficiency, and the sometimes inefficient, often untidy machinations of representative democracy can seem cumbersome. Ours is an age, too, which deifies certainty--an age which has great faith in our ability to quantify everything, to predict all contingencies, to deal with all eventualities in advance. In fact, much of the law which we write today seems to reflect an almost compulsive urge to anticipate, regulate, and control every human activity. 
It is ironic that many who support this amendment also rail against the large hand of government control in the private sector. What is this amendment but a strange hyperextension of that same urge to try to predict and control every budget eventuality with some sort of legal restriction which will keep us in budget balance in perpetuity? Especially in the case of the budget process, our laws have already become so complicated that few in Washington truly understand them. Why would we want to compound that complexity by the addition of a constitutional amendment and all of the rigidity and danger that it poses? The answer is simply that the people are frustrated, and this amendment can serve as political cover for a time. So we all decry debt and bemoan deficits and claim that we need the amendment for discipline. It is the magic formula. It is the ultimate fix for our budget problems. 
The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has, since the start of this debate, kept the budget documents for the past 28 years upon his desk. It is true that we have run large deficits during many of those years. But, let us not forget that the heavy spending that this nation undertook during the cold war certainly contributed to those unbalanced budgets. 
Yes, we ran deficits, but I was here, and I can tell you that there was no significant feeling in this chamber that that money was not well spent. This body reflected a strong consensus in the nation as a whole that we needed to spend whatever it took to assure our survival as a nation, and to prevail over the Soviet Empire in the cold war. Starting in 1962 and continuing until 1982, the annual average percentage for defense spending of the entire discretionary spending pie was 60.6 percent. From FY 1983 
to FY 1992, defense spending exceeded domestic spending by an annual average of 68 percent for the whole period. The rationale provided by then President Reagan was that we would spend the Russians into the ground. Their economy was no match for ours and the Evil Empire would implode. 
It was a successful strategy. The Soviets were unable to match our defense investments and beggared their economy to such an extent that it was a major contributing factor to the shattering of the Soviet empire. 
Was that money well spent? Did we invest wisely? You bet we did! It was one of the best investments ever made by the United States over time. Yet, it could never have been done under this amendment. 
We got something invaluable for that budgetary debt. We protected our way of life and our freedoms against a foreign menace. And not only did we protect our way of life, we performed a service for millions of people around the globe by breaking the backs of the Soviets. Those annual budgets were based on an assessment of the best interests of our national needs at the time by a majority in the Congress working with the Executive. And that is exactly as the Framers envisioned. 
Throughout this debate, I have heard debt and deficits portrayed as `immoral'. What folly that is! While most would say that gambling debts are bad, or immoral, would anyone claim that borrowing to send a child to college or to provide a home for one's family is an evil or immoral thing? Indeed it can be immoral not to borrow. And by denying future leaders the budgetary freedom to borrow for investments for future generations, are we not depriving those future citizens of the birthright of realizing their full potential? By subjugating every other objective and every national endeavor, everything, from protecting an ally, to building up to fight a war, to conquering an epidemic, to feeding the starving, to investing in public infrastructure, to educating our children, to challenging foreign competition in the international playing field, to protecting our economy in the event of a recession, everything will be held hostage to the all supreme god, the golden calf, of balancing the budget each and every year. Is that what the American people want? 
Has anyone been noticing the recent economic surge of China? Its growth rate is now around 10 percent a year. Its economy now ranks third in the world. And China has increased its military budget by 50 percent in real terms between 1988 and 1993. Surely China is fast becoming an economic power to be reckoned with. Are my colleagues completely sure that, even in the military arena, future challenges will not arise that may require us to again mount a long, steady buildup of fresh dollars for defense? We need the tools to react. We cannot anticipate every future contingency. 
Yes, it is true that presently, our debt is too high. In part, we are still grappling with the residue of debt from the cold war buildup and the savings and loan crisis. In cooperation with President Clinton, over the past several years the deficit has been coming down. We have heard the concern of the people. Our system is working in exactly the way the Framers intended. We have had the latitude to meet our challenges. We have all the constitutional power we need right now to balance the budget. We need nothing more. Adoption of this amendment will only close down our future options and invite the ingenuity of circumvention. Let no one be confused. If this amendment were ever to become part of our sacred Constitution, all of our collective energies, henceforth, would be devoted to overcoming each of the obstacles it will have erected. A thousand flowers would bloom--all of them sowing the poisonous seeds of disrespect for our law and further mistrust of Government. 
Balancing the budget is, indeed, a very difficult task. It is difficult because it means inflicting pain. It means making decisions that are not popular, and it means hurting some people because of cuts to programs that matter in their lives. But we were sent here to use our judgment and to make the hard decisions. All that we have to do now is don the `velvet cloak of responsibility.' We need to begin by telling the people the truth about what it will take to achieve yearly budget balance. If this is to be our goal, taxes will have to be raised and popular programs will have to be cut, because there is no other way. 
Already, our lack of courage and candor has resulted in mistrust by our constituents. But, surely the answer to our political dilemma is not to make our Constitution a scapegoat. Let us not make this Constitution a scapegoat. Let us never go down the ridiculous road of saying to the people, `it's not my fault, the Constitution made me do it.' That is the ultimate cop-out. The easiest thing in the world for politicians and for bureaucrats to do is to hide behind the regulations or, in this case, behind a constitutional amendment. One of the few things that continues to unite us and to command our collective reverence is our Constitution. I would hope that we would always be unwilling to risk that precious commodity, just so politicians can more conveniently duck the accountability for difficult decisions. 
Public policy is often controversial, but it can only be crafted by human judgment. No process--no amendment to the Constitution, no law that can ever be devised can ever substitute for it. The dream of a somehow automatic government, completely objective and insulated from the perils of flawed human judgement, may be in vogue today because it fits neatly with our traditional fear of government, especially big government. But, automatic, 
mechanistic, formula approaches to governing are really the antithesis of what the Framers had in mind. 
Theirs was a vision of well-motivated men, kept in check by carefully balanced powers and accountability to the public, but left unfettered enough to deal with the changes and challenges of the ages. The proponents of this amendment claim that we must have this amendment or there will be no discipline to force budget balance. Consider the paucity of that argument! Remember that word, accountability. The people have all the tools they need to discipline us, simply by exercising their rights at the ballot box come election day. I believe that we can meet our responsibilities to bring this budget to balance without resorting to this ruinous encumbrance of our Constitution. But, we must all step up to our responsibilities, be accountable to our people, and put aside partisanship if we are to succeed. If we do that, then this amendment will at last be relegated to the ash heap of bad ideas where it most assuredly belongs. 
I have fought this fight a half dozen times in the Senate since 1986. Frankly, I am weary. There is so much at stake. But, each time that I fight this amendment anew, I thank God that there are those members who are willing to risk political popularity for the dictates of their own consciences. 
And they have no one to answer to but their constituents. When they take the oath of office to be United States Senator, they do not surrender their independence. They do not surrender their independence. They do not surrender their consciences to anybody in this Chamber or in this Government. And they are accountable only to the people of their States. 
They have not taken the easiest course. They have chosen, rather, to go against the prevailing political winds in order to do the right thing. There can be no other motivation for such courage, but a deep and abiding love for this magnificent country of ours. 
The 5th century Athenian statesman, Pericles, delivered a funeral oration to commemorate the soldiers who gave their lives at the battle of Salamis. Upon that occasion he said, `It was for such a country, then, that these men, nobly resolving not to have it taken from them, fell fighting and every one of their survivors may well be willing to suffer in its behalf.' I thank God for a continuing supply of these noble men and women in our own time, `willing to suffer' on behalf of our country and its Constitution. Because of their courage, the `miracle at Philadelphia' may be preserved for yet a while longer. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the President of the Republic of Georgia, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, for the unusual but very appropriate action that he has recently taken regarding the actions of one of his nation's diplomats in Washington. 
As has been widely reported, President Shevardnadze broke with longstanding international precedent and waived diplomatic immunity from prosecution in the case of a Georgian diplomat who was arrested for a particularly outrageous incident of drunken driving, resulting in a high-speed crash and the death of a 16-year-old girl. 
Diplomats have a special responsibility for representing their countries in all manner of civil societies and all manner of governmental regimes. To prevent their being subject to harassment, punishment or other actions which would interfere with their representational functions, immunity from prosecution has been a time-honored protection. 
Now, we have to think of our own diplomats, those who represent the American Government who are abroad in countries that do not have the due process principles for which our country is noted and working under the Constitution which we have and which protects citizens. 
Mr. President, somebody ought to call attention to this, and it just seems to me that more of us ought to take notice when something like this happens. And we should not only speak out against the heinous crime that was committed but also we should compliment the head of the foreign government that exercises and demonstrates high purpose and responsibility in a situation such as this. 
However, diplomats also have a special responsibility for exemplary personal behavior, given their favored status. The tradition of immunity is not a license to behave in any but the most commendable manner. Immunity was not designed to protect loose living, risk taking or unlawful activities. Therefore, the action by President Shevardnadze in removing diplomatic immunity so that his diplomatic representative can stand trial for his outrageous behavior does not erode the traditional protection of diplomats but, rather, reinforces the need for diplomats to act properly and lawfully. 
I hope our own diplomats abroad would act properly and lawfully. I could not condone any action that was not proper and lawful, and our government should not condone it on the part of our own diplomats. 
President Shevardnadze is a highly respected leader in a very difficult part of the world. The Caucasian states of the Caspian region have been subjected to continuous, sometimes very heavy-handed pressure from the former Russian overlords who resent their independent, sovereign status as new nation-states. Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia all fall into this category. The leaders of these nations have upheld their independence under great pressure. We have to commend them for demonstrating that kind of courage. They have good independent judgment, and they deserve the support of the United States. The action of waiving immunity in this flagrant, flagrant case that I have referred to is a good example of the sound independent judgment of President Shevardnadze, and I highly commend him and am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate today to recognize the wisdom he has shown and the courage he has demonstrated. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Thomas, again, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, from a practical standpoint, education is fundamental to a society interested in securing a better future for generations to come. But, on a more personal level, I can think of few things in life that provide for the kinds of pleasure, growth, and sense of self-worth as does the acquiring of an education. 
Today, I wish to pay tribute to a long-standing pillar of education in West Virginia--Shepherd College. Shepherd College, in Jefferson County, was founded 125 years ago yesterday. 
This school, which is located in West Virginia's oldest town, is proof that we can preserve our heritage and traditions at the same time we are preparing ourselves for the challenges of tomorrow. With its roots firmly planted in history, Shepherd College continues to evolve and prepare for the challenges of the new millennium. 
Shepherd College first opened in September 1871, as a private school in a single building that had previously served as the Jefferson County Courthouse, and today bears the name McMurran Hall, in honor of Shepherd College's first principal, Joseph McMurran. McMurran and two assistant professors were hired that year to teach the 42 students who were instructed `in languages, arts and sciences.' 
On February 27, 1872, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act establishing Shepherd College as a four-year school, dedicated to the training of teachers, and accredited to bestow the Bachelor of Arts degree. A liberal arts program was approved in 1943, and in 1950, the Bachelor of Science degree was added. 
Today, Shepherd College, part of the State College System of West Virginia, boasts 3,700 students who are enrolled in 80 different fields of study. 
In recent years, more than a dozen new buildings have been added to the campus. I am proud to have played a role in that growth by adding funds to federal appropriations bills for the school's new Science and Technology Center. The new Center is intended to help prepare students in fields such as computer science, environmental science, biology, and chemistry--areas of education which are critical to the future ability of our nation to compete in the global market place, and in which our country, sadly, is lagging behind other industrialized nations. This facility will also provide working partnerships with the many federal facilities located in the Eastern Panhandle, helping area residents to develop careers in high-tech fields, and, in turn, helping West Virginia and the nation to achieve a more prosperous future. 
At noon yesterday, Shepherdstown echoed with the sounds of bells, pealing in honor of the school's 125-year commitment to education, a fitting tribute to its founders. 
Along with my fellow West Virginians, I wish Shepherd College a happy 125th birthday.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, back on June 5, 1996, I sent a letter to all Senators signaling my intention to offer an amendment to the next available tax bill to place into the Highway Trust Fund the 4.3 cent gas tax that is currently used for deficit reduction. 
Senators will recall that, back in May and June of last year, there was much debate on this 4.3 cent gas tax, which was first imposed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. During this past summer, I deferred offering this amendment on two occasions at the request of both the Majority and Minority Leaders. Unfortunately, another opportunity to offer the amendment did not arise. 
My purpose in proposing that the 4.3 cent gas tax be placed into the Highway Trust Fund is to better enable the Congress to reverse the very destructive trend of federal disinvestment in our nation's transportation infrastructure. By increasing the revenue stream to the Highway Trust Fund, it would be my hope and expectation to leverage additional resources for our Federal-Aid Highway program in order to stem the deterioration of our nation's highways. 
Our federal investment in infrastructure as a percentage of the total federal budget has declined significantly since 1980. Few economists would disagree that adequate long term investment in infrastructure is critical to a nation's economic well-being. Only through investment here at home, investment to maintain and renew our own physical plant, can our economy grow and generate healthy wages for its citizens. 
Even so, our nation's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product has almost been cut in half since 1980. As a nation, we continue to invest an absolutely paltry percentage of our Gross Domestic Product in infrastructure--a percentage considerably less than our chief economic competitors in Europe and Asia. 
Nowhere do we pay a greater price for inadequate infrastructure investment than in our nation's highways. Our national highway system carries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. The construction of our national interstate system represents perhaps the greatest public works achievement of the modern era. However, we have allowed segments our National Highway System to fall into serious disrepair. 
The Department of Transportation has released its most recent report on the condition of the nation's highways. Its findings are even more disturbing than earlier reports. DOT currently classifies less than half of the mileage on our interstate system as being in good condition and only 39 percent of our entire national highway system is rated in good condition. Fully 61 percent of our nation's highways are rated in either fair or poor condition. Almost one in four of our nation's highways' bridges are now categorized as either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. This is not the highway infrastructure that will help our country and its citizens continue to prosper into the twenty first century. If we allow this decay to continue, it will constrict the lifelines of our nation. 
According to the DOT, our investment in our nation's highways is a full $15 billion short each year just to maintain these current inadequate conditions. Put another way, we would have to increase our national highway investment by more than $15 billion a year to make the least bit of improvement in the status of our national highway network each year. 
It is critical to point out that, while our highway infrastructure continues to deteriorate, highway use is on the rise. Indeed, it is growing at a very rapid pace. The number of vehicle miles traveled has grown by roughly 40 percent in just the last decade. As a result, we are witnessing new highs in the amount of congestion, causing delays in the movement of goods and people that are very costly to our national economy. 
Mr. President, it is clear that the requirements we place on our national highway system are growing while our investment continues to decline. We are simply digging ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole. Six years ago, in 1991, it was estimated that an investment of $47.5 billion dollars would be necessary on an annual basis to ensure that highway conditions would not deteriorate any further than they existed in that year. By 1993, that figure grew to $51.6 billion. And two years ago, that figure grew to $54.8 billion. The longer we delay making federal highway spending a priority, the more expensive it gets to reverse this destructive trend. 
In the coming months, the Senate will take up legislation to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. Many members, including myself, have come to the Floor to introduce legislation to address specific transportation needs in their states and regions. Also, many members have spoken to the need for formula changes to bring about what they perceive to be a more equitable distribution of funds from the highway program. Just yesterday, our new Transportation Secretary, Rodney Slater, testified before the Environment and Public Works Committee on the broad outlines of the Administration's proposed ISTEA reauthorization bill. There are many fine initiatives in the Administration's bill just as there have been many fine initiatives introduced by Members from all regions of the country. 
However, we must face the fact that, absent a determined effort by the Congress and the Administration to substantially 
increase the current level of spending on our highway program, we are not going to stem the deterioration of our highway infrastructure. Similarly, it is unlikely that, as we reauthorize ISTEA, we will be able to accommodate new initiatives and address substantial formula changes. 
Just last month, I was pleased to join with 55 of my colleagues in writing to the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, asking that the upcoming Budget Resolution allocate sufficient budget authority to the Environment and Public Works Committee to allow for a robust ISTEA reauthorization bill. But it must be recognized that the ISTEA reauthorization bill is just that--an authorization bill. And while ISTEA does allocate some direct funding from the Highway Trust Fund outside of the appropriations process, the vast majority of funds distributed under the Federal-Aid Highway Program are controlled by annual obligation limitations set by the Appropriations Committee. 
The Administration's budget proposal assumes that there will be increased contract authority provided for several meritorious programs under the Federal-Aid Highway Program over the next six years. But the unfortunate fact is that the Administration's budget simultaneously assumes that the annual obligation limitation set by the Appropriations Committee will be frozen at the current year's level for the entire life of the next authorization bill. Put another way, under the Administration's proposal, states will not be allowed to obligate one additional penny in any of the next six years above the current year's level. 
Mr. President, I appreciate that we can have a reasonable debate as to whether the solution to this problem is depositing an additional 4.3 cents into the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund currently has some sizable unobligated balances. Moreover, income to the Highway Trust Fund has been steadily rising as a result of increased gas consumption and the fact that an additional 2.5 cents has been deposited in the Highway Trust Fund since the beginning of Fiscal Year 1996. However, one thing that cannot be denied is the fact that substantially increased funds are necessary to stem the deterioration of our federal highway system. A mechanism must be developed to ensure that, even while we strive to eliminate our annual budget deficit, we begin to stem the tide of federal disinvestment in our transportation infrastructure. 
Toward that end, I look forward to working with Chairman Domenici of the Budget Committee and its Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, along with the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee to seek a way to ensure substantially increased authorizations and obligational authority for our federal highway responsibilities. We cannot be responsible stewards of federal tax dollars and, at the same time, pass a steadily deteriorating transportation infrastructure on to our children and grandchildren. 
Now Mr. President, I did not seek to hold up consideration of H.R. 668 yesterday evening by proposing amendments to address our highway infrastructure needs. I recognized the urgency of renewing the aviation ticket tax. The Airport and Airways Trust Fund is on the verge of bankruptcy and, absent the renewal of the ticket tax, our nation's airport construction enterprise, as well as the procurement of critically needed air traffic control equipment, will be at risk. Indeed, airports are also a critical element of our transportation infrastructure. And, as in the case of highways, our airport infrastructure needs continue to grow while federal investment continues to fall precipitously. The current funding level for the Airport Improvement Program has fallen more than 30 percent in just the last five years. And the president's budget for the coming fiscal year asks us to cut the program an additional 32 percent. The last thing I wanted to do yesterday evening was endanger necessary investments in our aviation infrastructure in the hopes of addressing the needs of our highway infrastructure. 
However, I rise today to state my intention and commitment to work with the Senate leadership as well as the leadership of all the relevant committees to ensure that we put policies in place this year to adequately address the need for increased highway investment. I invite all members to join me in this cause.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. 
Mr. President, I have sat on this floor today and listened carefully to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey as he explained his amendment and as he has recounted the reasons for his having offered the amendment. I see no other Senator on the floor other than perhaps Mr. Hatch, the distinguished manager of the amendment, who sat through the entirety of Mr. Torricelli's speech. 
Mr. President, I say that to say this: The speech by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey was one of the most thoughtful, most thought provoking, most reasonable speeches that I have heard on any subject, and particularly on the subject matter of the resolution that is before the Senate. One could not listen to Mr. Torricelli without immediately knowing that a great deal of work and thought and agonizing went into that speech. 
The Senator from New Jersey is the one Senator whose vote has not yet been announced. We do not know how the Senator from New Jersey is going to vote, and that realization in itself would be indicative that he must have spent some tormenting, agonizing moments in the preparation of that speech. I am going to vote for the amendment that has been offered by Mr. Torricelli because I think it is a needed amendment. Whether the Senator, in the final analysis, casts his vote for the constitutional amendment or against the constitutional amendment is beside the point here at the moment. I respect the Senator for the thought that he has invested in this speech, and I admire him for that. 
I would have understood Henry Clay, who was a proponent of the great American system, to have made the kind of speech that has been made by the Senator from New Jersey. I would have understood Webster, in his debate with Hayne, on January 26 and 27, 1830--he spoke along the same line, saying that the people of New England did not recognize boundaries of rivers or lines of latitude, or mountains, as boundaries to their political patriotism. He thought that if an investment in infrastructure in South Carolina, for example, would benefit the Nation, it was a matter great enough for him as a Senator from New England to support. The Old Cumberland Road was a project that was supported by Henry Clay. They recognized the necessity for building up the Nation's infrastructure. They were looking not just at the present, but they were also looking at the future. 
Now, when they propose investments in infrastructure, investments in railroads, investments in canals, investments in bridges and highways, it seems to me that our friends on the other side cannot have it both ways. I have listened to their speeches, and they support, they say, doing the same thing that the States do--having a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We have heard them say over and over again, `Let's do what the States do. The Federal Government should do what the States do. We need a constitutional amendment to the Constitution that will force us to do what the States do, and the States have a constitutional amendment.' They have amendments in their constitution or they have it written into the constitution that they have to balance their budgets. 
The proponents don't bother to explain that States have both a capital budget and an operating budget. They don't bother to explain that. The people who listen to this debate are to take it on faith that we are not talking about apples and oranges, but we are talking about apples and apples.

Mr. BYRD. If I may, I want to ask the Senator from Utah a question. They say, `Let's do like the States do. They have constitutions that require them to balance their budgets.' But the proponents of this constitutional amendment don't bother to enlighten their listeners and readers to the fact that the States have capital budgets which they don't balance every year. 
So now the distinguished Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], seeks to meet that argument and put, indeed, into the Constitution language that will allow the Federal Government to operate on two budgets--an operating budget and a capital budget--so that the Federal Government will be, indeed, operating like the State governments, it will have a Constitution insofar as capital budgeting is concerned, like the State governments. It will continue to have an operating budget, and it will also have a capital budget. But it cannot have a capital budget, under the language of the proposed constitutional amendment. Section 1 provides against that. Section 1 says: `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.' 
So, right there, in section 1, as plain as the nose on your face, we would be precluded from passing a law once this constitutional amendment is adopted here and ratified by the States--the Federal Government would be precluded from having a capital budget. Well, the Senator from New Jersey seeks to remedy that. He seeks to provide that the Federal Government will have two budgets, so that indeed the Federal Government 
would be on a par with the States. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may ask a question of another Senator without losing the floor.

I want to close by again thanking the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. I wish to compliment him. I think he has exposed a major flaw in the argument of the proponents. He has made it indubitably clear that the proponents meet themselves in their arguments coming back. They argue both ways, as I have already indicated, that the Federal Government should operate like the States on a balanced budget. Now, when the Senator from New Jersey seeks to put the Federal Government on a par with the States and have a capital budget, on which almost all of the States operate, then the proponents say, oh, no. My friend, Mr. Hatch, says, oh, no, we do not want to do that. We do not want to put that kind of thing in the Constitution. This is the glittering gewgaw----

Mr. BYRD. The glittering gewgaw of glorified garbage that the proponents are seeking to nail into the Constitution. 
But, Mr. President, my friend, Mr. Hatch, says, oh, we do not print the money. 
Well, that is true but that is not an answer to what we have been talking about here and the need for a capital budget. 
Let me just close by saying to my friend from Utah, who continues to go over to his props, the books, I hope he will pause to explain that beginning with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Reagan's administration, the total debt of the United States at that time was $997 billion. Going right down to the close of September 30, 1981, which was the end of the last fiscal year for which Mr. Carter was responsible, the total Federal debt was just under $1 trillion. But going right down to the end of the last fiscal year for which Mr. Bush was responsible, September 30, 1993, the Federal debt was $4.316 trillion. 
Now, that will help to explain what is inside those budgets that are stacked on the Senator's desk. That would help to explain the great difference between the debt as it stood accumulated after the first 192 years of its existence under 39 administrations, 38 Presidents--one of them, Grover Cleveland, served two terms which were separated--which was slightly under $1 trillion----

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I sought to get Mr. Reagan to postpone the third year of his proposed 3-year tax cut until such time as we could see what the budget deficit was, until such time as we could see what was happening to the economy. 
No, he wouldn't do that. So I offered legislation here, as minority leader, at that time, to require that that third year of the tax cut be delayed. But my amendment was rejected, just like all amendments that we are offering now to the constitutional amendment are being rejected summarily. My amendment was rejected. And then I voted for the Reagan tax cut. 
My people said, `Go along with this new President. Give him a chance. Give him what he wants.' And so I did, and I have been sorry of it ever since. 
I voted for that Reagan tax cut. I also voted for his massive military buildup. And, so, I am that much to blame. But let it not be said that the President should escape the charge of having overblown spending, and the debt, by saying, `We are the Congress. The President proposes, the Congress disposes.' Mr. Reagan had a veto pen. Why didn't he veto some of the appropriations bills? He didn't. He didn't use the veto pen, perhaps, enough.

When Mr. Reagan became responsible for his first fiscal year budget--the total debt was $999 billion, total debt over the period of all the years and all the administrations since the Republic began. And when the last fiscal year for which he was responsible had ended, the debt was $2,830,000,000,000. And then when the last moment of the last fiscal year for which Mr. Bush was responsible had ended, the debt was $4,316,000,000,000. So much for the pile of books.

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank the manager of the resolution, Mr. Hatch, and I thank all Senators. 
Madam President, the proponents of the proposed constitutional amendment now before the Senate would have the American people believe that if their proposal is adopted by Congress and ratified by three-fourths of the States, the Federal budget will then be constitutionally required to be balanced every year, unless supermajorities of both Houses pass waivers. But let us all remember that `the devil himself can quote Scriptures for his purpose.' My purpose here is to strip away the hype and the rhetoric and examine the manner in which this constitutional amendment will actually work. 
Section 1 of the article states, `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year * * *.' That is pretty plain. That seems quite straightforward and very clear. There appears to be no room for any misplay or misunderstanding. The entire Federal budget must be balanced each and every year, right down to the bottom dollar. Unlike State and local governments or businesses, where borrowing is frequently used for the purchase of capital investments--or, in the case of family budgets, where debt is incurred for the purchase of homes and automobiles and to pay for college tuition costs--the Federal unified budget will not be allowed to incur debt for any reason under this amendment. Instead, the Federal Government's investments in military weaponry, highways, bridges, waterways, and all other capital items will have to be paid for, in full--cash on the barrel head--as they are purchased. Total spending for any year for any purpose will have to be no greater than the income to the Treasury for that same year if this amendment is adopted. 
But, the question arises, just how are we mere mortals to ensure that total outlays do not indeed exceed receipts, and how will that constitutional requirement be enforced? 
How, indeed, given that the Federal budget deficit, its total receipts and its total outlays, unlike the family budget, is based entirely on estimates? Granted, these estimates of total outlays and total receipts are prepared by some of the finest statistical wizards in this country--the men and women who work for the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
Once the amount of the deficit is set in the annual Congressional Budget Resolution, then the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, monitors the performance of the economy throughout the year and keeps Congress informed as to whether the outlay estimate and the revenue estimate and the deficit estimate are going to be correct. But remember, these are all estimates--educated guesses, if you will. I can produce one. You can produce one. It is an educated guess. But we live up to the educated guesses, or at least we are guided by the educated guesses of the Congressional Budget Office. These are estimates of many factors in the public and private sectors which are totally outside of the control of any mortal human--totally outside the control of any human being. 
We are told, just don't worry about that section 1. Don't lose any sleep over that section. The authors of the amendment have solved the problem. We need only to look at section 6 of their proposal to find the answer to the dilemma of how to ensure that the budget is balanced in every fiscal year, despite our having to rely on nothing more than estimates. Well, I want Senators, and I want the American people who are watching what is being said and what is being done here, to understand what 
they would be buying into here. What are you getting here now? Is it just what you see? Is that what you get? We all need to thoroughly understand that crucially important section--section 6--of the resolution.

Mr. BYRD. And to reduce the deficits, but I do not think we ought to go about it by way of a constitutional amendment. But the Senator from Utah continues to talk about the present system, the weaknesses of the present system. 
Section 6 is in the constitutional amendment. That is the present system. That continues the present system of working with estimates of outlays and receipts. 
So there is nothing different, except the Constitution of the United States will be trivialized. There will be nothing different 
in what we are talking about balancing the budget for real after the Constitution has been amended than from what the situation at present is. 
Reading section 6: 
The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. 
Now, I have been talking all afternoon, or for almost 1 hour, about estimates of outlays and receipts and the fact that they are never, never accurate. 
I hope the Senator from Utah, when he refers to the present system, he scores, he excoriates, and I do not blame him for that, the `present system'--the `present system.' He wants to get away from the present system. Well, he is not doing it in section 6, because under section 6 we are told, this is the Houdini section, the section that tells Congress it can do it, it can balance the budget, it can carry out the mandate under the constitutional amendment by relying on estimates of outlays and receipts. So the Senator from Utah is not getting away from the present system when he falls back on section 6. 
May I ask the Senator this question: What is meant in this section 6 by `appropriate legislation'? What does that mean?

Mr. BYRD. The Senator has not answered my question. What is meant by the words `appropriate legislation' in section 6? I want to point out the big hole that section 6 provides for the Congress, so that Congress can avoid section 1 of the amendment, which requires a dollar-for-dollar match between spending and income. What is meant by `appropriate legislation'? 
May I say as a predicate to asking the question, as I pointed out earlier, in section 1 reference is made to the word `law.' Section 1 is really a binding section if you just stood it out there alone: `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law.' 
Section 1 says Congress must `provide by law.' Section 2 says: `The limit on the debt shall not be increased * * * unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law.' Section 4 refers to increases in revenue which shall become law. Section 5 refers, and uses the words, `which becomes law.' 
Why is it, Mr. Manager of the bill, my dear colleague, Senator Hatch, why is it that section 6 uses the words `appropriate legislation'? It does not say that Congress shall enforce and implement this article by law, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. It says by `appropriate legislation.' 
What is meant? Does that mean a simple resolution? Does that mean a concurrent resolution? Does that mean a joint resolution? Does that mean a bill? What is meant by `appropriate legislation'? Why is the change made there? It is perfectly obvious that there must be some reason lurking behind this change in the word `law' in other areas of the constitutional amendment, but in section 6 it uses the words `appropriate legislation.' `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.' What does that mean?

Mr. BYRD. There is a massive problem here. For some reason --and I think the distinguished manager has put his finger on it --the constitutional amendment refers to actions by the Congress that constitute laws--until we get down to section 6. Section 6 is an alternative to section 1. Section 1 is a rather binding section, which says, `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts * * *'--`shall' not, not `may' not, not `ought' not, but `shall' not exceed--`* * * for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law. * * *' 
That is pretty binding. If that section stood by itself, it would be pretty hard to get around it. But, lo and behold, the authors of the amendment have come along with the Houdini section --section 6--which as much as says you don't have to do it by law, and you can do it by relying on estimates of outlays and receipts. 
Now, if you had to do it by law, under section 7 of Article I of the Constitution, which is the presentment clause, whatever we do in section 6 would have to be presented to the President of the United States. He could veto it. But we have a way out here. 
Section 6 allows us, by `appropriate legislation,' to avoid section 1. And appropriate legislation can be a concurrent resolution between the two Houses. It is kind of an agreement or an understanding, or a `shake hands' deal between the two Houses. It doesn't go to the President. It isn't presented to the President under section 7, the presentment clause. He has no voice in the matter--none. He can't veto. And so section 6 allows Congress, in the concurrent resolution on the budget, to put in whatever standards it wants. It can write into the resolution that so long as the deficits do not exceed, say, 1.5 percent of the gross--it used to be gross national product, but now it is gross domestic product--as long as it doesn't exceed 1.5 percent or 1.4 percent. To some, that would be considered negligible. But, as we have seen, with a $7.5 trillion GDP, 1.4 or 1.5 percent can amount to over $100 billion. But the President won't have any voice in that. It won't have to go across his desk. He can't veto this little Houdini section. What we do there is all that we will do, but we don't have to do----

Mr. BYRD. I will finish my sentence. I thank the Senator from Utah for his usual courtesy. We will not be bound by section 1. We can do it by way of section 6, which does not require a three-fifths vote for a waiver. And we will be complying with section 6 if we do it in a simple resolution, which is only an action by the Senate concerning the Senate, or on a concurrent resolution, which is an action between the Houses and which doesn't have to go to the President for signature. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah. It seems to me that the words in section 6 should give Senators pause. I am sure they would give the American people pause if they understood what Congress can do under that section.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend. 
Mr. President, section 1 of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget lays it out in a very straightforward way. It says in plain English that outgo shall not exceed income. `Spending shall not exceed income in any fiscal year unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for such an excess of outlays over income.' 
Now, that is a pretty tough section to comply with, and Congress, I think, would be in great difficulty if it sought to follow that mandate. But Congress, by this constitutional amendment, has provided a way around section 1, so that we really don't have to comply with section 1. 
Section 6 says that `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.' So, Congress, as anyone will know, because it is plain as the nose on one's face, Congress is just going to forget section 1, that will be too hard to comply with. Congress will choose section 6 as a way out, because then it does not have to balance dollar for dollar, it does not have to have a three-fifths vote, as section 1 would require, for a specific excess of outlays over receipts. It can forget about that. No real balancing of the budget. No three-fifths vote. Just doing it by appropriate legislation, which could be a simple resolution or concurrent resolution. So this is the way out, this is the dishonest way out--section 6. That is the Houdini section. 
What would I do? My amendment strikes the last words in section 6. My amendment says: `The Congress shall implement this article by law.' Period. You can't get around that. 
What does it mean when we say the Congress shall implement this article by law? It means that Congress will do by law what it says it will do in section 1; namely, it will have to balance the budget dollar for dollar, and the only way it can get out of doing that then will be to have the three-fifths vote to waive the requirement. 
So in order to keep us honest, in order to keep the proponents honest, and I include myself--I am not a proponent--in order to keep all of us honest in Congress, we strike out this Houdini language, which allows Congress to weasel around and avoid the impact of the amendment, and we say `the Congress shall implement this article,' which means section 1, balance the budget, and it has to do it by law. 
So this is the `to keep them honest' amendment, Mr. President, and I hope Members of the Senate will support my amendment. 
The American people have a pretty low estimate of politicians. They don't believe us. They don't believe that we mean what we say. They don't have much faith in Congress. It isn't just Congress, but we are talking about Congress now because Congress has to enforce this article. They don't have faith in Congress, and we are going to confirm their lack of faith in Congress by enacting this article in the Constitution and, more specifically, by including in it section 6, which provides the loopholes by which we can avoid the strictures and the commandment of the language of section 1. We are merely going to compound and add to and solidify and fortify the American people's low estimate of Congress and of politicians in general. 
So that is why I am offering this amendment. Let's clean up section 6 to say, `No, no, we are not going to have this sleight of hand.' Congress will enforce this article, and Congress will have to do it by law. 
Unless we approve my amendment, this section 6 will allow Congress to avoid the three-fifths vote, which is required if outlays are going to exceed income in any fiscal year, and will allow Congress to use estimates, sleight-of-hand estimates, in order to fool the American people.

Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching that season when we shall witness the departure of many of our colleagues who have elected not to serve beyond this Congress. 
Mr. President, I was the 1,579th Senator of 1,826 men and women who have served in the U.S. Senate from the beginning. I have seen many fine Senators come and go. As I think back over the years, something good might well have been said about most, if not all, of these Senators. We are prone, of course, to deliver heartfelt eulogies, speeches declaring our regrets that our colleagues choose to leave the service of this body. 
About all of these Senators whom I have seen depart the Senate, some good could be said, unlike Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, the Roman emperor who served from 180 to 192 A.D., one of the few Roman emperors about whom nothing good could be said. 
I don't think that any of the Senators that I can recall at the moment who voluntarily retired with honor from this body were Senators about whom nothing good could be said. But shortly, we will witness the departure of one of the truly outstanding United States Senators of our time, and when I say `of our time,' I mean my time as a Member of Congress for 44 years, a Member of this body for 38 years. The departure of Sam Nunn will be an irreparable loss. Someone might be able to take his place over a period of years. 
I remember the death of Senator Russell, Richard Russell of Georgia, on January 21, 1971, 25 years ago. In the course of those 25 years, one-quarter of a century, I have to say that I have not seen the likeness of Richard Russell, except in Senator Samuel Augustus Nunn. 
So it may be another 25 years, it may be 50 years before we see the likeness of Senator Nunn. 
I pay tribute to this distinguished colleague who is retiring from the Senate after 24 years--illustrious years. There are many things that one can say about Sam Nunn, as he has been consistently productive, growing in stature year by year to become, without doubt, the leading Senate voice on national defense security and alliance issues--the leading voice. His accomplishments, of which there are many, are notable and derive from an approach to his work which is unfailingly thorough and well-focused. He is blessed with an exceptional intellect, and in Senator Nunn's case that sharp intellect combines with a much rarer talent for harnessing creative visions to practical techniques. Sam Nunn has been especially successful as a legislator in this body because of his ability to reduce complicated issues to an understandable scope, while avoiding oversimplification. Then he works patiently and persistently to build bipartisan support. 
Indeed, his many ideas and initiatives are often shared and supported by his colleagues across the aisle. In a day when bipartisanship is as rare as platinum and gold and rubies, and certainly as valuable, Sam Nunn epitomizes that for which so many of us strive, and often fail to achieve--bipartisan consensus which the people so desire and which fuels large majorities behind legislative endeavors. The ingredients of vision coupled with practicality, and balance between liberal and conservative views, mark his spectacularly successful career as a Senator and are textbook examples for the younger Members of this body and the newer Members of this body in the years to come to heed and to emulate. 
Sam Nunn hails from Georgia, where commitment to the Nation's defense runs deeply, and from whence some of our greatest legislators on national defense have emerged. He has upheld the great Georgia tradition so ably begun by his granduncle Representative Carl Vinson, with whom I served in the House of Representatives before coming to the Senate, and his predecessor, Senator Richard B. Russell. 
While Senator Nunn has only served as the chairman or ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for 12 years, his record of achievement and the reverence in which he is held in this body are comparable to that--and I know--comparable to that of the great Russell. This is a feat of enormous distinction. The State of Georgia has to be extremely proud to have given such talented sons to our Republic, men who have so well borne the mantle of responsibility to protect the defense of our Nation and promote its fighting forces. 
Now, if you ask Sam Nunn what he regards as the most important of his many, many achievements in affecting and directing U.S. policy in the national defense arena, I doubt--and I have never asked him this question--but I doubt that he would mention the more widely publicized of his achievements, such as his role in developing the Stealth fighter; or the many initiatives he authored to reduce the dangers of war in the Russian-American relationship; or the meaningful measures enacted to reduce and make safer the world's inventories of nuclear weapons and fissile materials; or even his role in broadening and deepening American leadership in NATO, in Bosnia, in the Persian Gulf, or in Haiti. It is in the less heralded, less glamorous but critically important area of the morale and welfare of our men and women in uniform that is at the top of the list that Sam Nunn might himself cite as his most noteworthy achievement in the defense area. 
Senator Nunn was the key player in meeting the needs of the All Volunteer Force so that we could attract and retain the kind of men and women who could effectively manage and lead our forces across the globe in all environments. He constructed a benefits package for the men and women who fought so well in the Kuwait Desert in Operation Desert Storm. He crafted the post-cold war transition measures that address the needs of our military personnel as they make their way from the front lines of the cold war back into American civilian society. 
He has worked tirelessly to instill a sense of pride and loyalty in our uniformed men and women that is of such great value to the Nation. As Edmund Burke said on March 22, 1775, `It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to their government, from the sense of the deep stake they have in such a glorious institution, which gives you your army and navy, and infuses in both that liberal obedience, without which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber.' 
Now I have been privileged to serve with Sam Nunn as a member of the Armed Services Committee and with Sam Nunn as its leader. Senators are not renowned for their managerial skills, but the Armed Services Committee under Sam Nunn's leadership has been superbly managed. 
In my 44 years in Congress, I have yet to see a chairman of any committee who excelled Sam Nunn. In my humble judgment, he is the best committee chairman that I have ever seen in these 44 years in Congress, including myself. I worked hard at being a good chairman. But Senator Nunn, to me, represents the ideal, the model, the paragon of excellence as a chairman. 
Unusual among authorization committees in the Senate, he produced, from 1987 through 1994, eight straight authorization acts, each of which continued major initiatives to build a better managed, sounder Department of Defense. He was the key figure behind the so-called Goldwater-Nichols Reorganization Act, which decentralized power in the armed services, giving more on-the-ground authority to our unified commanders in the geographic areas where they had to prepare forces to fight in various contingencies. He developed the legislation which produced the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which cut through the political snarls involved in closing bases, and has been a most effective tool in downsizing the DOD establishment in a fair and orderly way. 
Over the years our uniformed leaders have consistently looked to Sam Nunn as their champion, as a strong but sensitive force, who empathized with their special needs and could be counted on to take the kind of action appropriate to best enhance the morale of the men under their command. He did not fail them. 
Perhaps some of the most creative ideas that Sam Nunn willed into reality came in the knotty area of reducing the quantum of danger in the Russian-American relationship. He championed, together with John Warner, programs to increase communication between the American and Russian leadership, and thus reduce the possibilities of tragic, accidental nuclear war. Together with Richard Lugar, he crafted a successful program to dismantle nuclear weapons possessed by the states of the former Soviet Union. He led the Senate Arms Control Observer Group for many years, as my appointee to that group when I was Majority Leader, traveling frequently to Geneva, leading delegations of Senators to ensure that progress on the INF and START Treaties had the knowledge and support of the United States Senate. He traveled extensively to Russia, and in turn Russian legislative leaders traveled to the United States, to exchange views and develop cooperative solutions to problems, thereby increasing the level of confidence and understanding between these two superpowers. Lately he has developed additional initiatives, again with a leading Republican counterpart, Senator Domenici, to tackle the problem of terrorist actions against the United States. All in all, Sam Nunn, when he leaves this Chamber and walks out of this door for the last time as a Member of this body, can take immense pride in his long, intense and patient efforts in the superpower relations arena. Those hard-won initiatives have had a substantial impact on the measure of safety in our world. It is indeed no exaggeration to say that the world today is a safer place in part because of the monumental efforts of one man, the senior Senator from the State of Georgia--Sam Nunn. 
These achievements and the quality of his dedication and work on defense, alliance and international issues, ranging from NATO to arms control and reduction, anti-terrorism, and joint U.S.-Russian threat reduction and communications measures have propelled his glorious reputation far beyond the Senate. He is known internationally and he is viewed universally as an expert in the defense field. He is well known in official circles around the globe and is widely sought for his wise counsel. 
Is it not remarkable that in my time there would have been two chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, two `tall men, who lived above the fog in public duty and in private thinking'--Senator Richard Russell and Senator Samuel Nunn--both experts in the field of national defense. Both of whom sought for their wise counsel,--sought out on this floor,--sought out before the bar of the Senate, in the well, sought out in foreign capitals for their wise counsel. 
It is not an overstatement to say Sam Nunn's reach and impact have been international and characterized by workable, sound proposals and brilliant judgment. The global scope of his work has set him apart from the vast majority of men who have served in this body and is a testimony to his dedication to the addressing of the burning issues of sanity and order in our world today. 
While Sam Nunn will undoubtedly be remembered for his Senate service in the area of national defense, as if that were not enough, his energy and creativity have also been evident in many other areas. The range of his thinking and his talents as a legislator and policy maker encompass everything from health care, to student loans, to insurance industry reform. In his farewell address, announcing his retirement, in Georgia on October 9, 1995, he dwelled extensively on the need for America to put our youth first, to work on protecting our children from street violence and drugs. He spoke eloquently of the need to reverse the saturation of our TV airwaves with programs of sex and violence. He focused on the need to reinvigorate our educational system in order to reincorporate great numbers of American citizens back into the working culture of our nation. He has developed successful legislation to lay the groundwork for a nationwide `civilian service corps' by offering education benefits in exchange for public service. As the cochairman of the Strengthening of America Commission, a bipartisan group of business, educational, labor and academic leaders, he has proposed an impressive plan to make radical changes in the income tax code to refocus our economy on savings and investment and away from consumption. 
Most importantly, and as my fellow Senators well know, Sam Nunn's success is in large part attributable to his hard rock integrity. 
A religious man, he does not go around wearing his religion on his sleeve; he does not go around making a big whoop-de-do about his religion, but he is a religious man, a moral man. Sam Nunn is known as a man whose judgment can be trusted. How many times have I heard Senators come to the Senate floor to vote on a measure and ask: `How is Sam voting on this one?' He is a leader in this body, in spite of the fact that he has not especially sought to lead. He has not been elected to a leadership position, but he has grown into a leadership position. He is a natural leader. His is the best type of leadership, because it is a leadership that is born of strong character. Horace Greeley said: `Fame is a vapor; popularity an accident; riches take wings. Those who cheer today, may curse tomorrow. Only one thing endures: character.' 
Sam Nunn epitomizes that great trait, character. The Senate will feel the loss of Sam Nunn and feel it deeply. His legacy and achievements certainly will grow with time. I am personally deeply sorry that he has chosen to go. He will leave an empty place in the Senate. 
Napoleon rejoiced that the `bravest of the brave,' Marshal Ney, had escaped and had returned across the Dnieper River, even though he had lost all of his cannons. Napoleon ordered that there be a salute to celebrate the escape and the return of Ney. And he said, `I have more than 400 million francs in the cellar of the Tuileries in Paris, and I would have gladly given them all for the ransom of my old companion in arms.' 
Had Sam Nunn been an officer in the Grand Army of France, Napoleon would have given everything he possessed for another Sam Nunn. 
His great natural talents will continue to bring him to the forefront of the national policy discussion, and he will, I know, continue to achieve great things in a variety of new settings. 
I have never really felt about a man in the Senate--other than Senator Richard Russell--as I have felt about Sam Nunn. I was the majority whip in the Senate when Sam Nunn came to the Senate, and I urged that he be placed on the Senate Armed Services Committee. As a member of the Steering Committee, I cast my vote to put Sam Nunn on that committee. That is where he wanted to serve. I watched him grow. I have had some differences, from time to time--minor, of course--with Sam on some issues. That is not the point. Sam has fulfilled my idea of what a Senator ought to be. 
There were 74 delegates chosen to attend the Constitutional Convention. The Convention met behind closed doors from May 25 to September 17, 1787. Fifty-five of those 74 delegates who were chosen participated, and 39 of the 74 signed the Constitution of the United States. I can see in my mind's eye a Sam Nunn in that gallery. I might well imagine that, as they met from day to day, if Sam Nunn had been a participant, they would have come, as they come here when Members of this body gather in the well, and asked, `What does Sam Nunn think about this?' I have no difficulty in imagining that. In such an august gathering as was that Convention, which sat in 1787, with George Washington, the Commander in Chief at Valley Forge and the soon-to-be first President of the United States, I can imagine that it would have been the same there. They would have said, `What does Sam Nunn think? How is he going to vote?' 
The First Congress was to have convened on March 4, 1789. And only 8 Senators--less than a quorum--of the 22 were there on March 4, 1789. Five States were represented--New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. And the Senator from Georgia who attended that day was William Few. 
It could very well have been Sam Nunn as a Member of that first Senate, serving with Oliver Ellsworth, Maclay and Morris, and others. And as they met to blaze the pioneer paths of this new legislative body, the U.S. Senate, I have no problem in imagining that, often, those men would have turned to Sam Nunn and said, `How are you going to vote, Sam?' `How is Sam going to vote?' 
I think every Member of this body shares with me that feeling about Sam Nunn. He could have been an outstanding U.S. Senator at any time in the history of this Republic--not this democracy. When the Convention completed its work, a lady approached Benjamin Franklin and said, `Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?' He didn't answer, `A democracy, Madam.' He said, `A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.' 
Now, what is there about Sam Nunn that makes him this kind of man? He is not the typical politician that one conjures up in his mind when thinking about Senators and other politicians. Senator Nunn is not glib. He doesn't jump to hasty conclusions. 
He does not rush to be ahead of all of the other Senators so that he will get the first headline. He thinks about the problem, and he logically, methodically, and systematically arrives at a decision. Then he carefully prepares to put that decision into action. 
I suppose that had he lived at the time of Socrates, who lived during the chaos of the great Peloponnesian wars, Sam would have been out there in the marketplace debating with Socrates, about whom Cicero said he `brought down philosophy from Heaven to Earth.' Sam would have been a hard man for Socrates to put down because he has that talent, that knack of thinking, an organized thinking, and the consideration of a matter logically, carefully, and thoroughly. He is truly a man for all seasons. His wisdom, his judgment, and his statesmanship have reflected well on the profession of public service at a time when fierce `take-no-prisoners politics' has embroiled the Nation to alarming degrees. 
Napoleon did not elect to go into Spain, and Wellington was concerned that Napoleon himself might lead. Wellington later told Earl Stanhope that Napoleon was superior to all of his marshals and that his presence on the field was like 40,000 men in the balance. Sam Nunn, the 1,668th Senator to appear on this legislative field of battle, is like having a great number in array against or for your position. 
I was looking just this morning over the names of those Senators who are leaving, and examining their votes on what is called pejoratively the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 1995. Of those Senators who are leaving, seven voted against that colossal monstrosity, for which many of those who voted will come to be sorry. If this President is reelected, he will have it within his power to make them sorry. He is just the man who might do it. 
Among the departing Senators, Sam Nunn is one of those who opposed that bill. Senator Heflin, Senator Johnston, Senator Pell, Senator Pryor, Senator Cohen, Senator Hatfield, and Senator Nunn voted, to their everlasting honor, against that miserable piece of junk. 
Just wait until this President exercises that veto and see how they come to heel--h-e-e-l. They will rue the day. But Sam Nunn voted against it. 
For the outstanding quality of his character as well as for the brilliance of his service, this Senate and the Nation are eternally in his debt. He will always command, in my heart and in my memory, a place with Senator Richard Russell. 
God, give us men. A time like this demands 
Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands; 
Men whom the lust of office does not kill; 
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; 
Men who possess opinions and a will; 
Men who have honor; men who will not lie; 
Men who can stand before a demagog 
And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking. 
Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog 
In public duty and in private thinking; 
For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds, 
Their large professions and their little deeds, 
Mingle in selfish strife, lo. Freedom weeps, 
Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps. 
God give us men. 
Men who serve not for selfish booty, 
But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty. 
Men of dependable character; men of sterling worth. 
Then wrongs will be redressed and right will rule the earth. 
God, give us men. 
Men like Samuel Augustus Nunn.

Mr. BYRD. No. The green line means the estimate was, indeed, right on target. It was not above or below the line. It was not too high. It was not too low. 
Would the Senator agree with me that based on this chart, in every year from 1980 to 1996, the estimate was wrong? It was off. It was not correct. In some years the revenues were more than estimated and in some years they were less than estimated. The point of the chart being to show that the estimates have never been absolutely correct. In many instances they have varied; in one instance here, $78 billion. The estimate was off $78 billion. In another instance, the estimate was off $65 billion. 
This is the record. This is not a Member's estimate here of what should have been in each of those particular years. This is the record. These bars indicate what went wrong, by how much the estimate was off for each year. Would the Senator tend to believe that in the future the estimates are going to be better than they have been on this chart, which represents 17 years of experience?

Mr. BYRD. The Senator does not want to continue with this system. He refers to this system as a statutory system. And yet--and yet--the amendment itself tells us who will enforce this amendment once it is in the Constitution. 
I will read it from section 6: 
The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation. 
So we are going to continue to enforce it. We are going to continue to operate under a statutory system. That is what I am saying. We have been operating under a statutory system. This amendment says we will continue to operate under a statutory system because it says that the Congress will enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation. 
What makes the Senator feel that under the new statutory system, that the estimates will be any better than they have been under the old statutory system when both systems are going to be the work of the Congress?

Mr. BYRD. This is not going to be real--section 6. It is not real. It talks about estimates. Now we are going to switch from section 1, which says total outlays shall not exceed total receipts in any fiscal year. In the first place, how do we know whether the outlays have exceeded the receipts before the end of the fiscal year, or even two or three weeks subsequent to the end of the fiscal year? That is number one. Number two, then, we switch to estimates. Why do you proponents of the amendment purport to do two things--one, in the first section, balance outlays with receipts--no ifs, ands, or buts--to the exact dollar. But in section 6, they say, well, just forget about section 1 and balance the estimates. We have all seen how the estimates run. The estimating is going to be done by the very same people, under the amendment, as have been doing the estimating prior to the adoption of the amendment. 
The proponents are promising, absolutely pledging to the people of the United States, that this amendment will balance the budget. That is what they are promising. The Senator just said that. We cannot possibly get the estimates right. The Senator just said that. We can't possibly get the estimates right. 
Well, then, may I ask the Senator, are we not misleading the American people with these elaborate claims that we are going to balance the budget when what we are really going to balance is the estimates? Then the Senator admits that we can't be accurate in these estimates. We never have been, and we never will be. There won't be any computers made that will come up with the correct estimates.

Mr. BYRD. I think the committee report language that was prepared by the committee, of which the distinguished Senator from Utah is chairman, makes one of the best cases against this amendment. He says there won't be any more games played. Take a look at this report. It tells you what games to play. 
Let me read it. Talking about the estimates of outlays and receipts, it says, `Estimates means good faith, responsible, and reasonable estimates made with honest intent to implement section 1, and not evade it. This provision gives Congress an appropriate degree of flexibility.' 
We have got more and more ways to play games. 
It `gives Congress an appropriate degree of flexibility in fashioning necessary implementing legislation. For example, Congress could use estimates of receipts or outlays at the beginning of the fiscal year to determine what the balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be so long as the estimates are reasonable and made in good faith.' 
Now we are going to play games about who is reasonable, what is reasonable, and what isn't. 
`In addition, Congress could decide that a deficit caused by a temporary self-correcting drop in receipts or increase in outlays during the fiscal year would not violate the article. Similarly, Congress could state that very small or negligible deviations from a balanced budget would not represent a violation of section 1.' 
Will the distinguished Senator indicate to me what would be considered `negligible,' what would be considered `small,' and what would be considered `not small,' and `not negligible'? We have a budget now of $1.7 trillion. Let us say it is off by $50 billion. Would that be `negligible'? Would that be `small,' $50 billion?

Mr. BYRD. Let's take a look at this chart. The green line, the horizontal line, means that the estimated revenues were right on target. They were not overestimated. They were not underestimated. The revenues were exactly estimated to be exactly on target. 
Note the chart which the Senator says makes his case. The chart says that in only one year, 1987, did the estimates even come close to being on target. They were off just $2 billion. So the chart makes my case. 
The committee says you can do it by estimates. `Estimates of outlays shall not exceed estimates of receipts in any given fiscal year.' The chart shows that you cannot depend upon the estimates, that the people who have the most expertise of any in the world cannot be accurate in their estimates. Why? Because we cannot foresee what the unemployment rate is going to be, we cannot foresee what the rate of national economic growth is going to be, and we cannot see what interest rates are going to be in a year or more down the road. That is why people cannot be accurate in their estimates. 
So this committee language makes my case--makes my case when it turns to the use of words like `estimates,' and then defines the word `estimates' as meaning `good faith, responsible, and reasonable estimates made with honest intent to implement section 1.' 
Let me ask the question of my dear friend, who will be making up these estimates? 
The Congress will make the estimates. The Congress will enforce the amendment. So what assurance is there that the Congress is going to make estimates that are correct? 
What encouragement does that give to the American people to believe that this amendment, which the distinguished Senator from Utah says does not say we are going to balance the budget, what assurance can the American people have when it is even worse than that by saying that the estimates of outlays will not exceed the estimate of receipts?

Mr. BYRD. He is correct about it. But he still has not answered my question as to why the committee and the proponents of the amendment felt after saying in section 1 that total outlays shall not exceed total receipts in any fiscal year, which is pretty straightforward language, which says that the budget has to be balanced every year, it says that the budget has to be balanced every year, why do we take an approach which says, on the one hand, the budget must be balanced--and that is what I have been hearing from the speakers who are proponents of this legislation--why did they say in the first section that the budget will have to be balanced every year and then in section 6 say, as it were, `Well, you do not really have to believe that first section? We are not going to hold you to it. We know it will be difficult, if not impossible some years, to hold you to that. So we are not going to require you to equal the outlays with the receipts. But what we are going to do is this. We are going to let you get by by just balancing the estimates.' 
Who makes the estimates? Cannot the estimates be cooked? The administration cooked the numbers when they were sending up budgets in the early part of the Reagan administration. They cooked the numbers. These numbers can be cooked once this constitutional amendment becomes a part of the Constitution. They can be cooked. The estimates can be cooked. When can the American people believe us and believe that we mean what we say? 
That is all I have been saying here. I have been saying that we do not mean what we say in this amendment. We do not mean what we say in section 1. So what are the American people to believe? 
I compliment the distinguished Senator for coming to the floor. He is a man after my own kidney, as Shakespeare would say. He is a man after my kidney. He came to the floor. And I had suggested that someone should come and give us an analysis of these sections and explain how they are going to work and what are we expected to do to make them work. 
Well, he came to the floor, and he has been reading the sections of the amendment one by one, which was not exactly what I asked for. I do not have any more faith in the amendment now than I had to begin with. I can read the sections. 
I read the sections a number of times. And the distinguished Senator has prepared a chart here so that we can read them over and over again. I want somebody to explain to me how they will work and what is there about that amendment that can assure those people who are looking through the electronic eye that this budget is going to be balanced if this amendment is adopted--the budget is going to be balanced.

Mr. BYRD. I have proved that I will do everything I can to balance the budget. But not only this Senator. They are standing in rows on this side of the aisle. 
In 1993, they voted to lower the deficits by almost $500 billion. Working with the President, we had a package to reduce the deficits. I voted for that package. The Senator from Connecticut voted for that package. Many other Senators on this side of the aisle voted for that package. Not one--not one--Senator on the other side voted for that package, to bring down the deficits. 
So we do not need a constitutional amendment. We just need the courage to vote for it. I do not know what there is in this constitutional amendment that will give us any more courage and backbone than we already have. I do not know how many will figure 
that out.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, here is the mirage, right here. This is the mirage, this amendment to the Constitution. The Senator says that we should write two or three more supermajority requirements into the Constitution. It already requires eight, including the three amendments--five in the original Constitution and three amendments, 12, 14 and 25. Now we are going to write some more in. This is going to head us more and more in the direction of minority control--minority control. This is a republic, which uses democratic processes. This is a representative democracy, a republic for which it stands. A republic. 
I just close by saying this amendment is a real gimmick--a real gimmick. It is not going to cause us to balance this budget any more than if we didn't have it; may even make it more difficult to balance the budget. 
Moses struck the rock at Kadesh with his rod. He smote the rock twice and water gushed forth and the people's thirst and the thirst of the beasts of the people were quenched. This amendment is not the rock of Kadesh. You won't be able to smite that amendment. The waters of a balanced budget are not going to flow from that piece of junk. I say that with all due respect to my friend. But that will not work. That's the long and the short of it, and it is misleading the people. It is misleading the people. The amendment doesn't require us to balance the budget, it only requires us to balance the estimates. So there we go again. There is a wheel, and we seem to be on it, around and around. Balance the estimates. We have seen the estimates. 
So we can see by looking at this chart where the estimates have been wrong--always wrong--in the past, and we should know by that lamp that they are going to be wrong in the future. 
So what faith can we have in this kind of an amendment? The Senator says we would be under greater pressure to balance the 
budget. Why not start now? Why wait 5 years, at least 5 years, perhaps even longer under that amendment? Why wait for pressure? The pressure is just as great today and we will be even deeper into the hole by 2002 than we are now.

Mr. BYRD. I would like to hear the distinguished Senator explain how the States balance their budgets and how they operate, not only on a budget that provides for the operating expenses of Government from day-to-day, but also on the capital budget, and why under this amendment the Federal Government will not be able to have a capital budget. 
Why does not someone explain that the States operate on two budgets? Not only an operating budget, but also a capital budget. And then why do we continue to say that the Federal Government should balance its budget like the States do, without the explanation that there are capital budgets in States?

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah for his courtesy in yielding time. 
Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut for his amendment, and for his very thorough explanation of it. There is, as he has said, no higher duty than this body has than to safeguard the security and liberties of the American people. This is the height of pernicious legislative mischief to provide the ready and robust forces when the Nation faces a serious threat to our national security. Can we define the specific nature of such threats that might face us? Of course not. Do we need the flexibility to react in time, in advance, and with sufficient credibility so as to show down all such conceivable threats to our security? Of course, we should. 
The Constitution should not be used as a straitjacket which has the effect of throwing into doubt our ability to perform this most basic of our duties. Thus, the Dodd amendment is a very useful one, as essential improvement to the constitutional proposal which is before the body. The definition of `imminent and serious military threat to national security,' as a test for waiving the requirements of the balanced budget, as proposed by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is a valuable improvement to the amendment offered by the Senator from Utah, and I strongly encourage my colleagues to support it. 
I again thank my friend from Utah, who is my friend, who is a fine Christian gentleman, who is always fair and courteous. I salute him for that, and I thank my colleague from Connecticut.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the measure before the Senate is a proposed amendment to the Constitution mandating a balanced budget annually. It is unconstitution-like. I am not saying it is unconstitutional. If it is riveted into the Constitution, of course it would be constitutional. But I am saying it is unconstitution-like in its words, which lack the vision, the simplicity, and the majestic sweep of language that we find in the Constitution. Rather, it sounds and reads like a bookkeeping manual on principles of accounting. The amendment is replete with words like `outlays,' `fiscal year,' `receipts,' `estimates of outlays and receipts,' `receipts except those derived from borrowing,' `repayment of debt principal,'--words which are out of keeping with the graceful language used by the Framers in writing the original Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The amendment is made up of 8 sections constituting a total of circa 310 words, more than were used by the Framers in stating the Preamble to the Constitution and in establishing a Congress composed of two Houses, establishing a House of Representatives, establishing a Senate, establishing the Presidency, establishing the Supreme Court, and including the article setting forth the mode by which the Constitution would be considered ratified and in effect. Moreover, it is a masterpiece of confusing details, deceptive illusions, and doublespeak. 
It is misleading. I am talking about this amendment now that we have before the Senate. It is misleading, contradictory in its terms, and is ultimately bound to disappoint the American people and undermine their faith in the credibility of the Nation's basic document of law and government. 
We all agree--all 100 of us--that continued massive deficits are bad for the country, and we are all in agreement that action must be taken by the legislative branch, working in cooperation with the executive branch, to bring our budgets under control and into balance at some point, yea, even to provide for surpluses so that the country can begin to retire the principal and reduce the interest on the national debt, which, in only the last 16 years, has assumed colossal proportions beyond anything that was even imagined during the previous 192 years and 39 administrations in the history of the Republic. I am saying during the 192 years previous to the first Reagan administration. I need not remind my colleagues and those who are listening to the debate--although I shall--that until the beginning of the first administration of Ronald Reagan, total debt of the U.S. Government was a little under $1 trillion, while, beginning with the first administration of President Reagan and continuing up to this time, over $4 trillion has been added to that debt. In other words, four-fifths of the total debt held by the public have been added in the last 16 years, four-fifths--four times the amount of debt that was accumulated during the first 192 years in the life of this Republic, during the first 39 administrations in the life of this Republic, up until the first administration of President Reagan. 
Does anyone challenge that? Does anyone wish to stand on this floor and say, `That ain't so'? 
It is no wonder, then, that the American people have lost faith in their Government, and if this proposed constitutional amendment is approved by both Houses of Congress and ratified by the necessary three-fourths of the State legislatures, the people of this country will have no cause for reassurance that our fiscal and deficit problems will ever be resolved. I fear that the situation will not have been made better but, rather, will have been made worse. 
I have not been able to listen to all of the speeches that have been made by all of the proponents of the amendment. 
I have tried to listen to as many as I could. I have not been able to hear them all. But of those that I have heard, there has not been one--not one--that has addressed itself to the details of this amendment. 
We have heard many times that the devil is in the details. I have not heard a single proponent--not one--explain the amendment section by section or stated how and why the adoption of this amendment will, indeed, bring down the deficit and lead to a balanced budget. I would like for them to explain each section and explain how that section is going to bring the deficits down. 
All of the speeches that I have heard merely talk about the need for getting the deficit under control. I am for that. But none has explained how this particular proposed constitutional amendment is going to do the job. All I have heard have been `the sky is falling' speeches--oh, the sky is falling--which have simply stated the need for getting our house in order, to which we all can agree and stipulate. 
So they say deficits are bad; our national debt is too large; we need to get the deficits under control. Nobody disagrees with that. That is all the speeches I have heard. As I say, I have not heard them all. But all of the speeches by the proponents I have heard have amounted to that: Deficits are bad; we have to do something about them. 
And what do they propose to do? Adopt this amendment. They don't explain how it will rectify the situation. 
So I continue to wait to hear a single proponent--just one--who will come to the floor and explain clearly as to how each section will contribute to the common objective that we all seek; namely, a balanced budget, and explain beyond any doubt that these sections of this amendment, as so constructed, will do the job. You can bet on it. 
Everyone is in agreement that consistently operating with deficits is undesirable, but we are told to accept on faith this proposed constitutional amendment. We are told it will do the job, but we are not told how it will do the job. We are not given the details as to the sacrifices and the pain the people must endure in order to achieve yearly budget balance. We are only told that continued deficits are not good, which we all know to start with, but that this amendment will fix the problem. We are, therefore, importuned to buy what really amounts to a `pig in a poke.' And as far as the explanation of the amendment thus far is concerned, we cannot even be assured that there is a pig in that poke. 
So now let us proceed to take a look section by section at the amendment, which we are all being implored to support and which, if we buy on to this amendment, the American people will, likewise, be beseeched to ratify in their State legislatures throughout the country: Don't look at the details, don't bother, just accept on faith. Things are bad, deficits are bad, we have to do something about it. Ipso facto, vote for this amendment. It will do the job. 
For the benefit of the American people who do not have a copy of this amendment and who are watching and listening to the words spoken on this floor, I have had the entire amendment placed on this chart and will now go through it section by section in the hopes of shedding a little light at least on what I believe to be a very anti-Democratic, anti-Republican, and anticonstitutional proposal. Not unconstitutional, but anticonstitutional. 
So let us start at the beginning. The Bible says, `In the beginning.' You can't get much beyond that, `In the beginning, God * * *' 
Well, in the beginning, let's take the very top section. Let's start at the top. 
Section 1 of the constitutional amendment states:  
Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed-- 
Shall not exceed-- total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific-- 
For a specific-- excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote. 
Mr. President, and Mr. and Mrs. America, this states that for every dollar that is spent in any fiscal year, there shall be $1 of income. That is what it says. In other words, for every dollar that goes out in a given year, a dollar will have to come in, unless three-fifths of the Members of both Houses of Congress provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote. 
If Congress is bound to spend more than it takes in, how can it do it? It can only do so by a rollcall vote and by passing a law which states the specific excess by which dollars spent will exceed dollars received. It will not be enough for Congress to provide by law in a given year that outlays `may exceed receipts.' That is not enough. To comply with the language of this section, Congress will have to state specifically the excess of outlays over receipts that it is willing to approve. 
Moreover, this cannot be done by a simple majority in each House of Congress, as is the case with most other laws that are passed by Congress. The stickler here is that three-fifths of the whole number of each House will have to approve the specific excess. Got to be exact, the exact amount. `All right, Senators, we're getting ready to vote. We've got to know the exact amount by which the outlays will exceed the receipts, because it has the words `specific excess'.' 
For example, the Senate is composed of 100 Members and three-fifths of them will be required to loose this amendment from its chains. Three-fifths of the whole number of the Senate means that at least 60 Members of the Senate would have to vote in favor of permitting the specific excess of dollars paid out over dollars taken in. Sixty Members. Fifty-nine will not be enough. 
It will not matter if there is a snowstorm outside the doors and only 59 Senators can get to the Senate to vote. That is a quorum--that is over a quorum. But that will not matter. Even if they all vote to allow outlays to exceed receipts by an exact and specific amount, that will not be enough. 
Now, this may appear to be a very simple matter on the surface, but upon closer examination it will be anything but simple. 
Why do I say this? Because there is no way on God's green Earth that human beings can precisely predict what the total outlays will be for a fiscal year until that fiscal year has expired and the U.S. Treasury Department has tallied up the final figures of what the income versus the spending was for the year just ended. No way--no way--that anyone, that any human being or any computer contrived by any human being can determine before the fiscal year is out the exact amount by which outlays for any fiscal year have exceeded the receipts of that fiscal year. No way. It is impossible. No way, until the fiscal year has expired and the U.S. Treasury Department has tallied up the final figures of what the income versus the spending was for the year just ended. You will not know until that happens. 
And only then, which is usually late in the month of October--perhaps the third or fourth week of October--several weeks after the end of any fiscal year, are the facts known as to the exact amount of the outlays and the exact amount of the receipts, and, consequently, whether or not there was a deficit, and, if so, specifically how much was the excess of outlays over receipts. We will not know it by the end of the fiscal year. 
So what are we going to do then? The fiscal year has ended. September 30 is gone. We do not know what the excess was. How then can three-fifths of the Members of the Senate vote for a `specific excess of outlays over receipts' when the final books are not closed, the amounts are not tallied. Nobody knows. 
I might stand on my feet and say, `Mr. President, how much is the excess?' Nobody can tell me. And we will not know it for perhaps 3 or 4 weeks after September 30, after the fiscal year has ended. 
Therefore, there is no way for Congress to provide by law for a `specific excess of outlays over receipts' during the fiscal year in question. The specific amount of any excess of outlays over receipts cannot be known by the human mind until the U.S. Treasury has totaled up the figures for a fiscal year that has already ended 2 or 3 weeks earlier and advised Congress of the results. 
Consequently, we are being presented in the very first section of the amendment with a requirement that cannot be met. It cannot be met. Now, let us examine more closely. Take the first portion of Section 1: `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year * * *' That language is very clear. It cannot be misconstrued or 
misunderstood. It means exactly what it says. It does not say that total outlays `may not exceed.' It does not say that `Total outlays for any fiscal year may not exceed total receipts.' It does not say that `Total outlays for any fiscal year should not exceed total receipts.' Nor does it say that `Total outlays for any fiscal year ought not exceed total receipts.' It says, total outlays shall not--shall not--shall not--exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, no ifs, ands or buts. The Federal budget, under this language, must be balanced every fiscal year right down to the bottom dollar. There is no wiggle room--wiggle room--none. 
Now, let us understand what this means. We are told by the proponents of this amendment that the Federal Government should have to balance its budget every year, like a family does. How many times have I heard that? `Oh, we ought to do like the average American family. We ought to do like a family does or do like the State governments do it. The Federal Government ought to do like the State governments do it. They balance their budgets. The American family balances its budget. And the Federal Government ought to do the same.' How many times have I heard that? How many times have you heard it, Mr. President? 
The truth is that the American family does not and the truth is the State and local governments of this country do not do what this amendment requires the Federal Government to do. The fact is that the unified Federal budget is not the same as a family budget. The fact is that the unified Federal budget is not the same as the budgets that State and local governments are required to balance--or that they are supposed to balance. They are not the same. 
Unlike those budgets, unlike the State budgets, the unified Federal budget includes all spending that occurs in a fiscal year regardless of whether that spending is for recurring operating costs of the Federal Government or whether that spending is for public investments. 
Now, would anybody stand and challenge that? Would anybody tell me that the States are operating under the same kind of unified Federal budget that the Federal Government is operating under? 
Yet they say we ought to do like the States. The Federal Government ought to balance its budget like the States balance their budgets. Just one--I would like to hear a Senator challenge that statement. 
Under the unified Federal budget, capital investments, such as roads, airports, transit systems, military procurement for weapon systems, military aircraft, battleships, missiles, are required to be paid for in full as the purchases are made. This is a system of budget accounting that no business, no State or local government, and no family has to abide by. 
Let us consider the family budget. I consider my family budget a typical family budget. I can remember when I had to buy a bedroom suite--on May 25, 1937; soon it will be 60 years. On May 25, 1937, I bought a bedroom set, looking forward to the day when I pay that preacher $2 and take my wife away. We would not be going on any honeymoon. Of course, we have been on a honeymoon now for 60 years, but we would not be going anywhere. There would not be any gifts, would not be any flower girls, would not be any best man--except Robert Byrd. I bought a bedroom suite, paid for it at the company store where I was employed as a meatcutter and in produce sales, $5 down, $7.50 every 2 weeks until it was paid off. 
So that is the way most families have to manage. Most families that I know have to borrow money to buy their homes, have to borrow money to buy their farms, they have to borrow money to purchase necessary assets such as automobiles with which they get to work and get home from work, and they have to borrow money to provide their children with a college education. I do not think that one will find very many Americans who would want to have to balance their family budgets in a manner that would require them to pay for the entire cost of their home in the same year, the entire cost of the farm in the same year, the entire cost of the automobile in the same year, or the entire cost of a college education for their children. Yet that is what the U.S. Government would be required to do by this section of this amendment. 
Mr. and Mrs. America, be on your guard; you need to know that. When you listen to these proponents say that the Federal Government should balance its budget just like the States balance theirs--listen, Governors, you know better than that. When the proponents say that the Federal Government should balance its budget just like the average American families balances its budget, hold on. Pay attention. That is not what it does. 
Similarly, the proponents tell us that most States and local governments are required to have balanced budgets. What the proponents fail to point out is the fact that State governments are required to balance only their operating budgets. Do not tell me that `ain't' so, because it is. The States are allowed to have separate capital budgets, which are excluded from the annual budget balancing requirement. A State may be required to keep its operating budget in balance each year, but the budget with which it floats bonds for the construction of school buildings or highways and other capital investments is not required to be balanced each year. I know. I know that is the way the West Virginia Constitution operates. It does not require a unified budget as this amendment would or as the Federal Government does operate on a unified budget. 
If such capital investment budgets were required to be balanced each year, as this amendment would mandate that the 
Federal Government do, the States in many instances would not be able to build schools and highways and bridges. Is that not so, Governors who may be listening? Is that not so, State legislators who may be listening? The capital budgets of States are excluded from the annual budget-balancing requirement of the State constitutions. Under this balanced budget amendment, however, the Federal Government would be forbidden to adopt capital budgeting, and this would gravely endanger our ability to purchase the kinds of public assets or make the kinds of public investments that are so critical to this Nation's future economy and to its future security. 
The language of this first section of the amendment, if the amendment is ever adopted and ratified, will prohibit the Federal Government from purchasing capital assets and repaying the costs of them over time for the simple reason that it says that each year, the total outlays shall not exceed the total receipts; shall not exceed the total income of the Federal Government. Rather, the Federal Government would be required to pay for the entire cost of all these capital investments as they are purchased. I believe if the American people focus on this issue alone, it should be enough to convince them of the unwisdom of placing such a straitjacket on Federal budgeting into our Constitution. 
But the proponents of the amendment will say, `Hold on. Hold on, Senator. This language allows a waiver of the budget balancing requirement.' Sure enough, there is a portion of section 1 which reads, `. . .unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.' 
So the two halves of this sentence do not match up. This sentence is classic doublespeak. Mr. and Mrs. America, that is exactly what we are doing here, engaging in doublespeak. It is a kind of `have it both ways' sentence--the kind of stuff that politicians are so proficient at crafting. On the one hand, we are saying that the Federal Government's spending shall not exceed its income, that it must live within its means, and that that concept is important enough to rivet into the Constitution of the United States. But in the very same sentence, without skipping a beat, the language also says that all that is so unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House waive that requirement. 
So there is a requirement for a supermajority vote of three-fifths of each House to approve a waiver, and that constitutes minority control in each House, which is anathema--anathema--to the principle of majority rule, anathema to the democratic--small `d'--rule, the principle of majority rule, a cardinal principle of representative democracy. That is basic in this Republic. It means that a minority can block action. The requirement of a supermajority three-fifths vote is a prescription for gridlock. A majority of three-fifths would be difficult to get on a politically charged vote of this kind where partisanship would rear its ugly head. What would happen, then, when the President's advisers tell him late in a fiscal year, or at the beginning of the next fiscal year, that despite previous estimates to the contrary--or if it is the last of October, in the next fiscal year--there was a substantial deficit and that Congress has not been able to produce the necessary three-fifths vote in each House to waive the requirement set forth in section 1 for a balanced budget. 
The clock is ticking. The fiscal year is running out. And a deficit looms large, large on the horizon. The President's advisers tell him he is constitutionally bound to balance the budget. 
Now, Mr. President, those Senators didn't do it. They could not muster the three-fifths vote to waive that provision in section 1. 
The President is, therefore, told to impose the necessary cuts in spending for the remainder of the fiscal year in order to achieve budget balance. He has no choice. 
At this late point, during any fiscal year, what could the President do? He would have no choice but to make arbitrary cuts in Federal spending, which could mean a reduction in payments to which many citizens are entitled under the law. Among the programs for which monthly checks are issued by the U.S. Treasury are Social Security benefits, military and civilian retirement benefits, veterans benefits--hear me, veterans--veterans benefits, payments for Medicare and Medicaid, and payments to contractors. To those who say that your Social Security check, or--veterans, lend me your ears--your veterans pension, or your military or civilian retirement checks are safe under this constitutional amendment, I can assure you that they are not. Moreover, it is highly likely that the judiciary will find itself embroiled in yearly budget decisions. 
I see in this committee report these words on page 23--words in the committee report that comment on section 6 of the amendment:  
The provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment that would result in a shift in the balance of powers among the branches of Government. 
How can any committee report say, with any authority that is dependable authority, that the provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment? Is that not what the committee report said? `The provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment. . .' That is saying to the courts, Mr. Justice, your court is precluded from interpreting the amendment in any way that would result in a shift of the balance of powers among the branches of Government. How much is that piece of paper going to be worth? Yet, a committee report says it. `The provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment that would result in a shift of the balance of powers among the branches of Government.' 
The President impounds the moneys. He feels he has to impound them. He has to stop the checks. He has to put a halt on the mailing of the checks. He impounds moneys. Does that constitute a shift in the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branches? And, Mr. Proponent, are you going to tell me that the courts will abide by this committee language here, that they will feel bound by this committee language, they will be `precluded'? That is what this language says, that `the provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment that would result in a shift in the balance of powers among the branches of Government.' 
Let me also say at this point that section 1 of the amendment is a hollow promise. It says the budget shall be balanced, but it does not say how the budget must be balanced. It does not say how the deficits shall be reduced. Where are the proponents? This is what I have been waiting to hear. I am opposed to this constitutional amendment. I want someone to tell me and to convince me and prove to me, by their written words, that I am wrong, that I am not reading these sentences correctly, that they don't say what I have said they say. I want someone to show me that I am wrong. 
It does not say how or where to cut Government spending. It does not say how or whether revenues should be increased. There isn't a proponent of the amendment that I have heard stand on the floor and say, `This is how we are going to make this section work. We are going to have to raise taxes.' I haven't heard a proponent stand up on this floor--not one--and say the President's proposed tax cut is going to have to be forgotten, or that the tax cuts proposed by the Republican Party--the GOP, the Grand Old Party--are going to have to be forgotten. Not only should we not have the tax cuts--I say we should not cut taxes. Here is one Senator who, if I were a proponent of this amendment, I would say, well, I am against cutting taxes. I believe we ought to balance the budget. I believe we ought to wipe out these deficits. But this language does not say how or where to cut Government spending. It does not say how or whether revenues should be increased. And all of the Republicans, in 1993, stated that the reason they did not vote for that budget balancing package--which worked--most of them used the excuse that it increased taxes. That may be what we will have to do again. But the language in this amendment doesn't say whether revenues should be increased. 
But never mind, the proponents of the amendment have provided an escape hatch right in the amendment itself. Take a look at section 6. 
Section 6 states, `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation * * *' There is nothing new about that. Congress has the power now, working with the President, to balance the budget. But this amendment says, `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.' 
I hope that the new Members of the Senate will pay close attention to this language. I can understand that when new Members come here, they haven't had any experience with the terminology or the Federal budgets, with the estimates of revenues and outlays from year to year, and how those estimates have been off. I can understand that. So I can forgive new Members. But I hope they will listen. Section 6 states that, `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.' This is the Achilles' heel of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
I especially would like the proponents of this amendment to come over here and defy what I am saying about section 6 of this constitutional amendment. 
While section 1 is the core of the amendment, because it says that the budget shall, not may, but shall be balanced every year, section 6 in the very same amendment says that we don't really have to balance the budget as section 1 would require. The proponents of this amendment are telling us in section 6 that they are just kidding in section 1 when they say that the budget must be balanced. In section 6, they are saying, `We don't really mean it, Mr. and Mrs. America.' In section 1, the amendment says that `outlays shall not exceed receipts' in any fiscal year, but section 6 says only that estimates of outlays shall not exceed estimates of receipts in any fiscal year. 
So, if this amendment is adopted, the sacred document of the Constitution will say, in no uncertain terms, in section 1 that Congress shall balance the budget every year. But just read a little further, and the Constitution of the United States will say, forget section 1, Congress doesn't really have to balance outgo with income, doesn't have to balance outlays with receipts. All we have to do is just rig the estimates, so that estimated spending will not exceed estimated income for any given fiscal year. 
Isn't that what this says? 
Section 1, therefore, makes the entire balanced budget proposal as phony as a $3 bill. Better still, phony as a $2.50 bill; phony. If the escape hatch is used, we will be right back where we have been so many times in the past, balancing the budget will be smoke and mirrors, and anyone who can read the English language knows it. Because there it is as plain as the nose on your face: `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article'--meaning the constitutional amendment to balance the budget--`by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.' Section 6 makes this proposed constitutional amendment a fraud; a fraud. I shall have more to say about section 6 at another time, but I will say this much: I say it makes the amendment a fraud. 
Let the proponents read what the committee report says about section 6. Let me read from the committee report. Page 23 of the committee report: `The Congress shall enforce and implement * * * creates a positive obligation on the part of Congress to enact appropriate legislation to implement and enforce the article.' Then the committee looks at the words `which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.' 
The committee report goes on to say this: `Estimates'--the word `estimates'--`means good faith, responsible, and reasonable estimates made with honest intent to implement section 1.' The committee knows that it is providing a loophole that is large enough for Atilla to drive his 700,000 horsemen through, large enough for Tamerlane, large enough for Amtrak--because it says in the first section the budget must be balanced, the budget shall be balanced; outlays may not exceed receipts. 
Then it comes along in section 6 and says, `Well, we don't really have to do that; don't really have to pay any attention to that language. What we really mean is that the estimates of outlays shall not exceed the estimates of receipts. And the record will show, as I will on another day, that it is impossible for the estimates--insofar as the record is concerned, it has been impossible for the estimates to balance or to come out as stated. It is impossible for anyone to estimate what the revenues are going to be. It is impossible for anyone in this Government to estimate what the revenues will be. It says, well, estimates really mean good-faith, responsible, and reasonable estimates. 
What is meant by `good faith'? How do we know when they are `good faith' estimates? How do we know when they are `responsible' estimates? How do we know when they are `reasonable' estimates? How do we know when those estimates are made with `honest intent'? We have seen the numbers `cooked.' David Stockman was the Director of OMB during the early years of the Reagan administration. The numbers were `cooked,' and David Stockman said so. So they were rigged. 
The committee goes on and says, `This provision gives Congress an appropriate degree of flexibility'--you bet it does --`in fashioning necessary implementing legislation. For example, Congress could use estimates of receipts or outlays at the beginning of the fiscal year to determine whether the balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be satisfied so long as the estimates were reasonable and made in good faith. In addition, Congress could decide that a deficit caused by a temporary, self-directing drop in receipts or increase in outlays during the fiscal years would not violate the article.' 
This is the committee report I am reading from, and it is talking about section 6 in this constitutional amendment. The language goes on to say in the committee report: `Similarly, Congress could state that very small or negligible deviations from a balanced budget would not represent a violation of section 1.' How much is `small'? How much is `very small'? What would be a `negligible deviation'? 
We have a $1.7 trillion budget. Let us say that the deviation is $50 billion. Is that `small'? Is that `very small'? Let us say the estimate only missed it by $50 billion. That is $50 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Is that small enough? It is only 3 percent of the total budget, $50 billion. As a matter of fact, you can make it $51 billion of a $1.7 trillion deficit. It would only be off 3 percent. Is that `negligible'? Is that small enough? 
It goes on to say: `If excess of outlays over receipts were to occur, Congress could require that any shortfall must be made up during the following fiscal year.' 
Now, this is the committee report explaining the amendment. And that is shilly-shally. That is what the committee report says. I did not say it. Section 6 provides the loophole, it provides the way out, the way to get around section 1 in the amendment, the way to get around this balanced budget amendment. I will have more to say about that section at a later time. 
Now let us look at section 2 of the balanced budget amendment. Section 2 states, `The limit on the debt of the United States held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an increase by a rollcall vote.' 
In practical terms, what this section means is, again, if a minority in the Congress decides that they do not want to go along with the policies of the majority, they can put this country into default on its debt. If the United States ever defaulted on the payment of its debt, that action would send the world financial markets into utter chaos. This is the same as any family's filing for bankruptcy. Forget about ever getting another mortgage on the home or another automobile loan. Any lender, knowing that you have already skipped your payments and gone bankrupt, is going to charge you an exorbitant rate of interest on your next loan, that is, if you can ever get another loan. 
Failure to raise the debt limit or ceiling, when required, would have far-reaching effects on the U.S. Treasury's ability to pay Social Security and veterans' pensions and other obligations, and the Nation's creditworthiness would be destroyed. Millions of people depend on Federal payments, including employees, pensioners, veterans, investors, contractors, as well as State and local governments. If the debt ceiling is reached and the necessary supermajority vote of both Houses is not achieved, all of these payments must be stopped. 
The fact is that over the last 16 years, there have been 30 occasions when the Congress has voted to increase the debt limit. And yet, on only 2 of those 30 occasions have we met the three-fifths requirement of this balanced budget amendment. It is not going to be easy. A minority will have many opportunities to play politics with this phraseology in this amendment. Only on 2 of those 30 occasions have we met the three-fifths requirement for this balanced budget amendment. On the other 28 occasions, less than three-fifths of the whole number of both Houses voted by rollcall to provide the necessary increase in the debt limit. 
I have seen the occasion arise many times when this party or that party, one party or the other, will play politics with this language. I have seen situations in which the Democrats laid back, would not vote for an increase in the debt limit. They would make the Republicans do it. And I have seen the occasions when the Republicans would lay back and not vote to raise the debt ceiling, make the Democrats do it. 
One particular instance comes to mind. This is just an example: 
`On Friday, October 12, 1984, the 98th Congress adjourned after the Senate, in a final partisan political battle, narrowly approved an increase in the national debt ceiling to $1.82 trillion. Senate Republicans cleared the way for adjournment when, without the vote of a single Democrat'--I was the minority leader--`without the vote of a single Democrat they,' meaning the Senate Republicans, `approved an increase in the national debt ceiling. `There will be no more votes today,' said Baker,' meaning Howard Baker, `as he smiled broadly. `There will be no more votes this session. There will be no more votes in my career.' His Senate colleagues and spectators in the galleries came to their feet to give the Tennessee veteran a roaring ovation as he sat in his front-row seat. Baker joined in the light laughter saying, `Frankly, I first thought that applause was for me. But then I realized that it was for sine die adjournment.' 
`Following the vote on the debt limit, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, `For 4 years, Republicans have always made us Democrats pass a debt limit. Then they campaigned against it. Now it's their debt limit. Let them pass it.' 
So those are the games that were played, and they will be played again. 
Section 3 of the amendment is as follows: `Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the U.S. Government for that fiscal year, in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts.' 
So this section means then that the President of the United States must send a balanced budget to the Congress before each fiscal year even though during a recession the President may deem it advisable to recommend a fiscal deficit in order to help get the country back on its feet. That will happen from time to time. The language of section 3 would preclude his doing so. He is not supposed to recommend a fiscal deficit. He is required by the constitutional amendment to recommend a balanced budget. 
Notwithstanding this requirement, however, a President's Office of Management and Budget could `cook the numbers,' as was done during the administration of President Reagan. Didn't David Stockman say so? That is not just Robert Byrd talking. They cooked the numbers to reflect whatever income and spending numbers the administration wanted. And they can do it again. They will do it again--cook the numbers. 
The President's budget could, for example, forecast that the economy will grow faster than it really will grow, and therefore would take in more tax revenues; or the administration could forecast that interest rates would be much lower than most economists predict, or that unemployment would drop during the upcoming budget year, thereby causing the budget to be in balance. Cook the numbers. 
In short, the President and his staff can, as we have seen in the past--don't say, `It ain't so,' because it is--come up with any number of rosy scenarios in order to make the numbers balance. Consequently, simply telling the President of the United States that he must send a balanced budget to the Congress does not in fact get us any closer to balancing the budget. The American people will again be treated to `make believe,' `Alice in Wonderland' budgets while we politicians just keep on playing the same old shell game in ways that will fool the American public. 
Section 4 reads:  
No bill to increase revenue shall become law unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by a rollcall vote. 
What the proponents of this amendment are doing is making it more difficult for Congress to close tax loopholes--to get rid of what are called tax expenditures. Mr. President, that little piece of the economic pie amounts to about $500 billion in lost revenues every year. This is not to say that all of these tax writeoffs are bad policy. Certainly the mortgage interest deduction has allowed many more Americans to own homes than may have otherwise been the case. So, many of the writeoffs are wholesome and healthful for the economy. But, at same time, some of these writeoffs are simply tax loopholes which, like leeches, suck the blood from the economic body politic. 
No one likes to raise taxes, but it is something that has to be done, and for 208 years, Congress has been able, by a simple majority vote in both Houses, to increase revenues. It does have to be done, from time to time, no matter how much we may dislike having to vote to do it. Yet, this section would require a kind of `floating' supermajority in both Houses in order to increase revenue. Let me explain this term which I have invented. For over two centuries, the Constitution has required only a simple majority in each House to raise revenues. For example, let us say that there are 90 Senators present and voting on a measure to raise taxes. Up to this point, a simple majority, just 46 Senators of the 90, could pass the bill. Under this proposed constitutional amendment, with 90 Senators voting, 51--51 Senators, not 46; 51 Senators, or five more Senators than a simple majority--would be necessary. 
Now, depending upon what day of the week, what hour of the day, of course, a supermajority of five votes would be necessary rather than a simple majority of one vote. But let us say that 80 Senators are present and voting. A simple majority would require 41 Senators to pass the bill. With this new constitutional amendment in place, at least 51 Senators would be required--or 10 more votes than is presently required. Hence, a supermajority of 10 in that hypothetical case would be necessary. And so on. If 70 Senators voted, ordinarily 36 Senators could pass the bill. But under this constitutional amendment, 51 Senators would be required, or 15 additional Senators over and above a simple majority; a supermajority of 15. So it is a `floating supermajority.' This is why I refer to it as a `floating supermajority.' It floats, or changes, depending upon the number of Senators present and voting, so that if the supermajority of five votes is necessary to pass the tax bill on a Wednesday, let us say, a supermajority of 10 votes or 15 votes may be necessary if the passage of the bill should occur on Thursday or Friday. It could be 9 o'clock in the morning in one case and 4 o'clock in the afternoon in the other. So it would fluctuate. It is not an exact number. It will float from day to day and from hour to hour, depending upon the clock and the calendar. 
Section 5 states: 
The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by a joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House, which becomes law. 
Mr. President, Congress does not always declare war anymore. Even when it does declare war, the declaration may not necessarily be lifted when the shooting stops. Congress declared war against Germany in 1941. Not very many Americans, and not all the Members of the U. S. Senate, perhaps, realize that this declaration of war existed until September 28, 1990. Consequently, if this constitutional amendment to balance the budget had been a part of the U.S. Constitution during that period, the Congress could have waived the balanced budget requirement every year for almost a half century--because a declaration of war was `in effect,' technically. 
So, here again, this section requires a `floating' supermajority, as did section 4, in order to receive the necessary approval by both Houses of Congress. 
If the Nation is not engaged in a conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security, then a three-fifths majority would be required to waive the amendment for national security reasons. I would like to remind my colleagues just to think back with me to the 1990-1991 timeframe and recall President Bush's military buildup in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the actual Desert Storm engagement, a very expensive military buildup was necessary to provide the materiel and the personnel to conduct that conflict. Under this constitutional amendment, should a similar situation arise, the President would be required to achieve a three-fifths majority of both Houses in order to enact into law a waiver under section 1 because the waiver under section 5 would not be applicable, in that we would not be `engaged' in a military conflict; we are just getting ready for one. We are just rolling up our sleeves. We are just preparing. We are getting things all lined up, but we are not actually in a military conflict. But that has to be done because you cannot provide the materiel, the equipment, the engines of war just overnight. Furthermore, under section 5, a three-fifths majority could be required to increase military spending to deter aggression, provide military aid to our allies, or to rebuild forces after a military conflict. 
Until such a three-fifths majority is achieved, what happens to the Nation's defenses? What happens to our national security? Will our allies be able to count on the United States to stand shoulder to shoulder with them if a necessity for such should materialize in the future? 
Will they have any confidence that the United States will act? They have to be more confident than I am confident that the three-fifths vote would be here in this Senate. 
Section 7 states:  
Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States Government except those derived from borrowing. 
`Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States Government except those derived from borrowing.' 
Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States Government except for those for repayment of debt principal. 
Under the definition of section 7, Social Security checks and veterans benefits, veterans pension checks, Medicare reimbursement checks--they are outlays. Does anyone dispute that? Those are outlays. The senior citizens of this country and the veterans of this country are being asked to accept on blind faith the fact that their Social Security checks or their Medicare benefits will be secure if this constitutional amendment is adopted here and ratified later by the requisite number of States. 
They are being told--Social Security recipients are being told, the recipients of veterans checks are being told--that even though the Social Security trust fund is not specifically exempted from the balance mandate, they have no need to worry, because Congress is on record as agreeing to balance the budget without touching the fund. 
The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, commonly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, placed Social Security off budget beginning in 1986. This legislation, with its protections for Social Security, passed the Senate by a vote of 61 to 31 with a strong bipartisan majority. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 reinforced these earlier protections for Social Security by placing it even more clearly off budget. What the American people are not being told by the proponents of this amendment, however, is that a mere statute--a mere statute--protecting Social Security is subordinate to the Constitution of the United States, which is the supreme law--the supreme law--of the land. It will top, it will trump any statute. The supreme law. Here it is, the Constitution of the United States. Tops any statute. 
Nor would the good intentions of the present Congress be binding on future Congresses. I say to the veterans and to the senior citizens of our country, be on your guard. If this proposal becomes a part of the U.S. Constitution, your checks--your checks--will be at risk of being reduced in the future. 
Finally, Mr. President, section 8 says: 
This article shall take effect beginning with fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning after its ratification, whichever is later. 
Which means simply that it can't take effect prior to fiscal year 2002. So those of us who are up for reelection in the year 2000 could, if it was our desire, vote for this amendment, go on home, sit in the old rocking chair, and just rock away, because the hammer isn't going to fall on me. This thing will not go into effect until 2002, at the earliest. 
What does that mean? That also means that Members of the House and Senate will be relieved of the pressure until 2002. So we can just go on our merry way. It will all be taken care of, it will all become automatic, this is self-enforcing, it's automatic. The sky is falling; the debt is bad; the deficit is terrible; just vote for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget; it's just that simple. 
This section amounts to nothing more than a feel-good section. What this is saying is that we can wait to actually balance the budget. We do not need to do it now, Mr. President. This year of 1997 may well be the most opportune time in many, many years to achieve a balanced Federal budget. The President has submitted a budget that is projected to balance by the year 2002. We have already made substantial progress toward that end. The deficit has already been reduced over 60 percent in the last 4 years. It is time to finish the job that we started 4 years ago and enact legislation that will achieve a balanced budget by 2002, not wait until 2002 to start to balance the budget. 
So, Mr. President, when looked at in its entirety, this proposed constitutional amendment amounts to nothing more than constitutional flimflam, constitutional pap. If it is adopted, we would have turned majority rule on its head and replaced it permanently with minority rule. And in the meantime, we will have perpetrated a colossal hoax--h-o-a-x--on the American people, and our children will have been robbed of their birthright to live under a constitutional system of checks and balances and separation of powers. 
We have all heard the moaning and groaning, the shedding of tears about our children, how they are going to bear the fiscal burden that has been placed upon them. I share that feeling. I voted for the package in 1993 that reduced the Federal deficit 
by $500 billion, something like that, $500 billion, which has resulted in four consecutive years of reduced deficits. 
I voted for that. No Senator on that side of the aisle can say that he voted or she voted for that. They will say, `Well, the reason I didn't is because it increased taxes.' Well, that may be part of the pain that we will have to undergo to relieve that burden from our children's backs. 
I do not think the President should be advocating tax cuts now. I do not think that the GOP, the grand old party, should be advocating tax cuts at this time. Forget about the tax cuts and relieve the burden on our children's backs by that much. 
I am concerned too about my grandchildren and my great grandchildren and their children, that they will not live under a Constitution such as that which was handed down to us by our forefathers. 
But let me remind my colleagues who may be listening, let me remind the American people who may be listening, this amendment does not require that the budget be balanced. It does if we only look at section 1. But when we look at the amendment in its entirety and go down to section 6, we realize full well that it does not mean that. We are only required to balance the estimates, the estimates of revenues, the estimates of outlays. So what this amendment does is require us to balance the estimates. 
Mr. President, I am reminded of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In his `Republic,' Plato, in a dialogue with a friend, speaks of human beings living in a cave, with their legs and their necks chained so that they can only look toward the rear of the cave. They are prevented by the chains from turning around, from turning their heads toward the entrance of the cave. And above and behind them is a fire blazing, causing shadows to appear on the walls of the cave, the shadows creating strange images that move around the walls, as the flames flicker and as men and objects pass between the fire and the human beings who were chained. The den has an echo which causes the prisoners to fancy that voices are coming from those moving shadows. 
At length, one of the human beings is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand and turn his neck around and walk toward the cave's entrance, walk toward the light at the entrance. As he is compelled to move toward the cave's opening, he suffers pains from the light of the Sun and is unable to see the realities, unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had only seen the shadows. He even fancies that the shadows which he formerly saw were truer than the real objects which are now revealed to him. 
He is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent until he is forced into the presence of the bright noon day sun and he is able to see the world of reality. 
Mr. President, as I listened to my colleagues who are proponents of the balanced budget amendment, I hear them year after year urging support of a constitutional amendment, and they use the same old arguments year after year. They must be getting tired of hearing those arguments over and over. I know I am tired. They seem never to view the amendment with reality but always with their backs turned toward the light and their faces turned toward the darkness, as it were, of the rear of Plato's allegorical cave. As in his Allegory, they seem to be impervious to a realistic view of the amendment, but continue to insist that it is really the elixir, the silver bullet, and they seem to resist holding it up to the light but prefer, instead, to concentrate on its shadows, its feel-good platitudes. 
I view the amendment as a flickering, unrealistic image on the walls of the cave of politics. Most of the proponents of the amendment are unwilling to take a look at the amendment, section by section, phrase by phrase, clause by clause, and word by word, preferring to live with the image that has so long been projected to the overwhelming majority of the American people by the proponents of the amendment. It is a feel-good image that will not bear the light of scrutiny, and the echoes that come back from the walls of the cave of politics are the magic incantations that we hear over and over and over again in this so-called debate--`vote for the amendment'--which really is not a debate at all. It has not been thus far. Maybe it will become one. If it were a debate, the proponents would be on the floor, even now, challenging the conclusions that I have drawn and expressed and telling me that I have not been reading the amendment correctly--`No, the amendment does not say that,' they should be saying--in which I have proclaimed it to be a fraud. 
Elijah smote the waters of the Jordan with his mantle and the waters parted, and he and Elisha crossed over the Jordan on dry land to the other side of the Jordan. I have seen that old river of Jordan, one of the great rivers of the world. I thought it was going to be a wide, deep river. Not a wide river. Not a deep river. Some places it might be 2 feet deep, that great old river of Jordan. 
I bet my friend here sings songs about that old river of Jordan.  
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, 
and cast a wishful eye 
To Canaan's fair and happy land 
where my possessions lie. 
So Elijah smote the waters with his mantle and the waters parted, and he and Elisha crossed over on dry land to the other side of the Jordan. This constitutional amendment will never be the mantle that will part the waters of political partisanship and divisiveness, `cooked numbers,' and doctored estimates so as to provide a path across the river of swollen deficits to the dry land of a balanced budget on the opposite banks of the stream. Where are those who will challenge what I have said about section 6, who will say that I am wrong about this amendment's unworthiness of being placed in the Constitution, who will cite the errors of my argument and explain to this Senate the amendment, section by section, and explain why this amendment will work, how it will work, where the cuts will be made, and how the revenues will be increased. All of these good things do not just happen once the amendment is added to the Constitution. 
If this amendment is the panacea that so many in this body claim it to be, then certainly it could stand the scrutiny of point-by-point, section-by-section debate. It is flawed, as I believe, and if it is flawed, as I believe, we must dare to hold it to the light and expose it. The American people should not be sent such a far-reaching amendment without an exhaustive discussion of the havoc that it could create. 
This is not a campaign slogan--`pass the balanced budget amendment.' It is not a Madison Avenue jingle designed to sell soap. Why not just put it on the bumpers of our automobiles as a bumper sticker--`pass the constitutional amendment.' This is an amendment to the most profound and beautifully crafted Constitution of all time. And we owe the American people the best, most thorough debate on its provisions of which we are capable as lawmakers and as their elected representatives. 
Let us all come out of the cave and not fear or shrink from the bright rays of the Sun on the language of this amendment.

which deals specifically with section 6. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is on the Judiciary Committee. He wrote some differing views from those of the majority of the committee, and they are printed in the committee report. But inasmuch as my amendment strikes most of section 6, I hope that Members--and I particularly call to the attention of new Members of the body, section 6 and the language in the report which provides the loopholes that will give us all a way out of having to live up to this constitutional amendment give us a way out of having to balance the budget, in the event that it is adopted by both Houses and ratified by three-fourths of the States. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont.

Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Rodney E. Slater to be the Secretary of the Department of Transportation. Over the last four years, Mr. Slater has served the President and the Nation, and he has served well in his capacity as our Federal Highway Administrator. He has done so with the same distinction and effectiveness that he demonstrated previously while serving then-Governor Clinton in several capacities back in his home State of Arkansas. 
I am pleased that the President has nominated such an able and accomplished and dedicated public official to head the Department of Transportation. We will face many critical challenges in the transportation arena in the next several months and years--the reauthorization of all of our critical highway and transit programs; the need to reform the entire financing mechanism for the Federal Aviation Administration; the need to find more Federal resources to stem the deterioration of our transportation infrastructure; the need to reverse the recent increase we are witnessing in drunk driving as well as the need to improve our safety record in all modes of transportation. 
I heard the President speak about the dangers of smoking, and I am for the great crusade that has been conducted across this Nation against smoking. But I would like to see a similar crusade against drinking alcoholic beverages. Let's have a crusade to match the crusade against smoking. Let's have a crusade against drinking, because my wife, your wife, my daughters, my grandchildren can get into an automobile and leave the house and never come home alive again because of some drunken driver who is all over the highway. Let's have a crusade against alcoholic beverages. I would be happy to help by speaking out against the drinking of alcohol. 
I know from several meetings that I have had with Mr. Slater that he recognizes clearly how important a vibrant and efficient transportation system is to the Nation's future. He knows that, as a nation, we have allowed our transportation infrastructure to deteriorate to the point that we have a backlog of unmet needs totaling well over $100 billion. This backlog of unmet needs for unsafe bridges, deteriorated highways, airports, and transit systems serves as a continuing drag on our Nation's productivity. He knows that poor highways restrict access to jobs, to schools and to health care--that poorly maintained ships and waterways can lead to environmental disaster. 
At my request, Mr. Slater has visited my home State of West Virginia on a number of occasions. He has seen first hand the benefits flowing to my constituents and the entire Nation from ongoing efforts such as the completion of Appalachian Corridor `G.' But he also knows that much more needs to be done to improve mobility, not just in West Virginia but throughout the entire Nation.  
Mr. Slater comes from humble origins, having been born in the small community of Tutwiler, MS. With a population of 1,391, just a few more people than we have in Sophia, WV, from where I come. Tutwiler has about 200 more residents than the town of my upbringing, Sophia, WV. I know something about humble beginnings. And I know that humble beginnings can give some people a clarity of vision and tenacity of purpose. These are the attributes that we find among true national leaders--and Rodney Slater's leadership at this vital time in the Nation's history as Secretary of Transportation will be critical as we strive to balance the Federal budget without decimating the Nation's physical infrastructure. I look forward to his confirmation. I am glad today to speak in support of his nomination enthusiastically and without any reservations. 
I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the English word `irony' comes to us from an Ancient Greek word meaning `a dissembler in speech.' 
The English word `irony' is defined as the contrast between something that somebody thinks to be true, as revealed in speech, action, or common wisdom, and that which an audience or a reader knows to be true. 
Mr. President, permit me to give an example. 
If anyone in the hearing of my voice will take out a U.S. one-dollar bill and turn that one-dollar bill over onto its obverse side, he or she will read in clear script, `In God We Trust.' 
Permit me to introduce another example. 
Every day of each new meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives, an official chaplain of each of those two chambers of Congress--or a designated substitute--will stride to the dais and address a sometimes elegant prayer to the Deity. 
Again, every day in courtrooms across this country, hundreds of witnesses will take their place at the front of the court chamber, put their hands on incalculable numbers of Bibles, and swear to tell the truth, `. . . so help me God.' 
We do the same. I have done it many times in my 50 years of service and elected office. We stand and swear on oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, `so help me God.' 
Additionally, daily, thousands of men and women, in a variety of groups and millions upon millions of boys and girls in our schools will pledge allegiance to our flag, uttering, among other words, the words `under God.' I was a member of the House of Representatives in June 1954, when the House of Representatives, I believe on June 7th of that year, added the words `under God' to the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. The next day, the Senate adopted a similar amendment, and then, on June 14, the measure was signed into law adding the words `under God.' I will always be proud of the fact that I was a Member of the Congress of the United States when those words were added to the Pledge of Allegiance--`one nation under God.' Both Houses added the words `under God.' 
Here is the irony. In spite of that chain of rituals I have just related, in situation after situation, anecdotal and documented both, public school authorities, ostensibly following rulings of the Supreme Court dating from at least the 1960's, have prohibited the utterance of prayers at school functions, in classrooms, or even in groups or privately on public school property. 
As I read my U.S. Constitution--and here it is--such a prohibition of prayer in school flies in the face of the first amendment, which declares that `Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .' 
Please note those words again: `. . . or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .' 
That passage was explicitly written into our Bill or Rights at the insistence of none other than James Madison, based on direct appeals to Madison by baptist ministers in Virginia, who had been forced to support the official State church during the colonial era, and whose practice of their own religious choice had been officially denied, proscribed, or penalized by colonial officials. 
It is ironic that from that understandable constitutional safeguard in support of the free exercise of religious faith, opponents of any religion have turned that passage of the First Amendment on its head to prohibit--I say prohibit--the free exercise of religion in our public life and, particularly, to drive religious faith out of our public schools. 
It is equally ironic that, as religion is making a public resurgence in the long-atheistic former Soviet Union, our Nation, whose protofoundations stand on the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of early colonists whose primary inspiration in coming to America in the first--Congregationalists, Calvinists, Baptists, Jews, Catholics, Orthodox, and others--whose primary purpose in coming to America in the first place, I repeat, was a yearning for religious liberty against those who would deny them the right of religious liberty--that our Nation should be embarked on a course which, in effect, denies religious liberty to many of our citizens. 
Mr. President, I have heard increasing concerns about the lack of moral orientation among so many younger Americans--about a rising drug epidemic among our children, about rampant sexual promiscuity, about children murdering children, about gangs of teenage thugs terrorizing their neighborhoods, and about a pervading moral malaise among youth in both our inner cities and suburbs. 
Is there any wonder that so many young Americans should be 
drifting with seemingly no ethical moorings in the face of an apparent effort to strip every shred of recognizable ethics, of teachings about values, and spirituality from the setting in which those young Americans spend most of their waking hours--our public schools? 
Mr. President, in an effort to restore something of a spiritual balance to our public schools and to extracurricular activities in our public schools, I am today introducing a joint resolution to propose an amendment to the Constitution clarifying the intent of the Constitution with regard to public school prayer. 
My amendment is an effort to make clear that neither the Constitution, or the amendments thereto, require, nor do they prohibit, voluntary prayer in the public schools or in the extracurricular activities of the public schools. 
Let me read my amendment. Let me read my proposed amendment. It is very short, very brief, very much to the point:  
Nothing in this Constitution, or amendments thereto, shall be construed to prohibit or require voluntary prayer in public schools, or to prohibit or require voluntary prayer at public school extracurricular activities. 
So anyone who fears that the language of this amendment would allow public schools to mandate the recitation of daily prayer, or that school administrators will become the authors of such prayers, need not worry. Have no fear. You need not lose a moment of sleep. This amendment does not supplant the clear proscription contained in the `establishment' clause of the First Amendment. My amendment is an effort to make clear that the words that the Constitution uses with regard to religious freedom do not mean that voluntary prayer is prohibited from our public schools or our public school activities. 
As I shall one day state on this floor, all of the Presidents in their inaugural speeches, and/or in other documents and writings, have referred to the Deity, referred to the Almighty God, to Providence, all of them. I shall read from the words of each President's inauguration speech in which he refers, in one way or another, to God Almighty, the Great Judge of the world. We read those references in the Declaration of Independence and the Mayflower Compact, and all of the State constitutions, as I shall show upon another occasion. Then to say that the schoolchildren of the Nation cannot enter into voluntary prayer in the public schools, or during commencement exercises is absurd, absurd, utter nonsense. 
In short, I hope to end the three-decades-long tyranny of the minority in denying to the majority of Americans the least vestige of the exercise of a liberty otherwise guaranteed by the Constitution--the right of believing children in our public school system to pray in accordance with their own consciences and in the privacy of their voluntary associations within our public schools. 
That right I sincerely believe the Constitution already grants, but I want to spell out in that same Constitution by way of an amendment that permission to pray voluntarily in our public schools does not constitute `an establishment of a religion.' 
To deny any schoolchild in this country the right to voluntarily pray in academics maintaining that that constitutes establishment of religion is pure nonsense. 
With introduction, and I hope eventual adoption of my amendment, we can finally begin the 7-year long process to answer the peoples' concerns. We can begin to restore the spiritual compass that has been lost in the lives of so many of our citizens. And, most importantly, we can begin to return to our children the moral orientation they so desperately desire. 
Tennyson said, `More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.' 
So, Mr. President, I urge those who want to deliver on the wishes of the American people to join me in this effort. 
I send to the desk my amendment, and ask that it be printed and referred appropriately to committee. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator talked about the language of the Constitution. In reading this amendment, this proposed amendment to the Constitution, I have been struck as I read it by the contrast in this language in the proposed amendment in contrast to the language of the Constitution. 
Would the Senator be surprised if I were to say to him that the Constitution of the United States provides for a Congress of two bodies, the Senate and the House of Representatives, provides for the creation of the House of Representatives, provides for the establishment of the Senate of the United States, provides for the establishment of the Presidency, provides for the establishment of the Supreme Court of the United States, and provides for the mode by which that Constitution would come into being? Would the Senator be surprised if I were to say to him that the language in the Constitution that does all of these things that I just enumerated constitutes fewer words than are used in this proposed amendment to the Constitution? Would the Senator be surprised at my saying that?

Mr. BYRD. This is not Constitution-like language, to start with. 
Has the Senator heard any proponent of this amendment come to the Senate floor and explain to the Senate and to the people watching and listening to the debate through the electronic eye, has the Senator heard any proponent come to the floor and, section by section by section, explain this amendment, how each section would work, why each section is there, what each section means? 
I have heard quite a number of Senators come to the floor and talk about the need for balancing the budget. I think we are all in agreement on that and I think there is a consensus here as to a need for balancing the budget at some point, bringing down the deficits, but I have not heard a single Senator--and I have not been able to listen to all of the debate; I tried to listen to as much as possible, but the Senator has heard most of the debate--has the Senator heard any proponent of this amendment come fully explain this amendment, talk about the amendment? Not about the need for balancing the budget, not about the need for getting the deficits down, about which we all agree. I would be greatly enlightened if a Senator would take the time not to talk about something we all agree on, but to talk about how this amendment will balance the budget, how it will eliminate the deficits. Has the Senator heard any proponent do that thus far?

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I strongly support S. 122, the Stop Tax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act--let me say that again--the Stop Tax-Exempt Arena Debt Insurance Act--a measure that has been introduced by Senator Moynihan. This bill would amend title I, section 141, of the Internal Revenue Code by closing a tax loophole that has been beneficial to a select few individuals: owners of professional sports teams. For the average taxpayer, however, it is nothing more than professional sports welfare. 
Provisions of the 1986 Tax Reform Act were supposed to prevent professional sports teams from building sports facilities with tax-exempt bonds. Under the law, professional sports teams are categorized as a private entity, and, as such, the issuing of private activity bonds is taxed. However, due to clever maneuvering, professional sports teams have circumvented the intent of the law by encouraging State governments to issue governmental bonds, which are exempted from Federal taxes, for the purpose of constructing large sports facilities. While such a tactic is technically legal, professional sports teams owners have manipulated the law for their own personal gain. 
Many large metropolitan areas have attempted to lure professional sports teams to relocate by offering generous incentive packages, including the construction of new stadia. Many of the proposed facilities cost in excess of $225 million. The Congressional Research Service has reported that the Federal share for a $225 million stadium could be as high as 34 percent. In plain monetary figures, that is $75 million over the lifetime of the stadium--$75 million that might better be spent and more usefully spent on benefits for the Nation, like books for our schools, safer roads and bridges for commuters, and more police to keep our streets safer. Madam President, the list is endless. Instead, the Federal Government receives no tax revenue, and money that could have been spent on these other, more deserving programs, is wasted, in my opinion. 
I commend my colleague, Senator Moynihan, for offering S. 122. I agree with his desire to close this tax loophole that is mainly beneficial to a few select and wealthy individuals. In this time of fiscal austerity, the Federal Government cannot afford to subsidize such programs. S. 122 seeks to preserve the intentions of the 1986 Tax Reform Act by ensuring that professional sports teams do not use--directly, or indirectly--Federal funds for the construction of their sports facilities. I have nothing in particular against sports or sports teams. 
I just think America has its values standing on their heads when it puts sports ahead of the development of the minds, the intellects of young people. But that is a discussion for another day. Professional sports in the United States is a lucrative and financially healthy private industry. It does not need this kind of public Federal subsidy while so many other pressing needs are feeling the slash of the budget-cutter's pencil.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the emerging relationship between the United States and China is one of immense opportunity for both nations, and deserves the steady attention of the highest levels of both governments. Both nations need to make every effort to broaden the area of common ground in our dealings and understandings, and to engage in an open and honest dialogue on those issues, such as weapons proliferation and human rights matters, on which we have serious differences. There is a rising tide of commentary on our bilateral relationship, and it is not particularly easy to arrive at the kind of balanced approach which is both clear-eyed regarding present realities, and at the same time visionary on future prospects. One of the most thoughtful recent attempts to paint the salient highlights of this complicated picture was made last week by the recently retired Senator from the State of Georgia, Sam Nunn. 
On the occasion of his selection as the 1997 recipient of the Paul Nitze Award for Distinguished Public Service, Mr. Nunn described the current state of consensus in the United States on U.S.-China policy as `very, very fragile.' If that consensus were to break down, and the relationship with China were to turn sour, a historic opportunity of profound importance could be lost. Both sides need to work hard to avoid that possibility. 
The consensus within the United States that Senator Nunn describes includes the healthy notion that our support for the modernization of China's legal and banking and judicial, civil service and other institutions will pay long-range dividends for our overall relationship, and for progress in China, but that modernization will not emerge magically. Sustained efforts at cooperation in both public- and private-sector activities must be ongoing. 
In his remarks, Senator Nunn rightly flags the importance of the circumstances accompanying the turnover of Hong Kong to China on July 1 of this year. How well China adheres to the commitment that she has made to the people of Hong Kong to preserve Hong Kong's distinct social, political and economic identity for the next 50 years will be vital. Senator Nunn states that China's `credibility is on the line,' in that China has given its word, and extended a solemn promise. A very disquieting note has just been raised by the annual report by the State Department on human rights performance around the world according to the New York Times. The report says, `Hong Kong's civil liberties and political institutions were threatened by restrictive measures taken by the Chinese government in anticipation of Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty' in July. If China does not honor its obligations to Hong Kong, her relationship with the world, as Senator Nunn points out, will be `dealt a severe blow.' Keeping her word will be a key indicator of China's general willingness to adhere to the terms of other international obligations that the United States might support, such as membership in the World Trade Organization. Hong Kong will, in July, become an integral part of China and it will take some dexterity and work on the part of the Chinese government to fulfill its promise to honor Hong Kong's unique institutions. In this, as in many other aspects of our growing relationship, patience, calmness, understanding and open dialogue will be important keys to success. The United States would be mistaken to judge too quickly or to criticize too easily. We should be cognizant that the more our interrelationships develop across the board, the more likely it will be that the warm breezes of open democracy will have its effects on Chinese society. 
It will take a special effort on both sides to continue to propel our relationship along constructive channels, and to do so will require sustained effort, frequent interchanges and constant communication. 
I commend Senator Nunn for his contribution to this dialogue on our China policy and recommend a reading of his address to my colleagues. I hope that his remarks will receive wide distribution.

Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I compliment the Presiding Officer, Senator Susan Collins, who presides over this body at this moment with a degree of dignity and skill and efficiency that is so rare as a day in June. 
I strongly support the nomination of Senator Bill Cohen to be our next Secretary of Defense. He is highly qualified for this important position from the perspective of the long, creative, and intense years he has studied and put into effect his ideas regarding a strong defense from the position of his membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
I have worked with Senator Cohen on many issues of war and peace, of foreign policy, national security actions and have always found him to be knowledgeable, thoughtful, with excellent insight and a distinct lack of partisanship, and always with an unusual dose of excellent judgment and innovation. 
He has always attempted to build consensus across the aisle on vital defense matters, and I have had this experience in working with him when I served as the Democratic leader and in the context of our membership together on the Armed Services Committee. 
I commend President Clinton for submitting this outstanding--truly outstanding--nomination. I suggest that the nomination reflects highly on both the Senator and the President. It highlights the need for bipartisan national security decisionmaking, and I feel that it will be constructive in taking politics out of defense budgeting and defense policy. 
It is an act of political courage on the part of the President, and it is matched by the independence of judgment and courage on the part of Bill Cohen over the years. Senator Cohen has demonstrated an ability to think a problem through carefully and clearly and reach consistently wise and independent judgments. 
In this regard, I commend his comment in the committee's confirmation hearing today that there should be an end to our Bosnia deployment within the near term and that our European allies need to finally step up to the plate and assume whatever further military peace-enforcing responsibilities remain at the end of that period. 
I know that Senator Cohen is a strong advocate of regular substantive consultations between the administration and the Congress on critical defense matters, and in particular on the question of the deployment of American Armed Forces into harm's way. I know that he urged President Bush to come to Congress on the matter of deploying our forces to Saudi Arabia in preparation to remove Iraq's forces from Kuwait. He has indicated that it is not sufficient for an administration to go only to the United Nations for such approval, and he supports his argument with both constitutional and practical reasons. 
It is far sounder to deploy forces when an adversary knows that a national decision in the United States has been taken which has been validated by the people's representatives. America's credibility is stronger under such circumstances, and we are more likely to sustain a difficult operation and to prevail. 
The nomination of Bill Cohen for Secretary of Defense is an unusually good one. I look forward to working closely with Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen on the very weighty and diverse responsibilities that come with that high and critical office. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a critically important measure to ensure that sufficient funds will be made available over the next six years to complete the Appalachian Development Highway System by the year 2003, some 38 years after the initial authorization of this vital 3,025-mile highway network. 
As Senators are aware, the funding authorizations for the Federal-Aid Highway program will expire at the end of fiscal year 1997. Consequently, one of the most important pieces of legislation we will take up during this congressional session will be the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. This legislation will provide new direction for our Federal highway and transit programs for the next six years. I commend the Majority Leader for recognizing the importance of this legislation in his remarks on the Senate Floor during the first day of this session, during which he cited his hope that we might turn to it prior to the Easter recess. 
Our colleagues in the other body have already completed several hearings on the reauthorization of ISTEA, and I understand that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will begin its hearings shortly. As we approach the drafting of a new, comprehensive, Federal-aid highway bill, I am introducing this bill today so that my colleagues have available to them my proposal to ensure that the Federal government finally completes its commitment to the Appalachian Development Highway System in all affected thirteen states. 
The necessity to expand highway access to spur the development of the Appalachian region was first cited by the President's Appalachian Regional Commission of 1964. The Commission's report stated: `Developmental activities in Appalachia cannot proceed until the regional isolation has been overcome by a transportation network which provides access to and from the rest of the nation and within the region itself. The remoteness and isolation of the region . . . are the very basis of the Appalachian lag. Its penetration by an adequate transportation network is the first requisite of its full participation in industrial America.' 
One year later, the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 authorized several programs for the development of the region, the first of which called for the construction of a new highway network. According to the Act, these highways `will open up an area or areas with a developmental potential where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access.' Subsequent amendments to the act defined the 3,025 miles that comprise the Appalachian Development Highway System. 
Unfortunately, today, we find that while the Interstate Highway System is virtually 100 percent complete, the Appalachian Development Highway System is only 76 percent complete. Of the 3,025 miles that comprise the Appalachian system, roughly 725 miles remain unfinished. These unfinished miles are spread throughout the 13 states that have counties within the statutorily designated boundaries of Appalachia. These states include Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
Mr. President, the purpose of my legislation is to ensure that we expeditiously complete this vital highway network. Its completion is even more important today than it was 30 years ago, not only for the local economies of the Appalachian region but also for the entire nation. The citizens of Appalachia are required to drive through the existing, inadequate road system--dangerous, narrow roads which generally wind through the paths of river valleys and stream beds between mountains. These roads are, more often than not, two-lane roads that are squeezed into very limited rights-of-way. They are characterized by low travel speeds and long travel distances. They were often built to inadequate design standards and, thus, present very hazardous driving conditions. 
Just last year, the Federal Highway Administration published a report indicating that substandard road conditions are a factor in 30 percent of all fatal highway accidents. I am quite sure that the percentage is a great deal higher in the Appalachian region. [In my own state, the inadequate two-lane road that currently lies along the alignment of our largest uncompleted segment of the ADHS represents the second most dangerous road in the entire state.] The Federal Highway Administration has found that upgrading two-lane roads to four-lane divided highways has served to decrease fatal traffic accidents by 71 percent and that widening traffic lanes has served to reduce fatalities by 21 percent. These are precisely the kinds of road improvements that will be funded through the legislation which I am introducing today. And until this legislation is enacted, many citizens will die unnecessarily on inadequate, unsafe roads. 
While several of the thirteen Appalachian states have enjoyed significant economic expansion and job growth over the last three decades, each such state continues to have pockets of severe economic distress characterized by low academic achievement, chronic unemployment, and an inadequate tax base. There are still children in Appalachia who lack decent transportation routes to school. There are still pregnant mothers, elderly citizens, and others who lack timely road access to area hospitals. There are many people who cannot obtain sustainable well-paying jobs because of poor road access to major employment centers. These critical conditions affect not only the citizens 
of these local communities but also the economy of the entire nation. Instead of enjoying the full productive potential of all the citizens of Appalachia, our nation must bear the costs of Federal assistance that must be provided to those who cannot adequately care for themselves through no fault of their own--costs associated with unemployment benefits, health care, school lunch programs, etc. 
The Appalachian Regional Commission has conducted a number of studies and surveys which confirm the linkage between economic prosperity and the completion of segments of the Appalachian Highway System. These same studies also highlight the fact that it is almost impossible for communities still awaiting completion of their segments of these highways to attract businesses and investment opportunities to their areas, largely due to an inadequate transportation system, inhibiting their access to the national markets. 
The most rigorous of these studies was financed by the National Science Foundation and published just a year and a half ago. This study covered a twenty-year period and compared conditions in Appalachian counties versus similarly-situated counties outside the Appalachian region. When looking at conditions in the sixty-two rural Appalachian counties, the study revealed that the income levels of those counties with substantially complete Appalachian Development highways grew 80 percent faster and that earnings grew 62 percent faster than did the counties without such highway access. 
Mr. President, the people of Appalachia have waited long enough for the Federal Government to fulfill its commitment to the Appalachian region. The bill I am introducing today will ensure that sufficient funds are set aside in the next major highway bill to complete the remaining 24 percent of the Appalachian Development Highway System in the thirteen-state region. This bill takes a different approach from that of the prior authorization acts for the Appalachian Highway System. The bill calls for direct contract authority to be made available from the highway trust fund. This contract authority would be distributed to the thirteen states of the Appalachian Region solely for the purpose of completing the 725 unfinished miles of the Appalachian Development Highway System. 
One of the primary reasons why completion of the Appalachian Highway System has lagged behind that of the Interstate Highway System is because the interstate system has benefited from the direct availability of highway trust funds while the Appalachian Development Highway System has been required to be financed largely through incremental annual appropriations of general funds. 
The bill I introduce today also makes clear that funds provided to the Appalachian states for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway system will be provided in addition to the funds those states will receive from the Federal Aid Highway Program for their customary purposes. These states should not be required to choose between the maintenance of their interstate and other federal highways and the completion of the Appalachian system. 
Under this bill, states will still be required to provide the standard 20 percent matching share for Federal funds for the completion of these roads, as is the case for all major Federal aid highway programs. The bill authorizes the Secretary to distribute `such sums as are necessary' for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System. Similar to the manner in which Federal funds are currently administered for Appalachian highways, the funds provided under this bill will be administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The ARC, with the cooperation of the Federal Highway Administration, is currently updating its estimate for the cost to complete the system. This study is expected to be completed by May 1 of this year, and I anticipate that, when this bill is incorporated into this year's highway legislation, it will identify and authorize the appropriate dollar figure that results from this ongoing study. 
I should point out, Mr. President, that the Administration shares my goal for the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System in the near term. In addition to having written to President Clinton several times in support of this legislative approach, I met with him personally in the Oval Office on December 16, 1996--last year. I have also had meetings on this subject with his OMB Director, Mr. Franklin Raines, and his Federal Highway Administrator and Transportation Secretary-designate, Mr. Rodney Slater. I am confident that the Administration will be supportive of my efforts to complete the construction of the ADHS as soon as possible. 
So, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation. Our entire nation has benefited from the improvements brought about by the Appalachian Development Highway System. So, too, will we all benefit from its completion in the near future.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Madeleine Albright for Secretary of State. Ms. Albright brings a lifetime of credentials to the job. She has superb experience as a practitioner of the craft of diplomacy, and a wide knowledge of outside opinion on the range of options and potential solutions that confront us in given international situations. More than that, and most appropriate for the rather free-wheeling, often confusing international environment that we currently face, she is an initiator and an exponent of an energetic and forward-looking American leadership in world affairs. 
Ms. Albright acquitted herself admirably as our most recent Ambassador to the United Nations. She is, I believe, sensitive to the role of Congress in formulating foreign policies, certainly partly because she has served as a foreign policy staffer in the Senate to the late Senator Ed Muskie of Maine. She has served in various posts in previous administrations, and stayed active on the faculty of Georgetown University while the other party controlled the White House and foreign policy making apparatus. 
At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright, as a matter of practice and of principle, put American interests first, as she should have, but also introduced overdue cost analysis as a requirement in the development of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the commitment of United Nations contingents abroad. She made the American weight felt in the Security Council, not the least in her successful effort to bring a new Secretary General to power in New York. 
There were, in the early years of the first administration of President Clinton, some growing pains in sorting out the role of the United States in the disorder that we confronted in the aftermath of the cold war, particularly as it related to the proper approach for both the United Nations and the United States in peacekeeping and so-called peace enforcing operations. We all learned some lessons from the experience of our involvement in Somalia, and the administration learned some lessons, as well. Ambassador Albright moved forcefully to resolve those lessons and established a laudable and workable mechanism for frequent consultation between her staff in New York, the State Department here in Washington, and the interested Senators and committees here in the Congress. I think that she believes, as I do, that early and substantive consultations between the administration and the Congress are essential for the successful conduct of American foreign affairs, and I fully expect the early development of an effective working relationship in that regard after she is confirmed by the Senate. 
I congratulate Ms. Albright for her selection as the first female nominee to be an American Secretary of State, and I look forward to working with her during her tenure at the helm of the Department of State and its far-flung operations around the globe. 
I shall cast my vote for Madeleine Albright this afternoon, and I shall do it with enthusiasm and with faith in her ability to perform the job and to perform it well. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader. 
For the record, and without being critical of anyone, I am sure that we have followed late precedent in notifying the House and notifying the President after the President pro tempore is elected. 
When the Senate first met on April 6th, 1789, after having been delayed 34 days for the lack of a quorum, the first order of business was the election of a President pro tempore, who is a constitutional officer. The Senate is required to elect a Member of the body to serve as the President pro tempore in the absence of the Vice President. 
When the Senate met on April 6th, 1789 there was no Vice President. There was no President. And once the President pro tempore was elected--his name was John Langdon from New Hampshire--the Senate then notified the House that it was organized and ready to count the electoral ballots. 
So the selection of the President pro tempore was first because the Senate had to have a Presiding Officer. And there was no Vice President. There was no Vice President until April 21st of 1789 when the Vice President, John Adams, took the oath of office. 
So I say this because sometimes we vary from precedent without thinking about it. And it escaped my notice that this was done, I think, in the last Congress when the President pro tempore was elected. 
But in any event, for the record, I hope that in the future we will follow the practice of the Members of the Senate of 1789, when a President pro tempore is to be elected. 
In the old days they elected a President pro tempore perhaps for the occasion, or one for a single day. But the practice now is that we elect a President pro tempore, who serves until another is elected--he retires, or passes on to another world, or his party loses control and a new President pro tempore is elected, or until his own term as Senator expires and he is reelected, as was the case today. 
I thank all Senators for their indulgence. And especially I thank our two fine leaders. I am also very favorably impressed with both leaders. I know that they are going to do the Senate proud and do all of us proud.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, have the unanimous consent requests been agreed to, en bloc?

<TEXT>
Mr. BYRD. I had hoped to be recognized before they were agreed to. But I take the floor now just to inquire of the Chair and to inquire of both leaders, during the leader time each day. 
are we talking about 10 minutes for speeches only? I do not think there has been any controversial motion ever made during the 10 minutes of either leader's time, and I think, for the Record, we ought to clarify this, that the 10 minutes are to be used for speeches or for unanimous consent requests but that no motion will be in order during those 10 minutes for either leader. 
I say this because it seems to me--and I have not seen it happen, but I think it could happen--during the 10 minutes if there were a very controversial motion and a Senator or group of Senators were attempting to hold the floor and not let that motion be made, their leader could come in and claim his time, which he has a right to do, and during the 10 minutes I am concerned that he might make a controversial motion. This might never happen, and there might be other ways--I am sure there would be--to challenge that, but just in order that we do not have to worry about it, I wonder if it is agreed that during the 10 minutes no controversial motion will be made. 
What is controversial? I should think we ought to know when either leader seeks to make a motion. If the motion is likely to be controversial, I hope that it would not be made during that period of 10 minutes.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators. I am fully satisfied with the colloquies that have resulted from my inquiry. 
May I say to the distinguished majority leader that I do not believe we had the 10 minutes for each leader back when I was the majority leader the first time in 1977. I think this practice grew up in that period or soon thereafter. But in any event, as I thought I said earlier, I have never known--I cannot remember a time in which such a provocative situation might arise. I have never known that to happen. I have never known any majority leader or minority leader to transgress upon the confidence of the membership in giving its acquiescence to the request. It is just that I thought there could be such a situation. I thought we ought to try to clarify it and thus prevent some future misunderstanding. I am satisfied with what has been said. 
While I have the floor, so that I will not impose upon the leaders too much, there was a second request made, and it was agreed to, and I just rise at this time to compliment the leaders on making this unanimous consent request and also on the progress that is being made and being discussed to which the majority leader has just referred, anent disorder in the Chamber. 
In recent years, we have allowed too much gathering of staffs and too many conversations to go on in the rear of the Chamber, and it does not do the Senate credit. I can remember when we had no benches; we even had no seats in the rear of the Chamber. The staff stood when they came to the floor. They stood or sat on the floor of the Chamber, which I did not like. And it was for that reason that I had, when I was majority whip, chairs brought into the Chamber and a large davenport so staffs would at least have a place to sit. 
And then, later, I had the gallery--this gallery here to the northeast, I guess it is--assigned to staff. Then I had these handsome benches and the bannister put back here so the staffs could be appropriately accommodated. I am glad that the request includes the words, `and that the Sergeant at Arms be instructed to rotate such staff members as space allows.' I want to thank the leaders for including that language. 
I especially want to take the floor here so that the Sergeant at Arms and all Senators--the leaders need our cooperation as well--so that the Sergeant at Arms and all Senators will be well aware that when more staff members are in the Chamber than the seating accommodations will allow, then there is a special gallery for staffs, and I would hope that the Sergeant at Arms would help us to keep the number of staff people in the Chamber down. I assure both leaders they will have my cooperation. I try, as I see that there are too many staff people--and I have two or three staff persons--I try to send mine out so as to leave only one. I am very much heartened by the letters that I have received from both leaders in response to concerns such as this, that I have expressed. 
I foresee that we Senators are going to be even more proud of our leaders in the future than perhaps we have been at some times in the past. I see not only a willingness but a desire on the part of both leaders to have Members speak to them about matters that concern us. As I have noted, I followed through on that, and that has not been the end of it. Both leaders have written to me to let me know that they are aware of a matter and that they are working on it. I thank both, and I think it is to the credit of the two leaders, and certainly will redound to the credit of the Senate, if we can have better order in the coming days. 
I thank both leaders.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Plato thanked the gods for having been born a man, and he thanked them for the good fortune of having been born a Greek. He thanked them for having permitted him to live in the age of Sophocles. 
Mr. President, I am very thankful for many things. I am thankful for the respect of my colleagues. My colleagues upon more than one occasion--undoubtedly many of them--have been angered by things that I have said. I am sure they have been frustrated with me from time to time over the many years. But they have always been forgiving, understanding, and most considerate. And I thank them. I thank, of course, the Supreme Governor of the World for having let me live to serve for 50 years the people of West Virginia. 
The psalmist tells us, `the days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.' I thank God for his mercy and his kindness and his love, for having let me live to serve the people of West Virginia 50 years. 
I thank the people of West Virginia for having demonstrated the faith and confidence in me to reelect me these many times over a period of a half century. 
Queen Mary I of England lost the port of Calais to the French. Mary served from 1553 to 1558. She said, `When I am dead and opened, you will find `Calais' written on my heart.' I say to the people of West Virginia, `West Virginia' will always be indelibly engraved with blood upon my heart until it returns to the dust. 
I must thank a very understanding and forgiving and considerate woman--my wife Erma--who has served with me these 50 years. I think that our spouses sacrifice beyond what people generally know when we serve in this body. Come next May 29, we will have been married 60 years. I had to have a forgiving and understanding and cooperative wife who was as dedicated to the people of West Virginia as I, to have done it. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me thank my staff. I have always been blessed with a good staff. I was once told by the chief chaplain of General Patch's army in World War II that a true mark of genius is to be able to surround oneself with able, committed people. I have had that kind of staff over these many years, a staff that likewise has overlooked my foibles, idiosyncrasies, and has been cooperative and kind and has helped me when I had to walk through the valley of despair--at my grandson's death. They, too, have served the people of West Virginia and the people of the Nation. 
I apologize to the leaders for imposing on their valuable time. I know how it works. They have other things to do, other demands are made upon them and other business is there to take care of, other errands to run, and other services to perform, but always there is some straggling Senator who comes to the floor who wants to take some time and talk. But I thank them, and I hope that over the years, whatever disappointments I bring upon them, I can have the opportunity to make amends and to support them in the good work that they do. 
And so I thank all today for the privilege and the honor that have been bestowed upon me by the Senators on both sides of the aisle. I have also been very fortunate in having had two good colleagues in these 38 years. I had Senator Randolph to begin with and now I have Senator Rockefeller, who is a very fine colleague. I could not ask for a better colleague than either of them. Senator Rockefeller has been especially supportive and deferential and kind to me. And so I have many things, Mr. President, for which to be grateful. 
Harry Reid has impressed me in the years he has been in the Senate. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, many times I have asked him to chair subcommittee hearings when I could not be there to do so, and he has always done an excellent job. 
He, too, is a Senate man. He is dedicated to the institution. I have had many conversations with him. I feel highly privileged to have him as my friend. 
Tennyson said, `I am a part of all that I have met.' How rich I am in that I am a part of Harry Reid and Jay Rockefeller and Tom Daschle and Trent Lott. 
I thank both leaders again for their consideration in giving me this time. I yield the floor.

Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished majority leader on the speech that he has made outlining what he hopes to achieve in a general way, without going into specifics, in the months and weeks and days ahead. 
May I say, as one who has been majority leader, who has been minority leader, who has been President pro tempore, who has been a chairman of a committee, who has been a Senator like all 100 Senators, that I am particularly encouraged by these two leaders that we now have in the Senate. 
I think that with respect to the minority leader, no one could be more considerate of his colleagues, more thoughtful, more eager to reach out and to bring them in to hear what they have to say, to work with them. No one is more eager to work with the majority leader than our current minority leader. 
And may I say with respect to our current majority leader, I think we have a leader who is interested in the Senate, who is interested in putting the Senate where it ought to be--first--and who is interested in improving the decorum in the Senate so that the people who view this Senate, through that all-seeing electronic eye, will see a truly premier upper House. 
We have students, we have professors, we have young people in high school, we have lawyers, State legislators, and people in all walks of life watching the Senate daily when it is in session, and they expect to see the best. 
I have been a member of the State legislature in West Virginia, in both houses, but even in the State legislatures--and they are closest to the people--even there they will look to the U.S. Senate and to the other body across the way for inspiration. 
It saddens me to see a Presiding Officer in this Senate reading magazines or a newspaper or books when he is supposed to be presiding. Millions of people are watching, as well as visitors in the galleries, and I wonder if they go away thinking the Presiding Officer doesn't have much interest in the body if he is not listening to what is being said. He should be aware and alert to what is going on and ready to protect the rights of every Senator while debate is under way. 
I think we have a majority leader now and a minority leader who are going to bring these things to the attention of the Members. We, all 100 of us, owe these leaders our very best support when they are trying to do the right thing: Trying to make the Senate what the framers intended it to be. 
I really am encouraged, because I think that Senator Lott is a man in that mold. He is bright, he has an endearing personality, he has an art of persuasiveness that will win many battles. He is considerate, he is patient, and a leader has to have all of these attributes. I thank him for all of these things.
