Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1733, as amended, a bill to combat fraud and waste in the food stamp program. This bill will do two things. First, it will require food stamp offices to match food stamp files with Social Security data to identify overpayments to deceased food stamp participants. Second, it will require the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explore data on the development of a national database to identify overpayments resulting from individuals receiving benefits in two or more states at the same time and implement other program interstate requirements. 
This bill is the result of the last two General Accounting Office studies that I requested dealing with groups of ineligible people receiving food stamps. In the first report, the GAO reported that 26,000 deceased individuals in four states were counted as members of a food stamp household. According to the GAO, this resulted in overpayments of an estimated $8.6 million. In the second report, the GAO identified over 20,000 individuals who received benefits in at least two states at the same time during 1996. Using administrative records from four states (California, Texas, New York, and Florida), the GAO estimates overpayments of $3.9 million in those states alone. 
Last year the GAO reported to the Agriculture Committee that over $3 million in food stamp benefits were overpaid to prisoners' households. In response, we passed legislation to stop prisoners from receiving benefits. 
My bill will require state food stamp agencies to use the Social Security Administration's Death Master file to verify that no deceased individuals are counted as members of food stamp households, either increasing a households' benefits or allowing an individual to illegally receive benefits in the deceased person's name. To give SAA enough time to iron out Year 2000 problems, this provision will not be effective until June 1, 2000. 
Current law requires that households notify their local welfare office of any changes in the makeup of the household within ten days. The GAO report showed that the deceased individuals were counted in food stamp households for an average of four months; and, in a few instances, the deceased individuals were counted as beneficiaries for the full two years the review was counted. This is unacceptable, particularly since this type of fraud can easily be prevented. 
 Mr. President, one federal agency has the information to prevent this fraud and abuse, but is not sharing it with other agencies issuing federal benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a Death Master File that compiles death information available in the federal government. According to the GAO, a match using SSA's Death Master File information could be a cost-effective method for identifying such individuals in food stamp households and eliminating these overpayments. States already relay on the SSA to verify the social security numbers of food stamp applicants. Therefore, a system already exists in one branch of the federal government that, with some modifications, could stop these overpayments. 
My bill will also require the United States Department of Agriculture to conduct a study to identify options for a national database to track food stamp participants and combat interstate fraud. The GAO's report validates a Department of Health and Human Services computer match of 15 states which found 18,000 potential duplicated Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cases. At present there is no appropriate national database that tracks in means-tested benefit programs. States have been working individually on the problem of benefits paid in multiple jurisdictions. For example, some states have developed cooperative agreements with neighboring states to share data. Current state efforts are effective, but anything short of a national system is inefficient. 
 Mr. President, the welfare reform bill required states to guard against fraud and abuse, and specifically prohibited participants from receiving benefits in two states. However, the bill did not give states tools to combat this type of fraud. HHS has already fulfilled a congressional mandate to look into some of these issues, so I expect the USDA to use the completed HHS report to Congress as a base upon which to build. 
Further, I believe that the study should explore the possibility of a `real time' database, so that eligibility workers will instantly know if there are any problems with an application. This will avoid the `pay-and-chase' problem that forces states to recoup overpayments from beneficiaries after the fact--sometimes years later. This method of fraud enforcement is inefficient, and often a burden on the recipient as well. A national database should not be seen as purely an enforcement tool. There are many cross program benefits for the poor, benefits which may not be apparent today. As with any large governmental database, the study should address how the system will safeguard recipients' privacy and limit unauthorized use and disclosure of data. 
Means-tested benefits, including food stamps, provide a safety net for millions of people. We cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine the food stamp program and welfare reform. Integrity is essential to ensure a program that can serve those in need. It is our responsibility to help end fraud and abuse in all federally funded programs. This legislation is an important step in that direction and will help ensure that welfare reform is a success. 
 Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Harkin and me in supporting this bill.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 2116, the USDA Information Technology Reform and Year-200 Compliance Act of 1998. This legislation aims to centralize all year 2000 computer conversion and other information technology acquisition and management activities within the Office of the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Agriculture. Centralization is the most efficient way to manage the complex task of ensuring that all critical computer functions at the department are operational on January 1, 2000. It is also a wiser and more effective way to construct an information technology infrastructure to enable USDA's hundreds of computer systems to interoperate, which unfortunately they cannot now do. 
The Department of Agriculture is charged with enormous responsibilities and its year 2000 readiness is crucial. It has a diverse portfolio of over 200 Federal programs throughout the Nation and the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs. It is the fourth largest Federal agency, with approximately 30 agencies and offices. The department is responsible for the safety of our food supply, nutrition programs that serve the poor, young and old, and the protection of our natural resources. Since 40 percent of the non-tax debt owed to the Federal Government is owed to USDA, the department has a responsibility to ensure the financial soundness of taxpayers' investments. 
The centralized approach to the year 2000 issue at USDA led to a lack of focus on departmental priorities. This approach resulted in a lack of guidance, oversight and the development of contingency plans. Responsibility for keeping the mission-critical information technology functioning should clearly rest with the Chief Information Officer. I am pleased that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has pledged his personal commitment to the success of year 2000 compliance and has made it one of the highest priorities for USDA. 
The General Accounting Office has long chronicled USDA's history of problems in managing its information technology investments. In August 1993, USDA received authority to spend up to $2.6 billion on a project called Info Share. The goal of Info Share was to improve operations and delivery of services by reengineering business processes and developing integrated information systems. In August 1994, GAO warned that the acquisition of information technology without business process reenginering would be problematic. Ineffective planning and management resulted in USDA's wasting $100 million on Info Share before it was ultimately disbanded. 
An August 1998 GAO report warned that USDA's ongoing effort to modernize information technology at its field service centers, faces significant risks. The department could spend more than $3 billion on the project by 2011. The report revealed that USDA has not completed a comprehensive plan for the modernization and lacks the project management structure needed to manage a project of this magnitude. Specifically, USDA has not assigned a senior-level official with overall responsibility, authority and accountability for managing and coordinating the project to ensure it is completed on time and within budget. 
In March of this year before a House agriculture subcommittee and again in May before the Senate Agriculture Committee, GAO testified in support of strong Chief Information Officer leadership at USDA. The Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, the Clinger-Cohen Act, seeks to strengthen executive leadership in information management and institute sound capital investment decision-making to maximize the return on information systems. Consistent with provisions of that act, more accountability and responsibility and responsibility over the substantial investments the department makes in information technology were recommended by the GAO. The GAO also noted major weaknesses in USDA's component agency efforts and testified that mitigating the risk of year 2000 disruptions requires leadership. 
Last year, I introduced S. 805, a bill to reform the information technology systems of the Department of Agriculture. It gave the Chief Information Officer control over the planning, development and acquisition of information technology at the department. Introduction of that bill prompted some coordination of information technology among the department's agencies and offices. This revised legislation, which includes input from the administration, is now needed to strengthen that coordination and ensure that centralized information technology management continues in the future. 
This legislation requires that the Chief Information Officer manage the design and implementation of an information technology architecture based on strategic business plans to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of USDA's program activities. Included in the bill is authority for the Chief Information Officer to approve expenditures over $200,000 for information resources and for year 2000 compliance purposes, except for minor acquisitions. To accomplish these purposes, the bill requires the secretary to transfer up to 10 percent of each agency's information technology budget to the Chief Information Officer's control. 
The bill makes the Chief Information Officer responsible for ensuring that the information technology architecture facilitates a flexible common computing environment for the field service centers based on integrated program delivery and provides maximum data sharing with USDA customers and other federal and state agencies, which is expected to result in significant reductions in operating costs. 
The bill requires the Chief Information Officer to address the year 2000 computing crisis throughout USDA agencies, between USDA and other Federal, State, and local agencies and between USDA and private and international partners. 
Mr. President, this is a bill whose time has come. Unfortunately, USDA's problems in managing information technology are not unusual among government agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. I commend the attention of my colleagues to this bill designed to address a portion of the information resource management problems of the Federal Government and ask for their support of it.

Mr. LUGAR. At no point during deliberations with the Department of Agriculture was it ever envisioned the transfer of information technology funds would cause reductions in force or furloughs. In fact, great care was taken early in the process to exclude salaries and expenses and intergovernmental payments from the calculations used to determine the amount necessary to adequately fund the development of an information technology architecture. This legislation does not authorize reductions in force or furloughs. The information technology architecture includes telecommunications, service center implementation, and site licenses for computer software and hardware. As introduced, the bill required a transfer of 5 percent of the information technology funds from each office and agency to the Chief Information Officer. Five percent of those funds represented approximately $40 million. Further negotiations with the department resulted in a revision in the bill that permits the Secretary to transfer up to 10 percent of the information technology funds. This amendment gives the Secretary the flexibility he requested to adjust transfers commensurate with the information technology architecture needs of each office and agency. This transfer authority terminates on September 30, 2003. I hope this addresses the Senator's concerns.

Mr. LUGAR. As I noted in my earlier remarks, that is my intention. It is my hope that the Secretary will avoid such actions. If, however, the Secretary considers a reduction-in-force or furloughs, I expect that he will first consult the committee before going forward with such actions.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity before the 105th Congress adjourns to honor our distinguished colleague and my friend, Dan Coats, who will be returning to private life at the end of this Congress. 
For the past 10 years it has been my privilege to join with Senator Coats in serving the people of Indiana. During that time, he has epitomized strong character and devotion to public service. 
Senator Coats has been a determined advocate for his point of view, but also a good listener who has often forged compromises that benefited our Nation. He has been a work horse able to shoulder the daily burdens of a thousand details, but also a thoughtful observer who sees beyond the politics of the moment to provide perspective on the direction of our country. And he has been an effective defender of the interests of Indiana, while always upholding his national responsibilities. 
Dan Coats has applied his expertise and commitment to many of the most critical areas of public policy. He has become one of our foremost advocates for protecting America's children and strengthening American families. His knowledge of military issues and his leadership on the Armed Forces Committee will be difficult to replace. 
Of particular note is his Project for American Renewal, because it speaks to both Dan's personal convictions and his legislative innovation. With this project--a set of 19 legislative proposals--he has succeeded in articulating a coherent philosophy of compassionate conservatism. 
Senator Coats understands that the limits of government do not limit our responsibilities to each other as citizens of a great nation. His project promotes volunteerism, charitable giving, personal responsibility, and the cohesiveness of communities. His proposal embodies both Senator Coat's insightful reading of modern American social conditions and his optimism for our future. I know that Senator Coats will continue to be an eloquent spokesman for the Project for American Renewal as he returns to private life. 
I am especially sad to see Senator Coats leave because he has been an outstanding partner. Ever since he arrived in the Senate in 1989, he and I have operated a unique joint office arrangement in Indiana designed to maximize our efforts on behalf of Hoosiers. By combining our resources, we have been able to provide better service at less expense to the citizens of Indiana. 
Many Senate colleagues over the years have been surprised when they learn that we share office space and staffs in Indiana. They understand the daunting challenges of combining the staffs of two independent-minded Senators with distinct responsibilities and committee assignments. But our Hoosier partnership has been strong and supportive, for which I am deeply appreciative. 
Senator Coats leaves the Senate after 10 years having established a legion of friendships and a legacy of achievement and integrity. The Senate will miss his expertise, his hard work, his thoughtful reflection, and his talent for innovation. I am confident that Dan will continue to serve the public in the many challenges that lie ahead of him. I wish Dan and Marcia Coats all the best as they move on to these new adventures. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will vote for the 1999 agriculture appropriations conference report. Unfortunately, several unwise provisions have been added since this bill passed the Senate. The cumulative weight of these mistaken policies does not outweigh the many good things in the bill, but is still reason for substantial concern. 
The bill is commendable in many ways. The conferees wisely rejected efforts to increase price support loan rates. Instead, they expanded disaster assistance from $500 million in the Senate bill to $2.35 billion. This aid will benefit farmers with 1998 losses as well as producers in some regions who have suffered several consecutive years of loss because of weather or disease. 
The bill also provides $1.65 billion in market loss payments to farmers. These payments provide income support without doing violence to the basic structure of the 1996 FAIR Act. In preserving the FAIR Act's `freedom to farm,' the market loss payments are clearly superior to the higher loan rates preferred by our Democratic colleagues. Raising loan rates, according to the non-partisan Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, would cause more production, higher surplus stocks and lower prices and incomes in future years. Even though higher loan rates might raise prices in the short term, they would have deleterious effects that would plague U.S. agriculture for years to come. 
Other parts of the bill deserve praise. The conferees adopted a biodiesel provision in the Senate bill which I sponsored along with other Senators. Encouraging the use of biodiesel will advance, in a small way, the neglected cause of energy self-sufficiency and renewability. The conference report will also facilitate an increase in overseas food assistance through Food for Progress. 
I also commend the conferees for adopting a regulatory standstill that will restore legal certainty to swap transactions. This standstill will allow the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to take necessary actions in a financial emergency, as well enforcement actions. It leaves regulators free to act prudently. However, the provision will ensure that the President's Working Group on Financial Markets has an opportunity to advance its current study of the appropriate regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a study I asked the working group to begin back in July. The turbulence in financial markets during recent weeks should finally convince everyone of the need to expedite this study. The standstill also allows crucial decisions about OTC derivatives to be made, as they should be, in Congress. 
Restoring legal certainty to swaps will also help to calm markets: In a volatile period, the last thing markets need to deal with is the threat of valid contracts becoming unenforceable. I commend Senator Cochran for his sponsorship of this provision, which Congressman Bob Smith and I proposed. 
Unfortunately, the conference report has a number of undesirable provisions. Most regrettably, this conference report adopts a House provision to deny funding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. It is difficult to understand why this initiative, which passed both Houses of Congress by overwhelming margins earlier this year, was neglected when many less urgent--and more parochial--research items were funded. The initiative's competitive grants and carefully chosen priorities represent the direction in which federal research funding should go. To deny funding for research that will help us feed future generations is unconscionable. 
The conference report has other flaws. It adopts new loan programs for honey and mohair which were not contained in either bill. Programs for these commodities were abolished only a few years ago. The conference report also adopts language from the House bill which will delay the reform of milk marketing orders by six months. Such a delay is doubly unfortunate since the Secretary of Agriculture is already proposing only half-measures to reform this antiquated and byzantine system. 
The report's statement of managers contains statements about the sugar program which, though not legally binding, would negate a provision of the FAIR Act if they were taken seriously by the Department of Agriculture. The managers state, in effect, that the one-cent-per-pound penalty assessed on forfeited sugar should not be considered an effective reduction in the support price of sugar, especially for purposes of determining the tariff rate quota for imports. But that was, of course, precisely the intent and effect of this provision. The logical result of a one-cent penalty is to reduce by that amount the price at which a sugar processor would be indifferent to forfeiture or a market sale. It is instructive to read comments on the floor of the House, during debate on the FAIR Act by a strong advocate of the sugar program, former Congressman E de la Garza. The former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee said that the FAIR Act's sugar section `effectively reduces the loan rate by 1 cent and ensures an increase in foreign imports.' 
The conference report also reverses one recent reform of the catastrophic crop insurance program. Not only does the conference report allow multi-million dollar operations to continue buying catastrophic coverage for as little as $60, rather than a small percentage of crop value. It also extends this provision into the future, something that is simply not appropriate in a one-year appropriation bill. Finally, funding was cut for environmental assistance that mitigates non-point source pollution--the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Like the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, EQIP is funded through mandatory accounts that are under the jurisdiction of authorizing, not appropriating, committees. 
Even after listing disappointing actions, I have chosen to highlight the positive achievements in this bill and other recent bills and enacted statutes in which Republicans have shown their ability to assist farmers in troubled times. 
Under the Republican FAIR Act, loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains for 1998 crops will total $4.2 billion. Most of this amount is not counted in the most recent Administration estimates of net farm income. This summer, Republicans led the way in passing a bill to augment farm cash flow by speeding up 1999 `freedom to farm' payments. Now, Republicans are asking the President to join in a $4 billion cash infusion into the farm economy--$2.35 billion in disaster assistance and $1.65 billion in market loss payments. 
These Republican initiatives will lift 1998 net farm income to near the 1997 level and above the average level of the 1990s. Without a doubt, many producers are under severe stress. Not every operation will survive. Like most other commodity prices, farm prices are depressed because of the shock waves sweeping through the world economy. In such trying times, Republicans have responded with practical assistance rather than ideological demagoguery. 
We should send this conference report to the President, and he should sign it promptly.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I submit a resolution calling for free and transparent presidential elections in the African country of Gabon. A similar measure was introduced in the House of Representatives, and I applaud the work of those Members of the House who are bringing attention to democratic development in this democracy. 
This resolution expresses support for the promotion of transparent elections at a crucial time in Gabon's political development. Although ostensibly a democracy since 1961, Gabon has been ruled by the same individual--Omar Bongo--since 1967. In 1968, President Bongo declared Gabon a one-party state and has since then won four consecutive presidential elections. 
A political easing in 1990 led to the strengthening of individual rights and the establishment of multi-party elections. However, there have been reports that disorganization and a lack of transparency marred President Bongo's most recent election in December 1993. According to the Freedom House Survey of the World Freedom, Bongo was declared the winner before many voters were counted and after a campaign that included extensive use of state resources and state media. Further, widespread irregularities were reported by the International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI), which served as observers during the Gabonese presidential and legislative elections in 1993. 
The electoral victory by President Bongo led to several months of civil unrest and violent repression. Some observers in Gabon believe more civil unrest will occur if the presidential elections this December are considered illegitimate. A free and fair electoral system would further democracy and stability in Gabon and set an example for other African nations. 
Mr. President, this resolution calls on the Gabonese government to take measures to help ensure credible presidential elections. The measure calls on the government to invite IFES, the NDI, the International Republican Institute (IRI), the Center for Democracy or other appropriate non-governmental organizations to aid or observe the December 1998 Gabonese presidential elections. 
The resolution also urges the United States and the international community to offer assistance for fair elections in Gabon and to encourage movement toward a stable democracy. 
Gabon is at a turning point. It enjoys a per capita income of $4,700, a high literacy rate (69 percent), and a billion dollar oil industry. The United States Senate would be aiding Gabon in the establishment of a stronger democracy that can help bring stability to a volatile region of Africa. 
I urge my colleagues to consider the benefits of free and fair elections in Gabon and to support this resolution.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Paul Drazek, a distinguished public servant, who is retiring from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Paul has served as the Special Assistant for International Affairs to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman for the past three and one-half years. Spending the past twenty-five years in international trade, both in government and the private sector, Paul has advanced agricultural trade policy and opened important and essential new markets to America's farmers and ranchers. 
Paul Drazek came by his love for agriculture naturally, with both of his grandparents running farms in upstate New York. At an early age he chose to use his intellect and energies to help one of our most export dependant industries find and expand market opportunities. To prepare him for his life's mission, Paul furthered his knowledge in agriculture by receiving a degree in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of Maryland. 
Mr. Drazek began his career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, serving fourteen years as a trade policy and marketing specialist. During that time he served four years as an agricultural negotiator for the U.S. delegation to the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and as the Agricultural Attache in our Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico. 
Prior to joining the Department of Agriculture as Special Assistant to the Secretary, Mr. Drazek served as Director of Government Relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation for ten years. He specialized in international affairs and legislative issues affecting U.S. agricultural trade. In that capacity, Mr. Drazek gained a familiarity with the political and economic sensitivities that shape farm and trade policies around the world. He also provided essential private sector input to the Uruguay Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
Paul has spent the last three years at the U.S. Department of Agriculture representing American agricultural interests overseas opening and expanding new markets for our farmers and ranchers. Making progress in international trade policy is a formidable challenge in this dynamic global economy. Paul's unwavering dedication and commitment to bringing prosperity to the world through trade and economic interdependence will pay dividends for our nation well into the future. 
Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute and say thank you to Paul Drazek, and I wish him, his wife Sue and their two sons, Keith and Greg, the best in all of their future endeavors.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, by request, to modify the overtime pay for meat inspectors who are veterinarians. Senator Harkin, the ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has joined as a cosponsor. 
This legislation was transmitted to Congress by the U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier this year. As drafted, the bill would provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to pay Food Safety and Inspection Service employees, working in plants subject to federal meat or poultry inspection, for overtime and holiday work at rates determined by the Secretary. 
Due to an anomaly in current law, meat inspectors who are veterinarians receive lower pay for overtime hours than they receive for regular hours. These veterinarians are seeking true overtime pay of 1 1/2 times their hourly rate without a cap on the rate. 
While the Federal Meat Inspection Act allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide overtime pay at rates determined by USDA, the Poultry Products Inspection Act does not provide this authority. The legislation introduced today would allow USDA to pay overtime for veterinarians at rates determined by USDA. Clearly an inequity exists for veterinarians who work overtime. 
I am pleased to introduce this legislation at the request of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues about this legislation and will seek opportunities to move this bill through the legislative process. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a copy of the transmittal letter from the Secretary of Agriculture.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2286, the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Amendments of 1998. The child nutrition programs have been critically important in helping meet the nutritional needs of our children. The bill before us, which was unanimously reported out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize and improve these successful programs. Nutrition programs in the Congress have a long history of bipartisan support and cooperation and I am pleased to report that this bill is no exception. 
As an Indianapolis school board member and the city's mayor in the 1960's and 1970's, I saw firsthand the need to provide nutritional assistance to children. Since that time, the child nutrition programs have changed in many ways. Although the programs may need some fine tuning, today's programs have been successful in ensuring that our nation's children have access to nutritious foods, providing a critical nutrition safety net. 
In 1997, approximately 89,000 schools enrolling 46 million children participated in the National School Lunch program. Although participation in the school breakfast program is not as large as that in the school lunch program, it has continued to grow. Since 1994, school breakfast participation has increased about 13 percent so that now over 70 percent of schools operating a school lunch program also operate a school breakfast program. 
The WIC program, which provides nutritious foods and other support to lower-income infants and children (up to age 5), and pregnant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women, has been successful at reducing the number of low-birth-weight babies. Its success has led to strong support over the years. In 1997, average monthly WIC participation was 7.4 million persons. In many states, the program has reached the long sought after goal of full funding. 
The bill before us makes improvements to the child nutrition programs. Recently we have seen reports on fraud and abuse in the WIC and Child and Adult Care Food Programs. S. 2286 strengthens the anti-fraud provisions in both programs. The bill requires WIC recipients to be physically present when being certified or recertified for the program. The bill also requires that recipients provide documentation of their income to prove that they are in fact eligible to participate in the program. The legislation cracks down on fraudulent vendors participating in the WIC program. Under most circumstances, WIC vendors who are convicted of trafficking will be permanently disqualified unless it can be proven that the disqualification will cause undue hardship for WIC recipients. In the Child and Adult Care Food Program, State agencies will be required to visit child care sites prior to approving participation by a provider. 
The bill also makes amendments to streamline school food service operations. Specifically, S. 2286 allows schools to operate after-school snack programs through the National School Lunch Program rather than separately through the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Without this change, those schools choosing to operate an after-school program, along with the school lunch program, would have to submit paperwork for two separate programs. Streamlining these operations will free up precious time so that school food service personnel can better serve our nation's children. The bill also improves access, for low-income children up to age 18, to the after-school snack and the summer food service programs. 
The bill creates a new universal school breakfast pilot program that will evaluate the effect of providing free breakfasts to elementary school children, regardless of income, on school performance and dietary intake. The new spending in this bill is fully offset by rounding down reimbursement rates to the nearest whole cent for meals served by schools and child care centers. 
Finally, the bill reauthorizes the child nutrition programs through fiscal year 2003. 
Mr. President, S. 2286 was unanimously reported out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on June 25, 1998. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, thus ensuring that our nation's children continue to have access to these important programs.

Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. I appreciate his sincerity, scholarship, research, and his passion, but the solution that he offers, in my judgment, is the wrong one. 
Republicans and Democrats are concerned about the financial stress in the farm sector. It is substantial. We have worked together on many initiatives aimed at strengthening the long-run health of our farm and ranch economy. There is, unfortunately, no single magic bullet that will make all of our farmers prosperous. But several constructive steps have been taken. I will explain later why raising loan rate caps would be unwise, but first it is appropriate to mention a few of the constructive steps that farm organizations have suggested would help American agriculture. 
Nearly all farm groups strongly support giving the President fast-track negotiating authority. The Senate Finance Committee has reported, in fact, a comprehensive trade bill containing a renewal of fast track. The majority leader, Senator Lott, intends that the Senate act upon that bill in this session. Our House colleagues have also pledged to act on fast-track legislation. 
Madam President, I start with that point because, very clearly, we must give the President fast-track authority. By that I mean the ability to submit to the Senate, on an up-or-down basis, a trade treaty negotiated with others, and in the case of the World Trade Organization negotiations next year, over 100 countries. If there is not the ability to deal with that legislation or that treaty on an up-or-down basis--and the normal course of the Senate would be to offer amendments--then other nations will feel free to offer amendments and the negotiations will founder. 
Madam President, I mention fast-track authority, and so do most farm groups, first because the export side of our farm business is the growth side. As a matter of fact, in recent years most Americans must realize that about a third of all we produce on our farms has been exported. That is a very large part of demand. 
The current crisis on the farm is of two origins. One is bad weather in some sections of our country and, in some cases, bad weather for several years running. As we have heard testimony from the distinguished Senators from South Dakota and North Dakota, parts of their States have reported conditions impossible for 4 years to get a crop. We have noticed very considerable drought this year in Texas, in Oklahoma, and in Georgia. And the Senate has acted appropriately. 
When the appropriations bill came before the Senate, the agriculture appropriations bill--and it was managed very adroitly by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran--$500 million of so-called indemnity payments were set aside, and that amount of money is in a conference between the House and the Senate now. The thrust of the indemnity payments was to recognize that although we are inexact in knowing exactly what damages should be assessed, there has been a great deal of pain and a formula must be worked out. That would be helpful to those farmers in those States and those regions that have had extraordinarily bad luck from the weather. 
Farming is always a situation of potential bad luck from the weather. No farm in this country is immune from those natural difficulties. That is a part of the excitement, risk, and the reward situation. Nevertheless, the Senate reacted appropriately, in my judgment, and now in conference a discussion about a half billion dollars of indemnity payments is proceeding. 
The other reason that a farm crisis has occurred is that the Malaysian economy, the Thai economy, the South Korean economy, and the Indonesian economy all went into disastrous tailspins for a variety of reasons. But whatever may have been the reasons, agricultural demand coming from our Asian customers stopped cold. Our best estimates are that about one-third of our exports to Asia, which we would have counted on this year--there is a very strong trend showing year by year gains, and as Asian citizens have had more income and have tried to upgrade their diets, they have become very good customers of farmers in this country. 
In any event, about a third of that demand is gone, and a third of all of our exports were headed to Asia. That means that roughly 10 percent of the entire demand for agricultural products in this country has vanished--vanished literally overnight. That has had a devastating impact, obviously, when demand heads into the tank at a time in which supply is huge. The supply of our corn crop, for example, is now going to be perhaps the second largest crop in the history of the country, and the soybean crop is the largest ever. Wheat farmers have already been heard from, and their pain has been felt. That registers both in the indemnity payment situation as well as a number of steps that the Senate and House have taken, including, as you will recall, an extraordinary debate on the Glenn amendment on Pakistan and India. The Glenn amendment required sanctions on both of those countries after they both tested nuclear weapons. 
But the Senate and the House voted rapidly to exempt Pakistan from that situation with regard to wheat so that an auction going on in Pakistan could continue, and, as a matter of fact, Pakistan bought, apparently, about 100 thousand metric tons bushels of wheat from the United States due to that extraordinary action. We had been conscious of the lack of demand for wheat and we are conscious of that lack of demand for corn and for soybeans. 
As the distinguished Senator from Wyoming who preceded me on the floor pointed out, American agriculture is not entirely grain. It is not entirely vegetables or fruits. It includes livestock. Of course, one of the interesting aspects of agriculture is that as we dwell upon the price of feed grains, it has the worst effect on the cost of raising cattle or raising hogs. There are many farmers who have productions that include both livestock and grain. Many do so deliberately so that they have hedges either way. 
But, in any event, in the totality of American agriculture, the important point this year is weather and Asia. Worse still is that the Asian situation was not contained there. The Asian problems may have been precipitated or extended by the fact that the world appears to be in the throes of a deflationary spiral, not only for agricultural commodities, but also for metals, minerals and for oil. All of these situations have been in what could be called a deflationary mode. The world has not seen this type of phenomenon for a half a century. 
It is not clear who the winners and losers are from deflation. There are many of us anecdotically going to a filling station to fill up a tank who rejoice in the fact that sometimes you can buy a gallon of gasoline for less than $1 these days. There is not a great hue and cry on the part of the public to raise the price of gasoline to $1.20 or $1.50. As a matter of fact, we pocket the change without commenting and are simply pleased that some nice things come along in life unexpectedly. 
But, if you were in fact a Nigerian, a Venezuelan, or even a Russian, and you saw that a large portion of the income of your country comes from oil and that income has gone down precipitously, or if you were any country in the world that gained most of its hard currency and export from mineral extraction, you would find a first-class recession on your hands. That has compounded the problem, obviously, for many of the Asian countries, as well as the increasing number of difficulties in our own hemisphere. It is not clear, Madam President, where the fallout will end with regard to so-called developing countries and others that have currency crises. But each of these weaken export demand from the United States for agricultural products and increasingly for other manufactured products as well. We need to recognize that. 
There are speeches every year about shortfalls in prices. Some of these shortfalls occur every year as we approach our harvest and the market tries to sort out where the lows are going to be and a certain amount of speculation occurs. This time the real fear is that, given the harvest woes, the bounce back may not be very substantial if there is not somewhere the prospect that we are going to have sales. 
I noted in the Wall Street Journal last Friday, at least that day--corn went down and beans went down. The problem pointed to by traders was that the export markets still looked weak. The article commented that wheat prospects looked somewhat better in the export markets--but not for corn and not for beans. That is a problem with which we are going to have to deal. That is why, Madam President, I pointed out that in the World Trade Organization meeting next year we must have fast-track authority. It is essential if we are to expand substantially our export markets, which we must do if demand is to increase and if prices are to go up. 
Let me point out that farm groups also strongly support International Monetary Fund funding and reform. They know that we have to deal with the Asian demand, the potential for declining demand in Latin America, and restoring IMF funding. 
Madam President, the debates upon IMF have been hot and heavy on this floor, and in the committees. That has been true in the other body. Clearly, a number of Senators pointed out that the IMF may not have given the best prescriptions for a healthy return in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea; that the IMF is far too opaque in terms of its deals; needs to be less secretive; that in fact prescriptions of raising taxes and lowering spending do not always work in economies and may not have been a realistic solution for Russia during the several times IMF money was given to that country. So, as a result, the Congress has not decided yet IMF funding. But, as I have pointed out, it is a very crucial situation. As a matter of fact, it is essential that we act in that area as well as the fast-track authority--two votes which leadership has promised. 
Agricultural groups want to maintain the viability of crop insurance and to improve it. In the debate today, considerable attention has been given to one of the failings of crop insurance. This failing is that should crop failure occur for several years, the producer's acreage production history falls, and his insurance premiums increase. We will have to reform crop insurance. But I would simply point out that there are a good number of debates, depending upon the standpoint of the observers, as to how that is to be done. 
For example, should there be a national premium for all farmers in all States and all locations regardless of risk that might be involved? Or should there be a premium based upon risk; upon the actuarial figures that show the history of a particular region or a particular crop? What should be the exposure of the taxpayers to the support of the insurance companies? We will need to face those problems of multicrop failures and actuarial soundness. 
There is currently a subsidy to the companies so that crop insurance will be provided universally, and, yet, there will be debates among Senators who are not in the agriculture business as to why this particular type of insurance is subsidized. But this year the Senate and the House--and the President by signing legislation as an amendment to the agricultural research bill--went a long way to stabilizing the situation for the next 5 years so that farmers would have a pretty good idea of the lay of the land, and so would the insurance providers. That was critically important. 
Madam President, part of our debate today on how agriculture is to be strengthened in the country was addressed in legislation that the Senate and the House passed and the President signed. We went a long way in the same legislation by providing specifically for agricultural research of all sorts, including pure research on those breakthroughs that we need to have if American agriculture is to be the most efficient, to be the lowest cost, and to be in a position to feed the world. 
I look forward in the Agriculture Committee to substantial hearings and efforts by all parties as we progress into the next session. But for now, we have most farmers in this country covered with some degree of crop insurance. The amount of coverage was the choice of the farmer. I would say from my own experience that I had to make choices with regard to coverage of my corn and soybean crops this year. I could take a chance by having no insurance. That really has been my policy for decades. 
Or I could assume that perhaps El Nino would not work out so well, or El Nino would come behind it, or there would be other difficulties. I had better be prudent, be certain that I cover certain acres, and guarantee a certain price or outcome. Premiums differ according to the amount of risk that is acceptable. That is what most prudent business people do, in agriculture, outside of agriculture, anywhere. 
Madam President, a number of farmers in the country apparently were not prudent and did not purchase adequate crop insurance coverage. Maybe they did not adequately understand the program, which means we have a large education job to do. But in any event, crop insurance reform is of the essence. That ought to be a part of our agenda. We have acted to mitigate the effects of economic sanctions on agriculture. 
Madam President, I wish that the Senate had passed the sanction reform legislation, S. 1413, which I offered as an amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill. I believe that would have been a very constructive and hopeful step not only for agriculture but for all of American exporters. I have suggested in that legislation--which is still alive and hopefully will be reconsidered this year or next year--that there ought to be a systematic way in which our country considers economic sanctions. The President or the Congress ought to state what we are attempting to achieve, what the benchmarks will be for success, and what the costs will be of the sanctions to Americans and to American businesses, in terms of their effect on incomes and jobs. Finally, we ought to review sanctions each year. After 2 years they ought to be sunsetted unless the President or Congress specifically decides that a particular sanction is making a difference in our foreign policy. 
I proposed this prospectively--that is, for the future--as opposed to revisiting the sanctions of the past, although many Senators have offered bills that touch upon the past or offered sanction waivers to the President. Unhappily, my bill got caught up, in a way, in the problems we have had during the appropriations season. There is not much time and there is much work to do. 
But in any event, others have proposed sanction reform legislation. I have supported a number of those attempts because they take away roadblocks to exporting, and exporting addresses demand and increases price. Those who have talked eloquently today about price and income need to talk about exports, fast-track authority, and sanctions reform as opposed to policy options to store and overhang supplies for the future. 
Let me point out, Madam President, that with regard to food there is a special case to be made against sanctions. I have supported such legislation, and I have supported the thought that we ought not to have economic sanctions on food, and that it is an inhumane policy. It is not an effective policy with regard to our foreign policy, and resolving sanctions on food would be of great help to American agriculture and American farmers. 
We acted with corresponding dispatch in this body, as we did on the wheat sales to Pakistan, by speeding up the 1999 AMTA payments, the Freedom to Farm payments to farmers. This is a very large sum of cash. AMTA payments are made twice. The final 1998 payment for farmers will be made before the end of the fiscal year. 
But we suggested that beginning October 1, 1999, farmers all over America who need increased cash flow--and we have heard much discussion of that today--could apply for the total AMTA payment for fiscal year 1999. Whether due to an emergency because of weather or because of the catastrophe in Asia, the cash flow could occur without taking out a loan; it is simply cash that the farmer in the program was guaranteed in the farm bill:  
But in any event, we decided to make that whole sum of about $5.5 billion available, and available promptly, as soon after October 1 as the U.S. Department of Agriculture could work out the administrative details, possibly by October 15. 
This, I think, is an important point about the current farm bill. It has been suggested--I hope facetiously--by some today that it was the `Freedom to Fail' bill as opposed to Freedom to Farm, but most people would say when it comes to the AMTA payments, they like it. They like the thought that for 7 years, if you are in the program, you get a payment, divorced entirely from supply and demand, from the Asian economic crisis, from anything else as a matter of fact. It is a so-called transition from the farm bills of supply control of the past to the market-oriented programs that we have now. 
Let me just say finally that the Senate, while approving $500 million in disaster aid as a placeholder for conference, it was understood that there may be additional monetary demands placed on the conference. I am not advocating that the sum be increased, but I am acknowledging that Senators from around the country have realized there has been further crop losses and plummeting prices. This legislation that is going to pass as a conference report, and hopefully will be signed by the President. 
Let me point out, Madam President, that in addition to these very substantial ways of bringing money to farmers and new and enhanced demand, many of us have supported Senator Grassley's farm and ranch risk management proposal and we will work diligently to encourage its inclusion in any new tax legislation this year. 
I was very pleased to note in the Wall Street Journal today that Congressman Archer, the distinguished chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, as he initiates $80 billion of tax cuts, has created an accelerated estate tax exclusion. The $1 million exclusion would commence January 1, 1999. 
In the hearings we have had before the Senate Ag Committee, there have been two items that real live farmers said we need, we want. One is estate tax relief because it means the family farm really does have some possibility of remaining a family farm as opposed to confiscatory taxes intruding into an estate which is very heavy in real estate, land, livestock, buildings, and often very low in cash. So this is a critical item if you are a family farmer, and I am. This is critical, at least as I take a look at it, from the perspective of all the people I know in Indiana who are involved in family farming. This is real change in the economic aspects for this year and for many years for the continuity of farm life as we know it. So that is an important item. 
The second thing people came in to say is, year by year, the most important thing you could do for us is to give us 100 percent deductibility of our health payments. For the average family farmer farming, say, 500 acres or so in Indiana, that often is an additional $4,000 or $5,000 added to the bottom line. That is a big piece of change. 
The price effects changes that would come from removing the cap on the loan rate amount to about a 15-cent change, a 15-cent change in the price of a bushel of corn. It takes a lot of additional bushels to add up to $5,000 in the bottom line. A learned study just performed by the Food Agriculture and Policy Research Institute, and commissioned by the distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, determined this. 
Congressman Archer is proposing in this bill that we go to 100-percent exemption promptly. That would be true for all Americans, and that is true of the estate tax situation. These are not proposals that are made specifically for farmers. 
I make that point because, although, quite properly, we are concerned with agricultural America, Senators have other people in their States in addition to farmers. In fact, some States hardly have very many farmers at all. What we are talking about, for example, in raising the loan caps is what the Congressional Budget Office now has estimated as a $5 billion new expenditure. That means that $5 billion would go from all the other taxpayers of the United States to some specific taxpayers who are essentially grain farmers. Few Americans may understand that transaction, that we have today been debating whether to give up $5 billion to grain farmers. But that is a huge transfer of income to a small group. 
What I think is more constructive is a proposal such as that of the distinguished chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in which he said estate taxes apply to all, including farmers. Farmers are 16 times more likely to pay estate taxes, for example, than other people. But this legislation is not limited to farmers or grain farmers. It is for all of us, and is true of the deductibility of those who pay their medical payments as individual persons. 
I think it is, likewise, important to point out that Congressman Archer was quite specific on one of his proposals. He suggested that a provision retroactive to January 1, 1998--that is the beginning of this year--would expand to 5 years from 2, the number of tax years farmers can carry back losses. 
That would be very helpful. A number of us have been talking about income averaging. This really goes at it aggressively, a carry back to 5 years. The Outlook, the publication of the USDA, points out that the last 5 years have been pretty good ones for agricultural America. This year is a downer with the weather and the Asia problems, but this has not always been the case. I can testify from my own farm that the last 5 years have been very, very healthy years. And farmers all over America have repaid debt. And businesses that thrive at the crossroads have thrived with that type of farm income. 
Let me point out the FAIR Act, the Freedom to Farm Act, did not abolish price support loans. I think that is important to point out. In fairness, several Senators have pointed that out. They have said that there is a marketing loan in the farm bill. They disagree with the rate of that loan, or the price that is to be allowed--$1.89 for corn, for example, and would like for that to be over $2.20. 
But let me just take an example, once again, from my own operations. I ask the patience of the Senate with regard to that because I do not believe there are many Senators here today who are in farming. There may be a few. I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, has long been involved with his family farm that I visited in Iowa. But there are not many. I am one of them, and today, Providence willing, soybeans will be shipped from harvest on my farm into the local elevator in Indianapolis. We will receive the marketing assistance loan at the rate of $5.26, which is being quoted today. 
I sold beans at an average pretty close to $6.75 to $6.80 over the last year. So $5.26 is well off of that. One could say it is 20 percent, maybe more, maybe less. But I am happy to report that the yield per acre on the Lugar farm on beans looks to me to be way up. I think that is probably important, too. As a matter of fact, the cost per bushel will be down if the number of beans coming up is up. 
We have heard suggestions today that you have almost an immutable cost out there. It simply cannot be met by these loan deficiency payments or marketing assistance loans. But I point out, volume still counts. And volume we have this year--a record soybean crop in America. Not just on our farm, that specific location, but all over America; unparalleled number of bushels of beans, maybe only the second in history in terms of corn. 
So before all the dire predictions are visited, one has to take a look at some actual situations, some actual farmers who have some beans and have some corn. I point out the Freedom to Farm Act has not gotten into the loan deficiency payment until this year, and it is because low prices have kicked it in. But it would appear that this is going to be an additional $2 or $3 billion for grain farmers this year. 
I pointed out earlier that over $5 billion is kicking in early in the AMTA payments for cash flow purposes, an additional $2 or $3 billion in this LDP program, and at least $500 million in an indemnity payment in regard to the weather. The taxpayers of this country have not been grudging when it has come to trying to meet agricultural pain and difficulty this year. As a matter of fact they have been very generous. And farmers are saying we do not really want charity, we want sales, we want marketing, we want exports. Give us at least those tools in fast-track authority in the IMF, in various other facilities. Give us taxation changes so as individuals who have to pay our own health insurance, we get the benefit of the deduction which in some strange way has been denied us. That is not the case in the industrial sector. Give us tax relief in terms of carry-back provisions so we can average out over the good years, and save the taxes. Give us estate tax relief. 
Let me just point out, we are not going to see, in my judgment, an end to the Asian crisis, the Russian crisis, or others, overnight. But we can exacerbate the problem inadvertently by doing the wrong thing. Higher loan rates have instant appeal--and I think that is obvious from the argumentation given here earlier today. But history shows they have long-term effects that are undesirable. A higher loan rate inevitably stimulates more production than the market can absorb.  
That is a very big point, Madam President, because, as a matter of fact, lower prices currently are very likely to send exactly different signals; namely, do not plant as much of those things in which you do not do well. There will be marginal changes. There are some farm operations geared up to plant a particular crop every year come hell or high water. There is no need for market signals, that is what the farm does. The question is, Can you lower costs so that you become profitable and efficient over the years? Most farmers have lowered costs. That is why we are the lowest cost producers in the world and why we are bound to be good when we export. 
But at the same time, the higher loan rate, by stimulating more production, will lead to a surplus and, thus, lower prices in the future, not higher prices. This amendment is clearly a short-term stimulus. If the projections of a $5 billion cost for taking off the loan cap is correct, $5 billion is going fairly immediately from some taxpayers in America to grain farmers, essentially. That will increase the income but, Madam President, the following year, the income comes down. 
Let me point out that a study that was completed for my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, points this out. Senator Harkin approached well-known researchers at the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute. They pointed out, as we might anticipate, that if, in fact, the amendment before us were to be adopted, the average price of corn for the current year, 1998-1999, would increase 10 cents a bushel. That would be the average increase for that corn this year--10 cents. Wheat prices would increase 15 cents and soybean prices 6 cents. 
But, unfortunately, they point out that the aftermath also indicates that in the following year, prices go down. Corn prices go down by 6 cents and wheat prices go down by 10 cents below the baseline. Soybean prices, would be relatively flat, they say. Essentially, they evaluate the immediate income surge at about $4.56 billion, pretty close to the $5 billion estimated by CBO. 
They point out the obvious: if you have $5 billion injected into this situation averaged over 2 or 3 years, you still have more money than you had when the $5 billion went in. But they point out that absent a constant stream of this kind of activity--that is unleashing the caps, with continual injections of cash--that prices come down and so does overall income.

Mr. LUGAR. That, Mr. President, is the basic problem with the amendment that has been offered by the distinguished Senator from Iowa. I simply point out that the basic and largest farm organizations in America have spotted this and they wrote to me on September 11. The organizations that have written and signed this letter are: American Farm Bureau Federation, American Sheep Industry Association, National Broiler Council, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Pork Producers Council and the National Turkey Federation--very sizable groups, covering general agriculture, as well as specific livestock and poultry situations. 
They say: 
Dear Chairman Lugar: As the largest market for feed grains and soybean meal, the livestock and poultry producers are concerned over the debate to change the farm program's non-recourse loan rate structure. While we empathize with the market situation faced by feed grain farmers, we urge you to consider the very serious potential impact that changes in loan rates could have on all users of feed grains. With the export market being so vitally important to American agriculture, it is necessary to ensure that changes in government policy not put animal agriculture at a competitive disadvantage. 
Historically, non-recourse loan rates that do not reflect market conditions have proven to affect producers' marketing decisions, which in turn have led to government surpluses that negatively pressure market price recovery. At a time when all of agriculture is facing depressed marketing conditions and export losses, we respectfully request that the Committee examine alternative policy initiatives to address low price conditions and help restore profitability to farmers and livestock and poultry producers.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, these agencies, including the American Farm Bureau and the sheep, broiler, beef and pork producers have made the essential point with regard to the removing of the cap on the marketing loans. Inevitably, the signals go out and the supplies increase. Even under the marketing loan concept, in which it is unlikely that there will be the buildup of forfeitures and the buildup of governmental storage that characterized previous situations, there still is a glut on the market. The surplus does not disappear. 
Price signals were out there for a purpose. They indicated who wanted to utilize the commodity, who could utilize the commodity. Tragically, in this country, we are utilizing commodities about as well as we are going to. The up-side potential that we talked about today on the export side is the difference. That is where the thrust has to occur. To have a domestic transfer of income simply hides the problem; it doesn't market the commodities. The costs do not decrease for farmers in the field, although much that we have done this year in terms of our research bill might assist people in bringing about lower costs. 
I commend all of my colleagues who have spoken to this issue today for their concern. They have spoken with sincerity. They are advocates of producers in their States and of American agriculture generally. Many are Members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and participate regularly in trying to think along with the majority and minority how we can deal with these problems. 
But, Mr. President, we have debated, as was pointed out earlier by various Senators, this issue on at least a couple of occasions. On one occasion, the distinguished Senator from Montana, who is on the floor now, discussed a lengthening of payment of the loan rate. He did not press for a vote on that occasion. But then on the appropriations bill, an amendment was offered by the distinguished minority leader of the Senate, Senator Daschle, that had very similar characteristics with regard to the caps on the loan rate. The Senate voted 56 to 43 after extensive debate that took, as I recall, the better part of 4 hours on that occasion. 
We have revisited the issue for another 4 hours this afternoon, and it is probably worthy of considerably more attention. I suspect the problem is that the Senate is also attempting to deal with the Interior appropriations bill in addition to problems of agriculture. 
It will not be a good idea to adopt this amendment. I have listened carefully to others who have spoken. But we ought to defeat this amendment. Therefore, Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their sincerity, but after a consultation with and on behalf of the majority leader 
I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Leroy `Lee' Lochmann, the recently retired President and CEO of ConAgra's Refrigerated Foods Companies. Over a forty-five-year career in the meat and poultry industry, Lee's leadership skills have made him a pioneer in the food business. 
In 1953, Lee joined Swift and Company directly out of high school, working on the line in an East St. Louis meat packing plant. From these early years, Lee moved through numerous management positions, finally ascending to key executive ranks. He ultimately became President of Swift and Company, the first of many--and increasingly large--meat and poultry companies that Lee would eventually run. 
In addition, along the way, Lee accumulated two university degrees and served his country in the military for three years. 
Lee's hardworking beginnings have given him a unique perspective as a food industry leader and have allowed him to effectively manage his employees, from the most junior line worker to the most senior corporate manager. 
At ConAgra, one of the world's largest food companies, Lee used his experience to expand its diversified Refrigerated Foods Companies. As president, CEO and member of the Office of the Chairman, Lee oversaw multibillion dollar businesses, provided a secure place of employment for thousands of hard-working employees and wonderful food products for American consumers. While consumers would not recognize the name of Lochmann, the products that he produced are an integral part of our daily diets: Armour hot dogs, Healthy Choice luncheon meats, Butterball turkeys, Swift Premium bacon and Eckrich sausages. 
Mr. President, many ConAgra employees are constituents of mine in Indiana, and we know first-hand the significant role the company plays in my state's economy and our country's agricultural industries. 
Lee was not only a leader at ConAgra, he was an industry trader, as well. A long term Director of the American Meat Institute, Lee's peers paid this fine gentleman a well-deserved tribute by electing him Chairman of the industry's National Trade Association in 1992. 
Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pay tribute to Lee Lochmann, and I wish him, his wife Agnes and their family the best in all of their future endeavors.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to combat fraud and waste in the food stamp program--overpayments resulting from individuals receiving benefits in two or more states at the same time. This bill is the result of the last in a series of General Accounting Office studies that I requested dealing with groups of ineligible people receiving food stamps. In the report being released today, GAO identifies over 20,000 individuals who received benefits in at least two states at the same time during 1996. Using administrative records from four states (California, Texas, New York and Florida), the GAO estimates overpayments of $3.9 million in those states alone. 
Last year the GAO reported to the Agriculture Committee that over $3 million in food stamp benefits were overpaid to prisoners' households. In response we passed legislation to stop prisoners from receiving benefits. Earlier this year, the GAO reported that 26,000 deceased individuals in four states were counted as members of a food stamp household. According to the GAO this resulted in overpayments of an estimated $8.6 million. The Agriculture Committee reported a bill to match food stamp files with Social Security Administration data. 
My bill will require the United States Department of Agriculture to conduct a feasibility study to identify options for a national database to track food stamp participants and combat interstate fraud. The GAO's report validates a Department of Health and Human Services computer match of 15 states which found 18,000 potential duplicated Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cases. This suggests that the problem is not confined to USDA. My bill would direct the USDA to work in consultation with other agencies to develop a systematic approach to developing a national database. 
At present there is no appropriate national database that tracks in means-tested benefit programs. States have been working individually on the problem of benefits paid in multiple jurisdictions. For example, some states have developed cooperative agreements with neighboring states to share data. Current state efforts are effective, but anything short of a national system is inefficient. 
Mr. President, the welfare reform bill required states to guard against fraud and abuse, and specifically prohibited participants from receiving benefits in two states. However, the bill did not give states tools to combat this type of fraud. The welfare bill also did not give states the tools to implement other important provisions. To effectively implement the TANF and food stamp time limits, some type of national tracking system is necessary. 
Therefore, this bill directs the agencies involved to address a broader range of issues than simply the receipt of benefits in different states at the same time. HHS has already fulfilled a congressional mandate to look into some of these issues, so I expect the participants in this new study to use the completed project as a base upon which to build. 
Further, I believe that the study should explore the possibility of a `real time' database, so that eligibility workers will instantly know if there are any problems with an application. This will avoid the `pay-and-chase' problem that forces states to recoup overpayments from beneficiaries after the fact--sometimes years later. This method of fraud enforcement is inefficient, and often a burden on the recipient as well. A national database should not be seen as purely an enforcement tool. There are many cross program benefits for the poor, benefits which may not be apparent today. As with any large governmental database, the study should address how the system will safeguard recipients' privacy and limit unauthorized use and disclosure of data. 
Means-tested benefits, including food stamps, provide a safety net for millions of people. We cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine the food stamp program and welfare reform. Integrity is essential to ensure a program that can serve those in need. It is our responsibility to help end fraud and abuse in all federally funded programs. This legislation is an important step in that direction and will help ensure that welfare reform is a success.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise before you today to recognize two excellent high school teachers who have been chosen by the National Geographic Society to represent the State of Indiana in the promotion of Geography Awareness Week. 
I wish to commend Christine Bullock of Walkerton, Indiana and Kevin Leineweber of Lafayette, Indiana for their efforts in advancing Geography Awareness Week throughout Indiana. 
Ms. Bullock and Mr. Leineweber visited our nation's capital for three weeks this summer to study methods for improving geographic education in our schools. They have set themselves apart as Hoosier leaders who understand that geography should be an intregal part of American education. 
Geography offers a unique perspective in understanding ourselves, our relationship to the Earth and its resources and our interdependence with other people of the world. With an ever expanding global network of trading partners, the United States must look to its future entrepreneurs and citizens to have an understanding of the world and its geography in order to promote American interests abroad. 
I urge all teachers to stress to their students the importance of geography, and I appeal to students to study geography and its effects on the makeup of our global societies. 
I extend my congratulations to Ms. Bullock and Mr. Leineweber for recognizing the importance of geography and working toward the development of geographic knowledge in our communities and schools.

 Mr. LUGAR. 
Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will help the dairy industry manage price volatility. The bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a pilot program under which milk producers and cooperatives will be permitted to enter into forward price contracts with milk handlers. 
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 required the U.S. Department of Agriculture to consolidate the federal milk marketing orders by April 1999, to phase out the dairy price support program by January 1, 2000, and replace it with a recourse loan program for commercial dairy processors by January 1, 2000, and authorizes reforms in the federal milk marketing order system. Movement toward a more market-oriented dairy industry was supported on a bipartisan basis in the House and Senate. 
At a July 29, 1997, Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, witnesses testified that price volatility exists in the dairy industry as it does for other agricultural commodities. However, in the case of the dairy industry, the tools to manage price risk are less developed and the knowledge of how to use risk management techniques is below that of most other food commodities. 
On January 2, 1998, and again on February 25, 1998, I wrote Secretary of Agriculture Glickman recommend modification of federal milk marketing orders to permit proprietary handlers of milk to offer dairy producers forward contracts for milk. The department interprets the applicable statute as prohibiting the offering of forward contracts because the contracts would violate a requirement to pay producers a minimum price. 
The legislation I introduce today authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a three-year pilot program for forward pricing of milk. Under the program, milk handlers and producers could voluntarily enter into fixed price contracts for specific volume of milk for an agreed upon period of time. It is intended that the Secretary of Agriculture review the forward pricing contracts to ensure that the contracts are consistent with all existing fair agricultural trade practices. 
Mr. President, it is important that dairy producers and processors be afforded risk management tools. I believe this legislation will assist in that effort and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee in a brief colloquy on the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX). I would like to hear his thoughts about German-American student exchanges and the reasons why the bill before us does not include any appropriation for these important exchanges. 
Let me assert first of all that I am a strong and enthusiastic supporter of the CBYX program that has been in existence now for 15 years. I recall the enthusiasm in the Senate when, in 1983, the late Senator Heinz introduced the bill authorizing this exchange program. Many of us rose to endorse it and the legislation received unanimous support. 
The legislation was inspired by the events surrounding the critical decision by the German Government to deploy United States Pershing-II missiles in Germany--a decision which, in my judgment accelerated the end of the Cold War. At the time, it became evident that there were fundamental misunderstandings within Germany of United States intentions and equally shallow perceptions about Germany in the United States. 
The German Government felt the need for correcting misperceptions about the United States most acutely and initiated a process to establish and fund a youth exchange program with the United States. The Congress-Bundestag exchange program that emerged from those efforts was not just another bilateral exchange program. Rather, it has become an essential component of American foreign policy. With the imminent expansion of NATO eastward, it takes on an even more important role in promoting understanding between our two countries. 
The Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange program was launched jointly in 1983 by the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag and has been funded by both governments in roughly equal amounts ever since. 
Many of us on both sides of the aisle who were in Congress in 1983 spoke passionately in support of these 
exchanges. Those of us who follow the program closely and meet with the exchange students believe it is an essential component of American foreign policy. 
Apart from expanding awareness of German and American institutions and culture, the international experiences and increased proficiency in language have become valuable assets in the students' continuing education and community life. 
One of the unique features of the Congress Bundestag Youth Exchange Program is that the German Government virtually matches our contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. They try to match the number of students they send to the United States to those we send Germany. They would like to send many more students. When we increase or decrease our funding, they tend to increase or decrease their funding. Thus, if we zero out or decrease funding for this program, the German Government may do the same. In effect, that would be a double hit and a double calamity for United States-German relations. 
Thousands of young people from Germany and from the United States are able to spend a year in the other country, live with host families and learn about one another. Thousands have become young Ambassadors for their country. They have strengthened our mutual interests. 
Germany's strategic importance in Europe is self-evident. It enjoys the strongest economy in Europe and has cooperated in expanding both the European Union and NATO toward the East. It is poised to play an even greater role in international peacekeeping, international commerce, and the global economy. Moreover, there are more than 60 million Americans who trace their heritage to German origins, one of the largest, if not the largest, ethnic groups in the United States. 
Could I ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee what has been the recent funding levels for the Congress-Bundestag Program and if the bill before us eliminates or reduces funding for the Congress-Bundestag program for fiscal year 1999?

Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate your assurances. Mr. President, I would like to made a few additional comments on the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program. 
For the past 15 years, some 11,000 young students from Germany and the United States have participated in these exchanges. German and American families have hosted these students in their homes and communities and formed enduring friendships and nurturing the ability to see each other through the other's eyes. The earliest of these participants are mature adults now and have assumed responsible positions in their communities. I'm impressed that senior members of the German Government, including Chancellor Kohl and the President of the German Bundestag, Rita Sussmuth are personally involved in the program. Many others have invited American students to work in their offices, invited them into their homes and arranged for specific events on their behalf. Our German counterparts value this program very highly and promote it with enthusiasm. 
In the end, we should support this program because it is in our interests to do so. It is one of our smallest international exchange programs but it reaps substantial foreign policy benefits. We should be sending more American students to Germany on this program. The German Government wants to increase the number of students they send here. 
I should add that most of the American students selected for this exchange program are juniors or sophomores in high school. The standards are high. To be eligible, a student must have a 3.0 grade point or better and be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States. 
Once again, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. He has a difficult task of balancing growing and competing demands with increasingly sparse resources. I appreciate his understanding and courtesy and look forward to working with him and the committee to restore funding for the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX).

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to permit local school districts to waive the cost requirements of foreign students studying in our public high schools in the United States on F-1 visas. The law now mandates that all foreign students who are not in a government-funded exchange program must pay or reimburse the costs of their education in American public schools. 
In those public school districts flooded with foreign students who pay no taxes, this requirement makes good sense. However, in those school districts which enroll a small number of foreign students and bear a tolerable burden there may be no need or desire for reimbursement. The decision to enroll and to require cost reimbursement should be made at the local level. Current law, however, does not permit this local discretion. The bill I am introducing will allow local school districts to waive the requirement that foreign students must pay for the cost of their education. The decision to waive or not waive this requirement should be made at the grass roots level, not in Washington and my bill seeks to preserve this principle. It would amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). 
Foreign exchange students bring knowledge, cultural exposure and understanding to American students, schools and communities. I have been a proponent of cultural and educational exchanges and have supported most international exchange programs over the years--both those which bring foreign visitors here and those which send American students, scholars and practitioners abroad. I remain committed to these programs. 
In 1996, I supported the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. This law states that as of November 30, 1996, IIRIRA prohibits any alien from receiving an F-1 student visa to attend a public elementary school, grades K-8, or a publicly-funded adult education program unless they pay the unsubsidized, per capita cost of their education in advance. My bill would not change current law relating to elementary schools or adult education. It would not pertain to students on formal, government-funded international exchanges. It would simply allow high school officials to waive the cost of education of high school-level foreign students in order to enroll an exchange student, should they wish to do so. I believe this has been an unintended consequence of IIRIRA. 
Several cities have `Sister City' arrangements between American cities and cities in foreign countries. One valuable component of these arrangements is an exchange program for high school students enabling American youth to spend a year in a foreign high school while students from abroad spend a year in a high school here. No tuition is generally exchanged under the sister city agreement, but current U.S. law states that visitors to our country must pay the unsubsidized cost of their education, even though American students are exempted from the cost requirement. 
Along the Alaska-Yukon, Alaska-British Columbia and U.S.-Mexican borders there are schools serving very remote communities on both sides of the border. After enactment of the 1996 law, Canadian or Mexican students were no longer eligible to enter the United States to attend the local public school even though governments and the local school districts agreed to enroll the students. 
Many school districts prefer to enroll one or two exchange students a year. Reciprocal exchange agreements are beneficial and host families enjoy these students in their homes. American exchange students attending schools in Germany, for example, are not subjected to the same tuition requirements for their schooling, yet they gain an understanding of German history and culture and benefit from their travels. Currently, U.S. law requires foreign students to pay tuition before they arrive in the United States. The extra paper work, the up-front costs and the extra burden these requirements place on foreign students tend to undermine the purposes of cultural exchanges. 
I remain mindful to past abuses of F-1 visas and am sympathetic to the burden that large enrollments of foreign students place on American public schools. My purpose in introducing this bill today is not to weaken the law as it currently reads, but to provide an outlet for our schools to give an educational opportunity for enrolling international exchange students.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for his insistence on my gaining recognition. I appreciated the colloquy between the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and the earlier comments of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. 
I come before the Senate as a fifth-generation family farmer; that is, five family generations of Lugars, from the 1820s in Grant County, through the present farming operation we have in Marion County, have been involved in the business of farming. We take the family farming very seriously on the 604 acres of corn and soybeans and tree stands that I am now responsible for and have been for the last 42 years. 
The contents of farm legislation are interesting to me as a citizen of this country, certainly as a member of the Agriculture Committee, and as one who is affected by those policies as I try to determine what I ought to plant, what my opportunities are as a family farmer in Indiana. I have been a long-time member of the Indiana Farm Bureau, as was my father, Marvin Lugar, and my uncle, Harry Lugar, a long-time member of the farmer's union in Indiana. I have been responsive to both groups and to others who have been involved in organizational agriculture as we helped to fashion the last four farm bills. 
I come before the Senate today just having addressed a meeting 2 days ago of the American Farm Bureau President's Group. At least on a couple of occasions a year, the president of each of the 50 State farm bureaus come to Washington, along with the various persons in their organizations. During the course of that colloquy with the farm bureau presidents, I was approached by a gentleman who mentioned he is the president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. His name is Jim Harmon. Jim Harmon, the president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, gave to me an article which he had published in the North Dakota Farm Bureau Journal. 
I quote from his article. Mr. Harmon says: 
It seems whenever things get difficult in farming, we look for someone or something to blame. That is certainly the case with the financial crisis facing farmers and ranchers in the northern plains where we have had continuous years of adverse growing conditions, now compounded by low prices. Some would like to assign blame to the `Freedom to Farm' bill; and have Congress reopen it to `fix' the price problem. This is the wrong route to take, because `Freedom to Farm' is not the problem--only the scapegoat. If the Act is reopened, I fear that farmers stand to lose much more than they can possibly gain. 
Mr. Harmon continues: 
The argument is being made that we need to reinstate the old `safety net' program of the last 50 years. Fifty years ago, we had almost seven million farmers in the United States. We now have two million. What kind of `safety net' lets that many producers slip through it? The only thing those programs guaranteed was a price ceiling on most commodities in most years. Stable prices at low levels with rising production costs is not the prescription for profitability in farming. In the current legislation, the `safety net' of price supports and disaster declarations (not always successful), was replaced by `transition payments' to offset the impact of depressed prices, and the promise of meaningful risk management tools to reduce the effects of natural disasters. For North Dakota farmers, the promise of an improved crop insurance program in our risk management tool kit still needs to be fulfilled. 
A recent study by researchers in the Agricultural Economics department at NDSU indicated that about three-fourths of North Dakota's 1997 decline in net farm income was due to yield and quality reductions, and one-fourth to low commodity prices. 
Blaming the current farm bill for the depressed cereal grain prices is also off the mark. The bill authorizes $500 million for the Export Enhancement Program. Only $150 million was appropriated, of which NONE has been used until the now famous EEU barley shipments into the United States. Adequate funding of the Market Access Program, along with a comprehensive strategy for expanding foreign markets for our commodities are tools that must be developed and implemented if agriculture is to succeed in the global marketplace. 
Mr. Harmon continues:  
Another area that deserves attention is the fact that the United States has made sanctions against countries that comprise 11 Percent of the world wheat market (accounting for 40 percent of the world wheat export market). Given American agriculture's dependence on export markets, trade sanctions usually punish farmers more than the leadership of the country we're mad at. 
Farm Bureau strongly believes that the following components are necessary to ensure the success of the current farm programs: 
Mr. Harmon says: 
Improve Federal Crop Insurance and develop new cost-efficient income coverage programs. 
Utilize to the fullest extent, all of the trade tools available, including EEP, GSM 102 and 103 Credit Programs, MAP, and the Foreign Market Development (FMD) Programs. 
Provided promised reforms in the areas of wetlands, pesticides, air and quality regulations. 
Expand agricultural research funding. 
Other items that will complete an integrated ag package include FARRM accounts, income averaging, estate and capital gains tax relief. 
Changing current farm law will only open the door to false hope for those of us who need real answers. Real answers can be found by using the tools available to their fullest potential. 
I believe that Mr. Harmon, the president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, has made the case very well for the current farm bill. He has also offered some excellent suggestions. I am hopeful that, as Senators meet with the President today, the President will subscribe to many of the suggestions that Mr. Harmon has made. 
Let me simply add, as that conversation with the President commences, that it would be helpful to have in front of the President U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the farm bill now in force in this country is providing payments totaling $17.180 billion over the 1996-1998 marketing years; that is, the first 3 years of this new farm bill. This $17.18 billion of payments to producers is in comparison to what would have been paid under the old farm bill. That would have been only $9.63 billion. 
In essence, the current farm bill, during 1996, 1997, and 1998, will have made available to producers in these transition payments $7.55 billion more than they would have received if we had continued the old farm bill. I think that is an important point, Mr. President, because that amount of income, $7.5 billion, is out there in farm country now. It is in the hands of family producers, family farmers, and it is reality, as opposed to speculation. 
Further, the transition payments under the farm bill are made earlier in the planting season than were the old deficiency payments. This has allowed family farms more latitude for planning as they go into planting their crops. 
Under the new farm bill, farmers have the flexibility as to what types of crops to plant and in what amounts. Farmers plant for the market rather than for the Government. The distinguished Senator from North Dakota noted that was one portion of the new farm bill that he liked. It is a very important one. 
As a family farmer, let me simply testify that for many years we planted corn because we were in the corn program and failure to plant corn might diminish the base on which our support payments were based. Therefore, we had to follow the dictates of the Federal Government that often asked us to set aside 5, 10 or 15 percent of our cropland. 
We could have produced things that did not have a program, Mr. President, but that would have diminished the base, so that if we wanted to return to the program, we would have been out of luck. As a result, for years, USDA essentially dictated the amounts of corn, wheat, cotton and rice--so-called program crops--to family farmers. Now, as a matter of fact, with Freedom to Farm, we are exercising that freedom. We are planting what the market signals the market wants. We are maximizing our opportunities. It is a critical point, Mr. President, but totally impossible under the old supply management of the farm bills of 60-some years. 
I note that current farm prices have prompted some Senators to suggest that the 1996 farm bill should be changed to alleviate what they perceive to be a farm crisis. Mr. President, we have had a lot of testimony before the Agriculture Committee and, indeed, we have heard farmers from the Dakotas and from the Chair's own State of Montana, and from northern Minnesota, testify about terrible weather problems, multiple crop failures--extraordinary difficulties that were recognized by this body when emergency disaster relief aid went to the Dakotas and to some other States last year. 
Mr. President, let me just say that even granted this crisis--and it is one that hopefully can be met by many farmers through the crop insurance that they have taken out, and participation in the Dakotas, where crop insurance is intensive, perhaps more so than most any other two States--given marketing opportunities that have been available that, hopefully, will be available again given the cyclical nature of crop prices, and certainly the changes in the weather that dictate from day to day very sharp changes in the futures market, we are all hopeful of trying to alleviate the crisis as perceived by some States and some counties that have a genuine crisis. 
I just point out, however, to all Members that 1998 farm prices--the ones we now have either for crops that have been harvested, or prospectively, for those in the fields--are low in comparison to the unusually high prices of 1995 and 1996. But they are about equal to the 1990-94 average price levels for wheat, corn, and soybeans. I point out that 1995 and 1996 had some unusual factors; namely, that the USDA guessed wrong and required farmers, such as myself, to set aside acreage and, in fact, the weather did not cooperate and we had very small crops in the country. Prices went up, predictably. 
I just say, Mr. President, that we are now in more normal planting situations in which there are not excessive stocks around the world. Farmers are planting for the market. And my point is that the prices now are roughly the 1990-94 average for wheat, corn, and soybeans. USDA projects that farmers, this year, will receive an average of between $2.70 and $3.10 for the 1998 crop of wheat. The 1990-94 average was $3.11. Corn prices are projected between $1.95 and $2.35, according to the USDA, and that is certainly much more speculative given the fact that we still have some time to make that crop, as compared to an average of $2.30 in the early 1990s. 
Mr. President, anyone who has watched the futures markets in the last few weeks has seen prices reverse direction drastically and dramatically. December corn closed on June 23, for example--not long ago--at $2.67 and three-quarters, a recovery of 30 cents from the contract lows--all in one fell swoop. Similarly, November soybeans closed at $6.40 and three-quarters, a 70 cent recovery from 
contract lows earlier in the season. 
Today's low prices are not caused by the farm bill. They reflect large world grain supplies, a direct result of the high prices of 1995 and 1996, distorted somewhat by USDA set-asides. But they reflect something much more, Mr. President, and that is a profound crisis in the economies of many Asian nations. If it were not for the Asian crisis, this Nation would be well on the road to setting another all-time record for the dollar value of farm exports. USDA's current projection of $56 billion in 1998 exports is about $4 billion less than the record--$60 billion--in 1996. If Asian demand simply matched last year's level, with no growth, we would have matched and exceeded the $60 billion figure. USDA forecasts that our exports to non-Asian countries will actually be 8 percent greater than in the record-setting year of 1996. 
The farm bill is a source of help and not harm for farm income. From 1996 to 1998, as we pointed out, the payments have been $17.18 billion, $7.5 billion more than the old farm bill. I just simply say that this money continues throughout the duration of the current farm bill. The payments are well known to farmers. So in terms of forward planning of their operations, they understand the money in the bank that is provided by the current farm bill. 
Let me just say that one of the ways in which many northern plains farmers who have been especially afflicted by very bad weather, and sometimes by wheat scab disease--a number of the northern plains farmers have adapted to these wheat problems, and scab and other disease problems, by changing the crops that they plant--oilseed acreage, for example, in North Dakota. And other States have expanded dramatically at the expense of wheat acres. Such wholesale shifts could not have occurred under the old farm policy. The disincentives to change crops were simply too great. Freedom to Farm is a package deal. Its aim is to leave planting decisions in the hands of the farmers and not the Government. And to achieve this goal, the FAIR Act provides full planting flexibility, bans production controls, and decouples income support payments. 
Another element in the farm bill is the relatively low loan rates, and that is the subject of the amendment before us. The purpose of the loan rates in the farm bill now is the same as the act's other features: to make certain that price supports are a short-term marketing tool and not an alternative market. Loan rates should not be set high enough to influence farmers' planting decisions, and they should not tie up grain in storage for such a long period of time that market signals are distorted. 
To state it another way, Mr. President, I have been asked by Senators, `Why is it a bad thing for marketing loans to bring grain into the hands of the Federal Government?' The basic reason is that grain doesn't disappear on its own accord. It is there; it is a drag on the supply side. It means everybody taking a look at futures markets knows it is still there. It has to be sold at some point. It depresses price. It depresses income. It is not a quick fix; it is not a good fix. Under the current farm bill, it is not meant to happen. That is why proposals to raise loan rates or extend the time for loans are doubly objectionable. 
Not only do they put a further strain on the Federal budget, but they put the Government back in the business of substituting its judgment about crop decisions for the market's judgment, and for that matter, about marketing the stores of grain the Government accumulates. The projected crop prices for the 1998 marketing year are much lower than I would like to see, particularly when compared to the high prices of 1995 and 1996. 
Mr. President, there are a number of steps that we will need to take in the Agriculture Committee and on this floor to assist farmers to obtain higher prices. I want to discuss some of those later in the day. But for the moment on the current amendment, just for the benefit of Senators, the amendment deals with removing the 1996 farm bill ceiling on loan rates. And it would mean that the USDA would be free to raise the 1998 crop loan rate to 85 percent of the past 5-year market price average excluding the high and the low years. The amendment would remove loan rate caps for marketing assistance loans for wheat, for feed grains, for cotton, and rice measured in fiscal year 1999 effectively uncapping the loan rates for the 1998 crops. 
Finally, the amendment would permit the Secretary of Agriculture to extend the term in the marketing assistance loans from the current 9 months to 15 months. 
I state all of this, Mr. President, because I am not certain in the debate thus far that it has been clear exactly what uncapping the loan rates means. It means, as I have stated, taking the last 5 years in these program crops, excluding the top and the bottom years, and, therefore, the average of the remaining three. And this results, for the benefit of Senators who are wondering about the amounts of money involved, that the current loan ceiling for wheat under the current farm bill is $2.58 a bushel. The calculation of the 85 percent of the 5-year average, excluding high and low prices, would raise that loan rate to $3.16. 
Mr. President, I make the point about wheat because I have already suggested that the average price of wheat calculated by USDA is now estimated after a pretty good harvest at between $2.70 and $3.10 for the year. Thus, we would be creating a loan rate higher than the likely average price for wheat marketed this year. It is logical in that event that very large amounts of that crop are going to go under the marketing loan. If, in fact, to take a practical example, a wheat farmer has some prospects for the average price of $3.10, or lower than that, he or she might decide to use the marketing loan to get the $3.16, and let the Federal Government worry about what is going to happen generally with the supply of wheat in this situation. 
For corn, the situation is not quite so generous. The current farm bill marketing loan would be $1.89 a bushel. Given this 5-year averaging, again with the high and low out, that goes up to $2.17. It is conceivable that given a bumper crop of 9.5 billion bushels that corn could dip below $2.17, and, if so, a good bit of corn would come under this procedure. 
Soybeans are at $5.26, the marketing loan rate. Under the farm bill, that would be $5.54 given the 5-year calculation if you removed the cap. It is hard to tell precisely what the situation would be for beans, but maybe a similar one to corn. 
In any event, you can predict that stock accumulations would be inevitable. These would lead, I suspect, to calls from the floor for supply control for USDA to step in and try to prevent a further accumulation of a glut of grain that is depressing prices in this country, and depressing farmers as they see those prices going down. Mr. President, this is not even a good quick fix. It is a prescription for enormous difficulty. 
Mr. President, the amendment before us, as I understand, has been tailored in various ways so that, although the Congressional Budget Office has not yet scored the amendment, it is clear that it would cost at least $1.6 billion, with 
approximately $400 million of that cost due to extending the term in the marketing loan by 6 months, and the remaining $1.2 billion due to uncapping the loan rates, 
Mr. President, I point out that in the action taken in this body the other day to make possible the tender offer by Pakistan, if it comes, for 37 million bushels of U.S. wheat, the Congressional Budget Office finally scored that, as I recall, at about $35 million in costs. And a huge scramble occurred to try to find where $35 million is, even to meet that emergency action. They found it. That is why the legislation finally made it through both Houses to be signed by the President. 
But we are talking now about $1.6 billion in this amendment. The quick fix of this situation is to say, `Well, it is an emergency outside the budget.' Unless somebody declared that today with regard to each of the same things that we are discussing, I see no majority support in this body for a declaration of emergency of this character. I see no prospect in the other body for that to occur. The money simply would have to come, if it is to be appropriated in this way, from other agriculture programs. And the scramble will begin as to who will pay the piper. This is a zero sum game. 
Mr. President, I add, finally, I started my talk by mentioning my visit with the state presidents of the American Farm Bureau. The American Farm Bureau and the 50 presidents who were there are not calling for this amendment. As a matter of fact, they do not believe the amendment is good policy, nor do I. 
Let me just suggest that there are things for which farm organizations are calling. The distinguished occupant of the Chair organized an important meeting of a good number of producer groups not long ago. During the course of that meeting a number of suggestions were made that are important policy changes. Among those were reauthorization of the Presidential fast-track trading authority. If there is a single item, Mr. President, that is important to higher income on the farm, it is that one, because in order to have an extension of our exports, an extension of our sales and our marketing, the President must have fast-track authority. No other country will deal with it. It is quite apart from the World Trade Organization, which is about to have an important meeting in 1999. At that meeting we are all encouraging Ms. Barshefsky, our Trade Representative, or anybody else who might represent us, including the Secretary of Agriculture, to make certain that agriculture is at the top of the priorities. Normally agriculture is at the bottom of the priorities. And that will take some pushing and shoving, because a good number of other interest groups in our country will say, `We don't want to hold up a deal with other countries due to their antagonism to agriculture.' The most protected of all areas is still in agricultural trade. 
So we have to have fast-track authority. We ought to be debating that if we are talking about agricultural income, and hopefully we will be debating that very soon on this floor. 
Second, we must have International Monetary Fund reform. I start by `reform,' because I appreciate the comments that have been made in various meetings of our committees about how IMF operates. But we are also going to have to have refunding and replenishment for the IMF. The cupboard is almost bare. The possibilities are that the nations of the world--we contribute about 18 percent of that money, and it is good to have at least 82 percent contributed by others. The nations of the world may, indeed, come to the rescue of other nations very promptly. Commodity prices are down worldwide. We are discussing today the problem of agricultural prices in the world. But, if we were in another country at another time, we would be discussing the implications of low oil prices, or low copper prices, or the fact that a certain deflationary trend seems to have come over primary foods and materials throughout the world affecting the economies. Enormous flexibility and safety net situations are going to be required. 
Third, the agricultural groups almost unanimously have talked about economic sanctions reform with a special emphasis on unilateral sanctions, the ones that we impose all by ourselves, and that we have imposed 61 times in the last 5 years and that have affected maybe $20 billion of American income and several hundred thousand American jobs. 
Later in this debate on the agriculture appropriations bill, I will be offering as an amendment a sanction reform bill that deals prospectively; that is, just with the future, but at least sets in motion criteria for the administration and for Congress in considering unilateral economic sanctions and estimates as to their cost and a sunsetting provision that we can get rid of them after they have achieved what they were supposed to do. It is a modest amendment, but it is an important amendment in the sense of giving hope to farmers in America. Do we care about them enough to be thinking how the sale is going to be made, how marketing can occur with this most vital of humanitarian commodities, food supply. 
Fourth, farm groups have called for establishment of normal trade relations with China. They have called for stronger oversight on biotechnology in negotiations with the Common Market and with others so that we are not denied the remarkable breakthroughs in our own science. They have asked for full funding of the agricultural research bill, and hopefully we will pass that as a part of this overall ag appropriations legislation. 
Earlier, of course, the farm groups were instrumental in helping us all to come to passage of the agricultural research bill itself. 
And 5 years of crop insurance provisions, which we now see were so critically important given the precarious nature of agricultural income due to weather and other events in so many parts of the country. 
I would point out that act alone, the Ag Research Act, and the crop insurance provisions for 5 years were tremendously important in making a difference for agricultural income now as well as for the foreseeable future in our country. 
The farm groups are calling for estate tax reform. Of anything that has come before our committee, that has had greater unanimity in terms of farm families, and these are the same family farms bandied about in the conversation all the time. They are saying, if we are going to have a family farm, we are really going to have to have estate tax reform and reduction and preferably abolition. Hopefully, that will come before the body. 
These are elements of a successful farm policy. We are finally going to have to come down to the point of discussing the difference between selling the crop and storing the crop, and there is a big difference. What I and many others are advocating is that we sell, that we market, that we move the crop. A third of all that we do in agricultural America has to move; a tough job in the face of the Asian demands falling off precipitously but not impossible. 
As I have pointed out, we are exporting to non-Asian countries 8 percent more now than we were doing in the 1996 record export year, and that did not happen by chance. It happened because agricultural marketers and farmers taking trade groups and personally visiting countries have done a remarkable job. We have to help that substantially, and we can. The policies I have talked about today are fully within our purview in the Senate to debate and to discuss and to enact. 
Let me just mention that those of us on this side of the aisle know that there are no quick fixes, but we do know that action is important as well as rhetoric. Less than an hour after the Senate approved the sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by the distinguished Democratic leader last evening, we gave final congressional approval to the broad exemption of agricultural products from India and Pakistan sanctions under the Glenn amendment. The Senate's action should allow U.S. wheat to compete in today's Pakistani tender for 350,000 metric tons of exports. 
Yesterday, I joined nine other Senators from farm States in calling for action this session on the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley's Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act, which gives farmers important new tools to manage the variability of farm income. I am hopeful that will be enacted in this session. 
Also, yesterday nine of us from farm States wrote the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, in support of actions which he can take now without legislation to increase exports of humanitarian food assistance. The CCC Charter Act provides authority for a wide range of Secretarial action, and our letter lays out how a new initiative could use existing funds to expand overseas concessional sales of wheat, vegetable oil, feedgrains and other commodities.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Republicans will continue to press for prompt action on appropriate legislative vehicles. We will join our House colleagues on both sides of the aisle in asking for a vote this year on fast-track authority, and we want to proceed with all Senators to move ahead on IMF replenishment and reform. We are hopeful of seeing passage of sanctions reform legislation. 
We are determined to create additional demand for American farm products and thus higher prices and hopefully higher income. We are working with farm groups all over the country for implementation of those portions of the farm bill which have led to the lowering of costs, so that the bottom line in terms of net income for farm families might be more positive. 
I share the general feeling in this debate that these are stressful times for millions of people in farm country. We have to address that up front and soberly. In these comments this morning, Mr. President, I have tried to illustrate that I believe the general outline of the farm bill has led to more income, more cash in these 3 years for farmers, and will in the next 4; that we have great possibilities, given Freedom to Farm, to do things on our farms that are most profitable guided by market signals. And finally, we have our work cut out for us in the Senate in dealing with the strengthening of our foreign trade position and the demand that we must have. 
Not long ago, I heard a lecture using this same general idea, that a third of our sales now go abroad--a third exported of our farm commodities and farm animals. The suggestion was, as a matter of fact, that already a third of the world trade that we were doing was with Asia. We had hoped for more expansion, and that seemed on the horizon, given the rise in Asian incomes prior to this year. 
Most of that third of the Asian trade is gone temporarily. We may have some success with this sale in Pakistan, and I hope that we will. Certainly, we are active as a Nation in South Korea, and there are some possibilities for sales there. The Indonesian market for the time being is devastated, and likewise not too much from Thailand, from Malaysia, and from other countries that have been afflicted. 
If you take away a third of the third of income that already was exported, that amounts to about one-ninth the demand for all that we do. It is no wonder that prices have fallen, but it should be a wonder if we do not act to market, to sell, to move this grain and this livestock by originating new policies that make a difference in world trade, where our bread and butter will come in agricultural America. 
For these reasons, I hope Senators will reject the amendment before us dealing with the marketing loan fix. In my judgment, it will be expensive, with money we do not have, it will depress prices rather than lead to an increase, and it will give the impression that this is in any way even a partial solution when, in my judgment, it will be a strong step backwards. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to propose an amendment that seeks to improve the way Congress and the executive branch consider and impose unilateral economic sanctions on other countries and entities. There has been a dramatic rise in the number and variety of U.S. economic sanctions directed against other countries to achieve one or more foreign policy goals. More often than not they have not been successful. Despite this record, we continue to impose one new unilateral sanction after another. We typically do so without careful analysis of their effects on our interests and our values. 
Because of this, I believe it is time we engage in a serious debate on the merits of using unilateral economic sanctions to accomplish foreign policy goals. That is the purpose of this amendment. My amendment is a modification of Senate bill S. 1413, the `Enhancement of Trade, Security, and Human Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act', or simply the Sanctions Policy Reform Act, which we introduced last November. The companion bill was introduced in the House at the same time. There are now 36 Senate cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. 
Let me take a moment to note some of the important changes from Senate bill 1413 that are now in my proposed amendment. These changes were included to reflect discussions with the administration, with legal counsel of the Senate, with our colleagues in the House, and with others. First, we clarify in the amendment that our general sanctions guidelines, procedural requirements, analytical reports and sunset provisions pertain only to future sanctions. I underline that point. This amendment deals only with the future. It is not an amendment about sanctions past or sanctions present. We are talking about sanctions in the future and only unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States alone. 
Our bill is totally prospective. We have eased some of the public notification requirements about the proposed new sanctions. We do not want the President to inadvertently alert a country targeted for sanctions to take steps to avoid our sanctions before they are imposed. If a country knows in advance that we intend to impose an asset freeze, for example, it would initiate moves to conceal, shift, or otherwise avoid our sanctions, thereby undermining their effectiveness. 
We have strengthened the language in the bill against the use of food, medicine, and medical equipment as a tool of American foreign policy. As a guideline, we believe food should never be used this way except in cases of war or a threat to the security of the United States. We have also included language in the bill that permits a slowing down of the process in the Congress to help guarantee that information about proposed new sanctions is available to the Members prior to their voting on the floor. 
There are other minor changes in reporting requirements and procedures. 
The fundamental purpose of my amendment is to promote good governance through thoughtful deliberation on those proposals involving unilateral economic sanctions directed against other countries. My amendment lays out a set of guidelines and requirements for a careful and deliberative process in both branches of Government when considering new unilateral sanctions. It does not preclude the use of economic sanctions, nor does it change those sanctions already in force. It is based on the basic principle that if we improve the quality of our policy process and our public discourse, we can improve the quality of the policy itself. 
This principle is familiar to us all. James Madison wrote eloquently in the Federalist Papers on the merits of slowing down the legislative process on important matters in order to achieve more careful, thoughtful deliberation and avoid the passions of the moment. This amendment is consistent with Madison's view. When we introduced Senate bill 1413 last fall, we did so because we believed that unilateral economic sanctions, when used as a tool of foreign policy, rarely achieved their goal, and frequently harmed the United States more than the target country against whom they were aimed. 
The imposition of unilateral sanctions may help create a sense of urgency to help resolve a problem, but it often creates new problems, many of which may be unintended. In some cases, unilateral sanctions may be counterproductive to our interests. 
Over the past several years, there has been a growing interest in the practice of unilateral economic sanctions as a tool of American foreign policy. Numerous studies have been conducted by think tanks, trade groups, the business communities, the U.S. Government, and foreign governments. These studies reached similar conclusions that unilateral economic sanctions that are utilized to achieve foreign policy objectives rarely succeed in doing so. 
They further conclude that unilateral economic sanctions seldom help those we seek to assist, that they often penalize the United States more than the target country, and that they may weaken our international competitiveness and our economic security. The studies also show that unilateral economic sanctions have increasingly become a foreign policy of first choice, even when other policy alternatives exist. 
Because of these studies, data on the use of sanctions are becoming familiar. According to Under Secretary of State, Eisenstat in testimony before the House International Relations Committee, the United States has applied sanctions 115 times since World War I and 104 times since the end of World War II. Nearly one third of the sanctions applied over the last 80 years have been imposed in just the past 4 years. 
There are now dozens of new proposals before the Congress that would tighten or impose sanctions on one or more countries, many of whom are our friends or our allies. There are other sanctions pending at the State and local level directed at nearly 20 countries. 
The 1997 Report of the President's Export Council on U.S. Unilateral Economic Sanctions, for example, cited 75 countries representing more than half the world's population, that have been subject to or threatened by U.S. unilateral sanctions. The application of new sanctions in the past 2 years have increased this global percentage to nearly 70 percent of the world's population affected or threatened by one or more U.S. sanctions. 
These sanctions are not cost-free. They are easy to impose because they appear to be cost-free and are almost always preferable to the use of force or to doing nothing, but they have many unintended victims--the poor in the target countries, American companies, American labor, American consumers, and, quite frankly, American foreign policy. 
One cost estimate put the income loss to the American economy from economic sanctions at between $15 billion and $19 billion, while impacting more than 150,000 jobs in 1995 alone. Magnify this overtime, and the economic and foreign policy costs to the United States become enormous. These sanctions weaken our international competitiveness, lower our global market share, abandon our established markets to others and jeopardize billions in export earnings--the key to our economic growth. They may also impair our ability to provide humanitarian assistance. They sometimes anger our friends and call our international leadership into question. 
Someone compared the use of unilateral economic sanctions in foreign policy to the use of carpet bombing in warfare. He noted that both tactics are indiscriminate and fail to distinguish between innocent and guilty victims. Those who are well-off financially, entrenched politically, or responsible for foreign policy actions we oppose, are those who tend to be least affected by unilateral sanctions. The point is that unilateral sanctions are blunt instruments of foreign policy that are too readily employed against foreign targets, even when other persuasive instruments of foreign policy may be available. 
The statute regulating our actions against India's and Pakistan's behavior, for example, is unusually inflexible and limits our options to develop solutions that work in South Asia. Our punitive sanctions, however meritorious they may be, do not help us achieve cooperation with either country in coping with regional and global problems; nor do they promote essential American goals of democracy, human rights, religious freedom, or other values we would like to see in both countries. Indeed, these particular sanctions could inadvertently serve to destabilize an already unsteady situation in Pakistan--a nuclear Pakistan--which would not be in anybody's interest. 
Mr. President, my amendment does not prohibit sanctions. There will always be situations in which the actions of other countries are so outrageous or so threatening to the United States that some response by the United States, short of the use of military force, is needed and justified. In these instances, sanctions can be helpful in getting the attention of another country, in showing U.S. determination to change behaviors we find objectionable, or in stimulating a search for creative solutions to difficult foreign policy problems. 
Indeed, many unilateral sanctions are intended to achieve very laudable foreign policy goals--human rights improvements, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stemming the flow of international narcotics, countering terrorism, prohibiting child labor, and others. These goals are worthy foreign policy objectives. Unfortunately, unilateral economic sanctions are not effective tools for advancing these objectives or our interests. They may, in some cases, undermine them. In the end, they typically inflict punishment on the American people or on the most vulnerable populations in the country against whom the sanctions are directed. 
Mr. President, if we use unilateral economic sanctions to advance our foreign policy, we must be more sparing in their use, we must improve the process by which we consider international sanctions, and find ways to increase their effectiveness once they are implemented. 
My amendment proposes to do that by improving the way we consider unilateral sanctions in both branches of the government. It is a modest amendment. It applies to a very limited class of sanctions which are unilateral in scope and which are intended to accomplish one or more foreign policy objectives. 
My amendment excludes those trade remedies and other trade sanctions imposed because of market access restrictions, unfair trade practices and violations of U.S. commercial or trade laws. It excludes those multilateral sanctions regimes in which the U.S. participates, when other participating countries are imposing substantially equivalent sanctions and taking their burden. Our legislation is prospective and would not change, amend or eliminate existing U.S. sanctions, although I believe they should be reviewed as well. The Sanctions Task Force set up by the Senate leadership is undertaking that 
review. Finally, the amendment does not pertain to state and local sanctions intended to achieve foreign policy goals. It deals simply with those of the Federal Government. 
To help achieve a more deliberative policy process, the bill establishes procedural guidelines and informational requirements before unilateral economic sanctions are considered by the Congress or the President. My amendment provides that any unilateral economic sanction proposed in the Congress or by the President should conform to certain guidelines. These should include: 
clearly defined foreign policy or national security goals; 
contract sanctity; 
Presidential authority to adjust or waive the sanctions if he determines it is in the national interest to do so; 
narrowly targeted sanction on the offending party or parties; 
expand export promotion if our sanctions adversely affect a major export market of American farmers; 
efforts to minimize the negative impact on humanitarian activities in targeted countries; and 
a sunset provision to terminate new sanctions 2 years after they are imposed, unless reauthorized. 
The amendment includes provisions to fully inform members of the proposed sanctions and requires new sanctions be consistent with these guidelines. It also mandates that all proposed new unilateral sanctions include reports from the President which assess the following: 
the likelihood that the proposed sanctions will achieve the stated foreign policy objective; 
the impact of the sanctions on humanitarian activities in affected countries; 
the likely effects on our friends and allies and on related national security and foreign policy interests; 
any diplomatic steps already undertaken to achieve the specified foreign policy goals; 
the prospects for multilateral cooperation and comparable efforts, if any, by other countries to impose sanctions; against target country; 
prospects for retaliation against the U.S. and against our agriculture interests; 
an assessment as to whether the benefits of achieving the stated foreign policy goals outweigh any likely foreign policy, national security or economic costs to the U.S.; and 
a report on the effects the sanctions are likely to have on the U.S. agricultural exports and on the reputation of U.S. farmers as reliable suppliers. 
I include that section, Mr. President, because agricultural exports are usually the first hit in retaliation. This is the area in which our Nation does best and has, by far, the largest surplus. Therefore, this is of special importance to the American agricultural producers that are the focus of our attention today in this appropriations bill. 
A separate section includes similar analytical requirements for any new sanctions the President considers. These include those sanctions imposed by executive order under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). these requirements must be shared with the Congress before imposing new sanctions. However, the bill allows the President to waive most of these requirements if he must act swiftly and if the challenge we confront is an emergency. The requirements on the President are as rigorous as those on the congress. 
FInally, my amendment establishes an inter-agency Sanctions Review Committee to include all relevant agencies in the executive branch in order to coordinate U.S. policy on sanctions. 
If unilateral sanctions are approved and implemented, the amendment requires annual reporting on their economic costs and benefits to the United State and any progress they are having on achieving the stated foreign policy goals. 
There would also be a sunset provision in each new sanction that would terminate new sanctions after two years unless they are re-authorized by the Congress or the President. 
The agriculture provision merits special comment because it singles out American farmers and ranchers whose exports are especially vulnerable to retaliation and whose products are most easily substituted by foreign competitors. American agriculture is heavily dependent on exports. 
About a third of all of our sales from the farms of this country are in the export trade. 
Last year, American agriculture contributed a net $22 billion surplus to our balance of trade, more than any other sector. Economic sanctions can have a serious long-term adverse impact on American agriculture. My amendment provides authority to compensate for lost exports through agriculture export assistance permitted under current statutes and agreements. No new appropriations would be required. 
To protect American agriculture, my amendment defines humanitarian assistance to include all food aid provided by the Department of Agriculture for the purchase or provision of food or other agricultural commodities. As such they would be exempt from sanctions other than in response to national security threats, where multilateral sanctions are in place, or if we are engaged in an armed conflict. 
I have focused many of my remarks on the economic and trade consequences of unilateral sanctions because they are more easily measured. But, the use of sanctions also raises a fundamental question about the effects of unilateral sanctions on the conduct of American foreign policy. Can we further our national interests and promote our values as a nation through the use of unilateral sanctions which distance ourselves from the challenges we face, or can we better accomplish our purposes by staying engaged in the world and keeping our options open to solutions? The answer is not always black and white because sanctions can sometimes be an appropriate foreign policy tool. 
On balance, I believe American interests are better advanced through engagement and active leadership that afford us an opportunity to influence events that threaten our interests. 
In some cases, unilateral sanctions restrict our ability to take advantage of changes in other countries because trade embargoes impose a heavy bias against dialogue and exchange. Unilateral sanctions may create tensions with friends and allies--including democratic countries--that jeopardize cooperation in achieving other foreign policy and priorities, including multilateral cooperation on the sanctions themselves. 
U.S. leadership and American values are better promoted through our presence abroad, the knowledge we share and impart, and the contacts we 
make and sustain. Many countries want to be exposed to our values and ideas if they are not imposed. The lessons of the free market and democratic values are learned more easily when they are experienced first hand, not as abstractions from a distance and not behind artificial barriers imposed by unilateral sanctions. 
Let me suggest a number of fundamental principles that I believe should shape our approach to unilateral economic sanctions: Unilateral economic sanctions should not be the policy of first resort. To the extent possible, other means of persuasion and influence ought to be exhausted first; 
If harm is to be done or is intended, we must follow the cardinal principle that we plan to harm our adversary more than we harm ourselves; when possible, multilateral economic sanctions and international cooperation are preferable to unilateral sanctions and are more likely to succeed, even though they may be more difficult to obtain; we should secure the cooperation of the major trading and investing countries as well as the principal frontline states if economic sanctions are to be successful; and we ought to avoid double standards and be as consistent as possible in the application of our sanctions policy. 
To the extent possible, we ought to avoid disproportionate harm to the civilian population. We should avoid the use of food as a weapon of foreign policy and we should permit humanitarian assistance programs to function; our foreign policy goals ought to be clear, specific and achievable within a reasonable period of time; we ought to keep to a minimum the adverse affects of our sanctions on our friends and allies; we should keep in mind that unilateral sanctions can cause adverse consequences that may be more problematic than the actions that prompted the sanctions--a regime collapse, a humanitarian disaster, a mass exodus of people, or more repression and isolation in the target country, for example; we should explore options for solving problems through dialogue, public diplomacy, and positive inducements or rewards; and the President of the United States should always have options that include both sticks and carrots that can be adjusted according to circumstance and nuance; the Congress should be vigilant by insuring that his options are consistent with Congressional intent and the law. 
In those cases where we cannot 
build multilateral cooperation and where our core interests or core values are at risk, we must, of course, consider acting unilaterally. Our actions must be part of an overall coherent and coordinated foreign policy that is coupled with diplomacy and consistent with our international obligations and objectives. We should have a reasonable expectation that our unilateral actions will not cause more collateral damage to ourselves or to our friends than the problem they are designed to correct. 
Mr. President, the United States should never abandon its leadership role in the world nor forsake the basic values we cherish in the pursuit of our foreign policy. We must ask, however, whether we are always able to change the actions of other countries whose behavior we find disagreeable or threatening. If we are able to influence those actions, we need to ponder how best to proceed. In my judgment, unilateral economic sanctions will not always be the best answer. But, if they are the answer, they should be structured so that they do as little harm as possible to ourselves and to our overall global interests. By improving upon our procedures and the quality and timeliness of our information when considering new sanctions, I believe we can make that possible. We should know about the cost and benefits of proposed new sanctions before we consider them. That is the intent of my amendment. 
I ask that all Members look closely at my amendment and hope you will agree that it is good governance amendment that will help improve the quality and conduct of American foreign policy. 
Mr. President, I will conclude by pointing out that a bipartisan sanctions task force has been appointed by the leadership of this body. That task force has met. I look forward to making a contribution to the work of that group. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier in the debate today, I visited with the presidents of the 50 farm bureaus in our country. I visited with them because they are concerned about the farm prices that we have been talking about, and I am concerned as well. Very clearly, the farm organizations of our country have a strong and clear agenda, to which I subscribe. They believe that we must pass fast track authority for the President, that we need reform of the IMF and replenish those funds, and that we must have sanctions reform. 
The American Farm Bureau has been a strong contributing member to the U.S.A. Engage movement, which now includes 675 American companies who are involved in exporting. The American Farm Bureau and these American companies are companies who say, first of all, that sanctions have to remain a part of our foreign policy apparatus; that unilateral sanctions, those imposed by ourselves, usually fail and usually cause more harm upon us than upon the target countries; that on occasion we may be so outraged that we may be prepared to accept that cost, understanding that the harm to our jobs and our income will be greater than that which we have fostered. But, Mr. President, the farmers of America and their organizations are crying out in this legislation for attention. 
I argued on the last amendment that our best policy in this country was to sell grain, to sell livestock--not to store it. I think that is the issue, Mr. President. But if we are to be credible with regard to the export side, farmers and farm groups are saying, `You must reform. You must do more.' And I agree with that. 
That is why I offered this amendment on the appropriations bill for agriculture, because it is a passionate cry by our farmers to take this concrete action to give some hope that their concerns are being addressed, that, in fact, we are going to move exports, and are going to do so because we are beginning to think more carefully here in this body about what we are doing. 
To reiterate the bidding, Mr. President, before unilateral sanctions alone are imposed, there has to be a purpose stated for why we are doing them. 
And criteria and benchmarks that would show the degree to which we have been successful in interim reports, and an assessment of the cost to American jobs and the lost income. I mentioned $20 billion of lost income in a year and 150,000 jobs. These are not inconsequential. Debates occur on this floor frequently over 100 jobs or 1,000 jobs. I am asking that to consider very carefully these cost implications before we adopt another unilateral sanction. And finally, I am saying that after 2 years there should be a sunset provision. The sanction ends at that point, unless it is authorized again by the Congress or by the President for valid foreign policy reasons. These sanctions go on forever. This amendment is prospective. It deals with the future. I hope the sanctions task force set up by the leadership will deal with the present and past sanctions. 
Mr. President, I ask for careful consideration by this body of my amendment. I am hopeful it will be a strong plank in this appropriations bill. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Clearly, the President, in the case of an emergency, has a right to impose whatever sanction he wants. There is no prohibition. Obviously, when national security is involved--and the national security situation is explicitly mentioned--I think that is important. But I ask the President to tidy things up. In other words, after imposing the sanction, he should state, if he has not already, the objectives and benchmarks and the cost to the American people of jobs and income. Some administration people have objected to the President playing by the same rules as the Congress. Nevertheless, the amendment is evenhanded. He has to fill it in. But he has emergency powers, of course.

Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, to answer the question posed, both the President and the Congress can reauthorize the action after two years. Additionally, they are constrained simply to explain how successful things have been and what their objectives were to begin with. But the law--at least my amendment--explicitly gives them the ability to reauthorize. They have to take that affirmative action.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, during this debate on the pending amendment, three arguments have been made. I want to respond to them briefly. One came about through Senators suggesting that the President of the United States, who just today proposed sanctions on certain firms in Russia and pertaining to Iranian missile transfers, would not have had the ability to impose those sanctions if the amendment that we are debating had been the law of the land. 
Later, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, after a careful reading of the legislation, noted that on page 30 of the amendment--this is the language: `The President may waive any of the requirements of subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)'--and so forth--in the event that the President determines there exists a national emergency that requires the exercise of the waiver. 
I made that point in an earlier presentation, but I simply wanted to reiterate there are emergency situations regarding the national security of this country. The President must have the ability to act. Our legislation expressly gives him that waiver ability. 
Then the distinguished Senator from Arizona raised the question as to whether, in fact, that waiver might be too broad. Perhaps. But, you cannot have it both ways. If on one hand you argue that the President of the United States is constricted in terms of what he may do, but then you find out he has full ability to do it, I suppose you could then argue that you do not want to have full ability at that point. 
Let me just offer a moment of reassurance. On the same page 30 of the amendment, there is a section setting up a Sanctions Review Committee in the executive branch. It reads: 
There is established within the executive branch of Government an inter-agency committee, which shall be known as the Sanctions Review Committee, which shall have the responsibility of coordinating United States policy regarding unilateral economic sanctions and of providing appropriate recommendations to the President prior to any decision regarding the implementation of a unilateral economic sanction. 
Now, that committee is composed of the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, the U.S. Trade Representative, and so forth. 
The point being that the President of the United States should be well advised before he decides on a unilateral waiver for even national emergency purposes. 
I suspect that this could be perfected further, but during the course of the debate on this legislation I simply note that many Members--and this is understandable--say this is very complex matter and we need more time to walk around it, try to think through the national security implications, the ability of the players to deal with this successfully. 
I point out, respectfully, that my original legislation on which this is based was introduced last October. This has been widely discussed in this city for many months. It is supported by 37 Senators explicitly who have thought through all the implications of this and have studied it at some length. 
Finally, Mr. President, I respond to the argument that the India and Pakistan incidents are the reason we are discussing this. As I recall, the distinguished Senator from Arizona pointed out we have resolved some of those problems and, therefore, it may be premature to move on to other problems. But, in fact, India and Pakistan had not gone through their nuclear testing regimes last October. 
The problem that has to come back to this body is that of the American farmers--the gist of the overall agriculture appropriation bill--need some hope that this body understands the effect of economic sanctions on agriculture. The USA*Engage group, composed of some 675 businesses, including the American Farm Bureau, have strongly encouraged this body to understand the problems faced by American business. 
I think the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, stated it well: American business is not a special interest. It is not a nefarious group of people with whom we should have no contact as we talk about national security or economic security. American business and American farmers provide the money that gives us the ability to provide security to this Nation. These are the people who actually are out there working and providing jobs. They are saying to us: You folks with all of your sanctions are creating unemployment for 200,000 Americans. That number of people are losing their jobs because of what is occurring in the sanctions regime. 
Of course, we have to be considerate of each and every aspect of making certain that national security is not compromised. It would be a stretch to think of many of these sanctions that have had a substantial national security implication to begin with. 
I suspect, finally, there has to be a balancing of interests in our country. Even as we are deeply concerned about democratic procedures in other countries, about religious procedures in other countries, about economic procedures in other countries, we ought to weigh and we ought to have a procedure in which we say we are going to impose a sanction on some country and take the time to state why, and then take time to say, `What would be considered a success? How would we know we have victory? What are the benchmarks of our success?' At least once a year, we should think about what the sanction did. Did it make any difference? Did it make a difference in American jobs and income that was totally disproportionate to whatever the impact might have been, in the target country? 
Now, that is what my amendment calls for--however you weave the argument around it, the need to state the purpose of what we are doing, the benchmarks of success, to examine periodically whether we have hit the mark even remotely, and, in any event, to estimate the cost of sanctions to Americans. It really is time to think about Americans, people in this country, farmers, producers, even as we are spinning wheels of economic sanctions for whatever economic purpose we might think of. 
From the beginning--and I think everyone has heard this clearly--we are talking about sanctions in the future, prospective sanctions. I hope Senators understand that. But that is the case. 
Secondly, we are talking about unilateral sanctions which we do ourselves that hurt us, that have no cooperation from others, with every other country grabbing our markets, entering in to eat our lunch. We have prescribed any number of ways in which people in this Congress and the administration have to think about it, and at the same time giving the President, as our Commander in Chief, the ability in terms of our security, to act if he must. 
Finally, we have said after 2 years the sanction comes to an end unless the Congress reauthorizes it. That is, take some more time to think about what has occurred, what the implications and the costs for Americans have been. 
I am hopeful this amendment will not be tabled. I regret that the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee feels he must do that at 6 o'clock, but I understand the expeditious procedure of this bill, and it is an important bill, has to go on. I hope Senators will vote against tabling the amendment when that time comes, about an hour from now, because I think that a vote against tabling sends a signal of hope to American farmers that we care, and we had better send that signal. 
I hope Senators understand that we have a difficult situation in American agriculture, not because of the farm bill but because demand from Asia is down and demand from other countries will be coming down as their income is constricted. We will need all of our weapons of trade in order to meet that, and the same eventually will occur to other industries. 
I stress agriculture today, Mr. President, because that is the first wave. That is where the first implications of economic downturn have come, with raw materials and food. But it will spread unless we are successful in adopting a new trade strategy that must surely include greater thoughtfulness about sanctions. 
Therefore, I call for a new regime of thoughtfulness--not a prohibition of sanctions, not a breach of international or national security, but a thoughtful approach, giving full latitude to the Commander in Chief and, hopefully, better latitude to us, to think through what we are doing and to do it more correctly and positively. 
I conclude by saying, as I recall, the distinguished Senator from Arizona was asking a hypothetical situation whether as to whether the President could act or not, I think I have answered the question that he could have acted on today's sanction. But let's say that the President acts, or the Congress acts; how do we know in advance that this is going to have any particular effect? The answer is that we don't. As a matter of fact, in most cases, the effect has been dismal, inappropriate, and costly to the United States and to our citizens. 
So I say that the President of the United States has the full ability to act, but whether he will act appropriately is another question. And that is why even the President is asked to consult with his Cabinet, and why we are asked to consult with each other--in the hope that if we do adopt a sanction, it will do some good, that it will have some wisdom behind it, some rationale and some procedure that the American people can follow. I submit, Mr. President, that many of the sanctions we have adopted have not had that wisdom, that procedure, and they have not had a very good effect. 
It is for this reason that I ask the support of Senators for this amendment and the support, particularly, on the vote to table. I am hopeful that that tabling motion will not be adopted when that moment comes. 
Mr. President, I thank all Senators for allowing us to have this full debate. I appreciate that there are many other issues that should come before the body. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to improve the effectiveness of the Wetland Reserve Program, or WRP. 
The WRP is a program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, or USDA, which purchases easements to restore and protect wetlands. These easements are purchased from landowners on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis. Under current law, land going into the WRP is enrolled for different time periods based on one of three types of contracts entered into between USDA and the landowner: (1) cost share contracts (which enroll land for ten years), (2) 30 year easements, and (3) permanent easements. Landowners have expressed more interest in longer term easements than in cost share contracts. However, current law requires USDA to enroll an equal proportion of each contract type (hence the so-called 1/3 , 1/3 , 1/3 rule), regardless of landowner interest. One part of the amendment which I am proposing would permit USDA to deviate from the 1/3 , 1/3 , 1/3 requirement based on landowner interest. Landowners would retain the ability to choose among permanent, non-permanent and cost-share agreements. 
Mr. President, the second part of my amendment would also amend the WRP. Under current law, landowners receive annual payments for land enrolled in the WRP, but, in the case of longer term easements, can elect to receive payments up-front in a lump sum. Annual payments, including those taken in a lump sum, are subject to a $50,000 per person limitation. However, permanent easements are exempt from the limitation. Exempting only permanent easements from the payment limitation tends to discourage landowners from choosing 30 year easements. This amendment solves the inequity by broadening the exemption to include 30 year easements. 
My amendment is strongly supported by the Audubon Society, Ducks Unlimited, and other conservation groups. It has been scored at no cost by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The amendment makes common-sense improvements to an important program which protects our natural resources. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to offer an amendment to make a technical correction to recently passed bill. This noncontroversial legislation serves to clarify two provisions of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. Senators Santorum, Collins, Harkin and Leahy are cosponsors of this amendment. 
The purpose of the amendment is twofold. First, under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research program in the northeastern United States, the amendment adds a requirement that the Governor of the State of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont make a request to the Secretary before any research is conducted under that particular program. Second, the assessment rate is amended from $0.0075 to $0.01 under the Honey Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act. 
Mr. President, both amendments make technical corrections. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, there has been a remarkable degree of bipartisan cooperation in moving this bill forward. I would like to thank Senator Biden, Senator Chafee, and Senator Leahy for their help in drafting the Senate bill, which is a companion to H.R. 2870, introduced by Representatives Portman, Kasich and Hamilton. I would also like to thank my twenty nine additional Senate cosponsors from both sides of the aisle for their important support. I would especially like to thank Senator Helms for cosponsoring the bill and moving it expeditiously through the Committee on Foreign Relations, which approved it by voice vote on May 19, 1998. 
Senator Biden and I have worked together on international environmental issues for many years. The original debt-for-nature bill was the Biden-Lugar Global Environmental Protection Assistance Act of 1989. This was followed by President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI), which also linked debt reduction and environmental protection in the developing nations of Latin America and the Caribbean.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the African Growth and Opportunity Act which has passed the House in March and is now before the Finance Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. I am the principal Senate sponsor of the bill which I introduced some fourteen months ago. There are ten co-sponsors. 
I introduced the Africa bill because I believe that our policy towards sub-Saharan Africa should be revised to reflect changing global and regional realities. For too long, our policy has been based on country-by-country aid relationships and devoid of any comprehensive strategy towards the continent. As important as our child survival, health, agriculture, educational and humanitarian programs have been, they have not promoted much economic development, political stability or self-reliance. Nor have they benefitted the American economy. For that reason, it is time to re-evaluate our policy. That is the purpose of the African bill. 
The African Growth and Opportunity Act is the first serious attempt to formulate a new American strategy towards Africa. It provides a general road map for expanding economic engagement and involvement in Africa through enhanced trade and investment. It seeks to establish the foundation for a more mature partnership with those countries in Africa undertaking serious economic and political reforms. 
I'm pleased to note that virtually all African Ambassadors have endorsed this bill. It has wide support in the American business community, non-governmental organizations, the African-American community, and the Administration. Indeed, President Clinton mentioned the bill in his State of the Union address in January and Secretary of State Albright included it in her list of the top four leadership challenges for l998. 
Let me summarize the bill. 
First, it urges the President to negotiate free trade agreements with African countries with the ultimate goal of a U.S.-Sub-Saharan Africa Free Trade Area. The President will need Fast Track authority to negotiate this and other free trade measures and I strongly support that effort as well. 
The bill establishes a US-Africa Economic Cooperation Forum to facilitate senior level discussions on trade and investment. No such dialogue now exists and there exists no long term agenda involving the private sectors here and in Africa. Doing business in Africa will require high-level dialogue and this Forum will signal to the investment and trading communities that we take Africa seriously. 
Africa lacks the infrastructure needed to promote and sustain economic growth and development. The bill establishes two privately-managed funds to leverage private financing for small and medium sized companies. The two funds would operate under OPIC guidelines and require no official USG appropriations. One is a $150 million equity fund, the other a $500 million infrastructure fund. Given the enormity of the needs, these are modest sized funds. 
Each of these initiatives will take time to mature. They have worked in other parts of the world. 
The initiatives in the bill that would bring more immediate economic benefits to Africa and the United States would provide greater access to our markets for African exports. The bill authorizes the President to grant duty-free treatment for products now excluded from the GSP program--subject to a sensitivity analysis by the International Trade Commission. It extends the GSP program to Africa for 10 years, which is important for business planning and predictability. 
The bill also eliminates quotas 
on textiles and apparel from Kenya and Mauritius, the two countries in sub-Saharan Africa which do not have quota-free access to the United States. They would receive this status only after adopting a visa system to guard against illegal transhipment of goods. Since global textile quotas are scheduled to disappear in the year 2005 under terms of the GATT, our bill merely gives Africa a small head start in a more competitive textile market of the future. 
Some have argued that granting quota-free and duty-free access to American markets will weaken our domestic textile industries. If that were true, I would not be advocating this provision. African imports of textiles and apparel now account for less than one percent of our total textile imports. The International Trade Commission looked at this issue and concluded that enactment of our bill would increase U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from Africa to between one and two percent of our total textile and apparel imports, a negligible impact. 
While this amount is small in terms of our overall textile and apparel imports, it can have sizable benefits for Africa. The lower costs of African textiles will also benefit American retailers and American consumers. 
Warnings about the illegal transhipment of Asian-origin garments through Africa, under liberalized arrangements, are false alarms. The House strengthened these safeguards substantially during its consideration of the bill. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that we have an historic opportunity to help integrate African countries into the world economy and to wind down our excessive dependency on public assistance as the signature of our ties with Africa. Africa is one of the last frontiers of untapped markets in the world. There are nearly 700 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, 33 of the world's forty-eight least developed countries are in Africa. Despite this, prospects for enhanced trade and investment are bright. Our exports now are twenty percent greater than to all the states of the former Soviet Union combined. Economic growth in Africa will create new markets and new opportunities for U.S. goods but that won't happen if we don't act to make it happen. 
We now have an opportunity to help strengthen civil societies and political institutions and to assist African societies on the path to greater self-reliance, economic growth and political stability. Nearly thirty countries in the region have conducted democratic elections. 
Private investment tends to follow good governance and economic reform but the private sector takes cues from government policies and involvement. It is very much in our interest to play a constructive role in the evolving political and economic transition in Africa. 
That transition is taking place and must continue. If we had ignored Taiwan and Korea in the l960s when they were at stages of economic development comparable to many African societies today, we would have missed enormous opportunities in East Asia. Years from now, I hope we can look back and be able to say that we were there at a crucial juncture in Africa's growth and development, that we played a constructive role in that change and that we did the right thing at the right time. 
Mr. President, if the United States is a major player, a pro-active player in Africa's economic and political development, we will also be a major beneficiary. 
I'm pleased the Finance Committee will be marking up the African bill later this month. I hope this bill will be brought to the floor as soon as possible for full Senate consideration. 
I urge all members to take a close look at the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, look at the mutual long-term benefits it brings to Africa and to our country and support this important bill when it reaches the floor.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my thanks to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. I appreciate his leadership, that of Senator Biden, and likewise the role of Senator Lott and Senator Daschle in appointing this important task force. 
I am eager to speak today as an original sponsor of the legislation before the Senate. This bill is appropriate and a good first step toward comprehensive review of economic sanctions that is sorely needed for our Nation's economic security. 
First, the legislation is timely. Executive agencies have debated whether the Agriculture Department's export credit guarantees for Pakistan should be included in the Glenn Amendment prohibitions, or not. The Justice Department concluded the law did prohibit these guarantees. 
In fiscal year 1997, Pakistan bought $347 million worth of U.S. wheat with USDA's export credit guarantees. In fiscal year 1998, Pakistan was allocated $250 million in export credit guarantees and has used $162 million of that amount, all for wheat. 
On July 15, Pakistan will hold a tender for 350,000 metric tons of wheat. Without export credit guarantees, the United States will get none of that business. That will mean the loss of about $37 million in foreign exchange earnings. 
The Pakistani government will not draw any lessons from our lack of participation, except that the U.S. has chosen to cede another market to its competitors. Other grain exporters are participating in the tender and will make the sales if we do not. Only our farmers will suffer. Quick action by the Congress, however, can resolve the short-term problem. 
Second, the legislation is appropriate. Food should not be a weapon in foreign policy. The history of unilateral agricultural sanctions over several decades adequately demonstrates their futility. 
When sanctions are unduly rigid and automatic, they become a roadblock to prudent diplomacy. This is a much more serious issue. In fact, sanctions tend to harm our industries and hamper our foreign policy more than they advance their stated goals. 
Mr. President, rarely did we state our goals when we adopted any of the 61 sanctions that are now on the books; nor have we established benchmarks that show whether these sanctions have been successful. Obviously, our policy was not successful with regard to the sanctions we are discussing today. Unilateral sanctions rarely accomplish their objectives in the absence of multilateral cooperation. In fact, scholarship on this subject is replete with almost no instance in which unilateral U.S. sanctions have achieved their intended goals, even when the goals were implicit as opposed to being explicit. 
Finally, the legislation is a good first step. This Senate needs a broad debate on economic sanctions and their consequences. The majority and minority leaders have shown strong leadership in naming a bipartisan task force to consider sanctions policy. 
The fact that we need to pass this legislation on an emergency basis only illustrates the need for a more comprehensive legislative approach. We need to think through the consequences of unilateral, inflexible sanctions before they are imposed, not after. 
In the near future, I will offer a modified version of my bill, S. 1413, for the Senate's consideration. That legislation will establish a framework for the consideration and review of future sanctions, and will broadly exempt food and humanitarian assistance. 
I look forward to working closely with the task force headed by Senator McConnell and Senator Biden. I appreciate that we must examine not only prospective views on any legislation suggested but likewise retrospective views and those of our Chief Executive and Secretary of State. 
For the moment, we need to pass the bill before us. I commend those who brought this important legislation to the floor today. 
Mr. President, we will also need to think carefully, as other Senators have suggested, about the overall agriculture situation in our country. As a general rule we ought to be thinking about how we make the sale and move the grain, not about how we store the grain and dismember the farm bill. 
Congress should grant the President fast track trade negotiating authority. We must have this in order to successfully move our grain to the rest of the world this year, next year, and for many years to come. Fast track is essential for the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations that will be paramount next year. We must also act on International Monetary Fund (IMF) replenishment. This is critical to having any chance of regaining Asian demand. Right now, prices are down because demand is down. It is as clear as that. 
Finally, we must have broad sanctions reform. Sanctions inhibit us and cost American jobs and American sales. 
For all of these reasons, Mr. President, this is an important moment, an important bill, and I strongly support its passage.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Senator Coats and I have shared with you this year our strong support for $2 million through the HUD Economic Development Initiative Account for the Midwest Proton Radiation Institute (MPRI). The MPRI is an important economic development and cancer treatment initiative at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. This is an important effort for the University, the City of Bloomington, and the State of Indiana. Funding for this project was not included as one of the 87 projects listed for this account in S. Rept. 105-216. The MPRI project--like several science-related projects slated to receive funding as listed in S. Rept. 105-216--is beneficial from an economic development perspective as well as in the area of health sciences research and cancer treatment. This is our only project request from the VA-HUD Subcommittee this year. As you move forward with consideration of the final VA-HUD Appropriations bill, I hope you will give consideration to including funds for this valuable and worthwhile economic development project of importance to my State.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to recall that fifteen years ago, the U.S. Congress and the Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany resolved to establish and co-sponsor the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX). This decision was in recognition of the long-standing ties of friendship between the peoples of Germany and the United States, in particular the special sense of partnership that existed, and still exists, between our two legislatures, and the importance of continuing to build and strengthen that relationship. 
Our common aim was to make a lasting and substantial contribution to the peace of the world by making it possible for young people from our two countries, regardless of their means, to spend a school year abroad, learning about the other country's culture and way of life through extended first-hand experience. We recognized then, and we should reaffirm now, that this kind and quality of people-to-people exchange is crucial to building and maintaining understanding between nations. 
Since June of 1983, over 11,000 young people from Germany and the U.S. have participated in this exchange. Perhaps more importantly, German and American families have hosted these 11,000 participants, taking them into their homes and communities, forming enduring friendships, and nurturing their ability to see the world through another's eyes. The earliest of these participants are mature adults now, many of them assuming positions of leadership in their communities, their horizons forever broadened in their youth by their experience in the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange. 
Citizens like these are the foundation upon which the close partnership between Germany and the U.S. ultimately rests. As we look forward to even greater unity among the nations of a Europe that will soon include countries once separated by the Iron Curtain and we recognize the leading role that Germany plays in that process, the importance of this partnership is abundantly clear. The success of the CBYX program over the past fifteen years forms one of the essential elements of this bond, and we should do whatever we can to ensure the program's future. 
Threfore, on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of this remarkable program, I extend very special greetings on behalf of the United States Senate to our fellow legislators in the German Bundestag. I sincerely hope that the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program continues to strengthen the deep ties of friendship and understanding between our two peoples.

Mr. LUGAR. I acknowledge the importance of warehousemen under the current tobacco program and that some of those warehousemen may be adversely affected when the current program is eliminated. That is why I have made it clear in my amendment that warehousemen may be considered as recipients of some of the $1 billion in economic assistance grants to states. I believe that it will be important for state and local governments to determine the level of assistance to individual warehousemen in their localities. Local officials will be better able to assess the economic impact on individual warehousemen and can make adequate compensation accordingly.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to support a program that will end tobacco subsidies, give fair compensation to farmers now rather than many years from now, make an extra $10 billion available for public health and other worthy purposes, and provide some degree of certainty for tobacco farmers, for agricultural America, with regard to our policies that would pertain with greater fairness to all farmers. 
Let me simply cite, at the outset my discussion of these issues, what I perceive to be the significant differences between the Lugar amendment, which I favor and which the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky has chosen through his amendment now to strike from the bill, and, in fact, the amendment provided by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and others who have supported their point of view. 
The basic differences come down to, first of all, should the U.S. Government support tobacco? That is a very fundamental issue. The debate, which now is in its third week on this subject, suggests that the American people are not prepared for their Federal Government to support a crop, a set of products, which they find injurious to health. Indeed, much of our debate has been about how we can protect the health of children, how we can pay for the difficulties in health that citizens of all ages have experienced. 
If it were not for these health issues which are serious for tens of millions of Americans and prospectively for many more, this debate would not be so intense; clearly, the remedy suggested would not be so severe. It really begs understanding of this issue as to how the same government that may legislate severely with regard to tobacco, could at the same time decide to support the price of tobacco, to support the industry, the warehousing, the infrastructure, as the current tobacco program does and has done for almost six decades. 
That is the first issue. Do we want the U.S. Government to support tobacco? And my judgment is we should not support tobacco. The legislation that I have suggested does not give prioritization to tobacco. Rather, it says that tobacco, so long as it is a legal crop, can be produced in America on the same terms as corn, wheat, soybeans, same freedom to farm that all other farmers have, same tests of the market, same tests of efficiency, of production. 
That, it seems to me, is the only way this can be rationalized, with those in agricultural America asking, Why special treatment for tobacco? Why specific situations that support that price, to support those farmers? There is no good answer to that. I understand the constituency problems of the distinguished Senators who have many tobacco farmers, and I am certainly mindful of approximately 10,000 farms in Indiana, albeit smaller ones than in Kentucky and in North Carolina and some other States, but nevertheless tobacco farmers who are impacted significantly by this debate. I have visited with them extensively. They support my amendment for good reason. 
Why would they support my amendment if I am prepared to say 
the Federal Government ought not to support tobacco? They do so because the Lugar amendment provides payment to those who hold tobacco quota, the certificates distributed principally in the 1930s, that allow people in this country to produce tobacco. We are prepared in my amendment to purchase those rights in a 3-year period of time. 
My amendment is attractive because the money comes to the tobacco farmers, but even more importantly, to the holders of quota certificates who are frequently elderly people, people no longer involved in production. They lease and rent the certificates to others. They really have no desire to continue in the tobacco business. On a one-time basis they can receive capital for pensions, for scholarships, money in the communities that are impacted--substantial money--and they can receive it quickly in a 3-year period of time. That is why tobacco growers in most States have indicated through their organizations that they support the Lugar approach. 
The Senate as a whole has to ask which of the two approaches, the Ford-Hollings or the Lugar approach, costs more. Clearly, the Ford-Hollings costs at least $10 billion more than the Lugar approach. It has a great deal more in it in terms of community development for States and localities that have tobacco farmers over the years. It is simply a very different approach which retains the tobacco program and some of the apparatus that has been associated with it over the years. 
I make that point because in the course of these remarks the statement has been made that somehow or other the Lugar approach will subtract money from health causes or other important objectives of the legislation, but in fact it will subtract $10 billion less than the Ford-Hollings amendment. There is no getting around that. 
I simply say, finally, that to argue--I believe almost disingenuously--that health groups would prefer a situation where $10 billion less is left in the general fund of this bill for health or anything else is to, I suppose, deny common sense. Many health groups perhaps were misled by the thought that in the event we went to freedom-to-farm tobacco, the price of tobacco would go down. The price of tobacco probably will go down. 
We have had testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee and we have had extensive hearings, as a matter of fact, on tobacco issues from which the Lugar amendment came. Essentially, the testimony was that the price of tobacco might fall by as much as 25 percent, perhaps more, depending upon how competitive American tobacco is in the world markets, and competitive abilities have been in decline. Most Americans are not aware that 40 percent of the tobacco now used in the production of American cigarettes comes from abroad, not from here. It comes from abroad because of questions of price and quality, 
normal economic questions. That deterioration of the American tobacco demand has been continuing at a fairly rapid pace. 
So, Mr. President, let me just state it fairly simply. If a pack of cigarettes now costs $2 before this bill, it will cost a great deal more after this bill. Approximately 6 cents of that $2 might be attributed to the tobacco in the package. If in fact that goes down by a quarter, maybe a cent or a cent and a half is at stake. To suggest that somehow this brings either unconscionable profits to tobacco companies or enormous new demands by young people taking up smoking is, I think, to defy both economics and logic in the midst of our raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by at least $1 or $2, or whatever the bill finally comes out to be with the overhead and all the economic costs associated. 
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, health groups for a long time have centered in on the fundamental issue I began with: Should the Federal Government be supporting tobacco at all? What kind of a signal does that give when we give official sponsorship and economic support to the price and warehousing and infrastructure of tobacco? I don't think the signal is very good. As a matter of fact, it is so ambiguous that it borders upon hypocrisy. At some stage, we will have to make a choice as to which of these two general thrusts in life we are for--health or support of tobacco. 
Mr. President, let me just say, finally, that we are going to have to come to grips with the issue that is posed by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky in his striking of my amendment. I appreciate that. The parliamentary situation is that the Ford-Hollings approach and the Lugar approach are both in the bill. I suggested that one or the other of us might, at some point in this debate, move to strike the other, and the Senator from Kentucky, my good friend, has decided he would move to strike my situation. 
So that is the issue before us. Members have to make a choice. I simply say to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, who is on the floor, that it would not be my purpose to delay the choice. My feeling is, essentially, by this time, if Members are not aware of the issues, they never will be. My feeling is that we ought to get on with it and resolve it. I stated up front that this will not be a long speech and, if there are not many more, we might come to a conclusion. 
Let me say that in defense of what we have been doing in the Agriculture Committee, in my own point of view, I rise to affirmatively support the Lugar approach, which has been moved by the Senator from Kentucky to be stricken. I believe that it is important to adopt my approach, to keep it alive by voting `no' on the motion to strike, because we will end tobacco subsidies, we will end the tobacco program. 
Mr. President, to be quite frank, this is the major point that I make, the reason I am in this debate. I believe that agricultural policy ought to be based upon supply and demand. I believe that all farmers producing crops in this country ought to be treated equally. We had a revolution in agriculture in 1996 in which we said freedom to farm means that a farmer may decide to plant whatever he or she wants to plant on their land, have full control of that, without the Federal Government dictating how many pounds, how many acres, how many bushels. The only signals would be market signals, and they are now world market signals. They are important to America because agriculture is the thing we do best, and our surplus and balance of trade is the greatest in that area. 
But freedom to farm also means taking risks. It means there is no warehouse for wheat, or for corn, or for soybeans, no props, no passing on from one generation to the next the right to grow corn or wheat. We really have to get over that, Mr. President. I understand why it came about in the 1930s because essentially people felt that if you let farmers have freedom, they would inevitably plant too much, they would do too much, they would be too ingenious, and, as a result, supplies would be horrendous, prices would fall, agricultural communities would fail. The New 
Deal policy was one of killing little pigs, knocking out rows of corn, to dramatically change the supply and to bring the price up. Whatever may have been the rationalization in those days, it was convenient to carry this on for about six more decades. 
Many people in America would still like the idea of being guaranteed a price for a bushel of whatever they are producing. They would like to be guaranteed that their neighbor could not do more. But at the same time, most farmers in agricultural America resent the Federal Government's control. They resent the fly-overs, the measurement of fields, the endless sign-ups--and rightly so. So we came to a revolution of sorts, Mr. President, and we went to freedom to farm, except in the area of tobacco, for example, where persons in that industry said that, `Notwithstanding everything else going on in agricultural America, we want to retain the same program we have had.' 
Now, Mr. President, my own view is that the program is deteriorating. I am not one who would predict the month, the year, or even the decade where it will finally collapse. I just say that tobacco farmers coming to my office from my State, and also from Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, and from South Carolina, I have said during the past year, although we had quota and the right to produce tobacco and to sell it and to have a price, we were cut back 10 percent in what we could do. Furthermore, they believe they are going to be cut back 15 percent this coming year regardless of what we do on this bill. That is a big cut. That is a deteriorating program. No wonder they were attracted by my thought that they might receive $8 per pound for quota, so many of them could get out of the business altogether. Now, a good number said they want to stay in the business, but they realize they are going to have to do so on the basis of supply and demand. That is the way the world works--without all the apparatus, the warehousemen, and so forth. That is fair enough. 
My bill provides that you continue right on producing, if you want to, and take money for quota, if you had it. If you are renting, fair enough, you have a transition of 3 years with some payments in support, the same as do corn farmers, wheat farmers, rice and cotton farmers, in the freedom to farm bill. It is a transition period. I think that is important, Mr. President. But at least we bring to an end an era that, I think, is coming to an end anyway. 
Now, what if we don't pass the tobacco bill? What if, in fact, the idea of the Senator from Kentucky, or mine--either one--is not a part of the final picture? That is a real problem for tobacco farmers. It is a problem that should have been contemplated by the attorneys general when they were working this situation out last year. But, as a matter of fact, at that time they left the whole grower issue aside. That is why we had hearings in the Agriculture Committee and why Senator Ford and others have been working in the Commerce Committee--to say, what do we do about this very important group of people; namely, growers, holders of quota, holders of equity property out there in at least 10 States in substantial numbers? 
Now, Mr. President, my guess is that one or the other of our amendments may prevail, but I am not confident of that. It could very well be that the Senate will decide they don't want either one. It could be that if we argue this long enough, people will begin to raise questions. What is an acre of tobacco worth? In some cases, 10 times what an acre of corn might be worth on this same farm, as is the case in my home State of Indiana. 
One reason is because it is a very special privilege. And as Americans take a look at this, they won't like what they have to see. 
In the Agriculture Committee for years, I witnessed--at least during the 21-plus years that I have been a member of the committee--people protecting each other. There were a lot of special deals. People got on the committee often to make certain they protected their deal and their farmers in their State. I understand that. Most did a good job of it. Now there are fewer special deals. There really is a very short list of situations that need to be tidied up, and this is one of them. 
So I come, Mr. President, to the floor to suggest that this is a good time, while there is a general settlement going on, money on the table, lots of money. The question has been raised, Does the grower money subtract from health? No. The Senate doesn't want to subtract. They simply provided any sequence of years we wanted. But when Members come to the floor and they talk about $300 billion, $400 billion, $500 billion, $600 billion, the $18 billion I am talking about in the Lugar bill is a very small part of that money. If people are worried about whether it comes upfront, my advice would be to provide money upfront. If you want to provide more money for health at the same time, do it. This bill is as fluid as any piece of legislation I have ever seen. Nothing is engraved in stone as to which dollar comes where. 
All I am saying is if you are serious about tobacco farmers and their plight, you give them their money upfront. You do it promptly, and those that want to leave, leave. Those that want to stay, stay, and react like farmers in almost any other sphere, including sometime the same farmers are producing corn as well as tobacco on the same farm. 
Mr. President, that is the first big issue: The end of the tobacco program, the end of official U.S. Government sponsorship of all of this. 
Let me say, secondly, that my plan costs less. One could argue that in the course of all of this we have bandied about these hundreds of billions of dollars that perhaps we have lost track altogether as to how money is going to be spent. But I hope not. If there are any Members who are interested in cost, they will vote for an $18 billion bill, the Lugar bill, as opposed to a $28 billion Ford bill. 
In addition, I am advised that the bill of the Senator from Kentucky now includes special relief for problems in North Dakota, or perhaps other States that have been afflicted by unusual weather problems. I am hopeful that in the course of the debate all of that will be explained. But it is another unusual addition to an already belabored situation. 
All I am saying is that if you are interested in cost, you will be for the Lugar alternative. It is less. Obviously, Mr. President, the money gets to the tobacco farmers sooner. If you are a tobacco farmer, the Lugar bill gets money to you more rapidly. Time is money--money upfront, money that could be used for capital for other farming, for pension, for scholarships, for other things that people have a quota for, or who are farmers where that quota can be utilized, and I think that is an important issue. 
Finally, let's be very clear on the health issues. I go back over that again. 
The fact is that the health groups of the United States--major proponents of this legislation--have analyzed these bills, and some have come out one way and some another. But I would just say simply that the money for health is finally going to be the determination of this Senate in this bill in whatever amounts that we want to provide for. 
Some have accused the President of the United States for asking for a number of things in the health area. He cited some in the State of the Union Address, and on this side of the aisle many of us have said we ought not to be funding the State of the Union Address in the tobacco bill. But having said that, we are funding 
a good number of proposals that the President or the administration and its various Secretaries have made at some point. We do so because the problems of health attributed to tobacco have badly afflicted tens of millions of Americans. These problems have created enormous public costs in the Medicare Program, Medicaid, and various other ways, and compounded black lung disease and other difficult health problems in our country. 
Mr. President, the logic has been that if we are going to have a tobacco bill, there ought to be some compensation to States. In fact, some States have not waited for compensation. Lawsuits have been proposed and some have been successful. Thus, the attorneys general came together and said perhaps we can have a comprehensive settlement. Many in the Congress found that to be intriguing. It would have been helpful if the President of the United States, last fall, had offered a bill as opposed to general guidelines. It might have been helpful, as a matter of fact, if there had been a comprehensive bill here that had embraced at least what I know have been seemingly contradictory strains on occasion. I certainly do not fault the managers of the bill. They have had a difficult time. 
But we have come now to a point where the one item, one significant item mentioned by everybody that was omitted--namely the growers, the farmers--has to be addressed. I believe it should be addressed. I don't believe it should be omitted. It is not specifically a health issue, and one can argue it competes with health issues. But inequity to farmers in these 10 States, and to tobacco farmers in particular, my intent and that of the Senators from Kentucky and South Carolina has been to take that very seriously. Although we may differ upon the amounts of money and the continuation of the tobacco program and various particulars in terms of expenditures in the States for community development and other aspects, we do not differ on very serious equity problems for farmers and for holders of quota. 
So we must address that issue. I am simply hopeful that this issue will not be seen as a subtraction or addition to health per se. It is a narrow issue of compensation to farmers and to their communities. 
I hope the Senate will accept the fact that there is equity in doing that. The so-called narrow version of the tobacco legislation--that principle--might not be accepted. 
So we are expanding today what the attorneys general and the State governments in their wisdom tried to negotiate last year. We are doing it so deliberately. Testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee said essentially the attorneys general, health groups, and everyone else anticipated the Senate at some point would act in behalf of growers, as we are doing, and, in fact, explicitly or implicitly endorsed that activity. 
Mr. President, I will rest my case for the time simply on the basis that I believe I have outlined why the Lugar approach is the best. Members will have a choice, either shortly or in the long term, depending upon how much debate Members wish to hear or endure on this subject. But I will not stymie progress of the bill. This is an issue that needs to be resolved. Members will have to make an overall judgment, I believe, on the bill on the basis of all factors, this one included. 
I hope at least in the course of this debate that we eliminate those issues that Members want to grasp, want to hear, and will be helpful in reaching a conclusion. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will understand this observation. Clearly, the strongest thing going for the Ford amendment is the Senator himself. As he has pointed out, he has long service to the people of Kentucky and his arguments on behalf of farm families with whom he has visited, and clearly all Senators have affection for the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky. It is my hope and had been my hope that I could persuade him that it is in the best interest of these farmers--the people with whom he has visited on the porches, who really have very real needs--and that is true of any tobacco farmers in the communities--and we want to support them. 
I know they are not as numerous as those in the Senator's State, but it is still very important to me. Our argument is really over what the future holds for them. I come into this business having conducted hearings, not claiming extensive knowledge like the Senator from Kentucky, but nevertheless understanding the predicament, it seems to me, of the tobacco program. I believe that it is a deteriorating and failing program. To give any other impression is not to give a very good forecast of the future. I hope the Senator from Kentucky agrees with me that, given that predicament, this particular piece of comprehensive legislation is almost a heaven-sent opportunity 
and has a lot to do with farmers who are tobacco farmers and those in those communities. I believe that if the opportunity passes, so will the opportunity for many of those families. That concerns both of us. 
Let me just say for the record that the Senator from Kentucky mentioned that an amendment I had planned to offer at the desk would provide for 46 percent of the farmers' money coming in the first year. That is correct. Let me point out, this is 46 percent of the money dedicated to farmers, not 46 percent of all of the money in the bill.

Mr. LUGAR. I will not argue with the Senator's arithmetic. I suggest there is even a worse predicament; namely, as the Senator has pointed out, a marriage penalty, and the drug program. Other things have been added in since we started the argument. My thought--this was at least in the working with the health community--was to try to stake out the farmers' claims before various other claims of the health community and various others that might come along. Clearly, the amounts of money in the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky in this bill will have to be expanded. And in conference they surely will be expanded. It appeared to me to stake out the farmers' interest in this way was prudent. The amendment has not been offered. The Senator has an amendment on the floor to strike my section which is the pending business. So we may never come to that point.

<TEXT>
Mr. LUGAR. That was my motivation. My general logic still is about the same--that we have a very crowded situation up front. But that is not precluding either one of us from arguing for the farmers' interests up front as opposed to downstream, and a long way down the stream in the case of the Senator's amendment. 
Let me just try to clarify another point that has arisen along the way; namely, that the Lugar plan would be of great benefit to cigarette companies. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky has frequently said, `Are you for the companies, or the farmers?' I am for the farmer. I have made no mistake about that for years. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky will recall that I have been attempting to wrap up the tobacco program for many years--it is not a new endeavor--because I don't believe it is good agricultural policy. But leaving that aside, the charge is made that under the Lugar plan the tobacco prices would drop dramatically and the companies would, therefore, make more profit on each pack of cigarettes. Let me try to address that as carefully as I can. 
Dr. Blake Brown of North Carolina State University, one of the Nation's most respected tobacco economists, studied what would happen if cigarette prices rose $1.50 cents a pack and the tobacco program were ended. As we know, the amendment to raise the price to $1.50 a pack failed. It is $1.10 a pack. So, to that extent, we have a problem with Dr. Brown's analysis. But, nevertheless, follow me if you will. He said that prices would not fall as much as opponents of the Lugar amendment assert. He projected a decline of 20 percent to 25 percent at around 35 cents to 40 cents, not the 60 cents or 70 cents claimed by some. Notwithstanding that, he said the price would fall but production would increase. 
The Senator from Kentucky has made that point--and he is correct, according to Dr. Brown--that, in fact, a more efficient tobacco industry is likely to arise under the Lugar amendment. This should not be surprising. 
Essentially, the tobacco program now brings about a very inefficient tobacco situation in the United States. I am not a proponent of tobacco, but I would say freedom to farm would be good for tobacco. In essence, the price will fall, more will be produced, exports will increase because price-wise--I would argue quality-wise--and it would be more competitive. Revenue is not simply price; it is price multiplied by volume. As a matter of fact, Dr. Brown estimates the total dollar value of tobacco sales would fall by just 2.8 percent, or $74 million, a year. By contrast, the Commerce Committee bill raises about $500 billion from the tobacco companies. 
Mr. President, it is my analysis that, in fact, the tobacco companies conceivably have $74 million of economy a year, not a billion a year that the Senator from Kentucky has mentioned. You multiply that by 25--I am asserting it is more like $74 million perhaps, and conceivably less than that, as a matter of fact. 
That is a very different ball park to argue the situation one way or another for the tobacco companies. But I would simply say that the tobacco companies are more likely to buy American tobacco under this situation. It is unlikely to lead to a GATT crisis, simply because the market works. One reason the tobacco companies do not buy as much American tobacco now is that normally the quality of much of it is not very good. The price of it is abnormally high. They have substituted purchases from abroad. 
There are so many mixed motivations in this bill that some Senators might argue we do not want a more efficient tobacco industry. As a matter of fact, we want to make it as inefficient as possible, as few sales as possible of American tobacco, the least rationalization economically of it all. But you can't carry water on both shoulders on this issue. 
I am suggesting that this is a good time simply to get the governmental apparatus out of it, which, in my judgment, is not very helpful either to the tobacco farmers, or the tobacco companies, or to anybody involved, and clearly it leads to a balance of trade problem for America generally. 
Let me get into the health and research question again, because some Senators may be tempted to support the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky because they believe that health programs might be disturbed in the redistribution of these funds. 
Let me just point out that the technical details of Senator Ford's proposal are important to know. For example, in the amendment that he has presented--and it is part of this bill now--the Ford plan costs will immediately explode by design, because payments are accelerated if the tobacco program ends. These costs could be over $10 billion in a single year. 
Why do I mention this? I mention it because I would guess, having witnessed action on the floor for several years, that in some year some Senator is going to propose the end of the tobacco program. That may not occur tonight or tomorrow. It could, if the Senate passes my amendment. But for some reason, because of sentiment for the distinguished Senator from Kentucky to continue this process, after the distinguished Senator has left the floor and left the Senate, my prediction is that some Senator will say this doesn't make sense, for the Federal Government to be prescriptive with regard to tobacco and here we are supporting tobacco in this way by governmental fiat. 
So at some point in a farm bill, or without a farm bill, my guess is the program will come to an end. The Senator has thought of that and says if that should be the case, immediately payments of all sorts come to tobacco farmers. In other words, there is a ticking time bomb there to suggest it is very expensive for anybody to try to end the tobacco program. Members need to understand that. They are buying not only a continuation of the tobacco program but a rather huge payment, if anyone should dare to tamper with the program. 
The health community people need to understand that. This is not a benign amendment with regard to the health of the American people. 
Let me point out, Mr. President, that the charge that we will give a $1 billion gift to cigarette manufacturers, taking it out of the farmers' pockets, just simply does not hold water. We have cited Dr. Brown of North Carolina State before. I cite Dr. Brown again. He estimates, as we have suggested, that farmers' total revenue might decline by 15 percent. He said this decline assumed a $1.50-a-pack price, but even at the $1.10 we finally adopted, the increase in their loss of revenue could still be severe--maybe not 15 percent but something in that neighborhood. Keeping the current program means lower total revenues for American tobacco farmers because noncompetitive U.S. prices well encourage a continued uptrend in imports and reduce exports while domestic demand is stagnant or falling. 
I made the point, Mr. President, that it is conceivable through protectionist legislation on top of this that Senators might decide to try to keep foreign tobacco out of the country, might try to amend the GATT at the World Trade Organization meetings when they come along next year. That would add, I suppose, double jeopardy to the whole situation--Federal sponsorship of tobacco, compounded by protectionist legislation enveloping even that. 
That does not make sense. This is not the way the world works. It is not the way the policies of this country are headed. Why in the particular instance of tobacco is there a blind spot with regard to the successful economic operation of our country including this specific industry? In fact, I would suggest that the families who, under the Lugar amendment, will be collecting $8 a pound for quota will use that money, many of them, to make investments and to earn money on them that are substantially more sound and more lucrative than the investments they have in tobacco. The tobacco industry is not a winner in terms of current investment either as a farmer, warehouseman or a manufacturing concern. It is not a winner because this legislation is in the Chamber and the impact of this legislation is going to be very depressing to tobacco people wherever they are. 
The intent of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and myself is to not only cushion that blow for farmers and those communities, but it is to provide, upfront and quickly, capital for those farmers to have a pension or money to invest in other operations, agricultural or otherwise, or money for scholarships. And I share the enthusiasm of the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for education of young people in those areas where tobacco is produced, as well as elsewhere. But I would seriously question whether the educational opportunities of those students are going to be enhanced by continuation of the tobacco program, a program that will mean less income for their families annually as far as the eye can see, from an industry and a general area, that of tobacco, in which demand will be depressed, in which sales and the amount of quota given annually will be depressed and in which, one after another, these families will in fact leave the business. 
I am not trying to legislate anyone out of business. I am as sensitive as the distinguished Senator from Kentucky that in a deteriorating situation people are leaving farming in general, but they are leaving tobacco farming in particular because it is particularly depressed and does not have even the liberation of freedom to farm, the ability to farm or to plant what he wants to maximize his or her production in this country. 
If, in fact, we are talking about the health and welfare of 
tobacco farmers--and that is our intent today--and the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is correct, that we were not at the table when the attorneys general of the various States met with the tobacco companies--and, in fact, testimony before the Agriculture Committee by at least one witness was that settlement for growers was deliberately left out. It was, to quote one of them, a deal breaker. Others have said that all along they expected Congress would act, and, indeed, we are attempting to do that. 
Mr. President, if we do not act or if we had not acted by bringing these amendments to the floor, I think it is clear to the tobacco farmers in my State they will be on a losing course with tobacco for the rest of their lives without any recourse or any particular funds. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would suggest as to the critical issue that has been suggested; namely, is there credible evidence that farmers will receive their money, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has pointed out that certainly my plan looks attractive to farmers who anticipate receiving $8 per pound of quota in the first 3 years after enactment; that my plan looks attractive to farmers who want to continue on and receive transition payments comparable to those of freedom to farm for corn and beans and wheat and cotton and rice, and my plan looks attractive, as a matter of fact, to communities that receive at least modest amounts of community development funds. The Senator from Kentucky has pointed out the value of these funds. 
I believe my amendment is attractive for all of these reasons, and this is why it is attractive to grower organizations in most States that have a lot of tobacco--a great deal of support, resolutions of support directly, editorial support in newspapers. It is not because people in those States necessarily favored my desire to end the tobacco program. It is because they came to a recognition the program is ending. It will be gone. This is the one opportunity in which some compensation might occur. It is an opportunity not to be missed. 
Now, if it is to be ceased in terms of the family, the money upfront makes sense. It is very important to understand that and to understand why that injection of capital and expenditure and buying power into tobacco communities is important in the short run. It is important to understand why, when a conference occurs with the House, if they pass a bill, growers need to have a strong position at the table, which our bill gives them. I think it is very important, as a matter of fact, to the success of this legislation as a whole that there be a provision such as the one I have suggested and which the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has now moved to strike--that my provision be there. It is a strong reason for Senators to vote for the overall legislation. 
I would say correspondingly, if in fact the tobacco program is to continue on forever, and if the expenditures the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has pointed out are very generous to his State and a few others are to be a part of that, many Senators will raise the question as to why the rest of the United States of America ought to subsidize these few States or these few counties. What equity is there, as a matter of fact, in such a transfer of money over the course of time? And Americans will clearly ask, Is it not hypocritical to maintain that entire apparatus if the point of tobacco legislation is to discourage smoking, discourage consumption, to help improve the health of the American people and the desire of young people to become committed to smoking at all. 
For these reasons, I am hopeful that as Members ponder their decision--and it may be a decision they will have to ponder throughout the evening or will make at some point in the morning, because I have pledged to the distinguished Senator now to make a motion. I had indicated earlier in the afternoon I was perfectly willing for a quick vote, and that situation did not materialize. 
There is no one here stopping progress. I will just simply say, at some point this has to be resolved, and I hope the Senators will resolve it in favor of the Lugar amendment, because I believe this is the best course for tobacco farmers, for tobacco communities, and for our national policy. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise before you today to commend the first place award winners of the American Set a Good Example Competition. 
Each year this contest recognizes three schools who have set themselves apart as leaders in the fight against crime and violence in our nation's schools. In this, the 12th year of the contest sponsored by the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America, Arsenal Technical High School of Indianapolis, Indiana, has been recognized as one of these very special schools. 
While we have seen the war against drugs and violence fought on every battlefield from the streets to our homes to the workplace, there is no more important battlefield than our children's schools. In an attempt to emphasize this message, the Concerned Businessman's Association of America (CCBA), began this unique contest in 1985 in order to encourage our nation's teenagers to become involved in the war on drugs and violence. 
This year the CBAA deemed the efforts of the students at Arsenal Technical High School, in conjunction with the guidance of teacher Mary Allen, principal Gerald McLeish, and the funding of Dr. Chris Kasle, worthy of this prestigious award. 
For their project, Arsenal Technical students selected the precept of `Do Not Murder' taken from the `Way to Happiness' by L. Ron Hubbard. First, the students discussed murders which have affected them, their families and communities. Next, students put themselves in the position of Mayor and formulated ways in which they would solve the problem of violence. Each student wrote essays about their plans. 
Arsenal continued this project by planning a `Set A Good Example Week.' When a teacher saw a student set a good example or perform an act of kindness, the student received a coupon redeemable for a small pack of candy at lunch. 
Students received the pack of candy from a booth promoting a talent show dubbed `Stop the Hate in 98,' an event promoting non-violence. 
The student-planned talent show included an art and rap contest and generated 100% student involvement. 
I extend my congratulations to the students and faculty at Arsenal Technical High School for this outstanding achievement and the excellent example they have set for our nation's youth. I urge each student to build upon the successes of this program and continue to set a good example every day.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I introduce the USDA Information Technology Reform and Year-2000 Compliance Act of 1998. This legislation aims to centralize all year 2000 computer conversion and other information technology acquisition and management activities within the Officer of the Chief Information Office of the Department of Agriculture. Centralization is the most efficient way to manage the complex and important task of ensuring that all critical computer functions at the department are operational on January 1, 2000. It is also a wiser and more cost effective way to construct an information technology infrastructure to enable USDA's hundreds of computer systems to interoperate, which unfortunately they cannot now do. 
The Department of Agriculture is charged with enormous responsibilities and its year 2000 readiness is crucial. It has a diverse portfolio of over 200 federal programs throughout the nation and the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs. It is the fourth largest federal agency, with 31 agencies and offices. The department is responsible for the safety of our food supply, nutrition programs that serve the poor, young and old, and the protection of our natural resources. Since forty percent of the non-tax debt owed to the federal government is owed to USDA, the department has a responsibility to ensure the financial soundness of taxpayers' investments. 
The dentralized approach to the year 2000 issue at USDA has led to a lack of focus on departmental priorities. In fact, none exist. No planning to assure the continuation of the overall mission of the department has occurred. Each agency has been allowed to determine what services, programs and activities it deems important enough to be operational at the end of the millennium. This decentralized approach has also led to a lack of guidance, oversight and the development of contingency plans. At a hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on May 14th, the General Accounting Office reported that eighty percent of the work remains to be done in the ten component agencies reviewed. Responsibility for keeping the mission-critical information technology functioning should clearly rest with the Chief Information Officer. 
In fiscal year 1998 alone, USDA plans to spend approximately $1.2 billion on information technology and related information resources management activities. The General Accounting Office has chronicled USDA's long history of problems in managing its substantial information technology investments. The GAO reports that such ineffective planning and management have resulted in USDA's wasting millions of dollars on computer systems. 
Last year, I introduced S. 805, a bill to reform the information technology systems of the Department of Agriculture. It gave the Chief Information Officer control over the planning, development and acquisition of information technology at the department. Introduction of that bill prompted some coordination of information technology among the department's agencies and offices. However, component agencies are still allowed to independently acquire and manage information technology investments solely on the basis of their own parochial interests or needs. This revised legislation is now needed to strengthen that coordination and ensure that centralized information technology management continues in the future. 
This legislation further requires that the Chief Information Officer manage the design and implementation of an information technology architecture based on strategic business plans that maximizes the effectiveness and efficiency of USDA's program activities. Included in the bill is authority for the Chief Information Officer to approve expenditures for information resources and for year 2000 compliance purposes, except for minor acquisitions. To accomplish these purposes, the bill requires that each agency transfer not less than five percent of its information technology budget to the Chief Information Officer's control. 
The bill makes the Chief Information Officer responsible for ensuring that the information technology architecture facilitates a flexible common computing environment for the field service centers based on integrated program delivery and provides maximum data sharing with USDA customers and other federal and state agencies, which is expected to result in significant reduction in operating costs. 
Mr. President, this is a bill whose time has come. Unfortunately, USDA's problems in managing information technology are not unusual among government agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. I commend the attention of my colleagues to this bill designed to address a portion of the information resource management problems of the federal government and ask for their support of it.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will consume much of my time at this juncture, reserve the balance, and yield to other colleagues. 
I am very pleased that the Senate is now prepared to debate the conference report on S. 1150, the Agriculture Research, Extension and Education Reform Act of 1998. 
I thank especially Senator Tom Harkin, the ranking minority member of the committee, and all committee members for their efforts to work together to fashion legislation to garner the support of 74 Senators and a large host of agricultural, nutrition and religious organizations. 
I point out that we had a good conference with our House colleagues. This is complex legislation. This is not the first time the Congress has had a conference report. It is usual, at least in matters of this variety, for the report to attract less attention. But ours is important. And I appreciate this opportunity to highlight that importance this morning. 
Our initiatives will help farmers in this country to produce food for the world's people and to do so at a profit while guarding the environment of this country and the world. S. 1150 also resolves a funding crisis for the Federal Crop Insurance Program, preventing the loss of coverage for farmers in every State. The bill extends an important initiative from the 1996 farm bill that provides resources for rural development and research priorities. And, finally, S. 1150 allows food stamp benefits to be provided to limited groups of the disabled, the elderly, political refugees, and children who immigrated to this country legally. 
Many of our colleagues have called for dramatic increases in funding for Federal scientific research. This advocacy is altogether appropriate. Unfortunately, agricultural research has received much less attention. Funding has declined in real terms for some years, and Mr. President, has declined in some areas to a point that we are no longer prepared to resist some of the insect and other disease pests that endanger our food supply. 
It took visionaries like Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr. Norman Borlaug who came before our committee and eloquently pointed out how agricultural research is the future of mankind. It is the basis upon which mankind will be able to persist by the year 2050. Millions of people are now alive who would have died from malnutrition had it not been for the food productivity gains from people like Dr. Borlaug, and the thousands of other scientists. Whether it is through the `Green Revolution' of the 1960s, or today's biotechnology, researchers have found ways to coax more food from each acre, tapping more fully the potential of plant and animal food sources. 
Further gains in output are not only possible but they are essential if the food needs of the 21st century are to be met. An increasing world population with rising incomes will require more and better food, feed and fiber. It is estimated, as a matter of fact, that their demand will be three times the demand for food which we now have in this year. 
Not every farm around the globe is well suited for food production. We have an interest in avoiding the further deforestation and the exploitation of rain forests around the world and other sensitive ecosystems that will be farmed only at a terrible environmental price. Production must be trimmed in areas most appropriate for agriculture such as the United States. 
An important part of the answer to this global crisis is our bill, S. 1150. It devotes $600 million over the next 5 years in mandatory funding to the initiative for future agriculture and food systems. These funds will be competitively awarded to scientists who will undertake cutting-edge research in priority areas such as genome studies, biotechnology, 
precision agriculture, and other critical fields of work. The new funds will augment the $1.8 billion existing annual budget for research within the Department of Agriculture. 
To make certain the existing budget is spent in the most efficient way, S. 1150 also makes a number of reforms to the Nation's research and extension statutes. These reforms will establish benchmarks and set new requirements for coordination of work among universities, placing new emphasis on activities that cut across several disciplines, involve multiple institutions, and integrate research with public dissemination of those results.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I want to summarize our debate--which has been a good one this morning--by saying that it is very important that we act today to pass the conference report. As the distinguished Senator from Mississippi stated eloquently and correctly, failure to do that will throw into chaos farmers who are now planting and who count upon crop insurance, reformed albeit as we have reformed it, as an underlying safety net in the year of El Nino, remarkable weather circumstances, it is unthinkable simply to kick away that safety net through our indifference. 
Secondly, Mr. President, the agriculture research, which has been characterized as an entitlement, along with crop insurance and other provisions, of course, is a 5-year program, as is our farm bill program. 
We have payments to farmers and Conservation Reserve Program payments for the environment. We have designated $120 million for vital research which we believe is necessary simply to fight back the pest diseases that are now jeopardizing our growth. 
Mr. President, the yield of wheat in our country has been flat in yield per acre over the last 15 years of time. The breakers are not occurring, and we must triple and not have a zero gain. 
Finally, let me simply say that there will not be people lined up all over the world trying to get into America to ruin our welfare reform. As a matter of fact, welfare reform has brought about a better America. This bill will help preserve that in a humane way. Provisions that were made under SSI for income for the very persons who are being talked about today--the elderly, the children, the disabled, and those who have come with a well found sense of persecution to escape torture--will, in fact, be aided in a humane way that I believe all Senators would want to support. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the report with regard to the conferees on agriculture reform is supported by 17 out of the 18 members of our committee. I make that point because the 17 have written to our leader asking him for this debate. They are grateful for that opportunity. The 18th was predictably our colleague and a very valued member of the committee, the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, who objects to the conference report and has offered this recommittal motion as a way, in my judgment, of defeating the conference report. 
Let me just offer a word of clarification. As the chairman of the conference and one of the conferees, along with Senator Cochran and Senator Coverdell on the Republican side, we supported the conference report after meeting with House colleagues who had very considerable enthusiasms of their own. This is not the first time that the Senate and House have met in a conference and have had to wrestle with issues that were distinctly different in the bills and have come to a compromise which, in my judgment, is a sound one, which was supported immediately by all the conferees in the House and the Senate in both parties and by 74 United States Senators who have written to the majority leader supporting this conference report. They do so because it is extremely timely. There are farmers in the field now dependent upon the crop insurance provisions. 
If we are not successful today, of course, we will return to the conference, but I have already turned to the conferees and they are unanimous that we should proceed with the same bill and we will be back in the Chamber delayed by days or weeks as the case may be. The Senate may then pass the conference report. Perhaps the distinguished Senator from Texas is correct that this is going to pass by a very large majority. But is it any more certain that this same conference report will pass days and weeks hence, if we can get floor time, than today? I doubt it. 
Now, the reason why conferees will not change the conference report is that the distinguished Senator from Texas has asked for a very narrow change that does not make a lot of sense. Let me review, Mr. President, respectfully, why I make that comment. 
Before welfare reform, all legal aliens were eligible for food stamps, for SSI, the Social Security income payments, and for Medicaid. Before welfare reform, all of these persons were eligible. With the passage of welfare reform, most legal aliens became ineligible until such time as they became citizens. 
But, Mr. President, follow carefully if you will. Refugees and asylees continued under welfare reform to be eligible for SSI, for food stamps, and for Medicaid. No new entitlement here. Welfare reform simply continued their eligibility from the pre-welfare reform days. 
Now, the balanced budget amendment restored Social Security to some of the legal aliens; namely, to children, elderly, the disabled who were in this country on August 22, 1996, when we passed welfare reform. And it made asylees and refugees who already had benefits, who retained those, eligible now for 7 years of Social Security income and Medicaid. 
Mr. President, you might ask, while we were at it we all passed this bill, the balanced budget amendment with enthusiasm. Why did we not change the food stamp provision from 5 years, which the refugees and asylees had, to 7 years to conform with what we were doing on income and the rest? Well, we did not because the Finance Committee had jurisdiction over that particular money. The Agriculture Committee has jurisdiction over food stamps. We were not in the picture. We are today. The intent of the motion of the Senator from Texas is in essence over the idea that the 5 years the refugees and asylees already had should not go to 7 years, and we should go back to conference to apparently knock back the 7 to 5. It is something which most Members find incomprehensible. 
The distinguished Senator has a larger point, I believe, in his motion. He believes that however you phrase the food stamp situation, it is a beacon of hope for persons to come to our country, as he says, for years, for decades. Well, perhaps, but the asylees and the refugees are not swarming across our borders. They are people one by one who must present themselves and say and affirm: I am a potential victim of persecution, well-founded, and they have to prove that. If they do not prove it, they do not get in. And frequently people who had not gotten in went back and were killed. There are consequences to those decisions. 
The people presenting themselves are Evangelical Christians; they are Jews from the former Soviet Union; they are Cubans who have tried to escape Castro; they are people who have fled from Somalia and from racial persecution in Bosnia recently. These are tough cases, and we recognized that in the welfare reform bill. We said keep them with a safety net because they do not have sponsors. They come with the shirts on their backs. And we have done so because we are a humane people. What sort of people are we to think about denying persons who have come in these circumstances to our shores? This is not a neon sign advertisement. It is simply a fact of the kind of country we are. 
To send all of this back to conference over the fact that 5 years of eligibility these people now have should be changed to 7 seems to me to be an item the Senate should reject and do so decisively. 
Finally, let me just simply say that Larry Craig, the distinguished Senator from Idaho, has said:  
This is more than just a reauthorization bill. Legislation before the Senate today is an investment in the future and represents our commitment to America's farm families. By providing the technical assistance and extension activities that help expand farm income, improve resource management, and develop new crop varieties, federally funded agricultural research assures that our Nation will continue to lead the world in farm production and help bolster the stability of our rural areas. 
I concur with that. This is not a question of an entitlement. It is the question of our commitment in the farm bill. 
We committed to America's farmers, for a 7-year period of time, a proposition--freedom to farm, the idea to manage your own land and plant for the future. And American farmers have responded to that. They have planted over 10 million more acres. They have raised their income. They have raised exports for America. But we said there will be a safety net in this transition from the old days of supply management. It includes payments to farmers that decrease over the next 5 years. It includes the CRP, the Conservation Reserve Program, that tries to protect the environment for a 5-year period of time. We believe it needs to include farm research during this same period of the next 5 years, and crop insurance with those guarantees. The argument is, it could be done year by year, but this is not of great assurance to our farmers. 
So, for all these reasons, I ask the Gramm amendment be defeated and we move on, then, to prompt passage of the conference report. I yield the floor.

Mr. LUGAR. I yield myself that time. 
Mr. President, let me make as clear as I can the parliamentary situation. We have tried, in the Ag Committee since last fall, to pass a sound research bill. We succeeded last fall. The House did not act finally until the end of the session and did not appoint conferees until a short time ago. 
It has been a very difficult conference--not the first time such a thing has occurred. Conferences in the Congress have occurred frequently. Compromises are made. 
Mr. President, to suggest glibly that we can go back to conference if the motion made by the Senator from Texas passes, simply excise what he wishes, and return to the Senate with a bill, is inaccurate. I have tested the conferees, and they will not change. The Senator from Texas may not change. Furthermore, if changes are made, the Secretary of Agriculture has written to the committee that he will recommend the President veto the bill. Now we can all estimate, Is the President bluffing? Is the Secretary accurate? Will somebody weaken on the House side--maybe many people--and suddenly see the light? Conceivably, Mr. President. And I pledge I will try. Patiently, for 6 months, I have tried, and if need be, I will continue to do that. 
My prediction is, there will be a considerable delay with regard to crop insurance, probably a year or 2 delay in terms of research, and in due course I have no idea what will happen on the food stamp issue. 
But, Mr. President, let me simply say, we have a remarkable possibility for achievement here today that I hope will not be defeated on a very narrow point. I understand the objections of our colleagues, but I understand an overwhelming majority, 74 Senators, expressed themselves in writing that this is their will. I hope we will have an opportunity to manifest it in passage of the report. 
I yield back our remaining time.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the ranking member, Senator Harkin, was characteristically gracious and generous, and I appreciate his comments. I want to tell him how much I have appreciated working with him and with all of our colleagues on what I believe is a monumental advance for not only American agriculture, but for feeding the world in the next 50 years, as well as the assurance of our farmers immediately in crop insurance and humane measures with regard to nutrition programs. 
I simply mention, Mr. President, that Dave Johnson and Terri Nintemann have been mentioned. Of course, our distinguished Randy Green, who does so much on the majority side in likewise guiding all of the committee staff efforts. But I also will mention Marcia Asquith, Beth Johnson, Andy Morton, Michael Knipe, Bob Sturm, Debbie Schwertner, Carol Dubard, Kate Wallem, Kathryn Boots, Chris Salisbury, Danny Spellacy, Terri Snow, Whitney Mueller, and Jennifer Cutshall, because this has been a 2-year effort on the part of all of these individuals and they have contributed highly. 
I have consulted with the distinguished majority leader, 
Trent Lott, and with the distinguished ranking member, Tom Harkin, and it will be our request that there be a final rollcall vote. I alert colleagues that that will be coming, hopefully soon. 
I appreciate very much the leader working with us to make this time possible and this opportunity to debate. I mention specifically the importance of the contribution of Senator Gramm, who is a member of our committee, who argued well a point of view that did not prevail but, at the same time, sharpened the focus of all of us on those things we believe are important in this legislation. 
Finally, I mention Senator Domenici, who had only a very small speech but an important one with regard to caps and entitlements in the budget and overall considerations. We are mindful of what he had to say and grateful for his support ultimately of our effort. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate has begun a historical debate over NATO's future, one that surely will reverberate for many years to come. I believe we have a historical window of opportunity to take steps which will secure European peace and stability and which will lock in the freedom and independence won in the revolutions of 1989 and the collapse of communism. 
If the Senate ratifies enlargement, we will have set the foundation for decades of European peace and prosperity; but if we fail, historians may look back at the early post-cold-war period as a tragic loss of opportunities. The more distant we are from the days of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, the clearer it becomes that we have entered a new era. But dangers still abound in post-cold-war Europe. The revolutions of 1989 not only led to the collapse of communism but also to the end of the peace orders established after two world wars. 
What is at stake here and now is order and stability in Europe as a whole. And that is why American interests are involved. Mr. President, NATO cannot by itself solve all of Europe's problems, but without a stable security framework, we run the risk that reform and democracy in Eastern Europe will not persist but will instead be undercut by destructive forces of nationalism and insecurity. 
The failure of democracy in the east could not help but have a profound consequence for democracy in the continent's western half as well. If history teaches us anything, it is that the United States is always drawn into such European conflicts because our vital interests are ultimately engaged. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are democratic, free-market nations with professional militaries under civilian control. In addition to contributing to NATO's core mission of collective defense, they are ready and able to support American and allied interests beyond their borders as they have demonstrated in Desert Storm, in Haiti, and in Bosnia. 
Accession of these three democracies to NATO will eliminate immoral and destabilizing dividing lines in Europe. I point out, Mr. President, those lines are there--not put there by us--and extend stability into a region long troubled by conflict. 
A stable and peaceful Europe will benefit all of Europe, including Russia and non-NATO countries. Expanding peace and stability in Europe lessens the chance of the United States again being pulled into conflicts in the region. NATO enlargement provides an opportunity for the alliance to be proactive in shaping a stable and strategic landscape in Europe. 
Mr. President, it has been argued that we are rushing into 1992 enlargement. I have advocated, among others, expanding the NATO alliance since 1992. I have had countless discussions on the subject with colleagues here in the Senate and in the administration since that time. I have traveled to Europe and to the former Soviet Union many times in recent years, and the issue of NATO enlargement has been one of the most debated and talked about issues throughout that period of time. 
As an early advocate of enlargement, I do not agree that the Senate is rushing to expand NATO. Rather, I suggest that supporters and critics of enlargement have been engaged in a debate and discussion of this topic for at least 6 years--hardly a hurried process. NATO enlargement has been endorsed by Congress each year since 1994. NATO enlargement was endorsed in 
the Contract With America as part of the 1996 Republican Presidential platform. 
Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee held 12 hearings over the past 4 years to hear from nearly 50 supporters and opponents of the policy of enlargement. In fact, I held the first hearing on the subject as chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee. Not only has the Foreign Relations Committee held hearings and studied the subject, but so has the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Budget and Appropriations Committees. 
These committee hearings have thoroughly examined concerns about NATO expansion, including projected cost, how we deal with Russia, and the future mission of NATO. The committee's resolution addresses all of these points and was reported by a vote of 16-2. Our chairman, Senator Helms, and distinguished ranking member, Senator Biden, have done an excellent job in constructing a very thoughtful and balanced resolution of ratification. 
If Senate committee hearings and deliberations are not enough, Senators Lott and Daschle organized a Senate NATO observer group, which had 28 members and met 17 times to study and discuss this important foreign policy initiative. NATO enlargement has received endorsements from every living U.S. Secretary of State, numerous former Secretaries of Defense and National Security Advisers, and more than 60 flag and general officers, including 5 distinguished former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
This has been a long, serious debate among Members of Congress, the administration, and our allies regarding the benefits and possible pitfalls of enlargement. There has been no rush to judgment. We are now entering the final stage of the process; namely, Senate debate and a vote on the merits of NATO enlargement. I have listened carefully to critics who suggest that there is no threat at the present time and thus we should not expand NATO now. They suggest there will be plenty of time to expand the alliance should a new enemy or threat appear on the horizon. I strongly disagree with that point of view. We have learned that the weapons used in Desert Storm were envisioned, planned, and produced in the 1970s. Thus, the systems which allowed us to triumph in the Persian Gulf are 20 to 25 years old. 
The organization and infrastructure to meet future threats must have a similar root structure. We must begin to construct an alliance which can meet the future and undetermined threats. Our military experts and top strategic thinkers believe an alliance which includes Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be better able to meet those challenges. 
What might those challenges be? Perhaps the emergence of a hostile regional power, a threat from the Middle East or from North Africa, a resurgent imperialist Russia, nationalist or religious instability, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
The systems needed to deter or defeat such future threats must begin to be constructed long before they can be expected to operate effectively. One cannot expect an alliance to be shelved during times of peace and simply dusted off when the threats emerge. The alliance must begin to lay the foundation which will prepare us to meet an uncertain future. In my mind, expanding the zone of peace and security in Europe and adding three new willing, enthusiastic members will contribute to that preparedness. 
Four of our NATO allies--Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Germany--have already ratified the protocols of enlargement. It is time for the Senate to act and to show leadership on this issue. 
NATO's open-door entrance policy established by article 10 of the Washington treaty--which should not be misunderstood as an open-ended policy--has given countries of Central and Eastern Europe the incentive to accelerate reforms, to settle disputes with neighbors, and to increase regional cooperation. They have done so magnificently. 
To retract the open-door policy, as some have suggested, would risk undermining tremendous gains that have been made for peace throughout the region. The result of a `closed-door' policy would be the creation of new dividing lines across Europe. Those nations outside might become disillusioned and insecure and, thus, inclined to adopt the competitive and destabilizing security policies of Europe's past. 
NATO's decision to enlarge in stages recognizes that all new democracies and applicants in Europe are not equally ready or willing to be security allies. Some states may never be ready. 
At the same time, NATO must not prejudge the future or draw new lines in Europe by pre-emptively excluding or setting time lines for future cooperation or membership. 
The selection of future NATO members should depend on: (1) a determination by NATO members of their strategic interests; (2) NATO's perception of threats to security and stability; and (3) actions taken by prospective members to complete their democratic transitions and to harmonize their policies with NATO's political aims and security policies. 
This would clarify the security expectations of non-NATO members. It would make clear that it is the intention of the United States that NATO remain a serious defensive military alliance and not slip into a loose collective security society. It suggests that enlargement will be a careful, deliberate process, with consideration of all security interests. Finally, it draws again on the principle of reciprocity, both to encourage prospective members to align themselves with NATO's values and policies and to signal that threats will be counterproductive. 
Intellectually, I can understand the concern that we must not allow the NATO Alliance to collapse under the strains, produced by multitudes of new members. But, neither can we seek a quick, painless remedy for serious debate and oversight of American foreign policy through `strategic pauses' or `NATO linkages'. The best way to ensure the continued vitality of NATO is for the United States to consider and debate the qualifications and potential ramifications of new members on a country-by-country or a stage-by-stage basis. 
NATO's open-door policy has served the Alliance well for fifty years. The Senate has always and will retain its prerogatives and powers in the area of the North Atlantic Treaty and the Alliance. A two-thirds Senate majority is the best form of balance and oversight we can produce without treading on executive privilege. 
In the weeks leading up to the Alliance's Madrid summit in July 1997, many of our current European allies pushed for a larger initial number of states to join NATO. The President decided to keep the initial round to three members. This was not a popular decision with some of our allies, who had championed the cause of Slovenia and Romania. And while neither the Administration nor the Senate can prevent other current members of the Alliance from promoting the membership of additional states, both have the ability to prevent the accession of other candidates--the Administration through its predominant voice in the North Atlantic Council and the Senate through its role in approving modifications to the North Atlantic Treaty. 
Consequently, I do not believe a legislatively mandated pause is in the interest of this country, this institution, or the NATO Alliance. 
Some propose that NATO enlargement be bound to the expansion of the European Union (EU). EU enlargement is highly desirable in its own right, but must not be a condition to NATO membership. It would restrict a trans-Atlantic Alliance led by the U.S. to the political exigencies of a strictly European organization. 
I point out again, Mr. President, that NATO is the organization in which the United States is involved and in which we offer leadership, not the European union. 
The transfer of security decision-making power to an institution which has been unable to develop a common security policy and failed to stop the fighting in the former Yugoslavia would not bode well for the future of European security. The EU's decision-making procedures are notorious for being cumbersome and slow. Moreover, the consensus-building process they serve to tend to produce outcomes expressing the lowest common denominator. All of these traits are antithetical to the demands of a military alliance which places a premium on timely, decisive action rather than first meeting the test of political acceptability to a diverse relationship. 
Finally, subordinating NATO to the EU in this manner would make the Alliance, not a cornerstone of European security, but an appendage. The role of the U.S., Canada, and Turkey, none of whom are members of the EU, would be significantly diminished in the enlargement process. This potential `back-door' approach to enlargement is fraught with dangers; I prefer the `front-door', the `open-door'. 
Critics assert that NATO enlargement repeats the mistake of the Versailles Treaty by mistreating Russia. One should be careful with historical analogies. NATO enlargement is not a punishment or isolation of Russia. During the period that NATO enlargement has proceeded, President Yeltsin was re-elected; reformers were elevated in government; President Yeltsin pledged to press for ratification of START II and then to pursue deeper nuclear arms reductions in START III; the Russian Duma approved the Chemical Weapons Convention; Russian troops continue their participation in Bosnia; the West has extended some $100 billion since 1991 to assist Russian democratic and economic reforms, and over $2 billion in weapons dismantlement and security. 
NATOP members will continue to have both common and divergent interests with Russia, whether NATO enlarges or not. It is a mistake to view Russia solely as a reactive power and to blame its actions on Western behavior alone. There will be areas of collaboration and areas of discord in the relationship, and those distinctions will be determined by differences in geography, history, and economic standing, not by ideology as during the Cold War and not by NATO enlargement in the post-Cold War world. The only way to manage both areas of coincident and conflicting interests is by building bridges where possible and drawing lines where necessary. 
Many reject NATO enlargement out of a desire to preserve a Russian sphere of influence. If Russia cannot accept the legitimate right of its neighbors to choose their security arrangements, a policy they embraced in the NATO-Russia 
Founding Act, then NATO's role in the region will prove even more important. 
Some critics believe that NATO enlargement is somehow condemning the START II Treaty and cooperative U.S.-Russian nuclear dismantlement activities to the dustbin of history. I do not believe this is the case. Russia's recent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention would indicate that the linkage between NATO enlargement and arms control is more political than strategic. 
Many Russians, including liberal Duma members, simply do not like the START II Treaty. They believe the Russian side was out-negotiated by the Americans, and oppose it whether NATO expands or not. 
What is at issue among Russian arms control specialists is whether the United States can be convinced to pay some additional price for mutual strategic nuclear arms control reductions that the Russians themselves will have to undertake with or without a treaty. Continued statements about the dire consequences that will accompany NATO enlargement become the means by which they hope to induce the U.S. to go to a START III agreement sooner rather than later. 
Perceived START II inequities constitute by far the primary reason for the reluctance of many Duma members and defense specialists to ratify the START II Treaty, not continuing, deep-seated resentment of NATO enlargement. It is not simply the nationalists but the so-called liberals in the Russian foreign policy elite who believe that START II, as currently written, is not in Russia's national interest. The latter would also propose to substantially modify the START III elements of the Helsinki joint statement agreed to by Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin, arguing that the March 1997 START III principles do not go far enough to guarantee that Russia's smaller strategic forces of the future will be able to reliably deter the United States. 
At the very time that prominent Russian `arms controllers' are publicly laying the blame for lack of Duma ratification of START II at the feet of an 
expanding NATO, they are privately probing to determine how far the United States would be willing to go in further lowering warhead ceilings through START III, realizing that Russia cannot realistically afford to maintain the proposed START II strategic force levels. They want to drive the warhead ceiling down to a figure that Russia can afford! They are urging the beginning of START III negotiations as soon as possible, in part, they say, to improve the prospects for Russian ratification of START II. They are arguing, in short, that the entire strategic arms control dialogue is foundering, not because of NATO enlargement, but because the U.S. insists on waiting for START II ratification before beginning formal negotiations on START III. 
It is not so much NATO expansion that is eating away at the U.S.-Russia strategic relationship. Rather, it is Russian weakness and the desire of some Russians either to stop the strategic nuclear arms reduction process at START I levels, or to convince American statesmen and political leaders, in part through a `guilt trip' over NATO enlargement, that a better deal needs to be offered to the Russian side--either in order to secure ratification of the START II Treaty or to supersede it with a START III agreement. 
There is nothing inherently inconsistent between a strong, healthy U.S.-Russian relationship and an expanding NATO. Too many Americans critics of NATO enlargement who posit this as an either/or choice fail to understand the nature of the debate within the Russian Federation.  
NUNN-LUGAR 
In recent trips to Russia and the former Soviet Union it has been clear to me that NATO enlargement is unlikely to have a negative impact on our broad and deep cooperation with the Russian government to reduce the threat from weapons of mass destruction. My colleagues have expressed their concern that our successful cooperative dismantlement and destruction programs may falter as NATO enlarges. 
For the past year or two, while NATO issues were being addressed by senior diplomats, Nunn-Lugar activities continued along their steady path, undisrupted. The programs are proceeding well, with no signs of NATO enlargement hindering or damaging our ongoing destruction and dismantlement efforts. 
To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has deactivated 4,700 nuclear warheads, destroyed 255 ICBMs, eliminated 252 ICBM launchers, destroyed 37 bombers, eliminated 95 SLBMs, destroyed 80 SLBM launchers, and sealed 114 nuclear test tunnels. These numbers will continue to climb as we expand our cooperative efforts with Russia. 
Our cooperative programs with Russia on these issues have not slowed down; rather they have made remarkable gains in recent months. Recently, the Russians have indicated their 
willingness to move forward on a range of new projects. Nunn-Lugar will support the elimination of over 20 Russian SS-18 ICBMs each year. At 10 warheads apiece, this removes one of the most feared threats to U.S. strategic forces. 
Nunn-Lugar will support the elimination of over 10 missile submarines per year at three Russian shipyards. Dismantlement projects will include DELTAs and ultimately TYPHOONs, the workhorses and mainstays of the Russian submarine forces. Moscow has also proposed Nunn-Lugar support for transforming the fissile material from dismantled Russian warheads into non-weapons-usable hockey puck shapes for storage at the Mayak fissile material storage facility. This project would provide unprecedented conformation that the Russians are dismantling nuclear warheads, and will speed the safe and secure storage of weapons-usable material. 
Ukraine has been similarly expansive in identifying new areas of cooperation. The Ukrainian government has requested Nunn-Lugar assistance in eliminating SS-24s and associated silos to meet its requirements by 2000. Kiev has also asked for Nunn-Lugar assistance in destroying 44 bombers, as well as over 1,000 advanced air-launch cruise missiles. 
With these major advances in our cooperative destruction and dismantlement programs under Nunn-Lugar, it is difficult to find evidence to support the claim that NATO enlargement is interfering with the larger problem of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Just the opposite, as NATO enlargement has progressed, so have our joint efforts with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union to deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction. 
Therefore I conclude that NATO enlargement and deeper NATO-Russian relations both have immense value for the United States and Europe if they are pursued properly. They are complementary and reinforcing objectives. The best outcome for the United States and Europe is for both tracks to succeed. A zero-sum debate about them, therefore, misses the point. 
The coming votes of European parliaments and the U.S. Senate on NATO enlargement will not simply be decisions over whether to add a few members to a military alliance. These votes will become a statement on the roles of the United States and the countries of Western Europe in the world. The U.S. vote on enlargement will be seen as a sign of whether America intends to maintain its international leadership role, or whether, after the end of the Cold War, the United States intends to retreat and relinquish its status as the world leader. 
It is my hope that America will maintain its position and engagement in the world's arena. We should ratify NATO enlargement and expand the zone of peace and security which has served Western Europe so well for the last fifty years to the central and eastern portions of this important continent.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus. I do so because 2 years ago the Freedom to Farm legislation that the Senator mentioned was passed. That bill has offered, in my judgment, a great deal of opportunity to farmers manage their own land, to make their own marketing decisions. 
But the Senator is correct: There are rules of the game that were negotiated at that time. This amendment reopens the farm bill and is primarily aimed at helping one crop, wheat, and the various States in the country's northern tier. 
The issue before Senators is marketing assistance loans. They allow a farmer to use the year's crop of grain or cotton as collateral for a loan from the Federal Government. The term of the loan is 9 months. At the end of that period, the farmer can either repay the loan or, if the market price of the crop is less than the amount owed on the loan, he can repay the loan at the lower price or forfeit the commodity. Because the loan is a nonrecourse loan, the Government cannot seek any further payment on the loan. 
Simply stated, a wheat farmer at the time of harvest could have sold the grain for the market price at that time. He could have priced the grain before the time of harvest, and in this particular case, if the farmer in Montana had done so, he would have done well. The futures price was high. Even the price at the time of harvest was higher than it is presently. 
In any event, farmers could place the grain under loan--that is, they store it and they take out a loan. If they have good luck within that 9-month period and the price goes up, they can take the higher price. If the price goes down or does not show any appreciation, they can simply take the loan money and the Government is out that money. That is the nature of this business. The loan is a marketing tool. 
I do not want to overemphasize the gravity of this particular instance. The Senator from Montana has pointed out correctly, this is not going to break the bank, and, as a matter of fact, scoring for the amendment shows its effect is estimated at zero. But, in fact, the amendment as I see it does not do a great deal for a wheat farmer in Montana or any other State at this point. Each one of us here can estimate what the price of wheat may be between now and the end of September, but as a new crop comes on, it is unlikely that that price is going to show great appreciation. In short, extending the period of difficulty by a few more months probably does not make a whole lot of difference in the price farmers will ultimately receive. 
It does make a difference, I believe, in setting a precedent with regard to the Freedom to Farm Act. The precedent is that, under other circumstances, other Senators from other States with other crops will come in and point out that things have not gone well for them. They may claim it was a foreign country, or the weather, or whatever, but, in any event, they will ask for a change in the loan or some other policy in the farm bill. In essence, they will attempt disaster relief under the guise of technical changes in the farm bill. In my judgment, that is not a good way to proceed. 
In fairness to Senators from all States, all crops have come together for some rules of the game that are working well. It seems to me very important we work together to make certain that they work better. In due course, we may discuss other remedies that may be more effective. I would like to suggest, for example, to the distinguished Senator from Montana that it is important to all Senators that wheat exports from this country grow. As a matter of fact, it is important that corn exports and soybean exports and rice and cotton and a number of other crops all increase. 
I suggest that we might work with the President on fast-track authority. That would be very, very helpful. I suggest we work with the President to think through our World Trade Organization stance for next year, when multilateral reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers might occur and should occur, and that the emphasis we place on agriculture in negotiations now with the European Union be enhanced substantially, and that the President's pledge in the Miami summit to move toward free trade in the hemisphere be given a boost as the President prepares to travel to the South American continent. 
In short, there are a lot of things we must do as a country to boost our exports. But specifically regarding the problem in wheat--and it is a substantial one for the States that have been stressed, as the Senator from Montana has pointed out--we could work with the President in terms of allocations for Public Law 480. That is an act which is on the books. We can work to increase export credit guarantees for overseas purchases of U.S. wheat. We can work together with the President, the Secretary of Agriculture, and Senators who are engaged in this, and I would like to be one of them, because I believe an increase in wheat exports is tremendously important and it is timely that we do it now as opposed to hereafter. 
I suggest USDA comply with the FAIR Act's requirements that high-value U.S. products such as wheat flour be a higher proportion of export programs. We could be helpful in that respect. 
And, finally, as I have suggested already, we must work now on our export goals with the Trade Representative and the WTO, as well as for each of the bilateral negotiations we must engage in because we do not have fast-track authority. These efforts are likely to be much more powerful in raising the price of wheat without doing violence to the farm bill--as a matter of fact, utilizing the farm bill and all its resources. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to others.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, 
along with Senators Biden, Chafee and Leahy, I am today introducing the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998, a bill to protect outstanding tropical forests in developing countries through Debt for Nature Swaps. We are joined in this effort by Senators Abraham, Akaka, Allard, Cochran, Craig, DeWine, Glenn, Harkin, Inhofe, Jeffords, Johnson, Kempthorne, Kerrey, Kerry, Levin, Moynihan, and Murkowski. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act builds upon the success of President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and extends the debt reduction portion of that initiative to the protection of tropical forests in lower and middle income developing countries outside of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Under the EAI, $154 million has been devoted to environmental protection and child survival in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica and Uruguay. One of the novel features of the EAI has been the linkage between debt reduction and the generation of local funds for the environmental protection and child survival. Whereas the U.S. receives dollar payments for the remaining principal payments after debt reduction, interest streams on the remaining debt are channeled into these local funds. 
The first Debt for Nature bill enacted into law was the `Debt for Nature Exchange' provision of the International Finance and Development Act of 1989. Under the authority of the Biden Lugar bill, the U.S. Agency for International Development has established environmental endowment funds in Costa Rica, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, Madagascar, Mexico, Panama, and the Philippines. By committing $ 95 million of its own funds, US AID has leveraged an additional $51 million. This is an effective use of scarce federal conservation dollars. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 is a companion bill to H.R. 2870, coauthored by Representatives Rob Portman (R.-Ohio), John Kasich (R- Ohio) and Lee Hamilton (R.-Indiana), which was recently ordered to be reported by the House International Relations Committee. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 would authorize the use of three `debt for nature' mechanisms to protect outstanding tropical forests in lower and middle income developing countries. 
Under the Buy Back option, an eligible country would be able to buy back its debt at its asset value in exchange for its willingness to place an additional forty percent of this value in local currency in a tropical forest fund. Suppose, for example, that the asset value of the country's debt was fifty cents on the dollar. In return for being allowed to buy back its debt at its asset value, the developing country would have to agree to place forty percent of that value, or twenty cents, into a fund to protect its tropical forests. 
Under this option, there would be no cost to the United States Government since the debt is being bought back at its value as determined under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. 
Second, the bill authorizes a Debt Swap option under which a nonfederal individual or organization would be able to engage in Debt for Nature Swaps with lower income developing nations. These purchasers would work with the United States government, but would use their own funds to assist these developing countries to reduce or buy back their bilateral debt owed to the United States Government in return for their placing local currencies in a tropical forest fund. 
Under this second option, there would also be no cost to the United States Government because the financial assistance involved would come from nongovernmental or private entities. 
Third, the bill authorizes a debt reduction mechanism based upon the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. Under the EAI Model, the developing country is allowed to place the interest on the reduced debt instrument in a tropical forest fund to be administered by a tropical forest board within that country. 
When the third option is exercised, the bill authorizes appropriations to compensate the United States Treasury for the reduction in the revenue stream which occurs. However, as in the case of the EAI, these funds would be effectively leveraged because the amounts placed by a eligible country in its tropical forest fund would exceed the amount of revenues foregone by the United States Treasury. For example, in the case of the EAI, $90 million in U.S. funds resulted in $154 million being placed by the Latin American and Caribbean countries in these local funds. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act applies to concessional loans made under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and credits granted under the Agricultural Trade and Assistance Act of 1954. It is consistent with established Treasury Department debt reduction practices as well as with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. 
The bill authorizes $50 million in FY 99, $125 million in FY 2000 and $225 million in FY 2001, subject to appropriations. 
Within each developing country, the tropical forest fund would be administered by a commission representing a majority of local nongovernmental, community development and scientific and academic organizations, representatives of the host government and a representative of the United States Government. 
The tropical forest fund could be used to provide grants for the following purposes:

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to combat fraud and waste in the food stamp program--in this case, the fraud and waste results from deceased individuals being counted as food stamp recipients. At my request, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has recently completed an inquiry into groups of ineligible persons being counted as food stamp recipients. In the report being released today, GAO reported that 26,000 deceased individuals in four states were on the food stamp rolls. My bill will require the Social Security Administration to share information from its Death Master file with state food stamp agencies to verify that no deceased individuals are counted as members of food stamp households, either increasing a households' benefits or allowing an individual to illegally receive benefits in the deceased person's name. 
Last year, GAO reported to the Agriculture Committee that over $3 million in food stamp benefits were being overpaid to prisoners' households. In response, we passed legislation to stop prisoners from receiving payments. In follow-up to the prisoner study and legislation, I requested that GAO determine if other ineligible individuals were similarly being counted as members of food stamp households. Today GAO will release the details of their study showing that, over a 2-year period, about 26,000 deceased individuals in the four states examined (California, Texas, New York, and Florida) were counted as members of food stamp households. According to GAO, this resulted in overpayments of food stamp benefits of an estimated $8.6 million in four states alone. 
Current law requires that households notify their local welfare office of any changes in the makeup of the household within ten days. The GAO report showed that the deceased individuals were counted in food stamp households for an average of four months; and, in a few instances, the deceased individuals were counted as beneficiaries for the full two years the review was conducted. This is unacceptable particularly since this type of fraud can easily be prevented. 
Mr. President, one federal agency has the information to prevent this fraud and abuse, but is not sharing it with other agencies issuing federal benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a Death Master File that compiles death information from a wide variety of sources and is considered the most comprehensive list of death information available in the federal government. According to the GAO, a match using SSA's Death Master File information could be a cost-effective method for identifying such individuals in food stamp households and eliminating these overpayments. States already rely on the SSA to verify the social security numbers of food stamp applicants. Therefore, a system already exists in one branch of the federal government that, with some modifications, could stop these overpayments. 
Although the Social Security Administration agrees that a portion of their death information can be shared with the states and the Department of Agriculture for food stamp program purposes, in SSA's comments to GAO it does not believe it has the authority, under current law, to share all of the death information. Therefore, I am introducing legislation that will require the Commissioner of SSA to establish cooperative arrangements with each state agency that administers the food stamp program that will allow the sharing of all death data. My bill then requires the food stamp program to provide the information necessary for the Commissioner to verify that no deceased individual is being counted as part of a food stamp household. 
The Food Stamp program provides a safety net for millions of people. We cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine the food stamp program. Integrity is essential to ensure a program that can serve those in need. It is Congress' responsibility to play a role in ending fraud and abuse in all federally funded programs. This legislation is an important step in ending fraud and abuse in the Food Stamp program.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Israeli membership in a United Nations regional group. I am delighted to join Senator Moynihan in bringing this resolution to the attention of our colleagues in the Senate. 
Over the years, many in the Congress have risen to comment on the United Nations. Many have been critical or skeptical about the role the Untied Nations can and does play in world affairs. Many have been laudatory as well. There is a division in the Congress about the extent to which the United Nations helps to advance U.S. interests and world peace. Last year, the Congress devoted an enormous amount of time on legislation to pay our arrears to the U.N. and the conditions and reforms which must be met before disbursement of our payments. That legislative effort is still continuing. There are many disagreements about the United Nations and I don't wish to revisit or bridge the gap between these views. 
But, Mr. President there is an important United Nations issue on which all members of the Congress can agree and that is the resolution we are introducing today. Senator Moynihan and I are joined by nearly forty members of the Senate who believe that an institutional injustice, based on political reasons, has been perpetrated on the state of Israel because it has been denied membership in a U.N. `regional group.' On the surface, this denial would appear to be a minor oversight or slight snub of a long-standing member of the United Nations. But, it is much more than that. 
U.N. regional group membership confers eligibility to serve on the Security Council and other important committees of the United Nations such as the International Court of Justice and the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Nominations of members to serve on U.N. committees are made by the regional groups. Israel does not belong to any regional group. Indeed, Israel is the only country in the United Nations that can not claim membership in any regional group. As such, it is ineligible for membership in the influential committees in the U.N. Paradoxically, Iran, Cuba, Syria and Libya enjoy this privilege denied Israel. 
As with the United States Congress and most every legislative or deliberative body, much of the real work is performed in committees, councils and other smaller deliberative bodies. To be denied membership in these committees is to be denied the opportunity to influence important decisions and actions of the United Nations. It is unfair and unjust and should be rectified as soon as possible. 
Israel has not been allowed to join its natural regional group of the Middle East and has expressed interest in joining the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG) regional group. The WEOG group includes Western European democracies, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Turkey. 
The resolution we are introducing today urges the President to help facilitate Israel's membership in an appropriate U.N. regional group. Under current circumstances, an appropriate regional group is most likely to be the WEOG. It further urges the administration to report to the Congress on the steps it has taken to assist Israel's membership in a U.N. regional group and the success or failure of those efforts. 
Mr. President, I ask that all members take note of this resolution. It seeks to bring full equality to Israel's membership in the United Nations. I am confident that it will be supported by the entire body.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on February 1, 1998, Lane A. Ralph celebrated his 20th anniversary of service in the Indiana State Office of the United States Senate. In recognition of this milestone achievement, and with deepest appreciation, I commend him. 
An alumnus of Indiana State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and a Master's of Public Administration, Lane joined my state office staff during my second year of membership in the Senate. In the ensuing years, Lane has worn many hats with unbridled enthusiasm, vast energy and selfless commitment. 
In 1980, Lane rose to the challenge of serving two senators, as Senator Dan Quayle and I established the only combined state office in the country. When Senator Dan Coats joined the Senate in 1988, Lane continued his selfless commitment to serve both of us, ceaselessly offering sage council, valued continuity and dedication to a shared purpose. Lane has consistently articulated a vision of humane government and has demonstrated a genuine commitment to public service. He has served with humility, compassion and empathy for those in need. 
As the Director of Projects for the United States Senate State of Indiana Office, Lane has provided leadership with integrity and intelligence. He has developed an extraordinary encyclopedic-knowledge of people, places, facts and issues which affect the quality of life of all Hoosiers. He has cultivated a comprehensive network of contacts in federal, state and local government and among community leaders who value his responsible and credible expertise, as well as his well-reasoned approach to public policy. 
Lane's leadership in environmental issues is well-known throughout Indiana. He has been a steadfast advocate of soil and water conservation, clean air and water, better forest management and responsible hazardous waste disposal. In his collaborations with Operation Lifesaver, Lane has worked tirelessly to educate Hoosiers in railroad-crossing safety. As an expert in public works issues, he has assisted elected officials, municipal administrators and concerned citizens enhance Indiana's roads, drinking-water systems and planning mechanisms. 
In his many years of service, Lane has consistently demonstrated a talent for forthrightness and for clarifying the intricacies of complex situations. He cuts to the heart of concerns and issues with a knack for asking key questions. Lane is fairminded and industrious with people from all walks of life, balancing the interests of conflicting parties and affably fostering collaborative partnerships. 
Apart from his distinguished career of public service, Lane has been a loving and generous partner to his wife, Ruth, throughout their 18 years of marriage. He is a caring and supportive father to his two daughters, Elina and Emily. He is also personally, my trusted and loyal friend. 
For his honesty, sincerity and integrity, for his dedication to excellence and for his genuine decency, I commend Lane A. Ralph for 20 remarkable years of service.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reauthorize those child nutrition provisions expiring in 1998. The child nutrition programs have been critically important in helping meet the nutritional needs of our children. Although not all child nutrition programs need to be reauthorized, this process gives us the opportunity to review all programs under the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966. 
As an Indianapolis school board member and the city's mayor in the late 1960's and early 1970's, I saw firsthand the need to provide nutritional assistance to children. Since that time, the child nutrition programs have changed in many ways. Today's programs have been successful in ensuring that our nation's children have access to nutritious foods, providing a critical safety net for children. Although the programs may need some fine tuning, the programs have ensured that America's school children, in a country of abundance, have a chance to eat. This is fundamental and something we must preserve. 
Some of the larger programs that must be reauthorized include: 1) the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, often referred to as the WIC program; 2) State Administrative Expenses, a program which provides grants to states to help cover general administrative costs associated with child nutrition programs; 3) the WIC Farmers' Market program which allows states and tribal organizations to offer special WIC vouchers to buy fresh produce; 4) the Summer Food Service program which provides reimbursements for meals served to children in summer programs operated in lower-income areas; and 5) the requirement to use certain funds to purchase commodities to maintain commodity assistance for child nutrition programs. In addition, there are a few other expiring provisions that must be reauthorized. This bill extends all expiring programs through 2003. Although it is not necessary to reauthorize the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, we hope to review and improve those programs during this reauthorization process. 
The child nutrition programs continue to successfully feed our nation's children to help them prepare for the future. In 1997, approximately 89,000 schools enrolling 46 million children participated in the National School Lunch program. Although participation in the school breakfast program is not as large as that in the school lunch program, it has continued to grow. Since 1994, school breakfast participation has increased about 13% so that now over 70% of schools operating a school lunch program also operate a school breakfast program. 
The WIC program, which provides nutritious foods and other support to lower-income infants and children (up to age 5), and pregnant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women, has been successful at reducing the number of low-birth-weight babies. Its success has led to strong support over the years. In 1997, average monthly WIC participation was 7.4 million persons. In many states, the program has reached the long sought after goal of full funding. This year as we reauthorize the program, we will look to see if there are ways to make this successful program run even better. 
Senators Harkin, McConnell and Leahy have joined with me today to introduce this important bill. I wish to stress that this bill is a starting point for debate on child nutrition reauthorization. I am sure that the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee as well as the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the subcommittee have additional ideas to improve these programs. Nutrition programs in the Congress have a long history of bipartisan support and cooperation and I am certain that we will continue that tradition. I look forward to working with them and other members of the Agriculture Committee, on both sides of the aisle, to craft a thoughtful and sensible bill to reauthorize the child nutrition programs. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in full in the Record.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for the pending fast-track reauthorization legislation. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, I would like to begin by stressing the importance of fast track to U.S. agriculture. In 1996, agricultural exports reached a record $60 billion, but import barriers, export subsidies, and state trading enterprises continue to distort world commodity markets. These distortions put America's farmers and agribusiness operators at a disadvantage. We must reduce these trade barriers and allow our industry to freely supply the world's markets.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Enhancement of Trade, Security, and Human Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act, a bill that will establish a more deliberative, commonsense approach to U.S. sanctions policy. I'm pleased to be joined by several distinguished colleagues, in introducing this important piece of legislation. 
In recent years, there has been a proliferation in the use of unilateral economic sanctions as a tool of American foreign policy. While unilateral sanctions may be a low cost alternative to the deployment of American Armed Forces abroad--or to milder, less coercive choices--they almost never succeed in achieving their foreign policy objectives. They frequently impose a greater burden on American companies, producers, farmers, and workers than on the intended target country. 
A cardinal test of foreign policy is that when we act internationally, our actions should do less harm to ourselves than to others. Unilateral economic sanctions, unfortunately, often fail this crucial test. 
Mr. President, there have been a large number of studies on unilateral economic sanctions in recent years and they provide some interesting results. Manufacturers revealed that in the period 1993 to 1996, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals 61 times in 35 different countries. Last year, the report of the President's Export Council cited 75 countries representing 52 percent of the world's population that have been subject to or threatened by U.S. unilateral economic sanctions. 
These actions have jeopardized billions in export earnings and hundreds of thousands of American jobs, while weakening our ability to provide humanitarian assistance abroad. In another study, the Institute for International Economics concluded that, in 1995 alone, economic sanctions cost U.S. exports--to 26 countries--between $15-19 billion, and eliminated upwards to 200,000 U.S. jobs, many in high wage export sector. 
The damage to the U.S. economy can have long-term consequences. Once foreign competitors establish a presence in international markets abandoned by the United States, the potential losses begin to magnify. Over time, the cumulative effect of sanctions will be a loss of commercial contracts, but more importantly, may be a loss of confidence in American suppliers and in the United States as a reliable partner to do business. Frequent resort to economic sanctions, however, meritorious they may be, runs the risk of weakening the export sector which has contributed so greatly to our economic prosperity. This weakening effect can, in 
turn, have an adverse effect on our political influence abroad. 
The major difficulty with our increased use of unilateral economic sanctions is that they rarely achieve the foreign policy goals they are intended to achieve. Sanctions frequently give the illusion of action by substituting for more decisive action or by serving as a palliative for those who demand that some action be taken--any action--by the United States against another country with whom we have a disagreement. 
Sanctions can also make it more difficult diplomatically to engage foreign governments in dialogue to help bring about a political opening or a change in behavior. Serious trade sanctions can, in fact, inhibit, rather than facilitate, constructive dialogue with others. 
As a nation, we often seek instant gratification or quick results from our actions. Sanctions, however, take a long time to work and the change in behavior we seek in other countries will most often take place incrementally over time. In some cases, our sanctions have the unintended consequences of providing authoritarian leaders a basis for increasing their political support and rally opposition to the United States because our sanctions can be used to divert popular anger and resentment away from their own mis-deeds and mis-rule. 
Unilateral sanctions almost never help those we want to assist, they frequently harm the United States more than the sanctioned country and undermine our international economic competitiveness and economic security. Most regrettably, unilateral sanctions have become a policy of first choice when other policy alternatives exist. 
Nonetheless, some economic sanctions are effective and, therefore, must remain a tool of American foreign policy. Multilateral, unlike unilateral, sanctions have frequently advanced American national interests. The multilateral sanctions against Saddam Hussein following Iraq's aggression against Kuwait have slowed down Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program. Similarly, international sanctions aimed at Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia functioned to isolate them diplomatically and protect United States and allied interests in the Balkans. The international sanctions against apartheid in South Africa in the 1980's had a significant influence on bringing about a nonviolent peaceful transition in that country. 
Finally, the broad consensus to oppose Soviet expansion through export restraints on East-West trade in the Coordinating Committee, or CoCom, proved to be enormously effective. Most economic sanctions, whether unilateral or multilateral, must be in place for a long time before they are effective and their success will almost always be dependent upon extensive multilateral cooperation and compliance. 
Nothing in our proposed legislation prohibits unilateral economic sanctions. There are situations where other foreign policy options have been exhausted and where the actions of others are so outrageous or so threatening to the United States and our national interests that our response, short of the use of force, must be firm and unambiguous. In such instances, economic sanctions may be a useful instrument of American foreign policy. 
Mr. President, my proposed legislation is prospective. It will not affect existing U.S. sanctions. It will apply only to unilateral sanctions and to those sanctions intended to achieve foreign policy or national security objectives. It would exclude, by definition, U.S. trade laws, Jackson-Vanik and munitions list controls. It would not address the complex and important issue of state and local sanctions designed to achieve foreign policy goals, although these so-called vertical sanctions are increasingly important features of American foreign policy. 
More specifically, Mr. President, this legislation seeks to establish clear guidelines and informational requirements to help us understand better the likely consequences of our actions before we opt to impose economic sanctions. We should know in advance of voting on sanctions legislation what our goals are, the anticipated economic, political and humanitarian benefits and costs to the United States and other 
countries, the possible impact on our reputation as a reliable supplier, the other policy options that have been explored, and whether the proposed sanctions are likely to contribute to achieving the foreign policy objectives sought by legislation. Comparable requirements are also in the bill for sanctions mandated by the executive branch. 
Once sanctions are implemented, the bill also requires an annual report from the President detailing the degree to which sanctions have accomplished U.S. goals, as well as their impact on our economic, political and humanitarian interests, including our relations with other countries. 
The bill also provides for more active and timely consultations between Congress and the President. It provides Presidential waiver authority in emergencies or if he determines it is in the national interest. 
It includes a sunset provision that would terminate unilateral economic sanctions after 2 years duration unless the Congress or the President acts to reauthorize them. 
It includes language on contract sanctity to help ensure the United States is a reliable supplier. 
It identifies U.S. agriculture as an especially vulnerable sector of our economy that has borne a disproportionate burden stemming from U.S. economic sanctions. Because of this, there is discretionary authority for agricultural assistance in the bill. In addition, the bill opposes agricultural embargoes as a foreign policy weapon and urges that economic sanctions be targeted as narrowly as possible in order to minimize harm to innocent people and humanitarian activities. 
Mr. President, my sanctions reform bill represents an attempt to develop an improved and comprehensive approach to an important foreign policy issue. We, in the Congress, are often called upon to make difficult choices between conflicting interests or among our core values as a nation and our international interests. 
These are frequently hard choices that should be given careful attention and preceded by careful analysis. We should never turn our back on our fundamental values of supporting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms abroad but we should ask whether we can alter the behavior of other countries by imposing sanctions on them. Many times we cannot do so and many times we exacerbate the very behavior we hope to reverse. There is no magic formula for influencing the behavior of other countries, but unilateral economic sanctions are rarely the answer. 
Nothing in this bill prevents the imposition of U.S. unilateral economic sanctions or dictates a particular trade-off between American core values and our commercial and other interests. The steps detailed in this bill provide for better policy procedures so that consideration of economic sanctions are preceded by a more deliberative process by which the President and the Congress can make reasoned and balanced choices affecting the totality of American values and interests. 
Mr. President, I feel strongly about this issue. I hope my colleagues will join the other original cosponsors by taking a close look at this legislation. I welcome their support and believe that if we deal with the sanctions issues in a careful and systematic manner, we can make a significant positive contribution to our national interest.

Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator. I think we both agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their materials, known-how, as well as associated means of delivery might very well be the number one national security threat facing the United States. 
As the Senator knows, when his resolution was raised at the Committee on Foreign Relations business meeting on October 9, 1997, I was concerned about the meaning of paragraph (2) of section (1). Paragraph (2) of section (1) states that: `if the Russian response in inadequate' to Presidential demands that the Russian Government take concrete actions to stop governmental and nongovernmental entities from providing ballistic missile technology and technical advice to Iran, `the United States should impose sanctions on the responsible Russian entities in accordance with Executive Order 12938 on the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and reassess cooperative activities with Russia.' 
I was joined by several colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee who were also unsure of the intent of the Senator's language as well as the definition of the term `cooperative activities'. As the Senator knows, many of our colleagues in Congress and in the executive branch believe that our ongoing cooperative efforts with Russia to dismantle, eliminate, destroy, and convert weapons of mass destruction, their materials, know-how, as well as associated means of delivery is vital of the national security interests of the United States. In particular, I am proud of the steps of our Department of Defense, Department of Energy and other executive agencies have made in reducing the threats to the United States from weapons and materials of mass destruction. 
I thank the Senator for taking the time to contact me personally and for working with me to ensure that this resolution does not have the unintended consequence of calling in question these critical national security programs. I believe the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, the Department of Energy's Material Protection Control and Accounting Program, and others have played and will continue to play a critical role in serving the national security interests of the United States. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today the Senate completes action on the Agricultural Research, Extension and Education Reform Act of 1997. This legislation was approved by a unanimous rollcall vote of the 18 members of the Senate Agriculture Committee in July. I commend Senator Harkin and all members of the committee for their bipartisan approach and cooperative efforts in constructing this legislation. 
Because research programs were only authorized through 1997 in last year's farm bill, the Senate Agriculture Committee has had the opportunity this year to review agricultural research, extension and education funding. The committee gathered testimony through four hearings in March and received more than 100 responses to some relevant questions that I posed publicly in January. 
With the growth in world population, U.S. producers may well need to triple their production in the next few decades to meet growing demand for food and spare the world's rain forests from being uprooted in a desperate effort to expand production. 
To increase future food production, our Nation must devote additional resources to agricultural research. This bill provides new funding for agricultural research to address critical emerging issues related to future food production, environmental protection and farm income. Food genome science, food safety, agricultural biotechnology and precision agriculture are key areas that need additional resources to meet the challenges that face U.S. farmers. 
This bill also makes significant reforms to the current agricultural research system. This system has served us well. To use our available resources most effectively, however, it is important to ensure more collaboration and efficiency as well as achieve greater accountability. We cannot overlook the relevance or merit of the research, extension, and education programs. 
I urge all Members of the Senate to support this important legislation.

The request for proposals [RFP] that will be published by the USDA could be very specific in its requests.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reform the federal tobacco quota and price support programs. This legislation would provide economic assistance to tobacco quota owners, tobacco producers, and tobacco-dependent communities as they make the transition to the free market. 
Nearly every American is aware of the global tobacco settlement between 40 States' attorneys general and cigarette companies. Tobacco farmers and their communities were conspicuously omitted from these negotiations. Yet the settlement offers Congress a unique opportunity to provide economic assistance to tobacco farmers while ending the federal government's support for tobacco production. 
My legislation would buy out tobacco marketing quotas, provide transition payments to tobacco producers, phase out the price support program, and provide economic assistance to tobacco-dependent communities. The cost of these reforms would be approximately $15 billion and would be paid for with funds from the tobacco settlement. Because farmers were not considered in the negotiations that led to this settlement, this amount would be added to the current $368.5 billion. 
Under my legislation, the tobacco quota program would end in 1999 and, beginning that year, the price support program would be phased out over three years. In 1999, price supports would decline by 25 percent, then by an additional 10 percent in each of 2000 and 2001, and would end thereafter. 
Quota owners would receive $8 for every pound of quota they own. They could elect to receive either first, a lumpsum payment in 1999 if they agree to cease tobacco production altogether, or second, three equal annual payments beginning in 1999 if they choose to continue to produce tobacco. 
Tobacco producers would receive transition payments of 40 cents per pound over 3 consecutive years for tobacco quota that they lease or rent on a cash-rent or crop-share basis. Transition payments would be based on the average of at least 3 years of production over the 1993-97 period. Producers who both own and lease quota would receive transition payments based on their leased quota and a buyout based on the quota they own. 
Under this legislation, producers would be able to grow whatever amounts of tobacco they choose--free of Government control. Most other farm programs went through a similar change just last year when Congress passed the freedom-to farm legislation. The global tobacco settlement would provide the funds to assist tobacco farmers as they join other farmers in the free market. 
Communities that are economically dependent on tobacco production would receive $300 million in economic assistance. Eligible States would receive block grants to facilitate the development of alternative crops, industries, and infrastructure. Recipient States would then determine the areas most in need of assistance. 
Mr. President, with or without a settlement, the forces to reform the tobacco program have been converging for some time now and they can no longer be ignored. High-domestic price supports have hurt the competitiveness of U.S.-grown tobacco. Exports of tobacco have fallen, while imports have grown. Congress has already ended Government control over nearly every other farm commodity. And, most importantly, Congress cannot ask Americans to accept Federal support for tobacco production when we are considering legislation to settle claims that stem directly from tobacco use. 
Clearly, the tobacco program may not be sustainable for much longer. With that reality facing all tobacco producers, we should not pass up this opportunity to provide economic assistance to farmers and their communities.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to thank the floor managers for agreeing to include the city of Indianapolis flexible grant demonstration amendment in the manager's amendment to S. 462. 
The Lugar amendment would authorize the city of Indianapolis,in coordination with its public housing authority, to receive and combine program allocations from Federal housing assistance funds so that it has the flexibility to determine the best use of these funds. This amendment has the support both of Mayor Goldsmith and of the Indianapolis Housing Authority. 
My flexible grant demonstration amendment would give the city of Indianapolis, in coordination with the Indianapolis Housing Authority, the ability to receive and combine covered housing assistance to which the Indianapolis Housing Authority would otherwise be entitled. Covered housing assistance is defined as operating assistance, modernization assistance, section 8 certificate and voucher programs assistance, capital and operating funds assistance, and tenant-based rental assistance. It does not include other housing assistance programs for which the city or its public housing authority would otherwise be able to compete. 
This demonstration program would last for 2 to 5 years and would serve a variety of purposes. It could be used to provide incentives for low-income working families to become economically self-sufficient, to reduce costs of housing assistance by providing funds in the most effective manner, to increase the stock of affordable low-income housing and housing choices for low-income families, to increase home ownership among low-income families and for other ways in which the city in coordination with the public housing agency could make more effective use of limited housing funds. 
Under no circumstances would there be any reduction in the number of low-income families who would otherwise be served with housing assistance had these amounts not been combined. In fact, by allowing greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness in the use of these funds, my amendment will increase and enhance housing assistance to lower income families who need it. 
I urge support for my amendment.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I did not object to the Ford sense-of-the-Senate amendment to S. 1061. I agree with its sentiment that the needs of tobacco farmers should be taken into account when Congress considers the proposed tobacco settlement. 
I wish to express reservations about two points in the Ford amendment's language. First, the amendment says that any compensation to tobacco growers should `be included within the $368.5 billion in payments.' However, we do not now know that the size of the settlement will be precisely $368.5 billion. It may be larger. Moreover, payments to growers might be additive to the settlement amount, whatever its size. 
Second, the amendment expresses a desire to ensure `the continued administration of a viable federal tobacco program which operates at no net cost to the taxpayer.' I favor compensating tobacco farmers for the equity they have built up in the quota system over the years. Such a buyout of the quota program should lead to, at most, a minimal price-supporting role for the Government. That is what we have done for the producers of most other commodities in the 1996 FAIR Act: Transition payments, and price supports at market-clearing levels. 
I believe that to continue the present tobacco program without change is not likely to be viable, so I find the amendment's language acceptable. Because some might read it to imply an endorsement of the status quo, I simply want to register my view that such a reading is neither required by the amendment's language, nor in the long-term interest of tobacco producers.

This concurrent resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States Government should fully participate in EXPO 2000 in the year 2000, in Hannover, Germany. It further states that the United States should encourage the academic community and the private sector in the United States to support this worthwhile undertaking. 
The theme of EXPO 2000 is `Humankind-Nature-Technology'. It's purpose is to provide a forum for a worldwide dialog on the challenges, goals, and solutions for the sustainable development of mankind in the 21st century. 
The United States must maintain its status as a leading political, intellectual and economic power. We must continue our strong interest in strengthening political freedom and human rights movements, encouraging open market economies, and stimulating technological advancement around the world. 
Participation in EXPO 2000 will allow the United States to preserve its leadership role and to continue providing the example the rest of the world attempts to imitate. 
Mr. President, I understand that a similar concurrent resolution will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Oxley, Hamilton, Bereuter, and Pickett. 
It is my hope that the United States will play a role at EXPO 2000 in Hannover, Germany, commensurate with its position in the world.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Army Sgt. Kelly S. Yarde, who hails from Evansville. Sergeant Yarde, who is currently serving in Bosnia with Operation Joint Guard, was moved by the sadness he saw in the faces of Bosnia's children each time he went out on patrol. In response, he appealed to the people of his hometown and surrounding areas, asking for donations of school supplies, toys and sporting goods that he could give to these children. 
Local media helped to publicize Sergeant Yarde's plea, and the community responded in magnificent fashion. Hundreds of donations have already poured in, and are continuing to arrive at collection bins set up at local businesses. Some of the gifts have already been shipped to Bosnia, and Sergeant Yarde has, on his own time, taken them to orphanages and refugee centers. 
Americans are, by their nature, very generous people. The fact that we can not solve every problem in the world should not prevent us from solving at least some of them. I am pleased and proud that Sergeant Yarde had the foresight to identify a problem that he could help to solve, and had the faith in his community to ask for help in solving it. I am equally pleased that the people of Evansville and the surrounding area responded so generously to Sergeant Yarde's plea on behalf of the children of Bosnia.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in my home State of Indiana, corn refining adds substantially to the value of our corn crop. On average, Indiana produces 800 million bushels of corn annually. It is estimated that corn refining--primarily through the production of high-fructose corn syrup--adds about $200 million to the value of Indiana's corn crop. In addition to enhancing the value of our corn crop, corn refining results in the direct employment of approximately 1,700 Hoosiers with an estimated payroll of over $70 million. 
It is for the above reasons that I join Senators Grassley, Harkin, Daschle, and Kerrey in introducing a concurrent resolution instructing the United States Trade Representative to take the appropriate actions in regards to a preliminary imposition of antidumping duties against United States exports of high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico. These duties were imposed on June 25 in response to a petition brought to the Mexican Government by the sugar producers' organization in Mexico. 
Prior to our adoption of the North American Free-Trade Agreement [NAFTA], duties on high-fructose corn syrup were 15 percent. This year, under our negotiated agreements, with should have dropped to 9.5 percent. The preliminary antidumping finding has disrupted the planned program for the duty reduction on this important agricultural product. Duties now in effect because of this decision are as much as four to five times the pre-NAFTA levels. 
Mr. President, this case involves important matters of international trade policy and the interests of U.S. agricultural producers. The preliminary finding of the Mexican Government appears to be in violation of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Antidumping. This agreement requires that governments fully investigate allegations brought by private parties before opening government investigations. In this case, Mexico's sugar industry stated that there was no production of high-fructose corn syrup in Mexico. This is inaccurate which means the Mexican sugar industry did not have standing under WTO rules to file this case. 
Three years ago this chamber helped take a major step toward creating a growing free-trade area in the Western Hemisphere. Passage of NAFTA was not an easy matter, as you will recall. However, those of us from agricultural areas--with strong support from the U.S. corn industry--worked hard to achieve its passage. 
With the passage of last years FAIR Act, we reduced price and income support for U.S. corn farmers. Increasing exports is the only alternative for U.S. farmers to maintain a stable level of farm income. One of the best ways to continue agricultures export performance is to ensure that unwarranted and unfair trade barriers are not erected. I hope you will join me in supporting this resolution.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment that I introduce comes to the floor because no funding for the National Endowment for Democracy is in this bill. It has been zeroed out. The bill as written proposes to eliminate the National Endowment for Democracy, a program that has been enthusiastically supported by every administration, Republican and Democratic, since President Ronald Reagan's first term, and by every Congress, Republican and Democratic, since 1983, when it was first launched. 
The amendment we are proposing would continue funding for the National Endowment for Democracy at this year's level, namely $30 million. It does not seek an increase in funding. But it proposes that the funding continue. 
The amendment would shift $30 million from the State Department Capital Investment Fund in the bill to the National Endowment for Democracy. 
I point out, Mr. President, that even with the $30 million shifted from the State Department Capital Investment Fund, that fund will still exceed by $11 million the administration's request. 
The capital investment fund is an important initiative. Many of us have written to Secretary Albright and the President about the importance of strengthening the State Department's technological and communications capability. They are significant and important deficiencies in the State Department. And this bill will go a long way to correct them. 
But, Mr. President, the administration requested a total of $64 million for these purposes. The bill before us includes a funding level of $105 million, some $41 million over the President's request. Therefore, Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the administration favors our amendment, it favors support of the amendment because it provides for the National Endowment for Democracy and all that had been requested, and more, for the Capital Investment Fund of the State Department. 
Let me point out, Mr. President, an important editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal this morning that very succinctly sums up the case that we make.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Harkins's amendment to increase the tobacco deficit-reduction assessment and devote the proceeds to enforcement of the Food and Drug Administration's rules to deter underage smoking. 
Senator Harkin has discussed this amendment with me and I find it fully consistent with my own views on the urgency of preventing smoking. The increased assessment will still contribute to future deficit reduction because it will assist us in preventing smoking. When a young person makes the mistake of beginning to smoke, serious health risks are created for the individual. The problems do not end here, however. A decision to smoke is also a decision to increase potential future health care costs. Many of these costs are borne by the Federal and State governments. People who do not begin smoking will be less a burden on the Nation's health care system and on the Nation's treasury. 
The primary benefit of the amendment, however, will be on the lives of individual young people. If they do not begin smoking in youth, they are unlikely to start once they attain greater maturity. Preventing smoking at an especially vulnerable age is a national priority and I commend Senator Harkin for advancing it in this amendment.

Mr. LUGAR. I am aware that recent studies by USDA, GAO, the Kansas City Fed, and the Rural Policy Research Institute have all noted the difficulty rural businesses, particularly new businesses, have in obtaining capital. The studies also suggest that a lack of adequate credit for rural businesses is affecting the economic growth of those communities.

Mr. LUGAR. I, too, am concerned that rural entrepreneurs do not have the same kind of access to capital markets as do their nonrural counterparts. I am also aware of concerns raised by various groups in regards to my esteemed colleague's amendment. I believe a hearing will offer the opportunity to vet all points of view. It is my intent that the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry hold a hearing on rural and agricultural credit as soon as possible in the hopes that we can find a timely solution to this problem.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill moves to conference to resolve differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill, I am hopeful the conferees will give careful consideration to the Senate provision addressing the issue of the disposal of the U.S. chemical weapons stockpile. This provision requires an additional report to Congress by the Secretary of Defense on options available to the Department of Defense for the disposal of chemical weapons and agents. 
Since 1985, Congress has directed the Army to conduct a number of studies and evaluations of our Nation's chemical weapons stockpile in order to determine the safest and most effective method of disposal. Regardless of the destruction timetables set forth in the recently ratified Chemical Weapons Convention, U.S. chemical agents and munitions must be disposed of by 2004 as a matter of national policy. 
Determining a safe and cost effective method for disposal of our Nation's chemical weapons stockpile is an issue of concern to many communities and citizens located near the Army's eight CW storage sites. In my home State more than 1,000 1-ton containers of bulk VX nerve agent are stored at the Newport Army Chemical Activity, Newport, IN. 
At the direction of Congress, the Army examined a range of disposal options and methods and involved significant public participation in the review process. The Army also considered the recommendations contained in an independent report on certain alternative technologies prepared by the National Academy of Sciences at the request of Congress. 
On December 6, 1996, the Army recommended that the Department of Defense utilize a neutralization process for disposal of bulk chemical agents stored at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and Newport, IN. On January 17, 1997, the Department of Defense authorized the Army to proceed with the necessary activities to pilot test two neutralization-based processes for the destruction of chemical agents stored at Aberdeen and Newport. 
As the conference meets to resolve differences between the House and Senate-passed versions of the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill, I am hopeful conferees will be mindful of the important progress made by Congress and the Army since 1986 to address this issue.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, momentarily, when the draft of my amendment arrives, I will send it to the desk. For the moment, I will simply mention that the amendment I am about to offer, I will offer on behalf of myself, Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, and Senator Levin. 
Mr. President, I indicate that additional original cosponsors will be Senators Hagel, Jeffords, Chafee, Specter, D'Amato, Frist, Gorton, Snowe, Collins, Kennedy, Biden, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lieberman, Byrd, Reed of Rhode Island, Daschle, and Robb. 
I want to especially recognize Senator Domenici for his contribution to our work on this amendment. 
Mr. President, let me state at the outset that Congress established, in 1991, with strong bipartisan support, what is known as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, the CTR. 
Last year, the Senate, in a 96 to 0 vote, amended and enlarged this important program through the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation entitled the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act. 
The CTR program at the Department of Defense, along with its companion programs at the Department of Energy--namely, the Materials Protection Control and Accounting Program [MPC&A] and the International Nuclear Safety Program--have played significant roles in our efforts to reduce the risk to the United States from loose nukes and the dangers inherent in the operations of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. 
Each of these programs plays a key role in enhancing stability around the world and contributes to circumscribing the threats that emanate from weapons and materials of mass destruction. 
The defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998, as reported out of the Committee on Armed Services, cut the funding for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the Materials Protection, Control and Accounting Program and totally eliminated all funding for the International Nuclear Safety Program. 
Our amendment is designed to restore the funding cuts in these three programs.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, behind me are some charts that may help Members understand the issues that we are discussing today. I cited, in my opening statement, as did the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the extraordinary work that has been done with cooperative threat reduction over the years. This chart makes it graphically clear--4,500 warheads deactivated. The background of this situation was one that, at the end of the Soviet Union, the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a number of military officers came to this country from Russia, a number came from Ukraine and Belarus, Kazakhstan and other new states--but the four that I cite originally were all nuclear states, and the questions they posed to the administration of our country and Members of Congress who are interested in this, was strictly, we believe--they said, `You have a vested interest in working with us to deactivate warheads,' and indeed we did. Mr. President, these 4,500 warheads that have been deactivated were all aimed at us. That is the heart of the cooperative threat reduction programs--cooperation in reducing the threat to us, of warheads aimed at us. 
Likewise, 99 ICBM's have been destroyed. They are no longer in the picture at all, in the process of working through, especially, the nonnuclear status for Ukraine, for Kazakhstan; 140 ICBM silos have been eliminated, they are totally out of the picture, in cooperative threat reduction; 20 bombers have been destroyed, and so forth. 
From time to time over the 6 years of the cooperative threat Nunn-Lugar reduction program debates, Members come on this scene--perhaps new to the entire argument--and ask why are we spending money in Russia? Why are we working with Russians on nuclear matters? Mr. President, we are working with Russians to destroy ICBM's, silos, warheads that are aimed at us. In my judgment we ought to do as much of this as we can. I would simply say the thought that some moneys might be nibbled away from the program simply does not meet the security needs of our country. Clearly, we ought to have a high-priority reactivation of all projects that will lead to our security in this area. 
Mr. President, let me describe a process that has been discussed in each of the last 6 years. It is namely how do you get from the priority of what you want to do, to money that is available, obligated, and spent? The cooperative threat reduction programs each year have many challenges to overcome before funds can be obligated. In my opening statement I cited the fact it was April of this year before the funds the Congress appropriated last October could get into action. Why? Because, from the very beginning of the Nunn-Lugar CTR program, an extraordinary number of procedural challenges have been placed in the legislation. 
They were placed there by those who were, frankly, skeptical that money ought to be spent with the Russians for any purpose. But, in any event, by April of this year, we finally had gone through all the hoops of that situation. 
The program requires government-to-government agreement, negotiations then with Russia, with Ukraine, with Kazakhstan, with Belarus, to establish the legal framework for each of these transactions. Each of the implementing agreements has to be negotiated for each project with the ministry responsible in that country for the project. 
Once the agreements are in place by country, by project, by ministry, then a definition phase of the project can begin and that can be lengthy as the Department of Defense negotiates the details with the recipient country. 
Then a contracting process follows. The Department of Defense uses its standard Federal acquisition regulations for all CTR assistance, normally contracting with United States firms to provide that assistance. That assistance mandates free and open competition and maximum protection of taxpayer dollars, but it is lengthy, Mr. President, having gone through all the hoops of the implementing arrangements and the requirement definitions, then the contracting process, identically the same as it is with the Department of Defense for everything else in the world with U.S. firms, open competition. All of that must occur. 
Finally, on an annual basis, DOD must certify the recipient nations are still eligible. We have heard now that Belarus is not, for a variety of reasons, but may become eligible again as its politics and situation may change. Our security problems, with regard to Belarus and those weapons, have not changed, I might add. But once certification, again, is complete, DOD must notify Congress in considerable detail as to how it intends to obligate the appropriated funds. After that notification, and only after that notification, can new agreements of amendments to the existing implementing agreements be negotiated, and only then can DOD obligate the funds which begin the procurement cycle. 
Mr. President, from time to time during this 6-year period of time, this lengthy process of certification and notification and renegotiation and bidding and notification of Congress has taken so long that the whole fiscal year is complete, appropriations committees have taken the moneys off the table, and we go back through the whole process of reappropriating what already had been appropriated. 
I do not argue with the procedures. I simply say they are tediously careful to make sure that everybody has a very good idea of precisely what is occurring, how U.S. firms, in competition with each other, might deal with it and with full notification of the Congress of all of this. 
I reiterated this because I heard in the distinguished other body debate during which it was blandly asserted that there is plenty of money in the pipeline. The argument in the other body no longer centered around the validity of the program but simply said there is lots of money available, no need, really, to further appropriate any more. 
I am asserting there is no more money available, as a matter of fact, for a long list of priority things our country should do for our own security, and to nibble away and cut pieces here and there is not in our national interest, it is not good public policy, and that is why it is time to take time to simply reiterate, through the charts, that dollar for dollar, year for year the money is obligated, it is called for, it is spoken for, it is competed for, and it is examined. 
Mr. President, we ought to get on with the process so that there is no ambiguity if we want to continue to work with the Russians to destroy ICBM's, take warheads off ICBM's, if we want to contain fissile material that is dangerous, if we want to work with Chernobyl-type reactors so they don't explode, not only creating damage in the countries in which the explosion occurs, but through the fallout damage throughout the world. 
This is grim and serious business. For these reasons, I really ask strong support of our amendment. I thank the Chair.  
Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Members who have followed this debate will recall that yesterday afternoon I offered an amendment to the division C of this bill, that portion dealing with the United Nations. Essentially, the task before the Senate, and before our Government as a whole, is how do we relate the United Nations as an organization we have supported, and one important to our foreign policy. It is an international organization that has been under attack in this country. And, we have not paid our bills. 
As I pointed out yesterday, the legislation before us attempts to remedy the situation over a 3-year period of time with 18 pages of very substantial conditions that must be met by the United Nations in order for the United States debt repayment money to flow to that body. 
Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. It substitutes for the 18 pages of conditions in the bill my amendment which says there are no conditions for our payment and we will, in fact, make the payment of $819 million in two installments in 2-years' time. The $819 million has been a sum the administration and the Foreign Relations Committee has agreed that we owe. In addition, we would be receiving approximately $107 million back from the United Nations for peacekeeping services we have offered. 
The two ideas before the Senate are important because this is a turning point of some significance in our foreign policy. In order to understand the amendment today and the bill that it amends, I think it is necessary to go back to square one and ask, why are we in such a predicament? How could the United States fail to pay the United Nations over $1 billion over the course of several years? 
I think the answer, quite frankly, is that there has been a pervasive feeling in the U.S. Senate which we, as Senators, thought were reflecting the country's antipathy to the United Nations, antipathy to bureaucracies and organizational inefficiencies. Many Americans have been told, at least in our Senate debates, that the United Nations preys upon the United States and that we are not in control. But, of course, the leadership the United States has exerted to obtain control of that body is certainly suspect. 
Mr. President, to set the record straight at the outset, a number of national polls have been taken that reflect a 2-to-1 majority of Americans believing the United Nations is very important and that we ought to pay our bills. The polling data goes for many years, but I found especially instructive a poll that indicated on the question: `Do you believe that U.N. member states should always pay their full dues to the U.N. on schedule, or should a state hold back its dues to pressure other members to agree to changes it believes are needed?', Americans, in a Wirthlin Group poll in 1989 conducted for the United Nations Association, 60% of Americans responded that we should always pay the United Nations, pay other countries, whoever. Only 14 percent said you ought to hold back. 
In April 1996 jumping about 7 years ahead, 78 percent of Americans believe that a nation should always pay; 13 percent believe you ought to be able to hold back. 
The American public understands what is fair. They understand what a contract is, what our obligations are as a nation. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, they understand the work the United Nations does, and by an overwhelming majority, the public believes we should not only stay in the United Nations but, as a matter of fact, in a polling item of a Times Mirror poll, the question was, `Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: The United States should cooperate fully with the United Nations?,' 65 percent of Americans agree, 29 percent disagree--well over two-thirds. 
I make that point because I believe we have come to this particular pass because public servants believe somehow it is popular to withhold money from the United Nations; to, in essence, say to the United Nations, `Reform, repent or we will not pay our dues.' 
This is understandable, and the amount of reform needed by the United Nations is sizable. The new Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has supported the United States, who has come to visit with our own Foreign Relations Committee, has not only pledged to make reforms, he is doing that job. Our Ambassador, Mr. Richardson, will have a full-time job working with him to make certain that occurs. 
There are 184 nations involved. We are one of them, ostensibly the most powerful of those nations. Essentially, we are going to have to work with that bureaucracy to pare it down, to pare the budget down. The signs of progress are promising. 
Let me make a major point I hope Members will follow. Of the more than $1 billion the United States agrees that we owe, only 5 percent has anything to do with the bureaucracy, the 
Secretariat of the United Nations, only 5 percent, some $54 million. 
Now, if Members ask, `Well, then, what is the argument about?' The argument is about $650 million or so of peacekeeping expenses that were assumed by our allies for which the United Nations is simply a passthrough for money that we, the United States of America, said we would pay and now we owe to friendly countries. 
Let me cite, so it is not obscure, who we owe money to. We owe money to France, $60.1 million; we owe Great Britain $41 million; the Netherlands $21.3 million; Pakistan $20.1 million; Germany $18.3 million we owe; Belgium $17.3 million; Italy $17.2 million; India $16.1 million; Canada our near neighbor, $14.2 million. This is money we owe to them, not to Kofi Annan, the Secretary General, or the U.N. Secretariat or the organization so frequently criticized on the floor of this body. We owe more than $650 million to other countries who sent their troops out to do work that we wanted them to do. We voted for the peacekeeping resolutions. We said we would send money if they would send men and if they would take on the fighting obligations, or at least the dangers that were involved in often hazardous duty that went beyond simple peacekeeping. That is the money, Mr. President, that is at risk. 
I am not certain Senators understand that we are, in essence, saying to our allies, we will not pay you unless you change the dues structure for us, for the United States. In essence, we not only have failed to pay our allies, but we have said, as a matter of fact, we are not going to pay you. This bill says we won't pay you unless you reduce our U.N. dues to only 20 percent of the budget, as opposed to 25 percent, and unless you reduce our peacekeeping dues to 25 percent as opposed to around 31 percent. Unilaterally, arbitrarily, take it or leave it. That is what is proposed in the legislation in front of us. 
In addition, the legislation, Members will note if they read through the 18 pages of agate type, has at least 38 conditions and hoops other countries and the United Nations must go through in order for us to pay our debts. 
Mr. President, it is strange that we came to this situation through, I think, a misperception of who ought to be paid. Most Americans who understand we owe Great Britain, France, Canada, and Italy, will say, `Why haven't we paid?' And most Americans would understand that our failure to pay will have consequences because we are dealing with these same nations in NATO reform and NATO expansion in trying to determine what the fair shares will be. We are dealing with most of these countries every day in terms of agricultural exports which are very difficult bread-and-butter issues for America. Yet, we take an arbitrary position with regard to the United Nations that we simply will not pay until they go through the hoops of implementing the reforms we insist upon in this bill.

Mr. LUGAR. The distinguished Senator from Delaware yesterday, in responding to a similar argument that I have made today, made the point that, all things considered, he agrees that we ought to pay our debts, that we ought to respond to our contractual obligations, that, in the best of all worlds, this is a principled stand, as I recall his description of it. But the Senator from Delaware said the trail that I am following leads to no payment. 
Now, if I were to ask with some incredulity why a fairly straightforward amendment adopted by the Senate--obviously the House must act and the President must sign the bill--why my course will lead to zero, as the Senator from Delaware characterized it. It is because, as the Senator from Delaware pointed out, he has been negotiating with the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the committee has said, in essence, we are not going anywhere without accommodation of these conditions--at least that was the characterization. Essentially, he was saying that we have gone nowhere for several years, and that we have accumulated debts and will continue to accumulate debts. 
In short, the distinguished Senator from Delaware said, and he described, very candidly, the negotiations that he came to the chairman suggesting a sum of money the administration felt we owed, and the chairman took a very adverse view to that. The Senator from Delaware has been negotiating for quite a long while in trying to get that figure up. 
The Senator from Delaware finally comes to the body yesterday and says essentially, `This is the best I can do. In essence, hopefully, these conditions will be met. Countries, in fact, will meet them and the money will flow, $100 million in the first year fairly easily,' as the Senator characterized, `and it gets tougher in the second and third years. But, nevertheless, somehow this is going to occur.' That is the judgment Senators have to make. 
I will just say very frankly, Mr. President, that we ought to face the situation in a much more straightforward way, because this debate has not occurred in private, nor have our failures to pay our debts occurred in private. It is a very public embarrassment in which the United States of America is stiff-arming our friends, quite apart from whatever damage we are doing to the United Nations. If, in fact, we want to get out of the United Nations, withdraw from it, saying essentially this is a group of people constantly preying upon us and we are tired of that, that is one basic decision Senators might want to make. 
I am suggesting, Mr. President, this bill veers very close to making that decision for us. 
What if the rest of the world, 183 nations, decides that our arbitrary decision here in the Senate is not really where they want to go? What if the United Nations goes bankrupt? What if our allies no longer trust us with regard to peacekeeping, fearing they will not be paid any more than they have been in the past? What if, as a matter of fact, other nations begin to doubt our word and our ability to follow through on contractual obligations we undertake? There is a lot at stake, Mr. President. 
It could very well be that there are some Senators who would say, `We ought to take advantage of our size and weight in the world now. There's no point in worrying about the sensitivities of other nations. We're paying 25 percent of the dues. Our share of the world's wealth right now is about 27 percent, but we don't want to pay that, we want to pay 20 percent. We're not going to take any fuss from any other nation about that.' 
We're going to pay 20 percent of the U.N. dues arbitrarily. Not only that, we are going to take our peacekeeping from 31 percent to 25 percent of the budget. It is too high to begin with. We are tired of paying that. We will pay that, take it or leave it. In essence there are two `take it or leave its,' Mr. President, as the Senator from Delaware characterized the debate yesterday. In essence he has said to the Senate that we either take it or leave it or there will not be any payment at all. The chairman will not agree to it. 
Second, after we get through this process, we say to the rest of the world, `Take it or leave it, because there won't be any payment unless you take our word for what we want to pay and under the conditions that we want to pay it.' 
In essence, Mr. President, this is not very good foreign policy. It is not really a very good stance for the United States at all. I will simply say, what will be the predicaments if we get our way and arbitrarily reduce our dues, and countries either get their moneys or they don't. I predict, Mr. President, the ramifications of this are likely to be very expensive for the United States. 
Not only is it the right thing to do to pay our debts, it is in fact the most effective way of being persuasive at the United Nations to bring about reforms that we want there. 
Mr. President, I appreciate that not all Senators have followed all of the debate as extensively as those who have been debating this yesterday and today. But let me say already there is some doubt as to precisely what this bill has to say. 
For example, the Washington Post of Saturday, June 14, 1997, suggested that Ambassador Richardson and our own colleague, Senator Grams of Minnesota, went to the United Nations on Saturday, after our markup on Thursday, and, according to John Goshko of the Post: They denied that Congress wants to `micromanage the United Nations,' and they insisted that the plan is `not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.' Instead, they said it is a set of `suggestions' aimed at helping the United Nations become, as Grams said, `the best United Nations it can be.'. . . 
The two officials' assertions that the conditions or so-called benchmarks in the plan are only suggestions ran counter, according to the article, and also according to remarks by Chairman Helms on Thursday. 
Quoting Senator Helms: 
This bill will prohibit the payment by the American taxpayers of any so-called U.N. arrears until these congressionally mandated benchmarks have been met by the U.N. 
Then another quote from Senator Helms: 
The message to the U.N. is simple but clear: no reform, no American taxpayer money for arrears. 
Now, Mr. President, in the Washington Times, Senator Grams is quoted as saying: 
`These are broad suggestions,' said Sen. Rod Grams, Minnesota Republican, architect of the reform package and U.S. delegate to the United Nations. `We're not going to micromanage the U.N. by any means.' 
At a press conference yesterday, both [Ambassador Richardson and Mr. Grams] took pains to soften the edges of a bill most here see as an imperious `take it or leave it' offer. Mr. Grams plans to spend time at the United Nations this summer, selling the package to foreign envoys [according to the Washington Times of June 14, 1997]. 
So already, Mr. President, while we are debating the bill, our Ambassador and a distinguished colleague are at the United Nations saying we are making some helpful suggestions that we do not want to micromanage. But back here at the Congress, the word is no reform, and according to the 18 pages of conditions in this legislation, no money. 
Senators will have to make up their minds. The suggestion has been two `take it or leave its,' in my own view. This is the reason I presented the amendment. We have obligations. In a straightforward way we ought to meet them. 
As the Senator from Delaware suggested in his question this morning, the amounts of money in this bill are clearly in dispute. But I accept the fact that the U.S. Government, both in its legislative and administrative branches, estimates we owe $1.021 billion. After various deductions, $819 million is on the table to be disbursed in both the Foreign Relations Committee bill and in my amendment. 
But there is a large difference in how the dispersal occurs, a very large difference in our attitude to other countries, our friends in the rest of the world, and a very large difference in our presumptions about the United Nations and its usefulness to us. 
Finally, Mr. President, word came yesterday in a debate that the United States of America has loaned countries a lot of money. We have spent a lot of money helping them defend themselves. And indeed we have. Our foreign policy frequently--frequently--tries to make sure the frontiers of conflict are as far away from our country as possible. We have given a lot of military aid to others who we hoped would fight our battles as our allies or as front lines for us. And that was prudent for us to do. 
But now we come to a situation, Mr. President, in which the United States said we do not want to be involved in these front line activities, or certain peacekeeping chores that were controversial, but which we think ought to be done. We voted for them. We sent others forward. We said we would pay. And now we have not paid nor will we pay unless the United Nations and the members in it reduce our dues, and unless they go through the hoops of even such suggestions that international conferences of the United Nations could be held in only four cities. We even dictate the cities in which the conference might occur. 
Members will be astonished, as they read through all the conditions, what is involved. But Members should read soon because we will have a vote shortly this afternoon on this amendment. I believe it is a critical vote for American foreign policy. I hope the Senators will support my amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that Senators support my amendment because it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to pay our debts and to meet our contractual obligations in support of the United Nations, a vigorous vehicle for the conduct of our foreign policy. 
The dispute that we have today is over two different tacks on which the Senators differ in terms of our effectiveness. I believe that the Lugar amendment is not only the right thing to do but I believe it is the most effective way to bring about reform, and to bring about cooperation with our allies, not only at the United Nations but in a host of international trade issues, in NATO and NATO-related concerns, and all of the planning that is vital to our foreign policy. 
It makes no sense, Mr. President, to deny our allies funds that we owe them and to expect that they are going to be generous or thoughtful in negotiating settlements with us in a range of agreements around the globe. 
So in terms of both the principle as well as its practicality, I believe the best course is to pay our debt and to do so promptly in a straightforward way and to negotiate firmly for reform of the United Nations, as we are doing, and as we will continue to do, after recognizing that 183 other countries are involved. There must finally be agreement with them, too. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, my amendment calls for payment of our obligations to the United Nations to the extent of $819 million over 2 years without conditions; $658 million of that is owed to our friends and our allies for peacekeeping operations and expenses they undertook and for which we voted. We have a contractual obligation to pay. 
Our effectiveness in bringing about reforms in dealing with NATO expansion, in dealing with a host of international trade issues depends upon our credibility with our friends. It is not an argument in favor of reform that unilaterally we decide not to pay or send our payments to other nations but insist on some with 38 conditions in 18 pages of agate type before we allocate the money. We have a straightforward vote, Mr. President. I believe it is the right thing to do. I think it is the most effective thing to do in terms of American diplomacy.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered strikes Title XXII, which is the portion of the legislation that deals with payments of arrears to the United Nations and reform of the United Nations. 
I offer this amendment fully respectful and cognizant of the remarkable work achieved by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Helms, and the Ranking Member, Senator Biden, in negotiating on behalf of members of the committee a comprehensive bill with regard to the organization in the State Department and other foreign affairs agencies, in addition to the matters relating to the United Nations that are the subject of my amendment. 
Mr. President, I want to discuss very broadly today why I take this occasion to offer this amendment because the timeframe for consideration is necessarily very short. The markup in our committee occurred just last Thursday. The debate today on the floor is occurring on Monday, and presumably we will have votes on these and other issues on Tuesday, tomorrow. Therefore, Senators and their staff will need to understand issues quickly in order to make a judgment on what I believe is a monumental turning point in American foreign policy, and perhaps one of the most serious foreign policy debates that we will have this year. 
I ask, first of all: Why have we come to such a point? By that, I mean why and how could the United States have come to owe hundreds of millions of dollars to the United Nations? It did not occur overnight. As I will illustrate in the course of my remarks, the amounts we owe are, in most respects, not to the United Nations organization per se. Indeed, again and again I will reiterate that only about 5 percent of our arrears are actually owed to the United Nations. Well over $650 million of the money is owed to other countries in which the United Nations is merely a passthrough largely to these countries for reimbursement of past peacekeeping expenses. 
So the debts that we owe are to Great Britain, to France, to Germany, to Italy, and to a host of friends and allies of the United States. We have accumulated debts to them largely because of their peacekeeping activities that we voted for. Our country frequently took the position that we were not in a position nor did we wish to send Armed Forces to various areas in which the United Nations, with our votes, decided to try to keep the peace. Therefore, our agreement in these cases was to pay money while other nations sent their forces, and on some occasions contributed money also. 
I mention this point because for several years there has been an assumption on the part of many Members of this body and of the House--perhaps even of the Presidential administration--that the U.N. had very great problems. As a matter of fact, many Members from time to time have suggested a lack of general support for the United Nations, suggesting that it impinged on our sovereignty, and on our ability to conduct foreign policy in a straightforward way. In fact, Mr. President, I submit that a great number of Americans not confined to this Chamber have come to a psychology that the United Nations has been preying upon us; that somehow an organization located in our country, in New York City, has been imposing insuperable demands upon us and they resent that. And, because of our resentment, so this argument goes, we ought to reform the U.N; we ought to teach it a lesson; we ought to deprive it of money; we ought to make editorial views of those activities we think are not very good, even those that we have voted for; and that by depriving the United Nations of money change its course, we indicate that we really do not wish to participate at all. 
Mr. President, I think we are coming to a much more crucial point in this debate than simply whether we will pay the arrears--the money that we owe. I think Senators will fundamentally have to determine: Should we continue to be a part of the United Nations? Because, if in fact the United Nations is deprived of the funds that we owe and other nations take our lead and are not prepared to pay either for diverse reasons of foreign policy it is apparent 
that the United Nations will be severely weakened. As a matter of fact, it will be less and less effective, if effective at all. 
So, Mr. President and Members, I think at the outset as we come to an understanding of how we got to this point, we have to decide: Do we really want the United Nations to be a forceful advocate for peace, for justice, an instrument of our foreign policy, and a group of nations in which we play a vital role as members of the Security Council with veto power from the beginning of the San Francisco Charter? Do we want this? If we do, we are going to have to not only try to shape up the United Nations but shape up our own views and our own activities as a member State--our own leadership, as a matter of fact--if the United Nations is to be effective. 
I come out on the side of one who believes that we ought to be active and vital in the United Nations; that, as a matter of fact, the United Nations plays an important part in our foreign policy; that it is extremely important to our overall security in the world; and, that it is an organization in which we play a leading role which ought to be supported by us as opposed to constricted by us, demeaned by us, and criticized by us. Given an opportunity, it seems, that the Congress has again and again not only tried to inhibit the United Nations but, as a matter of fact, may finally succeed in killing it off, if we are not thoughtful. 
Mr. President, if Members believe that these are the views of their constituents in a representative democracy, eventually the U.N. will receive the brunt of those attacks. But I would suggest that the American people have different views. As a matter of fact, Members will be interested in polls taken by the Wirthlin group and other polling groups for the United Nations Association. And one question that I found relevant was this one: 
Considering the problems we are likely to face in the coming years, how important is it for America to be an active part of the United Nations--an active part--very important, somewhat important, or not important that America be an active member? 
Fifty-four percent of Americans said it is very important that we be an active member. Another 28 percent said it is somewhat important that we be an active member. Only 12 percent said it is not important, and 6 percent had no answer. 
That is a rather extraordinary breakdown. 
Mr. President, of 82 percent of Americans, 54 percent are saying it is very important to be very active in the United Nations. 
Then in a Times Mirror poll, they asked: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: The United States should cooperate fully with the United Nations? 
On that kind of a question, 65 percent say we should cooperate fully. Twenty-nine percent disagree with that proposition. 
Another question asked: Do you favor or oppose legislation that would have the United States withdraw completely from the United Nations? The Wirthlin group found again: 22 percent favor withdrawal, 71 percent oppose withdrawal, and 7 percent had no answer. 
On still another quesiton, overall, do you think that in the long run efforts to strengthen the U.N. would be a good investment or not a good investment? This is the program on international policy attitudes poll. 
Sixty-eight percent of Americans said good investment, and 28 percent, not a good investment. 
Now we come to the crux of our issue today, Mr. President. 
The question posd was: Do you favor or oppose the United States paying its U.N. dues in full? Do you feel that way strongly or somewhat strongly? 
Thirty percent favor strongly our paying our dues in full. Twenty-eight percent favor somewhat. Thirteen percent oppose somewhat, and 16 percent oppose strongly. 
Adding together those figures, Mr. President, you once again get about the same 2-to-1 ratio. Fifty-eight percent believe that we ought to pay in full, and 29 percent do not. 
By 2 to 1 the American public believe that we ought to be paying our fair share and our full share. 
Interestingly enough, another qustion asked: Do you believe that U.N. member states should always pay their full dues to the U.N. on schedule, or should a state hold back its dues to pressure other members to agree to changes that it believes are needed? Again, the Wirthlin poll. Mr. President, in 1989, 60 percent of Americans said we should always pay. In April 1996, 78 percent said members should always pay. 
I find that interesting, Mr. President. 
The evolution of the American people with regard to the United States meeting its obligations has led to a much higher percentage of Americans saying that member states should always pay. 
Honor U.N. peacekeeping--the basic reason that we are here today, as a general rule, when it is necessary to use military force to deal with trouble spots in the world--Do you feel more comfortable having the United States contribute to a U.N. military action or for the United States to take military action by itself? 
Sixty-nine percent said U.N. military action while 24 percent said U.S. action alone. 
Do you think peacekeeping should be a high priority of the United Nations' system; somewhat of a priority; or not a priority? The Wirthlin group poll again: 75 percent of Americans in April 1996 said a high priority, somewhat of a priority said 17 percent, and not a priority, only 6 percent. 
Mr. President, I shall not recite further polling data except to make the observation that by fairly large ratios of about 2 to 1, or larger than that, Americans believe that we ought to participate in the U.N.; that we ought to pay our dues on time; that all nations should pay their dues on time; that peacekeeping operations are very important for the United Nations to conduct. 
I mention that because it appears to me that most Members may not be aware to whom we owe the money. 
I would just simply point out, Mr. President, and I take this opportunity to cite precisely the countries to whom we believe we owe money. They may have different views as to how much we owe, but there is general agreement between the administration and the Foreign Relations Committee to have come up with the figure of $819 million to be authorized and appropriated in one form or another. We have agreed that the U.S. portion of that debt is more than one-third. 
Using that ratio, France is owed by the United States $60.1 million; Great Britain is owed $41 million; the Netherlands, $21.3 million; Pakistan, $20.1 million; Germany, $18.3 million; Belgium, $17.3 million; Italy, $17.2 million, $16.1 million to India; $14.2 million to our neighbor Canada, and a long list of countries with smaller sums than that, all owed by the United States, with the United Nations merely a passthrough to them. 
Mr. President, it is clear, at least in my judgment, that we owe the money, that it is clear to whom we owe the money, but it is not at all clear whether the money is likely to be repaid. 
Now, I mention this because we had a debate in the Foreign Relations Committee markup on Thursday and the assertion was made essentially, and the press has picked up this story largely intact, that however you look at this, this provision entails a significant change in the course of American foreign policy. Essentially there is now agreement on the part of the United States to pay a part of the money we owe. 
Following the Foreign Relations Committee meeting, Nick Burns, on behalf of the administration, was asked: `What are you saying to Senator Lugar who says that the arrears are contractual obligations of the United States and should not be the subject of conditions?' Mr. Burns punts the issue, in my judgment. He says:  
Well, I think President Clinton and Secretary Albright have been very clear for as long as they have been in office that we do not like being the largest donor--that is, debtor--to the United Nations. In fact-- 
Mr. Burns says, and I am quoting-- we have called ourselves publicly the largest deadbeat debtor to the United Nations. We don't like that. The American people don't want their Government to be in arrears to any institution, much less the United Nations, but we have an opportunity here to make sure that while we take steps that are costly for us to pay off our arrears, we send forward a very strong signal that reform is important and the reform ought to be followed through. 
Mr. Burns continues. 
We have taken the opportunity and we have not been met with a fundamental objection by Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. He has welcomed the progress that has been made this week. He has put forward his own reform proposal. So we don't have a problem with the Secretary General and we certainly would look forward to the continued support of Senator Lugar in this effort. 
Mr. President, I am not certain what that means. Clearly Mr. Burns does reflect the thought of the administration and most Americans. We do not like to be thought of as a deadbeat country, but he is suggesting, I suppose, that somehow all of that has been finessed this week--a certain amount of reform, a certain amount of payment, the Secretary General not giving fundamental objections and a hope that somehow I might be pacified. 
I was even more intrigued by reports on Saturday in the Washington Post and the Washington Times after our Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, was accompanied by the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Rod Grams, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and chairman of the subcommittee dealing with international organizations. Senator Grams and Ambassador Richardson went to New York and had a press conference. I quote from the story by John Goshko in the Saturday, June 14, issue of the Washington Post. 
John Goshko said: 
They denied Congress wants to micromanage the United Nations and they insisted the plan is not a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Instead, they said, it is a set of suggestions aimed at helping the United Nations become, as Grams said, the best United Nations it can be. 
The two officials' assertions that conditions or so-called benchmarks in the plan are only suggestions ran counter to remarks by Senator Helms on Thursday. 
Senator Helms is quoted in the story. 
`This bill will prohibit the payment--prohibit the payment--`by the American taxpayers of any so-called U.N. arrears until these congressionally mandated benchmarks have been met by the U.N.,' Helms said. 
Quote again. 
The message to the U.N. is simple but clear: no reform, no American money for arrears. 
On another key point, Mr. Goshko says: 
Washington desires to cut the U.S. share of the U.N. operating budget from 25 percent to 20 percent. Richardson said it would be his job to negotiate with the other members to win such a change. But---- 
Says Mr. Goshko-- 
Helms used language implying that attainment of that goal is not subject for negotiation. 
Mr. President, let me just say that clearly at some point or other in this debate or on some other occasion, we will have to make up our minds. It will be impossible for Ambassador Richardson or my distinguished friend, Senator Grams, to go to New York and indicate, as the Washington Times said, and they quote Senator Grams: 
`These are broad suggestions.' At a press conference both men took pains to soften the edges of a bill most here see as a nefarious `take it or leave it' offer. Mr. Grams said he plans to spend time at the United Nations this summer selling the package to foreign envoys. 
But at this stage, whether one has the hard version or the soft version, my basic question is: is it likely the money will be repaid at all? And that is fundamental. If you buy my premise the United Nations is important, that it is important for us to make sure it is beefed up, is stronger, is viable as a part of our foreign policy, then, at a minimum, this means we must pay our arrears. And those arrears are only slightly owed to the U.N. superstructure. Most is owed to our allies with whom we have dealings in many other fora. 
If, in fact, we pass legislation--and I believe the legislation that came out with regard to Title XXII, the arrears section we are discussing, leads to so many stipulations, not only micromanagement but conditions to a fault, that the likelihood of very much money passing to our allies or to the U.N. is very small. 
The Washington Times article and writer counted as many as 20 conditions that would be required. My staff, in analyzing title XXII, has found at least 38. I have discussed briefly some of the major conditions, and these are major decisions for the United Nations must make to get its money and to make possible our payment of the arrears to our allies. But it is quite a change from dues in which we pay 25 percent of the U.N. budget to 20 percent and is quite a move for us to get 31 percent dues for peacekeeping down to 25. 
There are many Americans, not simply Senators in this Chamber, who would rather pay less. So I suspect there will not be an argument that, given your druthers, it would have been fine if our statesmen negotiated a long time ago a U.N. debt for dues for us of 20 percent as opposed to 25, or for 25 percent for peacekeeping as opposed to 31. 
Mr. President, I think we have to recognize that we are saying in this legislation is that unless the rest of the world, the other 183 countries, acquiesce to the United States and arbitrarily lower our dues, we will not pay. There may be a suggestion somehow that 
money is going to come forward, but unless those two requirements are met, it does not appear to me possible that payment is likely to occur. 
Now, we add on a number of other conditions such as the fact that U.N. conferences can occur in only four cities in the world and the rest of the world will have to accept that because we put it in this bill and we have said, in essence, we are not going to pay unless each of these conditions is met. Perhaps Ambassador Richardson and Senator Grams read this legislation in a different way and saw all of this legislation as merely suggestions, sort of ideas that might be kicked around up there at the U.N. with our friends. That is not the way the bill reads. It says you meet our requirements or there is no money to pay our past dues. And the distinguished chairman of the committee has underlined that view in his own remarks last Thursday. 
So, Mr. President, is the money likely to be paid? Probably not. And that means that the debate we are having today is likely to linger. The problem is there will not be as good a time to finally take care of this problem than there is presently. The Budget Committee, those who have been working on the overall reduction to zero deficit in 5 years, set aside the money and their plan is for us to pay off. If we do not authorize the money to do that, then it disappears from the table. It is unlikely to appear again. I do not suspect that the Congress will be involved in another 5-year plan for deficit reduction soon. We will have adopted one. We will be in the plan. We can choose to authorize the money and appropriators can finally decide whether to appropriate it. But at this point we come up with an option, under 20 conditions or 38 conditions, or however many you may be able to derive from Title XXII, that if we decide not to pay any money, we are going to have a problem, and that is what I want to discuss. 
Now, what are the problems if we don't pay? I think the problems are not only the inevitable weakness of the U.N., but the quality of our relationships with our allies in the world. Americans may not realize that is the problem we are talking about, our relations with Germany, Great Britain, Italy, with our NATO allies. At other times in other fora we are discussing NATO expansion, we are discussing new obligations, and arguing how extensive those will be. And most Americans, including myself, who have argued for NATO expansion have pointed out that we anticipate our obligations will be relatively small. I accept the estimate of the President of the United States in his London press conference with Prime Minister Blair that we will be paying $150 million to $200 million a year. But this implies that our European allies will be paying a lot more. The countries coming in will have to pay a great deal to bring their infrastructure up to speed to meet the common defense principles. Essentially, the United States will take the position with regard to NATO expansion that burdensharing means a very large burden taken on by our European allies for their defense, for the defense of Europe, and we will argue that that is perfectly logical; they are the countries most in harm's way and that we already have provided substantial infrastructure in Europe. 
But the stakes are very high and the money sums are very large that we are going to ask of European allies. Now, what if, in the midst of that argument, we still have the U.N. arrears situation? There are Members of the Senate arguing: We don't like the United Nations. We think it's top heavy with bureaucrats, that these people are inefficient, that too many come from countries other than our own, that essentially they hold too many conferences in strange cities all over the world, and we will not pay either the United Nations or our European allies until all of this is terminated--ad seriatim, as you go through and read Title XXII. 
Those negotiations for NATO expansion might be very difficult. I suggest a whole set of other negotiations may be very difficult. I had in my office this afternoon a distinguished Austrian statesman. We have a lot at stake in negotiating on agriculture with Europe, enormous sums, in terms of whether we come to agreement on technology, science and on export subsidies and export taxes. There is a lot at stake for a lot of Americans. Those negotiations are very tough. We are coming up to another GATT round in 1999 on agriculture. It is not at all certain how much headway we shall make. But it makes an enormous difference, in billions of dollars of exports, that we make a lot of headway and that we be negotiating with friends in good faith. 
How in the world can we anticipate useful negotiations on NATO or the European agriculture plan or the GATT situation with the very same countries to whom we are, in essence, saying: Sorry, we are not going to pay because a number of Senators don't like the United Nations? They still have a billboard mentality which says, `Get us out of the United Nations.' 
Some of us are going to have to say on this floor, `Not only keep us in, but make the U.N. work.' I certainly subscribe to every reform proposal that makes sense at the United Nations, and the Secretary General, who is a friend of the United States, subscribes to much of that. I have no doubt if we are a vigorous player in the United Nations, as opposed to taking the thought that we are being preyed upon by a group of nations over whom we have no control. If we are a vigorous player, we are going to be able to negotiate changes that are substantial, and we are going to have to do that in the European Community with the agricultural plan and with NATO. There is no free lunch in this business. The idea that we can, with an ultimatum, say, `Take it or leave it,' and that somehow the United Nations will make these changes to accommodate us, I believe is unrealistic. 
Mr. President, let us take, hypothetically, one more situation suggested by the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, during the markup in the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Kerry said, from his experience in dealing with U.N. reform, and he has had substantial experience on this topic, he thinks there is a possibility that all the other 183 countries will acquiesce. They will finally read Title XXII as the Foreign Relations Committee adopts it and grudgingly, and with great passion and recrimination and so forth, understand that it's lights out for the United Nations if they don't acquiesce to the United States, which they will describe as a bully, as a country operating totally outside international norms, as a country that did not recognize its obligations. 
That is still another scenario. I gather proponents of the bill think that is the best scenario. The United States wins. We reduce our dues unilaterally and our peacekeeping moneys. We managed to bully every other nation on Earth into acquiescence on the basis that a United Nations without us would be unthinkable. I would say, under those circumstances, we still have ahead some mighty rough sledding with regard to any other international organizations or negotiations on trade, or NATO, or whatever. 
The amendment I have offered is a simple solution. It says, in essence, that we owe $819 million. We ought to pay it in 2 years, two equal installments with no conditions, because we owe it to other countries, essentially. We owe it to some international organizations such as the Food and Agricultural Organizations, the 
FAO. We are about $100 million behind in our dues payment to them. We are about to lose our seat and our vote, even while those of us in agriculture feel it is very important we be at the table. There are consequences for being a deadbeat, for trying to stiff other countries. We ought not do it. We ought to affirm that the United Nations is important, that we are a leading player, that we are the leading player in terms of confidence building in international diplomacy, in security arrangements which the United Nations represents. 
I have offered this amendment as a substitute for the entirety of 18 pages that contain all of these conditions, an extraordinary array of pages and language. I am hopeful Members and their staffs will read this before they commit themselves to a vote in favor of this provision. 
I rise today simply to offer Members an alternative. The distinguished Senator from Delaware, the ranking member of the committee, has argued with a great deal of skill in the Foreign Relations Committee markup, that even if my position is right, even if there is some logic to what I have to say, the fact is the alternative was never my position. The fact is, the very best situation that he was able to negotiate with the distinguished chairman of our committee was for 18 pages of title XXII as they now exist. In essence, we are faced with the situation, as I read the logic of the distinguished Senator from Delaware, of a take it or leave it with the Senate, quite apart from a take it or leave it with the rest of the world. The implication is, if we do not adopt title XXII as negotiated, there is likely to be no money, zero money, for the United Nations. 
But I am suggesting that the outcome of adopting title XXII may very well be zero money for the United Nations, that you get to zero either way, that we have not solved the arrears problem, that the headlines that somehow or another the United Nations is about to be revived are premature. Or, to state Senator Kerry's position, as I have already: Somehow, the United Nations gets the money, they go through all the hoops and with all of the resentments, recriminations, and difficulties we have around the world, we pay dearly, a multiple of whatever has been squeezed out of this process. 
It is not an easy choice for Senators to make. But that is why I pose it in these terms and why I believe it is fundamentally one of the most important debates that we shall have about foreign policy. It gets to the heart of our relationship with our friends, with the rest of the world, and with the United Nations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and the Chair. Let me summarize. Earlier in the afternoon I offered an amendment to strike Title XXII from the legislation dealing with the United Nations. Essentially, I call for payment of our debt in 2 years, without conditions. 
Title XXII, as we observe, contains 18 pages of conditions. That is the issue. Senator Biden, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, argued that he believed in principle that my arguments were correct. He argued that pragmatically, in the negotiation that he had encountered with the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, the chairman led him to believe that the amounts of money, $819 million, and the conditions that are imposed by Title XXII were the best arrangement that was possible under these circumstances. 
The distinguished Chairman, Senator Helms, has argued that the Foreign Relations Committee ought to take action, as opposed to allowing the appropriators to take action, as so often has been the case with matters before our committee in recent years. I certainly subscribe to that thought, that we ought to take action. Clearly this bill as a whole is an attempt to do so in a very comprehensive and positive way. But it is important that Members realize the gravity of the debate that we are having on the United Nations. 
Senator Sarbanes, I think correctly, in his remarks, mentioned that the very thought of withdrawal, which appears in this bill, is a very serious business. Earlier I suggested that it is not at all beyond conjecture that there will be no money paid to the United Nations given the severity and the number of conditions that are required; that Members, in casting a vote on this, have to consider that casting that vote imperils the United Nations, quite apart from our reputation for paying our debts to our allies who have been involved in peacekeeping operations which we supported. 
These are serious matters. A basic dilemma is that the language is very complex. Many Senators may not have had an opportunity to read what the conditions are and all the reasons why this Senator argues it will be very difficult for the payments to be made. Senators may not have realized the implications of nonpayment, noncooperation, and nonleadership on our part could 
imperil the United Nations. If Senators are, in fact, of a mind that they really do not care or if they believe the United Nations has served its time and that this is an unusual back-door way of finalizing the problem, that is one point. But if Senators believe, as do two-thirds of the American people, that the United Nations is important, that we ought to be taking leadership, that we ought to be paying our debts, then Senators will vote to do so. They will support my amendment. 
It is not inconceivable that my amendment should pass and that we should proceed along this course of action. What has been argued this afternoon by the distinguished Ranking Member of the committee is that the distinguished Chairman disagreed with payment of very much money, and the distinguished Chairman insisted upon a large number of conditions. Apparently, he acquiesced and finally allowed some of the funds to be stricken from the legislation. That is the argument we are having. I would simply say that Senators must consider this, I believe quickly, because the timeframe of all this debate is very rapid. If there were more time, my guess is that around the Nation, members of the general public, editorial writers in newspapers, opinion leaders in foreign policy would agree, this is very serious. This is a moment of truth for the Senate with regard to the United Nations. There would be time for many people to reflect upon this, including Senators who must vote. And it is very possible that Senators would decide we really want to take leadership and we want to affirm the ties that we have with our allies to whom we owe the money. 
As we have pointed out again and again, $658 million is owed to countries such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other friends and allies--not to the Secretariat of the United Nations or the structure that has been described as overblown. That is a red herring; just 5 percent of the money is owed to the United Nations per se. The real issue is whether we will meet our obligations to our friends, whether we will take leadership at the United Nations, whether we will assert that the United Nations should continue as an important part of our foreign policy.

Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. Of course, one of the most vivid and recent experiences was that in Bosnia, to which our country for some time did not wish to commit forces, did not wish to commit NATO or get a vote of our NATO allies. So, as a result, other nations attempted to bring about peace in Bosnia largely because our Nation stood aside but indicated to them they ought to carry on.

Mr. LUGAR. The Senator has stated the options all too vividly; namely, we respond to security crises by ourselves or we say nothing is going to happen in the world. And worse still, we lose the option, if we do not have the United Nations, of going as we did to the Security Council, at the time the United States presided, during Desert Storm when we obtained a Security Council resolution that brought a number of nations to our side in a very, very important endeavor.

Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. As the Senator will recall, we took this international legitimacy as a basis for our literally asking other nations all around the globe to pay the bulk of the moneys for Desert Storm. As I recall, over $50 billion was collected from Japan, from Germany, and from many of the nations that are being cited now as countries to whom we owe money in other peacekeeping endeavors.

Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator for his questions. 
Mr. President, during this debate, strangely enough, we have really not argued about the text of the 18 pages that I wish to eliminate with my substitute amendment. No Senator has risen to defend that language and the labyrinth of the conditions that are involved in it. Rather, we have had a suggestion that this was the best that could occur, given the players in the legislative drama. I say it is not good enough. As a matter of fact, I believe that very drastic circumstances not in our interest are liable to arise from this language. This is why I make a point of it. 
I have not generally not offered amendments to this legislation. I believe the reorganization efforts and a good number of reforms that the committee has brought about in this legislation are important. But I believe the particular item we are talking about now with regard to continuation of the United Nations is a critical item and deserves underlining. It deserves attention, it deserves careful reading by all Senators prior to vote on my amendment or on final passage of legislation that will contain this arrears provision. 
I conclude simply by saying that I believe the United Nations is important for our foreign policy. I believe we ought to be vigorous in taking international leadership, in making certain that the United Nations fulfills our aspirations in working constructively with other nations. I believe we ought to pay our obligations to other nations. I believe, as a matter of fact, if we do so, we are likely to be more effective in our negotiation with many of the same nations in other vital international negotiations that will continue on the expansion of NATO, on freer and fairer trade around the globe, and on a number of things that are very important to our security and bread-and-butter interests. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will ask for the yeas and nays. As neither the Chairman nor Ranking Member are on the floor, I suspect the Chair may or may not be in a position to grant that. 
I will ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

Mr. LUGAR. 
Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that will transfer the census of agriculture from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Agriculture [USDA]. I am pleased that the distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, as well as Senators McConnell, Santorum, Daschle, Roberts, Leahy, Kerrey, Baucus, Landrieu, Cochran, Conrad, Johnson, Craig, and Grassley have joined me as cosponsors of this bill. 
In recent years the census of agriculture has been conducted every 5 years. Agricultural producers nationwide are asked questions regarding their production and sales. The census of agriculture is the only source of consistent, county level statistics on agricultural operations throughout the United States. It also provides national and State data. The census of agriculture is useful in monitoring the current status of, as well as documenting changes in, the agricultural industry. The number of farms, a major piece of data resulting from the census, is taken into account in the allocation of funding for several USDA programs. 
Last year Congress provided funds to USDA to allow USDA, in cooperation with the Department of Commerce, to conduct the next census without any substantive changes in scope, coverage, or timing. This transfer of funding necessitates the transfer of the authority. 
Transferring the authority for the census of agriculture to the USDA makes common sense. This move would integrate the agricultural statistics programs of the two Departments and eliminate duplication. USDA states that cost savings will result with one agency given primary authority over the content of the census as well as dissemination of its results. 
The issue of moving the census surfaced during final conference committee deliberations on the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act. Given the time constraints of that conference, a provision to transfer the census of agriculture to USDA was not included in the bill. Subsequent legislation was passed by the House, but did not receive approval from the Senate before the end of the session. 
Last year, the Department of Commerce expressed some interest in changing the definition of a farm, which is now defined as sales of $1,000 or more per year. While USDA has stated there will be no substantive changes with how the upcoming census is carried out, it is more logical to provide the authority to set the definition to the Department whose programs would be most affected by a change. 
Many agricultural associations and organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, support the transfer of the census of agriculture to USDA. Last month, USDA proposed legislation which is virtually identical to this bill.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the celebration of the life and recordbreaking Senate career of Senator Strom Thurmond gives each of us an opportunity to underline strengths of our friend and our colleague which we should emulate. Senator Thurmond is the oldest of our colleagues, but my most vivid memories of him have often involved his interaction with young people. 
During a trip to military installations early in my Senate career, I learned much about successful constituent relationships from Strom. Even while on the road, Strom Thurmond was receiving the names of South Carolinians who had recently died, were married, or enjoyed personal honors such as graduation or academic recognition. With the assistance of his 
able staff, Strom obtained daily lists of names and placed telephone calls, through his Washington office, to at least 2 dozen of these persons, according to my observations, leaving appropriate messages when necessary. He displayed the greatest excitement over students and could often identify their parents and their grandparents as he shared pride in the accomplishments of the entire family. 
Upon arrival at one naval base that shall remain nameless, Strom demonstrated another attribute, which has been partly responsible for his longevity of Senatorial service. We were greeted by the naval captain who commanded the base and, after just a few words of conversation, Strom indicated that it was 4:30 in the afternoon, he had been traveling for hours, and he wanted to jog around the base. He invited the astonished commanding officer to join him for the run and strongly insisted that this would be an excellent opportunity. As negotiations on the running assignment proceeded, the captain successfully pled the press of urgent duties and encouraged a young ensign to suit up for running duty with Senator Thurmond. I saw this episode repeated on another occasion. 
I noticed a remarkable excitement which young people enjoyed when running with Strom Thurmond. This excitement is not restricted to miscellaneous strangers that Strom met across the country. Last summer, I found that Strom's son, Paul, was a member of my fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, and that several of his fraternity brothers were interns in Senator Thurmond's office. I invited them to lunch in the Senate dining room where, midway through our meal, Strom entered with constituents from South Carolina. I was deeply touched while watching Paul greet his dad and the constituents and indicate to all the importance of the reelection campaign in which the entire family was heavily involved. Paul critiqued Strom's early morning TV appearance and the current stress of various activities, giving his dad advice. Then Paul and his fraternity brothers shared with me great stories about their experiences with Strom, including his intense interest in their daily activities. 
All of us know from our daily visits with Strom Thurmond on the floor of the Senate that he greets each of us warmly. He is excited by these encounters, almost as if it were the first time in a long while that he has seen us. In visiting with these young men who were interns in his office, and later with my own son, David Lugar, who had a wonderful conversation with Strom at a fundraising reception, I found a common theme. 
Strom, obviously, is invigorated by his meetings with young people, and he has much to say to them about successful patterns of living. His political instruction is surely world class, and I suspect that all of us recognize the power of a truly disciplined life that has been lived with the setting of important goals and the sustained activity necessary to achieve them. 
Very fortunately, Strom has not only set a record for longevity of service in the Senate, he is still among us, giving encouragement each day and inspiring the best of our efforts. I am very grateful for the privilege of serving with him. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is with great admiration that I rise today to recognize David Carter, a citizen of Indianapolis and a close family friend, for his achievement in reaching the peak of Mount Everest. 
David's successful ascent to the summit of Mount Everest bordering Nepal and Tibet is the realization of a boyhood dream. This achievement exemplifies his extraordinary determination and courage. 
On this, his second attempt to reach the peak, David approached the mountain's difficult conditions with bravery and extremely careful preparation. Through high winds and extremely cold temperatures, his expedition met the challenge. 
In explaining what drew him back for a second try, David simply answered: unfinished business. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating David Carter on the day of this signal victory which brings special pride to all Hoosiers.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ann Jorgensen to the Farm Credit Administration Board of Directors and Lowell Junkins to the Farmer Mac Board of Directors. Both nominees appeared before the Agriculture Committee on April 10 and both were favorably reported out of committee on April 15 by unanimous vote. 
The Farm Credit System is an important source of agricultural credit for rural America. The system is regulated by the Farm Credit Administration, which has had a vacancy on its three-member Board since March 31, 1995. I am pleased that after that long vacancy we have a qualified nominee to complete the board. Ms. Jorgensen has a distinguished career in farming, entrepreneurship, and public service and will serve ably as an FCA board member. 
Farmer Mac was created by Congress in 1988 to promote a secondary market in farm real estate loans. The Farm Credit System Reform Act of 1996 provided Farmer Mac with additional authorities to develop a successful secondary market. The future of Farmer Mac will be determined in the next 2 years. It is important that qualified individuals serve on the board to help move Farmer Mac toward a successful secondary market for agricultural loans. 
Mr. Junkins has served as a recess appointee to the Farmer Mac Board of Directors since April 1996. Mr. Junkins was also spoken highly of by the distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, Senator Grassley, and Congressman Boswell. 
Ann Jorgensen and Lowell Junkins are well qualified and should be confirmed by the Senate to the Farm Credit Administration Board and the Farmer Mac Board respectively. I urge my colleagues to vote for their nomination.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will help Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman in his efforts to make USDA a more efficient user of taxpayer money. The Department of Agriculture has a long history of wasteful spending on information technology [IT]--telecommunications and computers. Over the past 10 years, USDA invested almost $8 billion on IT purchases that were often poorly planned, incompatible, and redundant. Recently Secretary Glickman lamented the stovepipe mentality that pervades USDA planning and purchases of information technology. That is, each agency of the Department protects its own turf and budget, and is reluctant to coordinate its IT planning and purchases with other agencies. 
The Secretary's observations are consistent with messages we have sent to USDA in years past. Five years ago, Senator Leahy and I warned that `money invested by USDA in computer technology over the past several years has been spent without a clear understanding of what was being purchased or what was operationally required to increase efficiency within the Department.' We asked then Secretary Madigan to curtail computer purchases until a `strategic plan or vision for Department reorganization is completed.' We still await a final version of the current strategic plan. 
For over a decade, audits of USDA's IT purchases have uncovered the same root problems: inadequate control, planning, and direction of IT investments. Historically, USDA's administration has failed to exercise the authority to control the IT expenditures of its 30 agencies. These agencies' independent IT purchases have led to systems that are unable to communicate across the Department. This has impeded program delivery and resulted in a labyrinth of duplicative and incompatible systems that has wasted hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The 104th Congress passed the Clinger-Cohen Act, which requires performance and results-based management in IT planning and purchases throughout Government. Clinger-Cohen created the position of the Chief Information Officer [CIO], a high-level executive responsible for achieving program delivery through prudent and coordinated IT investments. The concept of CIO coordination of IT planning and purchases is already widespread in the private sector. 
To be successful, the CIO must have significant legal and budgetary authorities. The CIO at USDA has neither. Individual agencies, which control their own budgets, can ignore the CIO. Currently, USDA's CIO has the responsibility to coordinate IT investments across agencies, but lacks the planning and budgeting authority to meet this responsibility. Without such authority, the problems of the past are sure to continue. 
The legislation I introduce today builds on Clinger-Cohen by giving the CIO at USDA the legal and budgetary authorities necessary to manage IT across USDA's 30 agencies. This bill accomplishes three things. First, the CIO is given the legal and budget authorities necessary to sucessfully manage IT to benefit the Department as a whole. Second, the CIO is given subcabinet rank within USDA, and will report directly to the Secretary. Third, the CIO is given the authority to approve or disapprove all purchases for telecommunications and computers. 
One important provision of this bill transfers to the CIO 10 percent of all USDA agencies' appropriations for salaries and expenses, to be used for IT planning and purchases. This amount can be adjusted by the Secretary. When the CIO approves an expenditure, the funds are released back to the agency. My purpose in including this provision is to provide the CIO with sufficient authority to control IT throughout USDA. I understand that Secretary Glickman may prefer alternative methods of achieving this goal. I look forward to working with him to craft the best means of accomplishing our common objective, because I genuinely intend this legislation to be helpful to his efforts and want to be supportive. 
Secretary Glickman sincerely wants to change the stovepipe mentality that pervades decisionmaking among USDA's 30 agencies. The Secretary has expressed a desire to reform the planning and budgeting of IT expenditures. He has stated a desire to halt the pattern of uncoordinated planning and ill-advised purchases that has resulted in the waste of taxpayer dollars. I believe the Secretary agrees that we cannot afford the operating procedures which exist today. 
However, the challenge of effecting change in the long-standing pattern of stovepipe agencies operating on their own is formidable. By introducing this bill today, I offer my assistance to the Secretary in this difficult and heretofore elusive task. 
The intent of this legislation is to help the Secretary realize his vision of a common USDA spirit by allowing him to implement reforms across the entire Department of Agriculture. I look forward to working with him to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of IT purchases and in so doing improve delivery of USDA programs.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to repeal an outdated agricultural law that has cost taxpayers millions of dollars over the last several years. 
Historically, as part of its statutory mandate to support farmers' income, the Department of Agriculture made payments to farmers for the planting of certain crops and in cases of natural disaster. In the process of carrying out this mission, USDA sometimes mistakenly overpaid farmers. 
A provision of the 1990 farm bill, known as the finality rule or the 90-day rule, allowed farmers to keep these overpayments if they were not discovered within 90 days of the payment or application for farm program benefits. Repayment is required in cases of fraud or misrepresentation involving the farmer. 
Whatever its merits in 1990, changes in farm policy and new evidence indicate that the finality rule should be repealed. At the time of the 1990 farm bill, to be eligible for farm program payments, it was necessary for the county or State USDA office to determine that farmers were actively engaged in farming and that their operations were structured properly. Farmers often relied on these determinations before deciding which crops to plant, the size of the plantings, and how to structure their farming operation for the crop year. 
However, the landmark reforms in the 1996 farm bill eliminated these justifications for the finality rule. Under the 1996 farm bill, farm payments are no longer linked to the planting decisions of farmers and the structure of the farming operation is unlikely to change. Today, payments are made based on a formula which does not vary from one year to the next. 
The finality rule does not only apply to farm program payments. It applies to most types of payments received by farmers including disaster relief assistance. But these disaster payments have been dramatically scaled back in recent years. In 1994, Congress passed the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act which largely eliminated disaster assistance payments for most major crops. Instead of disaster aid, farmers were encouraged to buy crop insurance. 
A recent report from the General Accounting Office provides further evidence that the finality rule should be repealed. According to GAO, from November 1990 through September 1996, USDA applied the finality rule to 10,694 cases in which the overpayments were not discovered within the 90-day time-frame. The rule allowed farmers to keep $4.2 million in overpayments. Nearly 90 percent of the overpayments involved crop disaster initiatives or old-style farm programs which no longer exist. 
GAO also looked closely at finality rule payments in fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Even though the justification for the finality rule was to prevent farmers from having to repay large amounts of money years after the money was paid, GAO found that most of the overpayments involved small sums and were discovered within 9 months or less. According to GAO, in the years studied, 86 percent of the finality rule cases involved $500 or less. In addition, 59 percent had overpayments amounting to 10 percent or less of the correct payment amounts, and two-thirds were discovered within 9 months of the date of payment or the filing of a program application. It should be noted that while most of the overpayments were small, a few large overpayments accounted for the bulk of the dollar value of the overpayments. An examination of the GAO data indicate that the finality rule, in its application, has not served its original stated purpose. 
Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Agriculture agrees that the finality rule should be repealed. In those limited number of cases in which repayment would work a hardship on the farmer, the very cases that finality rule was supposed to assist, USDA has indicated that it would use existing procedures already in place for debt collection in hardship cases. 
In summary, Mr. President, the finality rule was largely designed for programs which have been dramatically altered, it generally does not serve the hardship cases for which it was designed, and it can be replaced by other existing procedures designed for hardship cases. The Department of Agriculture and the General Accounting Office support its repeal. It is time to remove this outdated law from the books. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce the African Growth and Opportunity Act. A similar bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives and is now cosponsored by nearly 50 Members. It enjoys the support of many in the House leadership. I applaud the hard work of those Members of the House who have toiled to draft proactive legislation that would, if enacted, help re-shape our relationship with countries in sub-Sahara Africa. 
The bill I am introducing contains a range of trade, investment and reform incentives for economic growth that require little or no new spending. It reflects much of the administration's `Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa' initiative which proposes greater U.S. attention and priority to Africa. This bill proposes important trade and investment initiatives that would be available to eligible African countries which pursue meaningful internal reforms--both economic and political reform. 
The bill would seek to provide a range of trade preferences and concessions, including GSP and lower trade barriers, to eligible countries embarking on economic and political liberalization. It seeks to encourage increased private sector investment flows by engaging OPIC and other government guarantees to create private equity and infrastructure funds targeted on Africa. It proposes certain personnel changes in various government agencies to give greater attention to Africa and to facilitate U.S. trade and investment. It seeks the cooperation of international financial institutions to ease the heavy debt burden of the poorest countries in Africa. And, it seeks the cooperation of other developed countries to join us in granting trade concessions and other preferences to Africa. 
To achieve sustained economic growth and political stability in Africa, the private sector must be more fully engaged. They have the investment capital, they have the knowhow, and they have the will to take calculated risks abroad. The private sector, however, will be more interested in investment, trade and the technical assistance that accompany them, if countries make the hard decisions to liberalize their economies and open their political system to participation and good governance. That process is underway in Africa, but much more needs to be done. 
This bill intends to increase our commercial and official contacts and interactions in recognition of the enormous potential for economic growth and development in Africa. It reflects the vast diversity of people, cultures, economies, and potential among the forty-eight countries and the more than 600 million people. It provides incentives and rewards to the growing number of countries embarking on a host of economic and political reforms. These are reforms we should encourage and support. These changes are not only in the interests of African societies, they are in our interest as well. A stable and economically prosperous Africa will contribute to our commercial and security interests. 
The `African Growth and Opportunity Act', therefore, includes a range of incentives and policy tools that would begin the long-overdue process of linking U.S. ties with Africa on trade and investment, not solely on foreign assistance. We should be basing our relations with Africans as partners, not just as aid recipients. For too long, American policy towards Africa has concentrated on our foreign assistance programs which have resulted in little more than a series of bi-lateral donor-recipient relationships. 
While helpful in promoting economic and political development, and in alleviating humanitarian crises and other social ills, our assistance programs were never large enough to be effective in stimulating or sustaining real economic growth. They are still important and needed. But, bilateral assistance, even when coupled with assistance from other donor countries and from international banks and lending institutions, are insufficient by themselves to kick-start and sustain the economies of Africa. They have not been sufficient in eradicating contagious diseases, in eliminating chronic poverty, or in ending the cycle of under-development and recurring political turmoil. 
Mr. President, we have neglected Africa's economic growth potential for too many years. For too long, American interest in sub-Sahara Africa was largely a function of our strategic considerations and trade-offs during the Cold War period. Most Americans paid attention to Africa only when there was a natural or man-made calamity or disaster. Regrettably, this has led to distortion and mis-information about the real Africa. It has retarded interest in exploring opportunities in this rich and diverse continent. 
But, economic growth, political stability or the protection of human rights in Africa won't happen by themselves or by the actions of the U.S. The leadership in Africa must make it happen by their actions and decisions. We should encourage and respond to those countries and those leaders who are making the difficult decisions to implement economic and political reform. 
There is little doubt that those African countries which have embarked on the road to economic and political reform are beginning to reap the kind of benefits known in other regions of the world, such as East Asia. Several countries already enjoy multi-year economic growth in the five, six to ten percent range. Uganda, for example, had a growth rate of 10% in l995 and Ethiopia exceeded that level last year. More than 30 countries in sub-Sahara Africa have already initiated economic reform programs and some twenty-five 
countries have conducted open elections. 
Many countries have begun to liberalize their exchange rates and prices, privatize state-owned enterprises, reduce expensive state subsidies and cut back on impediments to trade and investment. These steps and others will help African economies grow. 
African trade barriers are more onerous than those in the faster growing economies in the developing world. Import tariffs are three and a half times higher than those in faster growing countries in the developing world. Along with non-tariff restrictions and assorted protectionist practices, these practices have hurt the competitiveness of Africa exports. They inflict trade losses that match or exceed the total levels of aid to Africa. As these barriers to trade and investment are eased and eliminated, they will open the way for economic growth and assist American entrepreneurs by opening their markets to our goods and services. 
It may interest members to know that U.S. trade with sub-Saharan Africa grew by more than 18% last year. For the second consecutive year, the growth in U.S. trade in sub-Sahara Africa outdistanced America's overall growth in world trade. No one who has sought to invest or trade in Africa will deny that doing so has been difficult, but few would deny that the many opportunities exist. 
U.S. trade with Africa amounts to only about one percent of total U.S. trade and U.S. investment there totals less than one percent of all U.S. direct investment overseas. This, despite the fact that roughly forty per cent of all America exports now go to developing countries where the greatest growth in U.S. trade and exports in recent years has taken place. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I am introducing this bill to stimulate interest and to encourage serious debate in the Senate on re-orienting U.S. policy towards Africa. Without question, we have a genuine interest in Africa that is only now being recognized. Enactment of this bill will help create an environment in which the private sector will become more fully engaged in the economic development and growth and political modernization of Africa. If that happens, it will be very much in the interest of the United States. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take note of this bill, consider its merits, explore the growing potential for U.S. exports and investment and consider the prospects for revising and broadening our overall relationship with sub-Sahara Africa. 
If we do so, our country will be a major economic and security beneficiary. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act be printed in full in the Record.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in urging the authorities in Beijing to provide immediate medical care to Wei Jingsheng and to end his prolonged incarceration in Chinese prison. Granting these requests would not only be an act of official compassion but it would also signal to others that the introduction of economic liberalism--and the remarkable economic advancements that it spawned--is leading to improvements in internal freedom, human rights practices, and the quality of life in the People's Republic of China. 
Responding to our modest requests would be a positive sign that China, as it seeks to be more fully integrated into the global system, is increasingly self-confident about itself, about the image it projects to the rest of the world and about the role it intends to play in the world. 
Wei Jingsheng has spent the better part of his adult life in detention, in jail, and in labor camps. Most of his past 18 years have been spent in solitary confinement in unusually harsh conditions. His health has deteriorated badly and he is deprived of most normal privileges available to political prisoners. Those conditions and these deprivations would have broken the spirit of defiance in most human beings. Not so for Wei Jingsheng. 
Wei Jingsheng's remarkable prison letters to the Chinese leadership will be published today, May 13. His book, `The Courage to Stand Alone: Letters from Prison and Other Writings,' is a splendid testament to the yearning for democracy by a political dissident who has never experienced true freedom in a land and country that has never experienced true democracy or anything approximating an open society. His writings speak to us about the need for democratic reform at a time when China exhibits little 
internal visible dissent. There is now no visible political dissent in China because political dissidents have either gone into exile, are in prison, or have redirected their energies in new-found entrepreneurial enterprises. 
Mr. President, we are here today not only to laud the publication of Wei Jingsheng's book of letters or to urge Beijing to discard its harsh treatment of its leading political dissident, we are here to honor a true democrat. We should honor true democrats and democracy anywhere, and under any circumstances. We can and should promote human rights practices and democracy abroad just as we pursue other important national interests. 
Our foreign policy must express both our values and our interests. That is why we must continue to support the development of political and economic reforms abroad while endorsing those democracy-promoting programs undertaken by such non-government organizations as the National Endowment for Democracy [NED] and the Center for Democracy. 
Wei Jingsheng's current prison term expires in the year 2009 but his health is reportedly so poor that he may not survive until then. Keeping Wei Jingsheng in prison under such difficult conditions would be a permanent stain on China's claim that it is misunderstood by the rest of the world. To release this man and other prisoners of conscience would bring good will to China and assure the outside world that China enjoys the self-confidence to change. 
I join with my colleagues in the hope that Wei Jingsheng will be released from prison in the very near future. 
Thank you.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am sensitive to the concerns expressed by my colleagues. At the same time, significant reforms were made to USDA lending programs by the 1996 FAIR Act.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Harrison Eiteljorg, a dear friend and longtime patron of the arts, who passed away last week at the age of 93. This afternoon, friends and family will gather in Indianapolis to remember Harrison and to celebrate his remarkable life. 
Harrison Eiteljorg was the founder and chief benefactor of the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art. This museum, located in downtown Indianapolis, houses his extensive collection of paintings and sculptures of the American West, with works by Frederic Remington, Georgia O'Keefe, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Hart Benton. It also contains his collection of Indian artifacts, with costumes, weapons, ceremonial objects and masks representing tribes of the Midwest, Plains, and Northwest coast. The Eiteljorg collection is perhaps the finest of its type anywhere in the world. 
Harrison Eiteljorg found absolute joy in the pursuit, discovery and acquisition of paintings and sculptures of the American West. Early in his life, business interests took Eiteljorg on frequent and extended trips to the West and Southwest. His interest in Indian artifacts and crafts developed at this time, together with his attraction to Western painting and sculpture. 
Eiteljorg began assembling his collections in the late 1940's. His first piece was Olaf Weighorst's Cutting Horse, which depicts a cowboy about to rope a steer. As his collection grew, Eiteljorg tried to meet many of the artists whose works he purchased, in an effort to share a few moments of their lives. And, he gave his encouragement and financial support to several young artists, enabling them to devote full time and attention to their art. 
Harrison Eiteljorg was also a supporter and active member of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. He became a member of the IMA Board of Trustees in 1962, served as board chairman from 1974 to 1983, and had been honorary chairman since 1987. In the 1980's, Eiteljorg made a gift to the IMA of more than 1,000 pieces from his collection of African and oceanic art. 
As a former mayor of Indianapolis, I understand the importance of citizens being involved in their local communities. Harrison Eiteljorg's strong sense of civic responsibility and duty helped make Indianapolis a showcase for art and culture. 
Harrison Eiteljorg's personal commitment to preserving the heritage of American Indians and the evolution of the West is to be commended. While he will be sorely missed, his important collections will continue to educate and enchant visitors to the Eiteljorg Museum and the Indianapolis Museum of Art for many years to come.

Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. President, the objective of the Chemical Weapons Convention, the debate that we are involved in now, is leadership, a question of leadership by our country. 
We can take a look at all the exceptions and the negative views, but the very positive force I think we want to stress in framing this issue is, the United States of America, our statesmen, President Ronald Reagan, George Bush, now President Bill Clinton, and many who have worked with them in the Armed Forces and in statecraft, recognize that our country has a very substantial problem in the world; namely, that of chemical weapons. 
We came to a determination on our part that these weapons were unreliable, unstable, dangerous, and so dangerous, as a matter of fact, that we did not wish to employ them--we 
wished to destroy them. We have been doing that as a nation. 
Our dilemma is that other nations, primarily Russia, with substantial stores much greater than our own, but a variety of other nations, purportedly have these weapons. Our problem is to convince other nations in the world that we all ought to be about the task of ending production of these weapons, ending possession, storage, ending any vestige of them. 
Now, in order to do that, we have to bring other nations into this with us. Therefore, we have offered leadership now for many years. We have convinced 74 other nations that have already ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention that they ought to be with us in this quest. I make that point at the outset, Mr. President, because the motion before the Senate is to strike a condition added, at least to this treaty, that would say we ought to forgo our leadership, we ought to really forget what our objective has been for years. I presume we ought to forget we are in the process of destroying all of our own chemical weapons and simply hope that others might proceed. 
As a matter of fact, if we do not ratify this convention this evening, others will proceed, but they will proceed without us. Our diplomacy with Russia will be severely impaired. As a result, even though we are working with Russia now--as a matter of fact, to help them destroy chemical weapons--through reasons the world will find hard to understand, we will have denied the very treaty we have asked others to join us in. It makes no sense. 
Let me say with all due respect to those who formulated the idea that we should not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention unless the so-called rogue states--named as North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, and Iraq--join, must have really stayed up nights trying to think of some way to throw us off course. I presume they felt that our antipathy to some of these states would be such that we would say if they are not going to be a part of it, we ought not to be a part of it, we ought to simply go after them in a unilateral way. Let me examine that for a moment, Mr. President. 
The Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Massachusetts have talked about law, about legitimacy. As a matter of fact, our Nation does have the mobility to be an enforcer. In the event we feel our security is threatened, our President might, in fact, consider a military action against a nation that offered a security threat to us. But let us examine the implications if our President decides to do this. If he is going to act unilaterally without benefit of international law--and international law does count because other nations understand the implications of that cooperation and the binding that brings--if we are going to contemplate solo strikes without benefit of international law, then we will have to think about overflight rights, about the problems of our pilots if our aircraft are down, about a number of implications in which we count upon cooperation of nation-states. International law does count. It makes a difference that there is a law against this, and that the United States acts with other nations and with their backing to enforce that, and that we shall have to do. 
Much has been said about lack of military will or lack of political will, but, Mr. President, I have seen very little of that in this Chamber during this debate. We are serious about this. 
Mr. President, let me add just as a topical matter, because the Members of the Senate who have been watching local television at least in the last half-hour appreciate that in northwest Washington, in the downtown area near the B'nai B'rith headquarters, a vial of chemical material or biological material is present that authorities of the police and fire department and special persons in the Washington, DC, area have now picked up this material, and people in the B'nai B'rith headquarters are being decontaminated. A suggestion is that it may be anthrax, a very deadly biological weapon. 
It was not long ago on this floor, Mr. President, that the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act was debated and we talked then in terms of attempting to bring Department of Defense resources into play with 
the cities of this country--Washington, DC, being prominent among them, Atlanta, GA, Denver, CO, and 23 other cities have been named--so that in the event there should be anthrax, which was specifically mentioned in the debate, we were prepared to move. That is leadership, Mr. President. We saw the threat and we prepared to move upon it. We have done so. 
Now, we will do so with regard to the international scene. But the treaty gives us the basis of international law. To suggest for a moment, Mr. President, we ought to be deterred from our leadership by whether Iraq joins, whether Iran is involved, whether North Korea should ever be involved, is to stretch credibility really to the breaking point. These nations are irrelevant to our membership and our leadership. They are irrelevant to our standing for international law and our ability to act, and to act decisively. That must be our standard, Mr. President. With imagination, one will think of all sorts of hobgoblins that can be thrown up to make an interesting debate, but debate is leadership, and debate is decisive political will, and the debate is our ability to convince other nations of the world they should come with us, that we are reliable, that we stay the course, that our word is good, administration after administration. 
Mr. President, this is the reason we should vote to strike this amendment, this condition, from the convention immediately, decisively. It has been a point, clearly, a parliamentary procedure, and that our failure to do so, as a matter of fact, jeopardizes the entire treaty. It is improbable, if not impossible, our Nation would ever join, would ever follow through on our leadership, if we were to wait upon states that are irrelevant to the whole proposition. 
I conclude, Mr. President, by saying obviously, threats in those states are not relevant. We must be decisive. We need going for us international law, enhancement of our intelligence that the intrusive inspections and all of the trade accounts will give to us, so that when we strike, we will strike accurately and completely and bring the security to the world that this treaty attempts to promote.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware. The condition that we move to strike, condition 29, would prohibit the United States from ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention until the President certifies that Russia has done the following: 
Ratified the CWC, complied with the 1990 bilateral destruction agreement, fulfilled its obligations under the 1989 Wyoming memorandum of understanding, and ceased all chemical weapons activities. 
Mr. President, two arguments against this condition prevailed, at least on the last vote that we had. I cite the first important argument is simply that this is a killer amendment. Senators need to know that a vote to leave this in the convention effectively terminates the convention. Senators cannot have it both ways. 
I simply indicate, in his very important statement, the majority leader, Senator Lott, referencing a particular condition that he found appealing, indicated it was not a killer amendment. But, in fact, this one is a killer amendment. Therefore, there is a crucial reason to vote to strike it. 
Second, Mr. President, once again we are talking about American leadership. It is in our interest, clearly, to get Russia's attention to the chemical weapons problem. We have decided unilaterally in this country that chemical weapons are not useful to us in our defense, largely because we cannot necessarily guard our own troops against the fallout and against the problems they create. So we are destroying them. 
Russia always had greater stocks than we have. They still do. It has been in our interest to work with the Russians. In the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act, so-called Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act, we have worked with the Russians in a first instance to assist them in the techniques of destroying chemical weapons in Russia. There are seven very large sites that need to be dealt with. We are dealing now with the Russians at the first. 
Mr. President, I speak today from a personal experience of last October when it was my privilege to accompany the then Secretary of Defense, William Perry, and my colleagues Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Joe Lieberman, in a visit to Russia, specifically to the Defense Department of Russia and to military persons involved in weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps equally importantly, Mr. President, it was my privilege to go with my colleagues from America to the Russian Duma. On that particular day, our first attempt was to attempt to gain some understanding by members of the Duma about the importance of the START II treaty and its ratification. While we were there, we visited with the relevant committees comparable to our Foreign Relations and our Armed Services Committee about the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The Russians--in what we characterize as the Russian administration, the executive branch, and the legislative branch, the Duma--made identical points to us, that the START II treaty was coupled in consideration with the expansion of NATO. They said this is a political issue. These two are 
joined together. 
With regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention, they made the clear distinction that it was not political, it was not involved with either NATO or START II or other arrangements. As a matter of fact, they perceived it was in the interests of Russia to ratify the treaty. They also pointed out that Russia has very little money, that at this particular point in history Russian taxes are not being paid with regularity. The soldiers are not being paid, or at least their paychecks are often delayed. As a result, they pointed out that arms control expenses were a very great problem for them. I think we understand that. That is not a sufficient reason for Russia to dodge its responsibilities. But it was a reason offered as to why they had postponed consideration. 
In addition, Mr. President, they have postponed consideration because despite our leadership from the very beginning, our leadership to destroy our own chemical weapons, then to try to sign up all the nations of the world to destroy theirs, and to make this an international law project, the Russians read our press and they understood that we had had difficulty last December in ratifying this convention. So they simply were curious as to whether we were serious now. Well, we are, Mr. President. I simply say that the question that is before the Senate should not be delay or perhaps failure to ratify the treaty, because we are waiting on Russia. Our leadership is imperative. We are the country that is leading the world. We are the country that is leading Chemical Weapons Convention matters. Our citizens of the United States take that seriously. Mr. President, a large majority of Americans want us to act. They believe the U.S. Government ought to do everything possible, and they recognize, as do most Senators, that this convention is unlikely to get that job done very swiftly but they do recognize it is an advance, it is a constructive step. To offer as a reason why we would not proceed that we are waiting for Russia, or hoping that two agreements that are specified in the condition might somehow come to fulfillment is to miss the entire point of the leadership that is involved and the persuasion we must have. 
Mr. President, I believe it is important, as soon as we ratify this convention, for the President of the United States to press on President Yeltsin his responsibility to gain ratification. At the Helsinki summit meeting recently, President Yeltsin assured our President he would offer that leadership. He assured our President he understood the responsibility of the Russians. He also asked our President to do his duty to help get the job done here. In fairness, our President has been fulfilling that responsibility, as did Senator Dole yesterday, as have President Bush and President Ford, as they have come forward as Presidents who understand, and as the majority leader understands. In his statement today, he mentioned one reason for voting for this treaty is the fact that two Republican administrations have made a commitment. An American word means something. Our leadership has continuity and staying power. It does not flip one way or another, depending upon Iraq or Russia. 
Mr. President, I simply say, once again, American leadership is at stake. We are looking at a killer amendment. This condition must be struck. I ask Senators to vote aye when the roll is called. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the condition we are discussing, all Senators by this time, I am certain, understand, requires the President to certify that the parties to the convention have agreed to strike article X of the convention and amend article XI of the convention. That means, in simple language, that the United States would simply say a treaty negotiated by 160 countries, now ratified by, apparently, 74--unilaterally, we simply knock out article X and severely amend article XI. 
As all Senators who have addressed this will admit, this means effectively the end of the treaty, at least in terms of our participation, because, clearly, the other nations of the world are under no obligation to renegotiate the entire treaty at that point. This is the reason it is strictly a killer amendment. It simply knocks out material parts of the convention. 
If those who are advocating this had a point, there might be reason to pause at this point and not ratify the treaty. But by and large it appears to me that most of us want to ratify the treaty and we do so with assurance, first of all, that as a country we have our wits about us. There is no possibility this President, the next President, Members of the Senate, any responsible American is going to furnish material to countries that are rogue states that are going to jeopardize our security. The treaty does not call for that, as again and again we pointed out. This was a generous interpretation that the Iranians gave because, at least from that standpoint, they would like to have the material. But why we should ever be that gullible escapes me. There is no mandate to give anything away. 
Those of us who advocate the treaty have been saying we will not. The President of the United States has been asked for assurance, and he said that he will not. He has sent letters to the majority leader and to individual Senators affirming this in any number of ways. 
Furthermore, the question arises, `Fair enough, Mr. President, or Mr. Senator, if you will not give things away to the Iranians, how about the French or the Germans or some other nation? Perhaps they will do so.' As Secretary Cohen replied on Meet The Press on Sunday--and Secretary Albright, likewise, who was sitting beside him responded to this question--they pointed out that is a very good reason for us to be around the table with the other countries from the beginning, setting the rules. 
If Senators are seriously concerned that other countries are going to give away the store, we had better be there to help restrain them, to offer our leadership. It comes back to that, our leadership. We were the ones that started the whole process--President Reagan, President Bush, President Clinton. We are the ones who had a good idea: If we were getting rid of our chemical weapons, others ought to get rid of theirs. 
This is our treaty, as Secretary Albright said, `Made in the USA.' And we ought to be there to set the rules, to be the governing board, to assert our leadership at the moment that it is crucial after April 29. 
So I say simply to those who have qualms about articles X and XI, we are not going to give away the store, any of us, as patriotic Americans. We would like to be at the table to make sure no one else entertains that thought. But I say again, whether we are there or not, the treaty is going to happen after April 29. We better be there and, hopefully, with affirmative votes to strike this fifth situation we have discussed this evening, this fifth condition, and for final passage, to vote for the treaty. These are very important for the foreign policy and security of our country.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for a remarkable speech in favor of the Chemical Weapons Convention, and for his leadership. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, for a very important announcement. I have in front of me the statement given by Senator Dole at the White House. I point out the context of this statement was a meeting with Senator Dole and President Clinton, in which these two statesmen came together this morning for a very important purpose, namely to say to America, in a unanimous way, the Chemical Weapons Convention is important for our security. 
Senator Dole stated: 
Last September, the Senate Majority Leader, Trent Lott, asked me to express my opinion on the Chemical Weapons Convention. In my response, I raised concerns about the Chemical Weapons Convention and expressed hope that the President and the Senate work together to ensure that the treaty is effectively verifiable and genuinely global. They have, and as a result, 28 conditions to the Senate's Resolution of Ratification have been agreed to. These 28 agreed conditions address major concerns. 
I commend Senator Lott, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar, and many other former colleagues, as well as President Clinton and administration officials for their constructive efforts, is it perfect--no--but I believe there are now adequate safeguards to protect American interests. We should keep in mind that the United States is already destroying its chemical weapons in accordance with legislation passed more than 10 years ago. The CWC would require all other parties to destroy their stockpiles by April 2007. 
In addition, the Administration has agreed to a number of provisions dealing with rogue states that remain outside the treaty. 
The Senator attaches a letter from President Clinton to Senator Dole dated April 22, 1997, outlining those provisions. And then Senator Dole continues: 
I also understand there is a possibility of an additional agreement with respect to sharing of information. If so, it would further strengthen the treaty. I understand that even with all the added safeguards, not every Senator, for their own good reasons, will support ratification. 
As a member of the Senate, I supported the START I, START II, INF, and CFE treaties because they met the crucial tests of effective verification, real reductions, and stability. If I were presently in the Senate, I would vote for ratification of the CWC because of the many improvements agreed to. 
Those who may still have concerns can look to Article XVI, which allows withdrawal from the treaty on 90 days notice if it fails to serve America's vital interests. There is little doubt in my mind that if this convention increases proliferation of chemical weapons, it would lead to public outrage which would compel any President to act. The bottom line is that when it comes to America's security, we must maintain a strong national defense that is second to none. 
As the Senator has pointed out, we will have in front of the body this afternoon, first of all, all 33 conditions, including 5 that are killer amendments. We must vote those down. We will have, then, before us, 28 agreed amendments that Senator Dole has referenced. We should vote in favor of those, and then proceed in this debate to strike the other 5. 
We are here today to discuss the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I say to my colleagues that, in performing its constitutional responsibilities with respect to treaties and international agreements, the Senate has to reach a judgment as to whether, on balance, U.S. acceptance of the obligations contained in the treaty serves the national interests of the United States. That phrase, on balance, is important, because in arriving at our judgment, we have to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of a treaty's provisions and decide whether the advantages or benefits outweigh any real or potential costs. 
If one believes that the benefits outweigh the costs, one will write and support one kind of resolution of ratification that consents to the treaty while utilizing conditional language to clarify or minimize perceived weaknesses. However, if one believes that the costs of U.S. participation outweigh the benefits, one will write and support a very different kind of resolution of ratification. 
It is my belief that the Chemical Weapons Convention, on balance, is in the national security interests of the United States, and thus I believe the Senate should ratify a resolution of ratification which allows the United States to deposit its instrument of ratification and become a state-party to the CWC. 
As Senator Biden pointed out, this international treaty was negotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush and was signed by Secretary of State Eagleburger in January 1993--just before George Bush left office. 
Senator Biden was generous in pointing out that these were two Republican Presidents, Secretary Eagleburger was a Republican Secretary of State. It is appropriate that Senator Dole, as Republican candidate for President, join with President Clinton today, once again affirming that the CWC is in the best national interests of our country.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, for 17 years Chuck Conner has been my top agriculture and nutrition advisor, and for the last 10 years has been Republican staff director of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. Chuck is departing the Senate to become president of the Corn Refiners Association. 
Chuck has ushered four farm bills through the Senate, including last year's historic FAIR Act that ended 60 years of Federal production controls. Chuck's work can be seen in moving American agriculture to the free market, thoughtfully downsizing the Department of Agriculture, reforming hundreds of USDA field offices, making food safer through pesticide regulations, saving and then reforming the farm credit system, updating commodity futures legislation, and landmark reform of the nutrition sections in last year's welfare reform bill. 
Chuck was with me on my Indiana farm June 28, 1985, when then Secretary of Agriculture Jack Block and I announced the first Conservation Reserve Program. Today that program is still a vital cornerstone of soil and water conservation in America, and the extension of the program last year was part of the most significant environmental legislation in the 104th Congress. Chuck has been involved every step of the way. 
He has combined a strong academic background, with an agricultural economics degree from the Purdue University School of Agriculture, and practical knowledge of how programs are implemented. His family continues to operate an 1100-acre corn and soybean farm in Benton County, IN. Chuck and his wife Dru maintain a herd of 100 registered Angus cows in Whitley County, IN. 
Chuck and Dru met in the early 1980's while working in my office. My wife, Char, and I have enjoyed watching the growth of their four children: Katie, Ben, Andrew, and Emily. 
I will miss Chuck's counsel, which Agriculture Committee members have trusted and respected. He now takes his leadership skills to agribusiness. On the committee he has hired, trained, and developed a talented staff that will be led by his longtime deputy Randy Green, maintaining continuity in service. 
I speak for majority and minority members of the Agriculture Committee in wishing Chuck Conner, an extraordinarily talented and loyal friend, the very best.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce, by request, on behalf of Senator Biden and myself, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed by the United States on January 13, 1993, and was submitted by President Clinton to the United States Senate on November 23, 1993, for its advice and consent to ratification. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention contains a number of provisions that require implementing legislation to give them effect within the United States. These include: international inspections of U.S. facilities; declarations by U.S. chemical and related industry; and establishment of a `National Authority' to serve as the liaison between the United States and the international organization established by the Chemical Weapons Convention and States Parties to the Convention.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I introduce two pieces of legislation aimed at minimizing the burden of the estate and gift tax on Americans. The first would provide Americans with a powerful estate tax planning tool by raising the tax-free gift limit to $25,0000 from the current $10,000. The second bill would correct a longstanding agricultural problem that effectively limits the ability of farmers to rent farmland that they have inherited to other family members. 
The Senate Agriculture Committee held hearings at the end of February to study the impact of estate and gift taxes on farmers. As a farmer and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I understand the far-reaching effect that the inheritance tax has on rural America. Testimony revealed that farmers are six times more likely to pay estate taxes than other Americans due to the capital-intensive nature of the farm business. Commercial farms, those core farms that produce 85 percent of the Nation's agricultural products, may be 15 times more likely to pay inheritance taxes than other individuals. As the average age of farmers approaches 60 years, a quarter of all farmers could confront the inheritance tax over the next 20 years. 
I have already introduced three comprehensive bills on this subject--the first bill would eliminate the inheritance tax entirely; the second phases it out gradually; and the third raises the unified credit exemption to $5 million from the current $600,000 level. By raising the level of exempted property to this amount, the Federal Government would relieve 96 percent of the Americans who currently file estate tax returns from this burden. 
Although repeal of this tax ultimately is the best course of action, I understand that sufficient momentum may not exist to achieve this end. In the mean time, Congress should provide Americans with estate planning alternatives that help facilitate the passing of their estates to the next generation. These two bills further this goal. 
The first bill would simply raise the yearly nontaxable gift amount from the current $10,000 to $25,000. Congress unified the estate and gift titles of the Tax Code in 1976, subjecting a decedent's lifetime taxable gifts and taxable estate to one rate structure. Under current law, the first $10,000 of gifts made by a donor during a calendar year to any individual are not included in the donor's taxable gift amount for that year. Nor does this $10,000 gift lower the decedent's unified credit exemption, which allows each individual to pass on $600,000 of assets without incurring estate and gift taxes. Over the years, inflation has eroded this $10,000 amount, which has not been increased since 1982. Under my proposal, individuals could give $25,000 each year without estate and gift tax consequence. Through the current practice known as `gift splitting,' a couple could give up to $50,000 tax free each year. Raising the gift exemption amount would be a positive first step for Congress to take in helping with the transfer of family businesses and farms to the next generation. 
My second bill would correct a longstanding agricultural problem in the Tax Code that disqualifies farm heirs from receiving special use valuation for estate tax purposes because they cash leased the farm property to another member of the family. Section 2032A of the Tax Code provides heirs the option of valuing qualified farm property at its current use rather than valuing the property at its highest and most developed use. If the heir who inherited the property ceases to use it in its qualified use within 10 years, an additional recapture tax is imposed to regain the benefit of the special use valuation. Some tax courts have held that the cash leasing of the property to members of the decedent's family is not a qualified use, thus triggering the recapture tax provision. Congress partially fixed this problem in 1988 in regard to spouses, but other qualified heirs remain unable to cash lease the property to members of the family. My legislation would correct this wrinkle in the law by allowing qualified heirs to cash lease the inherited special use property to members of the decedent's family or members of the spouse's family without triggering the recapture tax. This bill is retroactive to December 31, 1976, when section 2032A was enacted into law. 
Congress intended to grant family businesses and farms some level of protection from the estate and gift tax through section 2032A, and farmers have relied on this provision for estate planning purposes over the years. During the Senate Agriculture hearings on estate taxes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture testified that the special use valuation reduced the number of taxable estates and the total Federal estate and gift taxes for all farm estates by about one-third. The American Farmland Trust gave witness to the fact that more than half of farm production in the United States occurs in counties that are metropolitan or adjacent to metropolitan areas. Without special use valuation for estate tax purposes, much of our Nation's agricultural land would be valued as strip malls or housing developments, rather than as farmland. Lessening the gross estate through section 2032A allows the next generation of farmers to maintain this land in agricultural production and helps slow urban sprawl. My legislation would make this good provision better.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Archie Galloway for his dedicated military service to our country. 
Colonel Galloway is retiring on May 31, 1997 from active service in the U.S. Army after serving for nearly 29 years as an infantry officer and soldier. I came to know Colonel Galloway personally during his last 3 1/2 years of military service as a staff officer in the Army's Senate liaison office, as he arranged for and accompanied me on a number of key trips around the globe on critical national issues of defense and foreign affairs. 
Colonel Galloway was born in Baltimore, MD, on April 12, 1947. He enlisted in the Army in 1967 as a private and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1969 from Infantry Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, GA. Throughout his military career, he consistently distinguished himself during times of peace and war, in both command and staff positions. He volunteered for duty in Vietnam as a Vietnamese ranger adviser and was decorated with the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Silver Star and the Bronze Star Medal. During Operation Just Cause, he served as the chief of current operations in the joint task force and earned at the end of his tour in the 7th Infantry Division the Legion of Merit. His other notable military awards include the Combat Infantryman's Badge, Meritorious Service Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Commendation Medal, Army General Staff Identification Badge, Ranger, Airborne, and Air Assault Badges. 
Colonel Galloway's professionalism and leadership as a military officer have earned him the respect and admiration of his soldiers, fellow officers, and Members of the U.S. Congress. He is known for his integrity, compassion, and ability to inspire men and women from all walks of life. It is these qualities that will assure his success as a new legislative assistant for Senator Jeff Sessions. 
I salute Arch Galloway for his distinguished military record and wish him and his wonderful wife and great baker, the former Nancy Carol Brendel, many years of happiness and good health in his retirement.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is with great privilege that I rise today to honor Charles H. Webb, an outstanding administrator and musician who is retiring after 24 years of service as Dean of the Indiana University School of Music in Bloomington, IN. 
Since his appointment in 1973, the Indian University School of Music has enjoyed a world-wide reputation for excellence. The Indiana University School of Music has been ranked No. 1 among schools of music in the country, and is the first and only school to bring an opera performance to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera in New York. 
Dean Webb's accomplishments have been hailed by Indiana University and the State of Indiana. He received the Thomas Hart Benton Medal from Indiana University in 1987 and the Governor's Award for the Arts in 1989. He is also a two-time recipient of the Sagamore of the Wabash award, which is the highest award given by the State of Indiana for meritorious service. 
In addition to his responsibilities at Indiana University, Charles Webb has maintained an active performance schedule as a conductor, pianist, and organist. Hailed as one of today's finest accompanists, he has appeared with some of the world's best musicians. He currently serves as the organist for the First United Methodist Church in Bloomington, IN. 
Charles Webb's contributions to the art of music and his support for education will continue long after his retirement, as his students enrich our lives with performances in orchestras, bands, opera, and theater companies, and schools around the world. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating him for his years of tireless service, and in wishing him and family all the best in the future.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will stop prisoners from getting food stamp benefits. My bill will assist States in implementing a program to ensure that prisoners are not counted as members or heads of food stamp households, thus either increasing the households' benefits or allowing an individual to illegally receive benefits in the prisoner's name. 
I was disturbed to read in the newspaper about a draft General Accounting Office report showing over $3 million in food stamp benefits being overpaid to households in which a member has been incarcerated. Current law prohibits prisoners from receiving food stamp benefits and requires that households notify their local welfare office of any changes in the makeup of the household. I am concerned to see that there is a breakdown in the system, allowing millions of dollars to be paid out illegally. 
Briefings by USDA's Food and Consumer Service and the General Accounting Office have confirmed that although a few States are performing computer matches of data on States' food stamp participants and verified inmates, most are not. All States should be doing these computer matches. This bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to collect information from States already doing computer matches to prevent prisoners from receiving food stamp benefits, then evaluate, summarize, and disseminate this information to all States not later than 180 days after the bill's enactment. The Secretary must then provide the States with technical assistance to implement a computer matching system. 
The problem of prisoners illegally receiving Federal benefits is not limited to the Food Stamp Program. Another recently released General Accounting Office report shows that the Social Security Administration has made erroneous payments to prisoners who were incarcerated in the jail system at the time of the study. In response to this study, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 included language authorizing the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to enter into agreements with institutions to prevent these erroneous payments. We should make a similar effort to prevent these erroneous payments in the Food Stamp program. 
The Food Stamp Program provides a safety net for millions of people. We cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine the Food Stamp Program. Integrity is essential to ensure a program that can serve those in need. It is Congress' responsibility to play a role in ending fraud and abuse in all federally funded programs. This legislation is an important step in ending fraud and abuse in the Food Stamp Program. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to take a moment to recognize JALEX, the Japanese Language Exchange Program. Since its inception in 1992, the JALEX Program has made valuable educational contributions to students in the United States preparing to function in an increasingly global environment. 
There are few Americans who would dispute the importance of providing our young people with an education that will prepare them to function effectively in the world. It is the responsibility of our educational system to prepare them to be competitive and cooperative in this global environment. You will be pleased to know that this kind of preparation is happening through JALEX, a unique program funded by the Center for Global Partnership of the Japan Foundation and administered by the Laurasian Institution. 
JALEX is unlike many exchange programs because it is reciprocal, pairing novice teachers from Japan with mentor teachers of Japanese in the United States at the precollegiate level. The program is designed to mutually benefit teachers from Japan and teachers and students in the United States. JALEX began as a modest prototype serving 18 schools in 5 States and has grown to serve 76 schools and community organizations in 20 States, including 18 cities in my home State of Indiana. JALEX also operates in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Tennessee, Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont. 
In the process of achieving its mission--enhancing Japanese language instruction in the United States and classroom experience for native Japanese teachers of Japanese-as-a-foreign-language study--the program also provides opportunities for meaningful cultural exchange for thousands of American citizens. 
Since 1985, the study of Japanese in United States schools has grown rapidly. Despite the comparative difficulty of Japanese and the longstanding appeal of Romance languages, interest in and demand for Japanese language instruction has continued to grow on a global scale. 
JALEX began in 1992 when President Bush and Prime Minister Miyazawa acknowledged the essential role of enhanced Japanese language training to advance global partnership between the two nations. During the Tokyo summit in May l996, President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto vowed to further promote exchange programs between young people of Japan and the United States as a means of strengthening this bilateral relationship. 
The Center for Global Partnership of the Japan Foundation and the Freeman Foundation should be applauded for their generous support of this program. Their support provides participating schools an invaluable resource of a native Japanese teaching assistant in the classroom as well as materials, stipends, and professional development opportunities for United States teachers. 
The approximate value of the annual benefits provided by the JALEX Program to each school is conservatively estimated at $30,000. The Japanese language programs would not be as strong without the support of JALEX. The program has also provided several JALEX participants--teachers, administrators, and students--the opportunity to visit Japan. These activities are provided at no cost to local school districts and without U.S. Government tax dollars. 
Because of JALEX, our leaders of the next century, will be able to direct our Nation on a global scale with a greater sensitivity and awareness to cultural and national differences. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the JALEX Program for the contributions it has made toward fostering cultural understanding and respect.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I use today to introduce the Federal Surplus Property Donations Act. This bill corrects an oversight by allowing nonprofit charitable organizations that primarily serve low-income people, to be eligible to receive Federal surplus personal property. 
Under current law, Federal surplus property can be donated to State and local governments, schools, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations that serve the homeless. My bill would expand the eligibility to food banks, construction oriented charities, building material recycling warehouses, and similar nonprofit tax-exempt organizations that serve the poor. The bill does not give preference to these organizations, but simply adds them to the list of eligible recipients. 
Charities that provide food and shelter assistance are major contributors to the safety net for the poor. As we look to charities to provide these important services to our Nation's low-income population, it is reasonable that we include them as eligible to receive surplus property. Excess property can be used creatively by these groups to lower expenses, thereby allowing charities to become more efficient. These nonprofit charitable organizations serving the poor are in great need of materials and equipment to build and repair homes, store food items, and deliver goods and services to those in need. We have already acknowledged that nonprofit charities serving the homeless should be eligible to receive these goods. This bill would recognize those charitable institutions which are providing shelter, food, and services to low-income Americans who may not be homeless. 
Mr. President, this legislation would provide donated equipment and goods at lower costs than alternative approaches such as grants to charities. Furthermore, it is a wise use of moneys either paid in taxes or donated by generous citizens. Domestic charities will make good use of Federal surplus and invest moneys saved in expanded efforts to further help those in need. 
The bill has bipartisan support. Cosponsoring the bill with me today are the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator Tom Harkin, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy. In addition, I am pleased to say that my Indiana colleague in the House, Congressman Lee Hamilton, is introducing the same bill today. 
Mr. President, I have personally supported various food banks in Indiana over the years. I am now proud to introduce a bill that will assist them in their continued efforts of serving the poor.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to provide a more effective method of targeting available Federal funds to enhance safety at our Nation's most hazardous highway-rail grade crossings. 
I first introduced this measure during the 104th Congress following 2 years of work to address a pressing public safety problem occurring in Indiana and other rail-intensive States. It is my hope this important legislation will be given thoughtful and thorough consideration this year as Congress moves to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. It is unclear what the final program structure will look like, or what the specific Federal role will be in the transportation decisionmaking process. I will work this year to assure that the goals of this rail safety legislation are incorporated as part of an ISTEA reauthorization bill that creates a more streamlined, flexible Federal highway program to help States maintain safe, effective, and efficient transportation networks. 
In America today, several hundred people are killed and thousands more injured every year as a result of vehicle-train collisions at highway-rail grade crossings. A significant number of these accidents occur in rail-intensive States such as Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, California, and Texas. One quarter of the Nation's 168,000 public highway-rail grade crossings are located in these 5 States. They accounted for 38 percent of deaths and 32 percent of injuries caused by vehicle-train collisions nationwide during 1991-1993. 
My home State of Indiana ranks sixth in the Nation for number of total public grade crossings with about 6,700, and is annually among the top five States for numbers of accidents and fatalities caused by vehicle-train crashes. 
In 1994, I travelled across northern Indiana aboard a QSX-500 locomotive and witnessed what engineers see every day--motorists darting across the railroad tracks before an oncoming train. From this experience, and from my work to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings, I learned that engineering solutions, along with education and awareness about grade 
crossing safety, are key strategies that can effectively prevent grade crossing accidents. 
Responding to this disturbing national trend, I began working in 1993 with Transportation Secretary Federico PenAE6a and with the Indiana Department of Transportation to address this serious safety problem. We worked to find solutions that would help Indiana and other States make better use of available funds to target the Nation's most hazardous rail crossings. 
The Federal Government has played an important role in helping States eliminate accidents and fatalities at public highway-rail intersections since passage of the Highway Safety Act by Congress in 1973. This act created the Rail-Highway Crossing Program, also known as the Section 130 Program. Since the program's inception, more than 28,000 improvement projects have been undertaken--from installation of warning gates, lights and bells, to pavement improvements and grade separation construction projects. 
During the 103d Congress, I introduced grade crossing safety legislation to restore States' discretion over millions of Federal highway dollars lost as a result of noncompliance with the Federal motorcycle helmet law. Indiana and other States affected by this law were prohibited from using a portion of their highway construction dollars to improve safety at highway-rail grade crossings. I was pleased the Congress repealed the helmet law penalty in 1995 as part of the National Highway System designation legislation. States now have greater flexibility to use their highway dollars for improvements at rail crossings, and for other transportation priorities. 
In March 1994, Senator Coats and I asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a survey of rail safety programs in Indiana and other rail intensive States experiencing a high number of accidents at highway-rail grade crossings. Released in August 1995, the report `Railroad Safety: Status of Efforts to Improve Railroad Crossing Safety' evaluated the best uses of limited Federal funds for rail crossing safety, reviewed policy changes that help State and local governments address rail safety issues, and recommended strategies to encourage interagency and intergovernmental cooperation. 
The report found that in addition to States' efforts to reduce accidents and fatalities through emphasis on education programs, engineering solutions, and enforcement of traffic laws, changes to the Federal funding formulas would target highway funds to areas of greatest risk. 
Under, ISTEA, the Section 130 Program was continued--with a portion of the 10 percent of a State's STP safety funds dedicated to highway-rail crossing improvement and hazard elimination projects. 
The GAO reported that key indicators or `risk factors' used to assess rail-grade crossing safety are not taken into account when STP funds are distributed among States. The GAO outlined the Federal Highway Administration's [FHWA] work to review options for STP formula changes that adjust the current flat percentage allocation to include these risk factors. Applying these factors to the funding formula creates a more targeted and focused process that maximizes the effectiveness of Federal funds. 
The risk factors criteria considered by FHWA include a State's share of the national total for number of public crossings, number of public crossings with passive warning devices, total number of accidents, and total number of fatalities occurring as a result of vehicle-train collisions at highway-rail grade crossings. 
For example, while Indiana received 3.4 percent of section 130 funds in fiscal year 1995, the Hoosier State experienced 6.1 percent of the Nation's accidents and 5.9 percent of the fatalities as a result of vehicle-train collisions from 1991 to 1993. In addition, Indiana has about 4 percent of the Nation's public rail crossings. 
Preliminary estimates of STP apportionments under a risk-based apportionment formula indicate Indiana's share of section 130 funds could increase by 49 percent, from the fiscal year 1997 level of $4.9 to $7.3 million. Overall, about 21 States would receive a substantial increase in section 130 funds for grade crossing improvements, including: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. 
While the Indiana Department of Transportation [INDOT] spends over $10 million a year to improve highway-rail grade crossings, a 49-percent increase in section 130 funds would allow INDOT and other State departments of transportation additional resources to improve hazardous highway-rail grade crossings. 
The Formula Enhancement Act addresses the allocation problem by adjusting the funding formula for the STP to include an apportionment of funds to States for the section 130 Program based on a 3-year average of these risk factors. I want to express my appreciation to the FHWA and to the Federal Railroad 
Administration for their valuable assistance in preparing this legislation. 
This legislation will help improve the way the Federal Government targets existing resources to enhance safety on our Nation's highways and along our rail corridors. This legislation does not call for new Federal spending, but rather for a more equitable and effective distribution of existing highway funds to States to enhance safety at dangerous highway-rail grade crossings. 
This legislation addresses one aspect of the grade crossing safety problem by refining a key provision of the existing ISTEA law. Using this proposal as a foundation, I am hopeful the Congress will craft provisions for the highway reauthorization bill that recognize the overall efforts of States to implement comprehensive rail safety programs. An effective grade crossing safety program integrates construction improvement projects with driver education and awareness programs, crossing closures, vigorous enforcement of crossing traffic laws and assessments of crossing inventories to identify the most hazardous crossings in a State. 
I will work with my colleagues this year to help assure Congress passes highway reauthorization legislation that makes the best use of available Federal resources while encouraging States to continue pursuing comprehensive efforts to address their public grade crossing safety requirements. My intent with this legislation is not to penalize certain States or to create winners or losers in the process of distributing Federal highway funds, but to find the best solution that will eliminate these preventable tragedies. 
At this time, it is unclear what direction the next highway authorization bill will take, what the Federal role will be in maintaining the national transportation infrastructure, and what current ISTEA programs will be renewed. Last year, I endorsed Senator Warner's reauthorization proposal to provide a more streamlined and flexible highway program that returns resources and authority back to the States. My intent with this legislation during this reauthorization process is not to protect a particular highway program or specific Federal set-aside requirement of the expiring ISTEA law, but rather to continue emphasizing an issue of great importance to my State of Indiana and to other States experiencing rail safety problems. I will advocate grade crossing safety as a priority within the context of other key funding and flexibility issues that are vital to the continued safety and mobility of Hoosiers traveling on Indiana roadways. I am hopeful this legislation will reinforce the importance of highway-rail grade crossing safety as the Congress moves forward with the national discussion of U.S. transportation policy for the 21st century. 
Continued emphasis on finding new and better ways to target existing resources to enhance safety at highway-rail grade crossings will contribute to the overall effort in Congress and in the States to prevent accidents, save lives, and sustain a balanced and effective transportation network for the Nation.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senators Harkin and Leahy, legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. This bill is very similar to S. 2077, which Senator Leahy and I introduced last September after several months of hearings and informal consultations with industry, academics, and regulators. The legislation streamlines U.S. futures trading law, conforming it to changing competitive realities. 
In many ways, regulation has benefited the U.S. futures industry. Prudent regulation enhances customer protection, prevents and punishes fraud and other abuses, and makes futures markets better able to provide risk management, price discovery, and investment opportunity. 
Regulation, however, also has its costs. U.S. futures markets face competition that is, in some cases, less regulated or differently regulated. In the years ahead, our challenge is to balance the need for adequate regulation with the need to offer cost-competitive products. 
This bill tries to strike such a balance. It requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to consider the costs for industry of the regulations it imposes. The bill streamlines the process of introducing new futures contracts, reducing the time that is required to begin trading these new products. It makes similar reforms to the process by which exchanges' rules are reviewed by the CFTC. 
Where additional authority for the CFTC is needed, the bill provides it. The CFTC will have the authority to require U.S. delivery points for overseas futures markets to provide information that is also regularly demanded of American market participants. This is eminently reasonable, and may assist the CFTC and other regulators in the future if situations similar to the 1996 London copper market scandal recur. 
The bill will also provide greater legal certainty for swaps, over-the-counter products that are of increasing importance to many businesses. It is important that these contracts' enforceability be made more certain, so that legal risk does not compound the other risks inherent in any financial transaction. In one important addition to last year's legislation, the new bill will also provide this legal certainty for swaps that are based on equities, as well as for hybrid instruments. In a more limited way, the bill will establish the terms of exemptions for on-exchange products traded solely among professional investors. 
Another addition to last year's legislation is a major rewrite of the so-called Treasury amendment, a provision of the Commodity Exchange Act that excludes some financial products from its regulatory coverage. This controversial section is at best unclear, and needs a fresh look from Congress. I hope the proposals we have made in this bill--which are explained in a discussion document I will mention in a moment--will both stimulate dialog and find wide acceptance. 
It is unfortunate that the CFTC and the Treasury Department, which discussed this subject at Senator Leahy's and my request, were unable to agree on a common approach. However, the committee will work with both agencies as we move forward. Despite some differences in drafting, I believe the Treasury Department's ideas are basically consistent with what Senators Harkin, Leahy, and I have proposed. The Treasury did not propose, as we do, to allow futures exchanges to create professionals-only markets in Treasury amendment products. However, Senator Harkin and I are informed that while the Treasury is still studying this proposal, in principle the Department does not object to treating exchange affiliates in a manner similar to other sophisticated market participants. 
The bill contains a number of other provisions. Senator Harkin and I have prepared a section-by-section discussion document, which may be helpful to our colleagues. 
On February 11 and 13, the committee will hold hearings on this legislation. It is a priority for the committee during the coming weeks and months. 
I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his extraordinary cooperation in putting this bill together. As the new ranking member of the committee, he has been gracious and collegial. Likewise, Senator Leahy's efforts both last year and this year deserve special praise. I salute them both for their leadership.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, development of overseas markets and customers is vital to the future of U.S. agriculture. Demand for food and feed is growing rapidly. U.S. agriculture is efficient and competitive, however, tariff and nontariff barriers remain high in many countries. 
As incomes rise in developing countries, their demands for our products will continue to expand. In 1996, agricultural exports reached a record $59.8 billion. Continued growth is vital. World commodity markets are often distorted by import barriers, export subsidies and State trading enterprises. These distortions put American farmers and agribusiness operators at a disadvantage. We must reduce trade barriers and allow our industry to supply the world's markets. 
Today I will introduce the Trade Agreement Implementation Reform Act. This bill will grant the President the fast-track authority he needs to negotiate future trade agreements. It is in the national interest for the President to have this authority, but is has lapsed due in part to the way past implementing legislation was handled. 
Earlier fast-track authority allowed side-deals, special-interest accommodations and provisions of questionable merit. As a result, public confidence in our trade policies eroded. Reforming the fast-track process and prohibiting these special-interest provisions is one step in gaining support for future trade agreements. 
My bill contains two major changes from previous practice. First, legislation submitted under the fast-track authority will contain only provisions absolutely necessary to implement an agreement. Prior law allowed provisions necessary and appropriate and encouraged deals with special interests in exchange for support. 
Second, although fast-track legislation is not amendable, we should make one exception. Senators should be able to amend or delete provisions that merely offset revenue losses from tariff changes. Such provisions in the Uruguay round legislation included the controversial Pioneer Preference and pension reform titles. Congress should have the ability to debate and amend items like these, but be subject to overall time limits. 
The United States must continue to move forward in its effort to find new markets for our goods and services. We should take advantage of a favorable trade climate in South America by pursuing an agreement with Chile. Chile has advanced bilateral trade agreements with Canada and Mexico and has become an associate member of the Southern Cone Mercosur trading bloc. Before the United States can move forward, the administration must have fast-track authority. The President must now make a case to Congress and the American people that this is a priority of his administration.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce three bills aimed at eliminating the burden that estate and gift taxes place on our economy. My first bill would repeal the estate and gift taxes outright. My second bill would phase out the estate tax over 5 years by gradually raising the unified credit each year until the tax is repealed after the fifth year. My third bill would immediately raise the effective unified credit from $600,000 to $5 million in an effort to address the disproportionate burden that the estate tax places on farmers and small businesses. 
I believe the best option is a simple repeal of the estate tax. I am hopeful that during this Congress, as Members become more aware of the effects of this tax, we can eliminate it from the Tax Code. However, even if the estate tax is not repealed, the unified credit must be raised. The credit has not been increased since 1987 when it was established at the $600,000 level. Since then, inflation has caused a growing percentage of estates to be subjected to the estate tax. My second bill is intended to highlight this point and provide a gradual path to repeal. 
Finally, my third bill focuses on relieving the estate tax burden that falls disproportionately on farmers and small business owners. By raising the exemption amount from $600,000 to $5 million, 96 percent of estates with farm assets and 90 percent of estates with noncorporate business assets would not have to pay estate taxes, according to the IRS. 
The estate tax began as a temporary tax in 1916, limited to 10 percent of one's inheritance. The tax intended to prevent the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few families. Today, however, the effect is often the opposite. The estate tax forces many family-owned farms and small businesses to sell to larger corporations, further concentrating the wealth. 
The estate tax has mushroomed into an exorbitant tax on death that discourages savings, economic growth and job formation by blocking the accumulation of entrepreneurial capital and by breaking up family businesses and farms. With the highest marginal rate at 55 percent, more than half of an estate can go directly to the government. By the time the inheritance tax is levied on families, their assets have already been taxed at least once. This form of double taxation violates perceptions of fairness in our tax system. 
In addition to tax liabilities, families often must pay lawyers, accountants and planners to untangle one of the most complicated areas of our tax code. In 1996, a Gallup poll estimated that a small family-owned business spent an average of $33,138 for lawyers and accountants to settle estates with the IRS. Larger family-owned businesses averaged $70,000. Families averaged 167 hours complying with the Byzantine rules of the estate tax, and the IRS estimates that they must audit nearly 40 percent of estate tax returns--a much higher rate than the 1.7 percent audit rate on incomes taxes. 
Let us consider the consequences of the estate tax on the American economy. The estate tax is counterproductive because it falls so heavily on our most dynamic job creators--small businesses. About two out of every three new jobs in this country are created by small business. From 1989 to 1991, a period of unusually slow economic growth, virtually all new net jobs were created by firms with fewer than twenty employees. 
Recent economic studies and surveys of small business owners support the thesis that the estate tax discourages economic growth. A 1994 study by the Tax Foundation concluded that the estate tax may have roughly the same effect on entrepreneurial incentives as would a doubling of income tax rates. A 1996 report prepared by Price Waterhouse found that even more family business owners were concerned about estate taxes than about capital gains taxes. A Gallup poll found that one-third of family-owned businesses expect to sell their family's firm to pay estate tax liability. Sixty-eight percent said the estate tax makes them less likely to make investments in their business, and 60 percent said that without an estate tax, they would have expanded their workforce. 
If we are sincere about boosting economic growth, we must consider what effect the estate tax has on a business owner deciding whether to invest in new capital goods or hire a new employee. We must consider its affect on a farmer deciding whether to buy new land, additional livestock or a new tractor. If you know that when you die your children will probably have to sell the business you build up over your lifetime, does that make you more likely to take the risk of starting a new business or enlarging your present business? It is apparent that the estate tax does discourage business and farm investments. 
One might expect that for all the economic disincentives caused by the estate tax, it must at least provide a sizable contribution to the U.S. Treasury. But in reality, the estate tax only accounts for about 1 percent of federal taxes. It cannot be justified as an indispensable revenue raiser. Given the blow delivered to job formation and economic growth, the estate tax may even cost the Treasury money. Our nation's ability to create new jobs, new opportunities and wealth is damaged as a result of our insistence on collecting a tax that earns less than 1 percent of our revenue. 
But this tax affects more than just the national economy. It affects how we as a nation think about community, family and work. Small businesses and farms represent much more than assets. They represent years of toil and entrepreneurial risk taking. They also represent the hopes that families have for their children. Part of the American Dream has always been to build up a business, farm or ranch so that economic opportunities and a way of life can be passed on to one's children and grandchildren. 
I have some personal experience in this area. My father died when I was in my early thirties, leaving his 604-acre farm in Marion County, Indiana, to his family. I managed the farm, which built up considerable debts during my father's illness at the end of his life. Fortunately, after a number of years, we were successful in working out the financial problems and repaying the money. We were lucky. That farm is profitable and still in the family. But many of today's farmers and small business owners are not so fortunate. Only about 30 percent of businesses are transferred from parent to child, and only about 12 percent of businesses make it to a grandchild. 
The strongest negative effects of the estate tax are felt by the American family farmer. Currently, proprietorships and partnerships make up about 95 percent of farms and ranches. In the vast majority of cases, family farms do not produce luxurious lifestyles for their owners. Farmers have large assets but relatively little income. The income of a family-run farm depends on modest returns from sizable amounts of invested capital. Much of what the farmer makes after taxes in reinvested into the farm, bolstering the estate-tax-derived `paper value' even more. 
As happens so often, family farms cannot maintain the cash assets necessary to pay estate taxes upon the death of the owner. Frequently, selling part of a farm is not an option, either because there is no suitable buyer or because reducing acreage would make the operation inviable. In these cases, a fire-sale of the family farm or business is required to pay the estate tax. Devastating to any business, such a forced sale hits farm families particularly hard because they frequently must sell at a price far below the invested value. Entire lifetimes of work are liquidated, and the skills of family members experienced in agriculture are lost to the American economy. 
Mr. President, I introduce today a set of bills to repeal the estate tax in an effort to expand investment incentives and job creation and to reinvigorate an important part of the American Dream. I am hopeful that Senators will join me in the effort to free small businesses, family farms and our economy from this counterproductive tax.

Mr. LUGAR. 
Mr. President, as we commence the 105th Congress and take up, as we surely will, issues with regard to national missile defense and theater missile defense, a key question is whether continued adherence to the ABM Treaty, in its original or a modified form, is compatible with the kind of missile defense we need. 
Is this an `either/or' choice? 
I hold the view that the ABM Treaty does have, or can be made to have, sufficient flexibility or elasticity to accommodate certain kinds of national missile or theater missile defense systems. By the same token, I reject the notion that we can only achieve the types of theater missile defense or national missile defense we need by outright abrogation of the ABM Treaty. 
I am struck more by the commonality than the differences between the prevailing views of some of my Republican colleagues in the Senate and views in the Administration on this subject. Much of the difference has to do with timing, stemming in part from different assessments of the intelligence information on the ballistic missile threat facing the country. Ultimately, responsible policy makers must come to grips with the management of the risk entailed by the threat and how much money we are willing to spend, in a tight budget situation, for various levels of missile defense to counter that threat. 
At this point in our debates, there seems to be general agreement that we are not trying to protect the U.S. against a massive nuclear strike from a reconstituted Soviet Union or even a general exchange with Russia. Nor, for that matter, are we talking about protection against a deliberate, massive Chinese nuclear attack on the United States. 
A consensus between the prevailing positions on the Hill and that of the administration comes closer if there is an acceptance that this range of Russian or Chinese threats are beyond our technological and financial means in the near term and that our objective is one of defending America against a Third World, long-range ballistic missile capability from a regime not subject to any rational laws of deterrence. 
It is the prospect that rogue states will at some point obtain strategic ballistic missiles - ICBMs - that can reach American shores which propels us to consider the deployment of a national missile defense. A second prospect involves an unauthorized or accidental launch of an ICBM from Russia or China. 
The kind of national missile defense system promoted both on the Hill and in the administration would not be capable of defending against thousands of warheads being launched against the United States. Rather, both sides are talking about a system capable of defending against the much smaller and relatively unsophisticated ICBM threat that a rogue nation or terrorist group could mount anytime in the foreseeable future as well as one capable of shooting down an unauthorized or accidentally launched missile. 
The critical difference between many of the plans offered on the Hill and those proposed by the administration has to do with timing. Some Congressional proposals would require selection of a missile defense system to be made within a year, with deployment to begin within three years. The administration has argued for the need to develop a system, assess the threat in three years, and make a deployment decision accordingly. 
It is the difference between the various plans over timing on system selection and deployment that holds practical implications for existing and potential arms control agreements--START II, the ABM Treaty, START III?--as well as the potential effectiveness of the system deployed. The more immediate the commitment to deploy a national defense system, the greater the risk of a Russian rejection of the START II Treaty and of an outright American rejection of the original ABM Treaty. 
Second, differences over timing have been linked to the issue of the effectiveness of the system deployed by the United States. The administration has argued that selection of a system within the next year or so will limit the options to build a system that is better matched to the threat, and that the real choice between various Congressional plans and that of the administration is between building an advanced system to defeat an actual threat and a less capable system to defeat a hypothetical threat. 
Mr. President, is there a middle ground--one that satisfies neither the administration nor various Congressional proponents fully but that does move us in the direction of providing the American people with a limited national defense system against the most urgent ballistic missile threats? I believe there is, and this legislation is an attempt to chart it. 
Mr. President, I sense a greater willingness in both branches to try to come together in the interest of providing the American people with some form of limited, national defense system against the most urgent form of ballistic missile threat --to seek to bridge gaps rather than score debating points. 
Moreover, with the passage of time, the differences over preferred dates of system selection and deployment have narrowed. 
With that in mind, and with a felt need to change the terms of reference of previous ballistic missile defense debates by focusing on areas of commonality between the administration's position and the various congressional plans, I offer this legislation as one of the starting points for a more constructive exchange on the subject of national missile defense.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a Senate Resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the income tax system be abolished and replaced with a broad-based consumption tax on goods and services. 
Despite a booming stock market and several years of economic growth, I have found that many citizens--particularly young Americans--are anxious about their future and have diminishing hope for better economic opportunities. 
Long-term economic trends justify these apprehensions. From 1950 through 1973, hourly compensation--including both wages and benefits--increased an average of 3.0 percent per year. Since 1973, the average wage increase has been less than one half of one percent. During the past two decades, economic growth has been cut in half, averaging only 2.5 percent annually. If this isn't discouraging enough, limiting growth to 2.5 percent appears to be the economic course of the Federal Reserve Board. 
Much of this economic under-achievement can be attributed to our national savings rate, which has fallen to alarmingly low levels. After averaging 13.3 percent in the 1960's, our Nation's savings rate has sunk to 5.5 percent in the 1990's. Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. As a result, productivity gains have averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994. The Concord Coalition estimates that had our productivity held its pre-1974 annual growth rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $50,000 annually, instead of the current level of $35,000. 
Although several other factors have contributed to this slowing of savings and prosperity, including continuing Federal budget deficits and the ensuing debt, our income tax system remains a significant drag on our long-term economic expansion. I propose that Congress should work toward the elimination of the income tax, the accompanying capital gains tax, and the estate and gift tax and replace them with a broad-based, single-rate national sales tax on goods and services. 
The Federal income tax system is inherently flawed. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in the country. Each year it costs Americans more than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal to the total worker output of my State of Indiana. It is unfair and riddled with loopholes. It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. And finally, it doesn't work. By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, with an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually. Anything this broken should be ended decisively. 
One can evaluate a tax system using several criteria. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive, (3) fair, (4) transparent, (5) border adjustable, and (6) friendly to savings and investment. I have studied recent tax reform proposals with these six factors in mind. Many are better than the current income tax. But if we are going to overhaul our tax system, we should choose the one that meets these criteria. I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative. 
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity. Under a national sales tax, the burden of complying with the income tax code would be lifted. There would be no records to keep or audits to fear. The money a person made would be his or her own. You may decide if you want to save it, invest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a tax. 
The national sales tax is the least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled. The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every taxpayer. Americans would not waste time and effort worrying about record keeping, deductions, or exemptions that are part of the current tax code. 
The national sales tax is the fairest. Everyone pays the tax including criminals, illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation. Wealthy Americans with lavish spending habits would pay substantial amounts of taxes under the national sales tax. Individuals who save and invest their money will pay less. Gone are the loopholes and deductions that provide advantages to those with the resources to shelter their income. 
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists and illegal aliens will pay the tax. Tax systems that rely on income reporting will never collect any of this potential revenue. 
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. Like the income tax system, a national sales tax can and should be constructed to lessen the tax burden on those individuals with the least ability to pay. One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services consumed by each American from the Federal sales tax. Another strategy is to exempt items such as housing, food or medicine. I am committed to designing a tax system that does not fall disproportionately on the less fortunate. 
The national sales tax is the most transparent. A Federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster efforts in Congress to achieve prudence in Federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or withholding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes. Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for the Federal Government to meet its obligations. If average Americans are paying that rate every day, they will make certain that Congress spends public funds wisely. 
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable. They are able to strip out their tax when exporting their goods. In comparison, the income tax is not border adjustable. American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice--once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination. In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports. It would place our exports on a level playing field with those of our trading partners. 
But the last and most imperative reason for replacing the income tax with a national sales tax is that it would energize our economy by encouraging savings. For the first time in the modern era, the next generation of Americans may be economically worse off than the previous one. Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average income of families has declined. They feel trapped in a box with diminishing hope of escaping. 
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough. Savings are vital because they are the source of all investment and productivity gains--savings supply the capital for buying a new machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker. 
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans and the Germans save five times as much as we do. Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future. Few realize that before World War II, before the income tax system developed into its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese. 
A national sales tax would reverse this trend by directly taxing consumption and leaving savings and investment untaxed. Economists agree that a broad-based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially. Economist Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year. Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University has concluded that the United States would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic growth if it had adopted a consumption tax like the national sales tax in 1986 instead of the current system. 
As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax. If we enact a tax system that encourages investment and savings, billions of dollars of investment will flow into our country. This makes sense--America has the most stable political system, the best infrastructure, a highly educated workforce and the largest consumer market in the world. Our economic growth and prosperity would be unsurpassed. I am committed to bringing this message of hope to all Americans, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on advancing this important endeavor.

Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, On April 29, 1997 the multilateral Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] that bans the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, use, and direct or indirect transfer of chemical weapons to anyone will enter into force whether or not the Senate acts and the President ratifies the Convention. 
Thus over the next three months it will be necessary for the Senate to consider the Convention and to fashion a corresponding resolution of ratification if the United States is to benefit from the provisions of the agreement and the U.S. chemical industry is not to suffer from the disadvantages imposed on chemical firms of non-Parties. 
The Senate was on the verge of taking up the CWC on the floor through consideration of a resolution of ratification that I co-authored and which was reported out of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations by a vote of 13-5 on April 30, 1996. 
Given the arrival of new members to the Senate and the need for all members to inform themselves in the near term on the benefits and costs to the United States of full participation in the Convention, I am submitting in the form of a Sense of the Senate resolution the resolution of ratification that was to have served as the vehicle for debate in the Senate during the 104th Congress. 
It is my hope that this will be helpful to all Senators and can serve as an important benchmark for a more constructive exchange during the 105th Congress on the subject of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
